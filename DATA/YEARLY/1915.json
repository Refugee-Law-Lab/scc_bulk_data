The plaintiff's lands, held under Crown grant of 1887, were bounded on the south by the middle line of Rat Creak (now in the City of Edmonton) and were traversed by one of the \"old trails\" of Rupert's Land, known as the \"Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan Trail.\" Upon instructions, under section 108 of the \"North-West Territories Act,\" as enacted by 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 19, that portion of the trail was surveyed and laid out on the ground by a Dominion land surveyor shewing its southern boundary approximately as Rat Creek and thus giving it a width upon the plaintiff's lands in excess of the sixty-six feet limited by this section. The plan of this survey was not shewn to have been approved by the Surveyor-General nor was it filed in the land titles office as required by the statutes in force at the time.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (28 West L.R. 920), that the statute gave the surveyor no power to increase the width of the highway authorized to be laid out by him; that the approval of the Surveyor-General and the filing of the plan in the land titles office were necessary conditions to the transfer of the trail as a public highway and, consequently, the land comprised in the augmentation of the highway remained vested in the plaintiff. Plaintiff sold part of his lands, described as bounded by the northerly limit of the surveyed trail, and, subsequently, the purchasers, and persons holding lands south of Rat Creek, filed plans of subdivision shewing the surveyed trail as of the full width given by the surveyor. The city also claimed to have expended moneys in improving the roadway at the locality in question.\nHeld, that the registration of the plans of subdivision, made without privity on the part of the plaintiff, was not binding upon him, and that there was not such evidence of expenditure of public moneys or of conduct by the plaintiff \u2014 by recognizing the plans as filed \u2014 as could preclude him from claiming the lands encroached upon or compensation therefor.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Harvey C. J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nIn the circumstances stated in the head-note, the plaintiff brought the action for an injunction restraining the City of Edmonton from trespassing or interfering with that portion of the lands comprised in the augmentation of the trail in question, as laid out by the surveyor, south of a line parallel to and sixty-six feet distant from the northern limit thereof, and order vesting such portion in him as the legal owner thereof, an order rectifying the plan of survey, damages and such other and further relief as the nature of the case might require. The other defendants were added for the purpose of enabling them to be heard so far as their rights might be affected.\nThe plaintiff's action was maintained by His Lordship Chief Justice Harvey, at the trial, and his decision was reversed by the judgment now appealed from. Ewart K.C. and G. B. O'Connor for the appellant\nBown K.C. and O. M. Biggar K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I can find no evidence of dedication by the plaintiff, appellant, and there certainly is no justification for reversing the trial judge on this finding of fact. As was said by Fournier J., speaking for this court, in Chamberland v. Fortier[2], at page 380:\u2014\nLes formalites prescrites par nos status pour l'ouverture des chemins et l'expropriation des particuliers pour la construction des chemins, doivent \u00eatre rigoureusement observ\u00e9es, sous peine de nullit\u00e9, comrae l'ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 nos cours.\nAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Idington, the requirements of the local statute were not complied with and the mere grant or spending of a sum of money by the Government and the municipality on the plaintiff's land to build a highway does not create a presumption juris et de jure in favour of dedication even if acquiesced in by the owner. The mere user by the public does not create a presumption of grant or dedication. In order to constitute a valid dedication to the public of a highway by the owner of the soil it is clearly settled that there must be an intention to dedicate, there must be an animus dedicandi of which the user by the public is evidence, and no more. Mann V. Brodie[3], at page 386. See also Folkestone Corporation v. Brockman[4].\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs here and in the courts below and the judgment of the trial judge restored. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant seeks to enjoin respondent from trespassing on certain lands which were granted by the Crown to him in 1887, when part of the North-West Territories, but which are now in Alberta. By virtue thereof he became registered owner on the 15th of June of said year. Over part of these lands there was a trail known as the \"Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan Trail.\" Prior to said grant there had been enacted the \"North-West Territories Act.\" It had then become chapter 50 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886. By section 108 thereof the Governor-in-Council, upon notice from the Lieutenant-Governor that it was considered desirable that any particular thoroughfare or public travelled road or trail, in the territories, which existed as such prior to any regular surveys should be continued as such, might direct such to be surveyed by a Dominion land surveyor and thereafter might transfer the control of each thoroughfare, public travelled road or trail, according to the plan and description thereof, to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council for the public uses of the territories.\nThe grant of said lands to appellant probably was subject to the exercise of said power,\nSaid section 108, however, was repealed by CO & 61 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 19, which was substituted therefor.\nThis later enactment was much longer and more specific in regard to what might be done under it, and provided a number of steps to be taken in respect to the results of such a survey before its becoming effective. Amongst other things to be done with the return of such a survey was the filing of it in the land titles office for the district. It seems clear that it was not until that and other things were done that the road or trail so surveyed could be transferred to the Lieutenant-Governor for the use of the territories, and even then it was subject to any right which might have been acquired under letters patent issued previously to such transfer.\nSub-section 2, of said, section 19, is as follows:\u2014\n2. The width of such road or trail shall be one chain or sixty-six feet; and in making the survey, the surveyor shall make such changes in the location of the road or trail as he finds necessary for improving it, without, however, altering its main direction.\nIt is exceedingly doubtful in face of the certificate of title, which in absence of the letters patent is our' only guide to contents thereof, if there ever could have been a survey made under this section interfering with the apparently absolute grant to the appellant. But it is shewn that in fact a Dominion land surveyor, in 1901, did make a survey of this trail, but how he came to do it or by what authority he presumed to do it is not explained. He was called as a witness and tells, amongst other things, that when done the plan thereof was sent to Regina.\nThe said section 19 required any such return when approved by the Surveyor-General to be filed in the Department of the Interior. Nothing of that kind seems to have been done or attempted. It never was filed in the district registry office and it seems quite clear that it was null as regards any legal effect herein or elsewhere as governing the right of any one.\nIt is simply because it seems to have been one of the many curious things put forward in answer to appellant's claim herein, as helping to establish an alleged dedication by him or something that might estop him from claiming the part of his land so granted, now in question, that I notice this proceeding alleged to have been taken under said statute. He sold ten acres of his lands to a Mrs. Sinclair, and in his deed thereof, as appears by the certificate of title to her in 1902, described same as bounded in part by the northern boundary of a surveyed road along the north side of Eat Creek. A plan of this part was drawn by same Purveyor and is said to have been annexed to the deed.\nIt appears that in the plan of survey of the said trail the said surveyor had taken it upon him to make the proposed road allowance nearly two chains wide at this part instead of only one chain as the statute required, and this illegal and improper dealing with another man's property, without calling his attention to it or asking his consent, it is claimed so appears on the plan as to constitute an act of dedication by him.\nThe deed was sent to him at Battleford, where he lived, for execution and then executed and returned. The marking of road allowance or boulevard thereon can be under such circumstances no evidence of dedication of this part of the land in question or foundation for any estoppel.\nThen in 1903 the appellant agreed to sell to McDougall & Secord the remainder of said lands at so much an acre and, in course of that transaction, came to discover, by reason of the amount of acreage, that would have to be paid for by the purchasers that he was short of the price he expected. That led to correspondence with the Department of the Interior demanding compensation, answered by referring him to provincial authorities, who failed to recognize that way of looking at matters. He was forced, by these circumstances, to conclude his bargain by deducting from the price the acreage cut off by this illegal survey. And in his deed, as I infer from the certificate of title issued to McDougall & Secord, the land sold them was described by describing his original grant of lands and excepting therefrom that ten acres sold to Mrs. Sinclair\nand also saving and excepting thereout a surveyed road crossing the said land hereby described.\nIt is again said this was a dedication, I fail to find anything therein of dedication. Some people might be tempted to call it something else if anything but blundering of some one.\nThe appellant lived at Battleford still and so executed the deed there, but never abandoned in any way his right to the property.\nNo One acting on behalf of the respondent ever had occasion to consider these deeds or registrations or is able to say he acted upon them, and thus as an estoppel enuring to respondent it is out of the question for it to claim thereby.\nThe legal presumption that every one is supposed to know the law might well, coupled with the fact of a trail having existed there, be supposed to have probably induced appellant to be reconciled to losing sixty-six feet in width for a road such as the statute above quoted seemed to make a possible provision for.\nEven if in strict law it could not have been at one time forced from him, there were other considerations such as his sale to these people, needing a road, which may well be looked at as tending to constitute a dedication or laying a foundation for inferring that much.\nBut beyond that I fail to see how it is possible to find in this appellant's conduct anything which could be fairly construed into an actual dedication by him of anything more than the common width of road allowance so generally and extensively in use in the west.\nThe defendant's streets did not then extend out there, and no inference can be drawn in law from what has transpired since in way of offer to dedicate or accept such dedication beyond the said sixty-six feet in width.\nDefendant has since, on the north' part of this land, but in no way extending further south from the said northerly limit of the surveyed land than sixty-six feet, expended some money thereon to render it a highway.\nIt has been travelled upon that much but the remainder now claimed herein is a founderous piece of land unfit for use as a road.\nThe expenditure of public money may, under the statute, constitute so much of the land as so improved thereby, a public highway, but not beyond.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the courts below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.;\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff, whose title under a Crown grant of 1887 to the land in question, lying along the north side of Eat Creek and extending to the middle of the bed of the stream, is admitted, unless that land has subsequently become part of a public highway, charges trespass by the defendants the Corporation of the City of Edmonton. The other defendants are owners of lots lying to the south of Eat Creek. The defendants all assert that the land in dispute became part of a public highway by virtue of a survey made, in 1900, by one Driscoll under section 108. of the \"North-West Territories Act,\" as enacted by 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 19; that by two conveyances made by him the plaintiff dedicated this land as a highway; that as a result of these conveyances and certain registered plans which shew the land in question as part of a highway he is precluded from asserting title thereto: and that by the expenditure of public moneys thereon by the defendant municipal corporation its character as part of a highway has been confirmed.\nIn making his survey Driscoll ignored the provision of section 108 limiting the width of the highway, thereby authorized to be laid out, to 66 feet. He laid out a road at some points three chains wide. I cannot accept the view that he had some discretion as to the width to be given to the highway. So far as I can find there is no evidence that Driscoll's plan ever received the approval of the Surveyor-General, although Mr. Justice Beck states that it was \"approved by the department at Ottawa on the 11th October, 1904.\" The learned appellate judge apparently based this statement on some initials and figures \u2014 \"P.W.C.; 11, 10, '04\" \u2014 which appear on one corner of Driscoll's plan produced from the department; at least I have found nothing else in the record to sustain it. There is no evidence to shew what these letters and figures signify \u2014 certainly nothing to warrant the conclusion that they indicate approval by the Surveyor-General. Nor was a copy of Driscoll's plan ever filed in the land titles office of the district as the statute, prescribes. It is only upon these things being done that section 108 authorizes the transfer of the road or trail so surveyed \"by the Governor in Council for the use of the Territories.\" This transfer, it is asserted, and not denied, was not made. The old \"Fort Trail\" had been transferred to the territories by order-in-council of the 16th May, 1895. But it did not include the land now in question.\nThe evidence shews that the northern boundary of the projected highway as laid out by Driscoll across the plaintiff's land followed approximately the northern boundary of the old \"Fort Trail\" and, notwithstanding the omissions above stated, the plaintiff recognizes the public right to a highway, across what was formerly his land, of the statutory width, having as its northern boundary the northern boundary of the projected highway as laid out by Driscoll. It is the land to the south of this highway 66 feet wide, and between it and Rat Creek, that he claims.\nThe judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, who tried the action, upholding the plaintiff's title to the land in question, accordingly limited his recovery, as appears in the following paragraphs:\u2014\nThis court doth order and adjudge and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to the lands described in the pleadings, that is to say: All that part of the Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan trail as shewn upon a map or plan of the said trail prepared by Alfred Driscoll, D.L.S., and of record in the Department of Public Works in the Province of Alberta, in the westerly 25 chains of section nine (9), in Township fifty-three (53), range twenty-four (24), west of the fourth meridian, in the Province of Alberta, lying to the south of an imaginary line parallel to and 66 feet south of the northern limit of the said trail.\n* * * * *\n3. And this court doth further order that the said plan of the said trail be rectified by substituting for the southern boundary of the said trail in the said section nine (9) as shewn on the said plan, a line drawn parallel to and 66 feet south of the northern boundary of the said trail as shewn on the said plan.\nIn order to deprive the plaintiff of the land lying between the highway thus defined and Eat Creek, which was admittedly included in his grant from the Crown, much clearer authority than is afforded by the statutory provision invoked would be required and a much more precise compliance with its provisions than has been shewn would have to be established.\nNone of the persons entitled under the plaintiff's grants to Sinclair and McDougall & Secord are parties to this action. Whatever right by way of estoppel or otherwise they may have (if any) cannot be asserted by the present defendants.\nThe plaintiff appears to have made some demand early in 1904 for compensation in, respect of the appropriation of three acres of his land; but his claim was rejected and there is nothing to shew that he ever intended to dedicate the strip now in question gratis to the public. On the contrary, on the 21st June, 1904, he wrote to the department to know if it intended to cancel the survey of the \"Fort Trail,\" and in reply he received a letter, dated 2nd July, 1904, stating that this trail had been transferred to the territories by order-in-council of the 16th May, 1895. Of course that transfer did not cover the land now in dispute.\nThe registration of plans to which he was not a party shewing lands of other persons lying to the south of Rat Creek as bounded by a highway lying to the north of the creek and extending to its centre line did not bind the plaintiff. There is nothing to shew that Driscoll's highway or esplanade extended south of the north bank of the creek. It, therefore, does not appear that any of the defendants or any other person who has bought lands upon the plans referred to has a frontage upon, or a direct right of access to, the highway in question. Nor does the evidence at all satisfactorily establish that any purchaser of such lands bought in the belief that he had a frontage on that highway.\nThe plans filed by Mrs. Sinclair and McDougall & Secord subdividing parts of the lands purchased by them from Rowland, shew the esplanade as laid out by Driscoll. But, I am, with respect, unable to accept the reasons advanced by Mr. Justice Beck as warranting the view that the plaintiff was bound by the registration of these plans in respect of land owned by him and improperly included in them, although they were not signed by him as an owner as is required by subsection 1 of section 124 of the Alberta \"Land Titles Act\" (chapter 24 of 1906). Although the certificates of title of Sinclair and McDougall & Secord, which have been produced, shew sales to have been made by them of parts of the lands purchased from Rowland, they do not establish sales or mortgages according to the registered plans of subdivision relied upon, if, indeed, that would suffice, under sub-section 2 of section 124 of the \"Land Titles Act,\" to make the plans binding on the plaintiff without his signature in respect of land belonging to him and improperly included in them. In view of the requirements of sub-section 1 of section 124, I think it Would not.\nExpenditure of public moneys on the land in question is not established. The evidence is quite too vague and indefinite (Township of St. Vincent v. Greenfield[5]), except as to a sewer; and, for aught that appears to the contrary, no part of the sewer is north of the middle line of the bed of Rat Creek. The admission relied upon by the defendants rather indi- cates that it lies wholly under the south half of the bed of the creek and land adjoining to the south.\nFor these reasons and those assigned by Mr. Justice Stuart in his dissenting opinion I think the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge was right and that his judgment should be restored. The plaintiff should have his costs in this court and in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014A land surveyor, who was supposed to be acting under the provisions of the law, surveyed a trail and, at the place in question, the roadway so surveyed exceeded the 66 feet provided by the law. The owner of the property subsequently sold his property to different persons and never claimed then any right in the part of the roadway which exceeded the 66 feet.\nThis roadway is now one of the streets of the City of Edmonton and has necessarily acquired a great value. The plaintiff, appellant, claims the ownership of the piece of land which is left, those 66 feet being deducted.\nThe evidence is not very satisfactory as to whether this piece of land had been dedicated for the roadway or not. It is true that the land surveyor had mentioned it on his plan and that in selling his property the appellant had referred to that plan. But it cannot be said and maintained that this man formally dedicated this piece of property and nobody can be deprived of his rights without his consent, or without the provisions of the law.\nThere is no consent proved and the law cannot be construed as depriving him of his right in connection therewith.\nFor these reasons, I would allow this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 28 West L.R. 920.\n[2] 23 Can.

Idington and Anglin JJ. contra.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J., that \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d as to which the provinces are given exclusive jurisdiction (\u201cB.N.A. Act,\u201d 1867, sec. 92, sub-sec. 11), authorizes the incorporation of companies whose operations are confined, territorially, to the limits of the incorporating province.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014Such company has capacity to avail itself of the sanction of any competent authority outside Ontario to operate within its jurisdiction.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The term \u201cprovincial objects\u201d in said sub-section means provincial with respect to the incorporating province, and the business of mining in the Yukon its not an object \u201cprovincial\u201d with respect to Ontario. The question whether capacity to enter into a given transaction is compatible with the limitation that the objects shall be \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is one to be determined on the particular facts.\nAlso, per Duff J.\u2014On the true construction of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d the appellant company only acquired capacity to carry on its business as an Ontario business; and there was no legislation by the Dominion or the Yukon professing to enlarge that capacity.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. (Duff and Anglin JJ. contra), that to enable a joint stock company to obtain a free miner\u2019s certificate under the regulations in force in the Yukon Territory it must be authorized by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, and at present only a British or foreign company could be so authorized (61 Vict. ch. 49, sec. 1 (D.)).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada dismissing the appellants\u2019 petition of right.\nThe suppliant is a joint stock company, incorporated by the Province of Ontario, under the provincial \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d Its charter professes to authorize it to carry on the business of mining.\nBeing so incorporated, it purported to obtain tranfers of two certain hydraulic mining locations in the Yukon Territory, theretofore issued by the Dominion Government to certain individuals, and to enter into certain agreements in respect thereof with the Dominion Government which are set out in the case, and to obtain certain certificates which are referred to in and form part of the evidence taken in the case.\nDisputes having arisen between the suppliant and the government regarding the alleged rights of the suppliant in respect of the hydraulic leases above referred to and under the agreements also referred to, the suppliant filed its petition of right in January, 1908, claiming damages against the Crown.\nIn January, 1909, His Majesty filed an answer to the said petition, raising two grounds of defence:\u2014\n(a) Want of corporate capacity on the part of the suppliant company to carry; on its business in the Yukon Territory, or to enter into agreements with the government in respect thereof, or to acquire or maintain any rights thereunder, or to receive any certificates or licenses purporting to entitle the suppliant to carry on its business of mining in the Yukon Territory, or to acquire any rights under such certificates or licenses;\n(b) Want of authority on the part of either the Yukon or the Dominion executive to issue any such certificates or licenses to the petitioner, or to confer any such rights upon the petitioner, as the petition of right claims.\nThese particular grounds of defence were, in due course, directed to be determined in advance, of any general trial of the petition, and without prejudice to the other matters which the record presented.\nMr. Justice Cassels, who tried these preliminary questions of law upon such evidence as the parties saw fit to present upon the particular points raised by the preliminary questions, determined them adversely to the suppliant, who appealed from this determination of the preliminary questions.\nHellmuth K.C. and Moss K.C. for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. and Newcombe K.C. (Mason with them) for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court on a petition of right launched to recover damages in respect of breaches of agreements and leases alleged to have been vested in the appellant by assignments in the circumstances set forth in great detail in the petition.\nThe claim was disposed of in the court below on the short ground that the appellant was without capacity to accept the assignments of the leases and collateral agreements or to carry on mining operations in the Yukon Territory or to recover damages for the breach of the said agreements. The appellant is a joint stock company incorporated by the Province of Ontario under the provincial \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d The charter professes to authorize it to carry on the business of mining.\nBeing so incorporated it purported to obtain transfers of two certain hydraulic locations in the Yukon Territory, theretofore issued by the Dominion Government to one Doyle and one Matson, and to enter into certain agreements in respect thereof with the Dominion Government, and to obtain certain certificates which are referred to in the documents introduced and the admissions made with a view to the final determination of the questions which arise upon the two grounds of defence hereinafter referred to.\nThe petition of right was granted to settle certain disputes which arose between the appellant and the Government in respect of these leases and agreements. In answer to the petition two grounds of defence were raised which I think are fairly set out in the respondent\u2019s factum as follows:\u2014\n(a) Want of corporate capacity on the part of the suppliant company to carry on its business in the Yukon Territory, and, in consequence thereof, incapacity to acquire the hydraulic leases already referred to, or any rights thereunder, or to enter into the agreements with the Government in respect thereof also already referred to, or to acquire or maintain any rights thereunder, or to receive any certificates or licenses purporting to entitle the suppliant to carry on its business of mining in the Yukon Territory, or to acquire any rights under such certificates or licenses;\n(b) Want of authority on the part of either the Yukon or the Dominion executive to issue any such certificates or licenses to the petitioner, or to confer any such rights upon the petitioner, as the petition of right claims.\nThis defence raises squarely in the first paragraph the important question, so frequently considered here and, in my opinion, now finally disposed of by the Judicial Committee, of the power or capacity of a company incorporated by a local legislature to carry on its operations in a territorial area over which the incorporating legislature has no jurisdiction. I adhere to what was said by me on this point in The Companies Reference[1]:\u2014\nThe Parliament of Canada can alone constitute a corporation with capacity to carry on its business in more than one province. Companies incorporated by local legislatures are limited in their operations to the territorial area over which the incorporating legislature has jurisdiction. Comity cannot enlarge the capacity of a company where that capacity is deficient by reason of the limitations of its charter or of the constituting power. Comity, whatever may be the legal meaning of the word in international relations, cannot operate between the provinces so as to affect the distribution of legislative power between the Dominion and the provinces under the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nThis does not imply that a provincial company may not, in the transaction of its business, contract with parties or corporations residing outside of the province in matters which are ancillary to the exercise of its substantive powers. I use the terms \u201csubstantive\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d as descriptive of the two classes of powers inherent in the company, as these are used in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2].\nIt is not, of course, suggested that a provincial legislature may not incorporate a company for one of the objects enumerated in section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which upon its incorporation enters into existence as an entity clothed with corporate powers; but the question raised and which must be decided in this appeal is: Can such a company exercise its functions or pursue the activities of its particular organization beyond the jurisdictional limits of the constituting power? In other words, can a properly constituted provincial company exercise its powers (purposes or objects) locally outside of the province of incorporation. It may be that a provincial company can with the consent of another province exercise its civil capacities within the area of that province, but I am still of opinion that a provincial company cannot either with or without that consent fulfil the purpose for which it was organized, that is, discharge what may be described as its functional capacities, in this case mine for gold, outside the limits of the constituting province. To admit juristic persons to the enjoyment of civil rights is not the same thing as to admit them to exercise their functions or to pursue the activities of their particular organization or in other words to transplant their institution to a foreign jurisdiction (Lain\u00e9, des Personnes Morales en Droit International Priv\u00e9, 282).\nThe Ontario \u201cJoint Stock Companies Act\u201d under which the petitioner obtained its charter, enables a provincial charter to be granted\nfor any of the purposes or objects to, which the legislative authority of the Legislature of Ontario extends.\nThe legislative authority of Ontario has never been deemed to extend to mining upon lands geographically or jurisdictionally situated beyond the province, and a provincial charter, issued to a company for the purpose of mining, must find \u201cthe object or purpose\u201d for which it was created within and only within the field to which the legislature itself has deemed its authority to extend. There is not, it is quite true, a geographical limitation in the appellant\u2019s charter as to the territory in which it may carry on its operations, hut the limitations of the constituting power must be read into the charter which must be construed as if it read: \u201cthe subscribers to the memorandum of agreement are created a corporation for the purposes and objects described in the letters patent in so far as these purposes and objects are geographically and jurisdictionally situate within the province.\u201d\nAs the Lord Chancellor said in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[3], at page 339,\nthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects cannot extend to a company the objects of which are not provincial.\nThe business of mining in the Yukon Territory is not a provincial object with respect to Ontario. The Yukon Territory is not a province and is exclusively with respect to its public lands under legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion.\nIf this limitation is inherent in its constitution how could the appellant company acquire by transfer or otherwise hydraulic mining locations in the Yukon Territory or enter into agreements for the purpose of operating those mines\u2019 with the Dominion Government.\nI agree with counsel for the Crown on the second branch of his defence for the reasons given in his factum.\nAssuming that the company had the power to engage in mining operations in the Yukon Territory it did not comply with the statutory conditions subject to which it was entitled to carry on its operations. No joint stock company is recognized under the statute and the regulations as having any right or interest in any placer claim, mining lease or minerals in any ground comprised therein unless it has a free miner\u2019s certificate unexpired. No joint stock company can obtain a free miner\u2019s certificate unless it is incorporated for mining purposes under a Canadian charter or licensed by the Government of Canada, and I interpret the statute 61 Vict. ch. 49, sec. 1, to mean that a British company and a foreign company are the only sort of joint stock companies that could be licensed there.\nThe same argument applies to the license given by the Deputy Minister of the Interior. He was without authority to grant any such license. To be effective such a license could only be issued by the Government through the Secretary of State and it is admitted that no such license was ever taken.\nIn effect I hold that the company was not competent to take the assignment from Matson and Doyle upon which it bases its claim, or enter into the alleged agreement with the Dominion Government with respect thereto, and also that the company could acquire no right or interest in or to a mining claim in the Yukon because it was excluded by the statute from obtaining a free miner\u2019s certificate.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This action raises in a concrete form one of the questions referred to this court by His Royal Highness the Governor General in Council as to the limitations, if any, which the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d imposes upon the legislatures of the provinces in giving them exclusive power to legislate in section 92, sub-section 11, respecting\nthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects. In answering the questions submitted to us on that reference I gave at length my reasons for holding that the power conferred was a limited one and that its limitation was territorial.\nI have seen no reason to change the opinions I there expressed. The company appellant in this case was incorporated in the Province of Ontario as a mining company. In my opinion it has neither the power nor the capacity to carry on mining operations in the Yukon Territory or district, that being a part of Canada thousands of miles distant from Ontario. It would seem quite unnecessary for me to repeat the reasons given by me in the reference above referred to.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The questions raised herein relate to the limits of the capacity of a company incorporated by provincial authority acting within the powers conferred in section 92, sub-section 11, of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d to acquire property outside the province, or to contract for anything to be done for its benefit or omitted by it or any one else to be done for its use or benefit outside the province.\nIt has been heretofore usually assumed that men incorporated for any object might in their corporate capacity, acting within the scope of such object, do anything relative thereto for the purpose of serving such object, wherever the law of the country where done did not prohibit the doing thereof. This has been recently denied so far as provincial corporate creations are concerned. That denial is founded upon the discovery (long hidden from the ken of man) of manifold possible limitations inherent in said sub-section. It has assumed many shapes. That involved in the absolute denial of capacity for either contracting beyond, or contracting for anything to be done or to be got beyond the territorial limits, is easily understood whatever may be thought of its legal validity.\nBut this denial of ordinary capacity which has assumed such various and varying shades of meaning that it is impossible to accurately define any line by which to bound the permitted operations of a limited sort beyond the territorial limits, is not quite so comprehensible.\nThe facts involved herein are so complicated that they may give rise to the application of any one of these propositions comprehended in such denial of capacity, or specific shade thereof, that I think better they should be set out with some detail.\nThe appellant was incorporated in 1904 by letters patent issued under and by virtue of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d (a) to carry on as principal, agent, contractor, trustee, etc., etc., the business of mining and exploration in all their branches, and (b) to apply for, purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire, patents, patent rights, trade marks, improvements, inventions and processes, etc.; and apparently incidental to these main purposes, by the means specified in ten succeeding clauses to do a great many things needless to state in detail here.\nAll we are concerned with is that what was specified either in said clauses (a) and (b) or in the other subsidiary clauses, or both combined, contemplated the exercise, without saying where, of contracting powers and the acquisition of such kind of rights and properties as involved in the issues raised herein. The place where operations of any kind were to be carried on is not stated further than that the head office of the company is to be at the City of Toronto. That must, therefore, be taken as the home wherein it carried on its business.\nFrom the pleadings and the contracts, licenses, and correspondence, made part of the case, we find the following facts or what have to be assumed such as to be dealt with herein.\nThe suppliant, now appellant, sets forth in its petition that one Doyle and his associates, and one Matson and his associates, each set respectively had, in 1899 and 1900, applied to the Department of the Interior for Canada, each for a separate hydraulic mining location, and each became entitled thereto, and got leases from Her late Majesty therefor; and thereupon looking to the further and better development of these properties, collateral agreements were entered into between Her late Majesty, represented by the Minister of the Interior for Canada, and each of said set of parties respectively, in January, 1900, whereby the Minister was to observe that certain other properties should, in certain contingencies which took place, be granted by way of lease to these parties respectively. These leases and agreements entitled each of said set of parties with whom they were made to valuable privileges. It is to be assumed for the present that they were valid and that there were moneys paid to the Crown thereunder and that, for or by reason of any breach of the obligations incurred on the part of the Crown, said parties or their assignee would thereby be entitled to claim heavy damages for losses so caused.\nThe appellant acquired these leases and agreements by assignment thereof, presumably in Ontario. I presume it thereby became entitled to such indemnification as the original holders respectively might have had at the time against the Crown, besides acquiring the right thereafter to realize the hopes and expectations of said parties and of the appellant thereunder. The appellant on the 24th December, 1904, the day after its incorporation, got a free miner\u2019s certificate, under the regulations then in force, for which it paid the respondent a fee of $100 and kept it renewed, paying for such renewals, it is alleged, so long as the regulations governing mining in the Yukon required the owners of a hydraulic concession to hold a free miner\u2019s certificate. It is by no means clear that the possession of such a certificate was necessary to enable it or any one else to make such acquisitions, though probably needed before actively engaging in operating a mine.\nThe appellant upon acquiring said leases and agreements found the obligations of the Crown thereunder had not been lived up to and that land which fell within the scope and under the operation thereof, instead of being leased to appellant or its predecessor, had been relocated or let to other parties to the detriment of appellant either through its said predecessor in title or directly. Against such omissions, for a time, the appellant made fruitless protests.\nOn the 16th March, 1907, however, the Crown; represented by the Minister of the Interior, entered into an agreement with appellant\u2014after reciting said leases, and that they had, and all the interests therein and thereunder of said lessee Doyle and others, and Matson and others, had become vested in the appellant and otherwise as appears therein \u2014 whereby the respondent leased to said appellant the lands in said mining claims enumerated in the schedule thereto, together with the exclusive right and privilege of extracting and taking therefrom, by hydraulic or other process, of royal or precious metals, etc., for the remainder of said terms of years, respectively, for which the said leases ran for the hydraulic mining locations within which the said claims were situate.\nAnd there are assurances given therein that the Crown will in certain contingencies grant appellant a lease of other locations as and when reverting to the Crown. This agreement and lease from respondent was executed at Ottawa.\nFounded upon those things of which the foregoing is a brief outline, the appellant alleges it became and was entitled to certain services of water and water-rights and other privileges, all of which are to be presumed to be admitted; and the loss of large sums of money expended by relying upon each and all of said agreements being observed and of profits which might have been got, I assume is also admitted for the present.\nOn the 7th of September, 1905, the appellant got a license in pursuance of chapter 59 of the Consolidated Ordinance of the Yukon Territory, authorizing it to use, exercise and enjoy within the Yukon Territory, the powers and privileges and rights set out in the appellant\u2019s memorandum of association; for which it paid a fee of $500.\nThe authority of this is section 2 of said ordinance and is thus expressed:\u2014\nAny company, institution or corporation incorporated otherwise than by or under the authority of an Ordinance of the Territory or an Act of the Parliament of Canada desiring to carry on any of its business within the territory may petition therefor, etc., and the Commissioner may thereupon authorize such company, etc., etc. Again by the issue of the free miner\u2019s certificate, already referred to, appellant seems to have been recognized pursuant to an Order-in-Council bound up with a Dominion statute for 1898, on page 39 of which the interpretation clause gives the following:\u2014\n\u201cFree miner\u201d shall mean a male or female over the age of eighteen but not under that age, or joint stock company, named in, and lawfully possessed of, a valid existing free miner\u2019s certificate, and no other.\n* * * * *\n\u201cJoint stock company\u201d shall mean any company incorporated for mining purposes under a Canadian charter or licensed by the Government of Canada.\nThe law of England relating to civil and criminal matters as it existed on the 15th July, 1870, was brought into force in the North West Territories subject to certain exceptions, and the law in said territories continued in the Yukon by the statute 61 Vict. ch. 6, setting it apart saving also some exceptions.\nHence the English rule of law by which foreign corporations are by the comity of nations recognized, I presume must prevail, until the contrary is shewn.\nNo Dominion Act is shewn prohibitive of any provincial incorporation doing business in the Yukon. If such a purpose ever existed it was quite competent for the Dominion to have so enacted inasmuch as the Yukon is within its legislative jurisdiction. As there are many mining companies operating elsewhere than in the Yukon and by virtue of provincial legislation, I imagine the possibility of such being tempted to help develop the Yukon would forbid such an imprudent policy as forbidding them. Yet we are asked to imply such from the omission in the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act\u201d to provide specifically for their being licensed by the Dominion. The fact that the Yukon Ordinance as already pointed out did provide for such licenses and no objection made thereto, indicates the policy of Parliament as to the Yukon as does also the above order-in-council.\nAll the foregoing claims, and possibilities thereof, are held by the Exchequer Court to have been answered by the legal effect of the following two paragraphs of the defence:\u2014\n1. The respondent denies that the suppliant has now or ever has had the power either under letters patent, license, free miner\u2019s certificate, or otherwise, to., carry on the business of mining in the District of the Yukon, or to acquire any mines, mining claims or mining locations therein, or any estate or interest by way of lease or otherwise in any such mines, mining claims or locations.\n2. Should a free miner\u2019s certificate have been issued to the suppliant the respondent claims that the same is and always has been invalid and of no force or effect \u2014 that there was, no power to issue a free miner\u2019s certificate to the suppliant, a company incorporated under provincial letters patent, and that there was no power vested in the suppliant to accept such a certificate.\nAnd the said petition has been dismissed.\nThe learned trial Judge assigns as reason for said dismissal, the answers given by the majority of this court in the Companies Case[4].\nWith great respect I do not think that position is tenable unless by first forming an opinion which the learned trial judge disclaims. If a person approaches the problem of ascertaining what the said judges meant with the preconceived opinion that a limitation is necessarily implied in appellant\u2019s charter, or in any other provincial charter, then his conception of what the majority had agreed in is possibly warranted, but not otherwise. However, as expressed by the court above, these opinions bind no one. And unless approached in the way I suggest there is not a majority maintaining the view the learned judge acts upon.\nOn the other hand this court had decided in the concrete case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[5], against the view which the learned trial judge adopts as that of this court. True in that case, if the refusal of the late Mr. Justice Girouard to express an opinion is counted as against what seems to have been the opinion of three members of the court, it would then be an equally divided court and the appeal resting upon the like contention set up herein failed. In such a case in appeal the negative thereby established the rule of law binding it for the future, for whatever it may be worth.\nIt is not for the mere triviality of the marshalling, so to speak, of judicial opinion in this court with which I am concerned. It is the fact that the seat of the Dominion Government is in Ontario, the home of appellant and that the transactions in question herein took place with that government there and by virtue thereof, and that the appellant paid moneys to respondent which at all events it is entitled to recover back on the principle this court almost unanimously followed in the said case. More than that, the same principles as supported by a majority of this court in that case would, I submit, entitle appellant to take an assignment of a lease and of a claim such as those parties had under whom appellant claims. How far the facts would have carried the matter and entitled the appellant to relief I cannot say.\nIt is to be observed further that the matter of a contract being ultra vires and hence unenforcible is not the same as one to be held void by reason of what may more accurately be described as illegal. From the latter nothing can spring entitling a plaintiff to recovery. There may arise herein such rights as to be cognizable by the court in order that justice may be done. Indeed, in the said case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[6] the right was asserted alternatively by the plaintiff to a recovery of the premiums paid, and that right was maintained by the opinion of the judgments of the Chief Justice of this Court and Mr. Justice Davies, though holding the contract in question ultra vires of the defendant company.\nIn this case the recovery sought was not limited thereto, but I apprehend the greater might well have been held to include the less if that was all the suppliant had been found entitled to.\nIt hardly seems right (or indeed consistent with what one should expect to find following that decision) that the Crown having recognized the standing of the appellant and taken its money when denying appellant\u2019s capacity to pay, should yet refrain from at least tendering so much amends.\nMoreover, the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies, concurred in by the Chief Justice, recognized the possibility of a provincial incorporation being entitled, in the way of that which might be found ancillary to its business, of going beyond the boundaries of the incorporating province and thereby acquiring rights of property and rights of action arising out of such contracts as it may thus have engaged in. (See page 431 of the report of that case.) What the range of possibilities may be of putting into operation such a view, I do not intend to attempt to define. Certainly the acquisition by assignment of the leases and agreements to the company do not seem necessarily excluded therefrom.\nExploration was one of the objects written in this charter and as incidental thereto there are specified many things it is permitted to do in the way of acquisition. The ultimate aim of such exploration and that incidental thereto doubtless was gain.\nProceeding upon any and all of the foregoing grounds and having regard to these results of a concrete case in this court, I most respectfully submit that the petition should not have been dismissed.\nPassing these considerations let us come to the broader issue presented by the denial of the inherent capacity of any provincial corporate company going beyond the territorial limits of its parent province, either to contract there, or acquire there, property or rights of any kind, serving its uses in pursuit of its objects. Such companies are incorporated by virtue of the power in sub-section 11 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d expressed as follows:\u2014\nThe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\nSuch a view as involved in that denial I rather think was never presented in any court in Canada till the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[7] case, already referred to. Assuredly the contrary view was acted upon for forty years, to such an extent as to involve in the aggregate enormous sums of money in the way of contracts, by and with companies, which must be held ultra vires and void, if the contention set up should prevail.\nA microscopical examination of the phrase \u201cprovincial objects\u201d cannot help much.\nIt is to be observed, however, that the word \u201cobjects\u201d had been used prior to said Act, both in the English \u201cJoint Stock Companies Act of 1862\u201d and the Canadian Act, in chapter 65, section 1, of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, as an apt description of what by the articles of association must form the basis of incorporation in either case respectively falling thereunder. And the word \u201cprovincial\u201d can be given full force and effect, in the way I am about to submit, without further qualifying or restricting the well known use of the word \u201cobjects\u201d in relation to companies so as to produce something as curious as contended for.\nNo one pretends the whole item No. 11 can apply to anything relative to the purposes, aims or affairs of the Government or its direction of the public institutions of the province, which are prim\u00e2 facie the only \u201cprovincial objects\u201d as such. Counsel for the Dominion in the Companies Case[8], by introducing history, let us see how the unhappy phrase was begotten. If permissible to refer thereto, I have recorded it in pages 362 and 363 of 48 Can. S.C.R., containing the report of that case.\nIs there another possible meaning of the phrase \u201cprovincial objects\u201d? Seeing it is an incorporation of companies that is designated it can surely mean nothing else than a provision for the incorporation of persons likely to develop the business activities of any kind seeking such development in any province. Does that necessarily imply that the business in any such case seeking development is to be confined in all or any of its operations within the territorial limits of the incorporating province? Surely such a limitation is and always has been since before the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d something quite inconsistent with the requirements and expectations of business men looking to commercial success.\nBut why should we suppose it was by the word \u201cprovincial\u201d intended to engraft upon each provincial incorporation of a company the limitation that it could not transact any business beyond the limits of the incorporating province? Those provinces which negotiated and arranged for this creation of a federal system and thereby determined what as result thereof should appear in the Act, had each up to its enactment coming into force, absolute power over the subject of the creation of incorporate companies. It is somewhat difficult to understand why they should be supposed to have intended to surrender that power essential to their local prosperity save in so far as necessary to facilitate the furtherance of the purpose had in view.\nCan it fairly be said that such extreme limitations and restrictions as argued for herein were so necessary? Was there not something else to be guarded against?\nIn assigning the control of property and civil rights in the provinces to the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial legislatures which would impliedly carry with it the right of incorporation, it may have been thought that the power of incorporation relative to the subject matters assigned to the Dominion might be impaired, or indeed render it necessary for its Parliament to look to the province possessed of such far-reaching powers, relative to property and civil rights, to aid it in that regard. To have thus by any possibility impliedly rendered Parliament subservient to the will of any legislature, would have been embarrassing.\nAgain, it may have been conceived undesirable that there should be the possibility of any conflict between the provinces by reason of one asserting as of right the power over or against another to invade its territory against its will, by any such legislation relative to companies. That view was upheld later by Ministers of Justice for the Dominion, as will presently appear.\nBy framing the enactment as it is, these, and possibly other contingencies, were averted and the general rule of private international law (which I submit was well known) relative to the recognition of corporations abroad by virtue of what has been called the comity of nations, was left to work out the solution of the question; as it has been in each individual case for nearly half a century with great benefit to all and detriment to none.\nSome such reasons, as well as the desirability of marking the contradistinction between the provincial corporations, which ought not to have for their objects any of the subject matters assigned to the Dominion, and Dominion corporations, or such of them as relate to any of the subject matters assigned to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion, one can understand as having been deemed, if not necessary yet desirable, to facilitate the working out smoothly of the scheme as a whole. But why should that necessity have reached to the wholly unnecessary exclusion of trading either with the mother country or its other colonies or the United States or any other foreign country, as had been done for many years by provincial companies?\nIn short, why should it be supposed to have been intended to render trading by provincial companies impossible?\nThe scheme of the Act was primarily to arrange for the federal union of four or five provinces until then having very large powers of self-government. The trainers thereof followed the example of the United States constitution and its method of assigning very large powers of legislative or administrative control to the Governments to be created, by merely specifying the subject matter over which such powers were to be exercised, without elaboration of how; and in like manner prohibiting in terse terms the exercise of power over other subject matters.\nThey departed, as experience had then dictated in a marked degree, from the substance of the model. All I here desire to press is for a realization of the fact that they made the best use they could, under the circumstances, of such a model, endeavouring to avoid rocks ahead, while trying to cure the ills the provinces laboured under.\nIncidentally thereto it is not conceivable that they shut their eyes either to the commercial necessities, to which I have already adverted, or to the history of the development of the recognition of corporate capacity both an the United States and elsewhere, when transacting business beyond the limits of the corporate-creating state. That question had theretofore, both in England and Canada, as well as in the United States, received much consideration. In the United States the question had also been considered with relation to the constitutional limitations of the incorporating state as it is now presented relative to the powers of the provinces.\nThe discussion it gave rise to in the United States was long and keen. It culminated there in the decision of the case of Bank of Augusta v. Earle[9], decided in the United States Supreme Court in 1839, which stands good law to-day.\nThe argument there as here was that the company should not go beyond its home state to do business, and the limitations of state powers were also relied upon. That eminent and able court held it could go wherever the comity of state or nations might permit.\nThe very different question, of a foreign company, by its constitution inherently incapable of going abroad, had been presented to our old Upper Canadian Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in the case of the Genesee Mutual Insurance Company v. Westman[10]. Indeed, some obiter dicta therein would go further, but the day was young then. Shortly after Confederation there arose in same court, the case of Howe Machine Co. v. Walker[11], where the issue of the right of a foreign corporate company to do business in Canada was likewise presented and the right maintained with the proper distinction made between that and the Genesee Case10. This was in 1873.\nThe decision is only of significance here as indicative of the view then taken and thus likely to have been held six years earlier by those framing the clause now in question. The English view is presented by the authorities collected in Westlake, at section 305 of his work on Private International Law.\nIs it conceivable that men, presumably holding the views of English law as thus expressed by either Canadian or English authorities, and knowing how that had been applied and worked out at that time under a federal system, deliberately designed the creation of something new and wonderful to be operated with under the Canadian federal system? I cannot assent to such a proposition. Those men had sense, and some of them, wide experience and great grasp of public affairs. To say that they had not in view the daily experience of Canadian trade and industries before their eyes and the futility of providing therefor by a new kind of corporate creature which it would take forty years to discover, is paying them a compliment which, I submit, is undeserved.\nThe relevancy of all this is that the instrument ander consideration is not an ordinary contract or Act of Parliament, but one which if we would rightly understand it must be read with the eye of the statesman measuring the future range of its effective yet harmonious operation in all its parts so as to make each and all productive of the best results when put in actual practice.\nThen there is another practical aspect to be considered along with and consistent with that general survey of the question from a legal or constitutional point of view. It is this: In each of the provinces there are industries peculiar to its people. The adaptation of legislative contrivances needed to aid such people in promoting the development of its resources, whether of an agricultural, mining, fishing, lumbering, mercantile or mere financial (not banking) character, may have to be suited thereto and to the peculiar character or habits of life, of the people of the province. That which would meet the wants of Nova Scotia might be quite unsuited to the requirements of Ontario or that suited to either fall short of promoting the welfare of the farmer on the western plains.\nThe promotion of any scheme needing legislation for its assistance, is most likely to bear speedy results when an appeal is made to those most directly interested. The vast extent of Canada and diversity of its natural resources, render in many cases the promotion at Ottawa of legislation only subservient to local needs, almost an impossibility, and even where not impossible, very likely to lead to something less efficacious than what might be obtainable if a local legislature were appealed to.\nSuch considerations or something like thereunto, no doubt were present to the minds of the framers of the Act and of this provision. And it was to give ample scope to the legislative activities of each province in relation to these provincial objects that it was designed.\nHaving regard to the situation of the then Canadian provinces, and what was then present to the minds of those acting, can anything more absurd be conceived, than to suppose that those men realizing such a situation and looking to the future, deliberately planned that the incorporating power to be given the legislatures of the provinces for such objects as I have outlined, should be hampered by such limitations as are contended for herein, and never had existed elsewhere in the constitution of any legislature to which the like subject matters had been intrusted? A company incorporated with the objects of exploring as indicated in appellant\u2019s charter might seek something in the United States or Mexico, for example. That is conceivable as a business enterprise. Why should its promoters in Halifax, Toronto or Victoria have to go to Ottawa at a loss of time and money for such authorization as needed to obtain that common every-day business convenience and contrivance used by business men?\nWhat difference can it make whether incorporated at Toronto with a home there or at Ottawa with a home there? Neither province nor Dominion can give it any right or power to go into those countries. All either can do is to give it a form or fashion by creating the legal entity by means of which men may co-operate for that object had in view. Beyond that in a foreign state it must depend entirely upon the comity of the nation concerned whether or not it can do anything.\nThe Ontario Legislature has always, I think, abstained from ostensibly proposing such ventures abroad. Its companies have been incorporated for a specific object or objects relative to some specified sort or kind of business and within that object in going abroad they have depended for effective recognition entirely upon comity.\nIn this case the appellant was recognized not only directly by the respondent by virtue of the transactions entered into between them, but also by the local executive of the Yukon.\nIt is said, however, that the word \u201cprovincial\u201d so plainly indicates that it was designed that such corporations should not carry on business beyond the province that there is an implied limitation in the capacity of each precluding it from availing itself of the advantages of recognition by virtue of the doctrine of comity. It is hard to get two to agree exactly in what that proposition does mean. If it ever had been conceived, as once suggested in argument, but which no one has been bold enough judicially to affirm, that nothing could be done or be contracted for being done outside the territorial limits of the province, the situation of each province and the commercial relations of its people with those of the other provinces and of countries beyond the Dominion, were and remain such as to forbid a moment\u2019s serious consideration for such a curious proposition. Besides, such a simple conception if ever entertained could have been concisely stated.\nI, therefore, discard once and for all this very improbable conception of territorial limitations as ever having been intended to rest in the language used.\nLet us then proceed to consider the theory of the implied limitations restricting business within lines including only that which may be ancillary to the main object and he an \u201cincidental necessity\u201d thereof as, for example, the buying abroad of raw material, etc., and possibly the marketing of a company\u2019s goods, without regarding other refinements which might be suggested, and see how it will stand the practical test.\nIf we apply our common knowledge of the actual facts in an attempt to realize what such corporate activity means, we may find how impossible it would be to make the theory a workable success.\nThe actual operations of these industrial concerns, of provincial origin, daily furnish us with illustrations. Of the vast and ever-increasing volume of business done by them with people in other provinces or abroad, more than one-half of what it represents is an actual carrying on, by the agents of such companies, of business outside the province. The production of the article is but a part of the business operation in order to reap the gain for which the corporation was created.\nIf, as has been suggested, the company has the right, of necessity, to go abroad for supplies, then the division of the carrying on of the business, within and without the province, is such that the part done outside the province greatly preponderates over that done within.\nIn such cases the company has to acquire abroad its raw material, arrange there for its importation, and then when manufactured, has often, of the like necessity, to send it again abroad to be marketed. Where, in such case, if not as I suggest, is the major part of the business operation carried on? And where has the money been got to carry it on, and how? Has the business man as he ventures on each step of this process to stop and ask himself if he is within the incidental necessities of his corporate business? Has his foreign customer also to say \u201cstop and shew me, not how to answer the easy old formula of whether the transaction is within the scope of the objects of your company; but how to solve the queer puzzling riddle of what some lawyers in your country of curiosities may say about the actual \u2018incidental necessities\u2019\u201d of the company in relation to the proposed transaction. And he might, if a foreigner of deep thought, ask what \u201cnecessities\u201d can mean anyway. Perhaps he might wisely conclude the transaction proposed was not a necessity for him. Then the poor obfuscated, beaten Canadian travelling homewards might well ask himself why any one ever conceived he was such a fool as to try to do something that was not necessary for his business.\nAgain, the mining and lumbering industries of some provinces and the development thereof are parts of the development of the natural resources therein and of the local Crown domain. These having thus peculiarly close relations with the local governments, who better fitted than these powers to determine how the corporations engaged therein are to be created and controlled?\nWe also know from common knowledge that the miner has often to send his raw product abroad to be treated and then marketed, and in such cases bargains have necessarily to be made abroad involving a great deal more expense and variety of business transactions than the mere expense of digging it out of the earth. In the same way the incorporated lumberman may, indeed often does, find his timber in one province and his mill in another and his market in a third province, or abroad, and occasionally he has to be an importer from abroad of his raw material.\nThe courts in which a corporation has appeared as suitor or defendant always had, if its status was in question, to determine whether or not the business involved was of the kind which it was incorporated to transact. This new view of \u201cincidental necessities\u201d in substitution of primary objects as the measure of capacities, presents new puzzling possibilities hitherto unimagined.\nWhat a fine field for the ingenious mind to roam over and dream in! True, all these difficulties may be averted by practically blotting out the item No. 11 of the section in question and resorting entirely to the Dominion powers. But again, was that the meaning and purpose of the item?\nTake another mode of testing this alleged limitation. The province is given by item No. 10 the exclusive power of legislation relative to local works and undertakings except those of an interprovincial character as specified. Railways and other works have been constructed by companies which had to rest, I submit, on no other authority than this item No. 11. It is all comprehensive or nothing. It will not do to say the grant of power to incorporate might be implied in No. 10 itself, without resorting to No. 11. I admit the province as such could undertake such works.\nI am referring to the numerous cases of railroads and other works constructed by companies empowered by a legislature to do so and incorporated by it for that purpose.\nI submit such companies rest upon this very item No. 11 or nothing. For if implications relative to \u201ccompanies\u201d are to be permitted in item No. 10 then likewise does No. 13, \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d carry in such case the like implication and so would end all this contention.\nIt seems generally conceded that this specific enactment excludes such implications so far as \u201ccompanies\u201d are concerned under provincial legislation and if so I do not see how they can exist relative to No. 10 any more than independently under No. 13.\nNow these companies, beyond question, have gone abroad for almost everything, including the money got from stock-holders and bond-holders as well as rails and all else. Who ever thought they were acting ultra vires? Are their contracts void? And indeed no companies can be incorporated to execute such local works or undertakings save by local legislatures unless of the kind declared by virtue of sub-section (c) of section 10, to be for the general advantage of Canada or of two or more provinces.\nThe enactment in item No. 11, by its terms does not express any such thing as urged; then why, with such obvious consequences of so reading it as abound on every hand, adopt that instead of the way it has been read so long?\nWith the limitations sought to be implied in such charters they may mislead and must be of little use. Not only that, but they must obviously conflict with the true working out of section 121 of the Act, in its true spirit so far as the incorporated producer is concerned.\nMoreover, what must never be lost sight of, there is the fact, that the interpretation which I submit should prevail, has in actual practice been so long observed and acted upon and so much depends thereon that even if otherwise doubtful it should be upheld.\nThe products of our industrial activities of every kind have been and still are handled by provincially incorporated companies and sold abroad and commercial exchanges effected. Are these transactions all ultra vires and these companies engaged in doing so liable to be met by the foreign dealer with a plea such as respondent sets up herein? These companies have often exchanged such products abroad for other goods, or bought goods abroad with the money so got. Are they in any or all of these transactions liable to be met by such a plea?\nAnd perhaps quite as frequently they have been, by the credit thus acquired, enabled to buy goods on credit; and are they in such cases entitled to say they were not liable as they were acting ultra vires in thus abusing their credit?\nThey have borrowed money abroad by virtue of direct contracts or manifold indirect transactions entered into in London, Paris, New York or elsewhere. Are they to be permitted to answer the claims of such creditors by a plea of the kind we are asked herein to give effect to?\nAnd what of the shareholders who have put their money into such concerns as like as possible in principle to the venture herein involved?\nThen the authority of Ministers of Justice insisting upon the exercise of the veto power is relied upon. Supposing each and every one of these reports of such Ministers had stated that the Act must be so interpreted as counsel for the Crown desires, are we to abandon our functions?\nThese Ministers, however, never ventured to enforce their opinions, if to be read in the way counsel suggests they do read, else we should have had the matter tested long ago in ways open to them. But the reports do not so far as I have seen bear that construction he puts upon them. Time and again legislatures have apparently been alleged to have exceeded their authority by passing bills which expressly provided for the company thereby chartered acting abroad or in other provinces than its own. The Lieutenant-Governor in each of many such cases was told the bill would be vetoed unless withdrawn, and I presume each of these requests was duly complied with. It is not necessary here to express any opinion whether or not that cautious view was right or wrong. That attitude towards such legislation is a long way from maintaining what is contended for herein. I respectfully submit that it is only by a confusion of thought that what the Ministers in question then forbade must necessarily prohibit those incorporated companies with specified objects, suitable to the commercial needs of those in one of the provinces, from entering into contracts outside the province for the due execution of the purpose for which they were created.\nFor example, there is nothing inconsistent in the late Sir Oliver Mowat as Attorney-General or Premier of Ontario, permitting scores of Ontario companies when so created to grow and flourish by reason of their foreign connections and trade, and his insisting later as Minister of Justice at Ottawa, that if a provincial legislature should expressly enact that a company was entitled to carry on business in another country or province, it was acting improperly and possibly ultra vires.\nThis appellant is only a small concern following no doubt that practice which grew up under the eye of that able man who so long and so successfully managed provincial affairs in and for Ontario. And he is now curiously quoted in argument as if, when acting as Minister of Justice, condemning it.\nCounsel for respondent addressed to us an argument of some length based upon the recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[12] from British Columbia.\nI am unable to understand the exact relation supposed thereby to exist between that long sought for but belated recognition of the power resting in item No. 2 of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d assigning the regulation of trade and commerce to the Dominion, and the question of the quality of the capacity inherent in a provincial corporation to receive recognition outside the creating province. In an appeal to Parliament, to exercise its power over the subject so assigned to it, and to enact legislation which would curb the aspirations of the provinces and their creatures, that decision might be used to justify such legislation.\nIt strikes me the argument is submitted to the wrong court.\nMeantime until Parliament has legislated in that direction, if it ever does, we must continue to keep within our judicial functions.\nThe practically minded might say that decision renders needless any disturbance of the long recognized capacity of provincially incorporated companies either herein or otherwise.\nIndeed, counsel presented, briefly but stoutly, mining as a trade and hence within the sphere of the operative effect of that decision. I hardly think such a view is necessarily to be attributed to their Lordships whatever may grow hereafter out of the said decision in the way of centralizing our Government.\nNothing remains eternally stationary. Let us be patient and wait upon the evolutionary process which may spare us the probably painful consequences of rashly accepting counsel\u2019s theory of trade and commerce.\nI must adhere to the view I have always taken, and maintained in the cases above cited, of our constitution as set out in the Act; that its aim and that of the framers thereof was to eliminate friction as much as possible and yet give freedom a chance; and trust to the results of experience to be gotten thereby. It was a distinct recognition of how utterly astray domineering minds may be inherently prone to treat the rest of mankind as children when resorting to needlessly repressive measures. In that converse spirit of freedom every case presenting problems, arising under said Act, for judicial solution should be weighed and the Act worked out accordingly in harmony with the ideals of those who framed it.\nI do not see how the recognition of provincial company corporations as possessing the usual qualities of and capacities of other business corporations can fail to subserve what the Act so read was intended to subserve, but I do see how any of the other interpretations contended for will materially tend to defeat such aims, intentions and purposes.\nThat view which I maintain, in no way extends to an interference with the very wide field of possible corporate activity, which may fall within the range of any of the subject matters assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion, and needing the exercise of corporate power to give efficacy to the enjoyment thereof.\nIt is not germane to the issues raised herein to enter upon a discussion of the limits of the Dominion\u2019s incorporating power, further than to point out and illustrate how, relative to the said issues, there is no conflict between that and the exercise of the ordinary corporate capacity by the provincial companies.\nAnd as to the rights of other provinces, they may be quite within their rights in refusing recognition if the incorporating province attempted what it should not. Even if they should stupidly seek to curb or curtail the commercial activity and enterprise of a neighbour (unless so far as in conflict with section 121 to which I have referred) experience, and the power of public opinion thus engendered, will rectify such mistakes if any.\nWith every desire to condense, so far as consistent with perspicuity, I find this opinion already too long drawn out.\nYet the neat point involved herein is within a very narrow compass. I have attempted by manifold illustrations to exemplify how unworkable the contentions set up might, if successful, prove and how little in harmony they are with the probable conceptions of the framers of the Act.\nThe extreme importance of what may be involved in the ultimate decision and the desire to make that clear and meet the varying shades of opinions put forward, can alone justify such length.\nWhether such companies may in transactions involving the sanction of the shareholders or board of directors got beyond the confines of the province be held, as according to some American decisions in like cases, inherently incapable of dealing with such transactions outside the province is entirely another question than here involved.\nIn the alternative view as bearing upon the present case I may make an observation or two.\nThe case of Comanche County v. Lewis[13], cited to us by appellant\u2019s counsel, was decided by an eminent judge holding that the mere recognition by the legislature of an alleged corporation which might not otherwise have been held validly constituted, entitled that doubtful creation to recognition by the courts and, therefore, liable to be sued and judicially dealt with.\nThat decision typical of what in many other cases has been treated as recognition of de facto corporations, suggests a good many curious questions more or less bearing upon one aspect of what we have in hand.\nIs the power of incorporation so existent in the Crown in right of the Dominion as to enable it to incorporate without direct legislative authority relative thereto? If so what is the effect of the recognition by the Crown of the appellant in these transactions now in question?\nRe-incorporation can exist, indeed, has more than once been legislatively effected. Can that be effected by the Crown? What more is necessary therefor than recognition? I express no opinion, and, indeed, have none in relation thereto, or to the point made in the pleading of recognition and otherwise in argument, but not based on the suggestion I make. It may be that want of assent to re-incorporation is complete answer to such suggestions.\nThat branch of the case was not thoroughly argued and, therefore, I have formed no opinion upon it. The point is not to be disposed of by the common-place that the Crown is not bound by any estoppel.\nThe honour and dignity of the Crown are, I respectfully submit, deeply concerned; and the principles just now adverted to, or the range of the Exchequer Court jurisdiction which remains an unexplored field so far as argument in this case is concerned, ought to be fully considered if my view of appellant\u2019s rights are non-maintainable, in order that justice may be done.\nIn the manifold ways I have pointed out there has been that recognition of the appellant which entitles it, if possessed of the inherent capacity which I hold it has, to succeed without resorting to these considerations.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and that part of the proceedings below, involved in this disposal of the first two paragraphs of defence, and the case be remitted to the Exchequer Court for further trial and disposal of remainder of the case.\nDuff J.\u2014Two minor points were taken by Mr. Newcombe which I shall dispose of first. \u201cThe regulations touching the disposal of mining locations to be worked by hydraulic process\u201d approved 3rd December, 1898, which admittedly govern the appellants in respect of the rights in question in this action provide, by paragraph 4, that one of the conditions of the right to acquire any such location is the obtaining of a free miner\u2019s certificate under the \u201cregulations governing placer mining.\u201d Paragraph 1 of the regulations governing placer mining then in force authorizes the issue of free miner\u2019s certificates to persons over 18 years of age and to joint stock companies, and \u201cjoint stock company\u201d is defined in the interpretation clause as meaning\nany company incorporated for mining purposes under a Canadian charter or licensed by the Government of Canada.\nMr. Newcombe\u2019s contention is that \u201cCanadian\u201d here means \u201cDominion\u201d and \u201cCanadian charter\u201d means an Act of the Parliament of Canada or an instrument emanating from the Government of the Dominion or deriving its validity from a statute of the Dominion Parliament. I think this contention is not well founded. It is no doubt proper to read the adjective \u201cCanadian\u201d as describing the kind of charters intended to be included by reference to the authority from which they emanate; and \u201cCanadian\u201d in this connection may doubtless be read in two different ways. It may be treated as indicating the relation of the authority to Canada \u2014 as an entity \u2014 to the Dominion of Canada. On the other hand it is quite capable of being read as embracing every lawful authority in that behalf exercised within the territorial limits of Canada. Reading \u201cCanadian\u201d in this latter sense \u201cCanadian charter\u201d would mean a \u201ccharter\u201d emanating from any lawful authority in Canada \u2014 capacity to acquire the right to pursue the business of mining in the Yukon being, of course, assumed. I think this is the meaning that ought to be attributed to it. The proposed construction would exclude not only companies incorporated under provincial authority, but a company incorporated by Yukon authority or by the North-West Territories Council before the erection of the Yukon into a separate territory. It would likewise disqualify companies incorporated by the provinces of Canada before Confederation, by British Columbia, for example, before 1871. These consequences appear to me to afford a sufficient reason for rejecting the proposed construction,\nThe other contention is that by force of 61 Vict. ch. 49, an Act of the Parliament of Canada, the carrying on of mining operations in the Yukon by any joint stock company or corporation excepting companies or corporations owing their existence to some Act of the Parliament of Canada or licensed under the statute is prohibited. The statute is permissive only. It does not contain a single word expressing prohibition. Nor can I find a single word in it which seems to imply a prohibition such as that contended for. If, indeed, there were any implied prohibition it is difficult to understand upon what ground the implication could be limited in the way suggested. If this statute is to be read as conditionally prohibiting the carrying on of mining operations, as it most certainly does under the construction proposed, by a company incorporated by the old Province of Canada, or by the Province of British Columbia before Confederation, or by a \u201cchartered company\u201d in the strict; sense, such, for example, as the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, it is difficult to imagine what principle can justify such a construction which would not equally involve a like prohibition as against companies existing at the time the Act was passed and owing their existence to some Dominion statute. Any distinction between the two classes of cases could rest upon nothing in the statute itself, but must be founded upon mere speculation as to the policy of it.\nAs to the point of substance.\nThe specific authority conferred by section 92 (11) (the incorporation of companies with provincial objects) in relation to the subject there dealt with cannot be enlarged by reference to the more general terms of section 92, items 15 and 16,\nproperty and civil rights within the province\nand\nmatters merely local and private within the province.\n(John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[14]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[15], at pp. 461 and 462.) This appeal turns upon the answer to the question: What is the effect of the qualification \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d as regards the capacity of the appellant company to enter into the contracts which the appellant company\u2019s suit is brought to enforce and upon the validity of those contracts? The word \u201ccompany\u201d obviously does not embrace every kind of corporation. (See items 7 and 8 of section 92 and section 93.) But the appellant company is indisputably a \u201ccompany\u201d within the meaning of the clause. \u201cProvincial\u201d means, I think, provincial as to the incorporating province; and although it is perhaps conceivable that as regards companies formed for some communal or governmental purpose, the word \u201cprovincial\u201d might be read as having reference to the province as a political entity, I think that as regards companies formed for the purpose of carrying on some business for private gain it must be read as having reference to the province as a geographical area.\nIt results, I think, from a series of dicta (which, if they have not the force of decisions, are still of such weight that it is my duty to follow them) that the undertaking or business of such a company and the powers and capacities conferred upon the company must when considered as an entirety he so limited that the \u201cobjects\u201d of the company fall within the description \u201cprovincial\u201d in the sense mentioned. See Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[16]; Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[17], at pages 165 and 166; John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton [18]. I think that whether the \u201cobjects\u201d of a company under a given constitution or \u201ccharter\u201d are \u201cprovincial\u201d in this sense (or whether the possession of capacity to enter into a given transaction is compatible with the condition that the company\u2019s \u201cobjects\u201d shall be \u201cprovincial\u201d) is a question to be determined upon the circumstances of each case as it arises; and I doubt whether upon this point any more specific test than that supplied by the language of section 92(11) itself can usefully be formulated now.\nThe appellant company\u2019s title to relief rests upon the proposition that the letters patent (by which it is incorporated) granted under the authority of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d authorizing it to acquire mines and to carry on the business of mining generally without restriction as to locality do confer upon it capacity to acquire the right to carry on the business of mining in the Yukon Territory or elsewhere under the territorial law as established by competent authority or that such capacity has been derived from some other source. I think the possession of such capacity does not flow from the letters patent on the ground that the business of mining (i.e., working mines) generally without restriction as to locality is not a business that is \u201cprovincial\u201d as to the Province of Ontario, and that a company having as one of its objects the carrying on of such business would not be a company \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d within the meaning of section 92(11); and that consequently letters patent professing to create a company to carry on such business could not be validly granted under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d I do not think it follows as a consequence that the letters patent of the appellant company are void, but only that the description of the objects of the company in the letters patent should be read as subject to the restriction necessarily imported by the reason of the overriding enactment in section 92(11). It follows that the appellant company, a company incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d to carry on the business of mining, must be deemed to be a company created with the object of carrying on that business only as a \u201cprovincial\u201d (i.e., Ontario) business in the sense mentioned.\nWhat then is the effect of this restriction as regards the validity of the contractual engagements entered into between the appellant company and the Crown upon which the appellant company\u2019s suit is based? It has never been doubted in this country that the doctrine of ultra vires applies to companies incorporated under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d and that it does so apply was not disputed by the appellant\u2019s counsel and indeed it is not arguable that the reasoning of Lord Cairns in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[19], by which His Lordship reached the conclusion that the doctrine governs companies formed under the \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d 1862, does not apply to the provisions of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d It results inevitably that the company had \u00f1o capacity to enter into the contracts upon which the action is brought unless some additional capacity over and above that imparted to the company by the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d has been acquired by it from some other source. It does not appear to me to be necessary to consider for the purposes of this case whether the Yukon Council or the Dominion Parliament from which the Yukon Council derives its legislative capacity has the power constitutionally to legislate with regard to a company \u201cincorporated\u201d by a, province \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d in such a way as to change fundamentally its corporate nature and capacities. Our attention has not been called to anything in the Yukon law which properly construed can, in my opinion, be held to profess to authorize extra-territorial companies to carry on within the territory any business which such company would otherwise be disabled from carrying on by reason of restrictions upon its capacity laid down in its original constitution. The ordinance relating to the registration of extra-territorial companies cannot, I think, be held to contemplate any such enlargement of the corporate powers of companies taking advantage of its provisions.\nThis appears to be sufficient to dispose of the appeal. But an observation or two may be proper upon the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant company.\nFirst, it is argued that assuming it would be incompetent to a province exercising the powers conferred by section 92(11) to incorporate a company for objects other than \u201cprovincial objects\u201d in the sense above mentioned still that clause does not necessarily subject companies effectively incorporated for \u201cprovincial objects\u201d to the principle of ultra vires in such a way as to incapacitate such a company from entering into valid transactions having no relation to such \u201cprovincial objects.\u201d\nThe doctrine of ultra vires reposes upon statute (Lord Cairns in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[20] at p. 658; Lord Haldane in Sinclair v. Brougham[21], at pp. 414 and 417. See also an article by Sir Frederick Pollock, 27 Law Quarterly Review at p. 223); and not upon any theory as to the inherent nature of corporations. It is very doubtful if it applies to corporations created by letters patent in exercise of the prerogative (Sutton\u2019s Hospital Case[22]; British South Africa Co. v. De Beers Consolidated Mines[23]; Riche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co.[24], at p. 263; Attorney-General v. Manchester Corporation[25], at p. 651; Baroness Wenlock v. River Dee Co.[26], at p. 685; Bateman v. Borough of Ashton under Lyne[27]), and there can he no doubt that as regards companies created under section 92(11) a province can limit the operation of the doctrine provided that it does not legislate inconsistently with the limitations upon its authority imported by the terms of that clause.\nI find, however, two (to me) insuperable objections to this contention as applied to the present controversy; (a) A company having capacity to enter into valid transactions having no relation to any \u201cobject\u201d which can be described as \u201cprovincial\u201d does not appear to me on the assumption above stated to be a \u201ccompany with provincial objects\u201d within the meaning of section 92 (11), and (b) assuming a province to be competent to limit the application of the doctrine of ultra vires in the way supposed, still there remains the difficulty that if the \u201cobjects\u201d of the appellant company as stated in the letters patent are read as the carrying on of the business of mining as an Ontario business and not without restriction as to locality (as they must be read to bring the \u201cobjects\u201d under the category \u201cprovincial\u201d) then since it is not disputed that the doctrine of ultra vires applies to companies incorporated under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d (and it is self-evident as I have said that Lord Cairns\u2019 reasoning in Riche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co.[28] applies to that Act) the appellant company must be held to possess only such powers and capacities as have relation to the \u201cobjects\u201d so construed.\n2nd. It is argued that \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d does not define the class of companies in respect of which the legislative powers conferred upon the provinces by section 92(11) are exercisable. The construction put upon section 92(11) according to this contention is this: The clause is read as dealing with two subjects (a) the incorporation of companies, (b) the \u201crights\u201d as distinguished from the corporate capacities with which the incorporating province may endow the company when incorporated. Such \u201crights\u201d it is said, must fall within the designation \u201cprovincial objects,\u201d but that restriction has nothing whatever to do with corporate capacities which may include every capacity (excepting capacities that by section 91 (enumerated heads) can only be conferred by the Dominion) with which an incorporeal subject of rights and duties can be endowed. Any \u201cobject\u201d according to this interpretation is \u201cprovincial\u201d which can he carried out within the limits of the province provided at all events that it is not one committed by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to the exclusive control of the Parliament of Canada. While in this view the province cannot invest the company with the right to carry out \u201cobjects\u201d which are not \u201cprovincial\u201d it can nevertheless endow the company with capacity to acquire rights and powers having no relation to such \u201cobjects\u201d from any other competent legislative authority.\nI have already indicated certain passages in the judgments of the Privy Council which appear to me to be incompatible with this construction and to which I think effect ought to be given in this court whether they strictly possess or do not possess the authority of decisions.\nAs may have been collected from what I have written above I think that fairly read the observations referred to mean, that the limitation expressed by \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d has reference to the business or undertaking the company is capable under its constitution of carrying on, and the powers and capacities with which the company is for that purpose endowed, looked at as a whole; in other words, that by force of the phrase \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d such a company is affected by a \u201cconstitutional limitation\u201d which makes it incapable of pursuing \u201cobjects\u201d not \u201cprovincial.\u201d\nAnglin J.\u2014Two questions are presented in this case:\u2014\n(\u0430) Whether the appellant company, incorporated by the Province of Ontario to carry on mining operations without territorial limitation, has capacity to avail itself of the sanction of any competent authority outside Ontario to operate within its jurisdiction.\n(b) Whether the appellant company was duly sanctioned to acquire and operate mining properties in the Yukon Territory by authority competent to confer those rights.\nOn the first question, but for a misconception by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court of what I there stated \u2014 as inexplicable to me as it is unfortunate \u2014 I should merely refer to my views expressed in the Companies\u2019 Case[29], p. 452 et seq., as a sufficient presentation of my reasons for an affirmative answer. But, if what I said in that case is so ambiguout that it is open to the interpretation put upon it by Mr. Justice Cassels, it would seem advisable that I should endeavour to re-state my opinion in unmistakable terms. The learned judge says:\u2014\nAs I read the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin, I would infer from it that his view would also be that a company incorporated by a province for the purpose of mining would be confined in the exercise of its main functions to the province incorporating it. He does state that he finds \u201cnothing in the language of clause 11 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which compels us to hold that the ordinary mercantile, trading or manufacturing company, incorporated by a province to do business without territorial limitation is precluded from availing itself of the so-called comity of a foreign state, or of a province, which recognizes the existence of foreign corporations and permits their operations in its territory.\u201d\nFrom this it would appear that the learned judge is dealing with the case of ordinary mercantile trading and manufacturing companies. I would not infer from his reasons that his view would be that where the business of the company is that of a mining company, such a company would have the capacity to carry on its mining business, namely, that of mining in a foreign country.\n\u201cThe ordinary mercantile, trading or manufacturing company\u201d was referred to in the passage quoted from my opinion in contrast to bodies incorporated \u201cfor the establishment and maintenance of a hospital or the building of a railway,\u201d mentioned in the sentence immediately preceding as examples of corporations the nature of whose objects implies territorial limitation, and because in the second part of the question then under consideration a company incorporated \u201cfor the purpose of buying and selling or grinding grain\u201d was preferred as an example. The inference that a mining company was intended to be excluded from the class of provincial corporations entitled to avail themselves of international comity by the reference to an \u201cordinary mercantile, trading or manufacturing company\u201d and to be placed rather within the class of which the hospital corporation and the railway company were given as examples, seems to me, with respect, to be scarcely warranted. But, without discussing further the question whether a mining company falls within the category covered by the description, a \u201cmercantile, trading or manufacturing company,\u201d in order to remove any possibility of future misapprehension, I shall state explicitly that the nature of the objects of a mining company incorporated by a province does not, in my opinion, involve an implication that its operations are to be confined within the limits of the province, and that, if its letters patent, or incorporating statute impose no territorial limitation, it may avail itself of the comity of another state or province.\nMr. Justice Cassels, however, proceeds to deal further with my opinion in the Companies\u2019 Case[30]. He says:\u2014\nThe second question submitted for the opinions of the court is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cHas a company incorporated by a provincial legislature under the powers conferred in that behalf by section 92, article 11, of the \u2018British North America Act,\u2019 1867, power or capacity to do business outside of the limits of the incorporating province? If so, to what extent and for what purpose?\u201d\nThe answer of Mr. Justice Anglin is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cYes \u2014 subject to the general law of the state or province in which it seeks to operate and to the limitations imposed by its own constitution \u2014 but not by virtue of (the powers conferred by its) provincial incorporation.\u2019\u201d\nIf this answer is taken by itself, I infer from it that the learned judge was of opinion that the capacity of the corporation was limited to the province in which the business was being carried on, as he limits his answer by the words \u201cbut not by virtue of (the powers conferred by its) provincial incorporation.\u201d\nWhy the learned judge should have taken this answer by itself and without reference to the reasons on which it was based can only be surmised. In the answer \u201ctaken by itself I have sought in vain for anything which warrants reading the categorical answer, \u201cYes,\u201d as \u201cNo.\u201d The quoted words, \u201cbut not by virtue of (the powers conferred by its) provincial incorporation\u2019,\u201d were taken from the second part of the question being answered. The allusion \u2014 sufficiently obvious, I thought \u2014 was to the passages in my opinion where I had discussed this question and stated the grounds on which I based my affirmative answer. For instance:\u2014\nIf the operations or activities of any foreign corporation should depend for their validity upon the powers conferred on it by the law of the incorporating state, it would in my opinion be difficult to sustain them, inasmuch as \u201cthe law of no country can have effect as law beyond the territory of the Sovereign by whom it was imposed.\u201d But the exercise of its powers by a corporation extra-territorially depends not upon the legislative power of its country of origin, but upon the express or tacit sanction of the state or province in which such powers are exercised and the absence of any prohibition on the part of the legislature which created it against its taking advantage of international comity. All that a company incorporated without territorial restriction upon the exercise of its powers carries abroad is its entity or corporate existence in the state of its origin coupled with a quasi negative or passive capacity to accept the authorization of foreign states to enter into transactions and to exercise powers within their dominions similar to those which it is permitted to enter into and to exercise within its state of origin. Even its entity as a corporation is available to it in a foreign state only by virtue of the recognition of it by that state. It has no right whatever in a foreign state except such as that state confers.\n* * * * *\nThe provincial company is a domestic company and exercises its powers as of right only within the territory of the province which creates it. Elsewhere in Canada, as abroad, it is a foreign company and it depends for the exercise of its charter powers upon the sanction accorded by the comity of the province in which it seeks to operate, which, although perhaps not the same thing as international comity, is closely akin to it.\n* * * * *\nWhen the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was passed the doctrine of comity in regard to foreign corporations was well established as a rule of international law universally accepted. It had been long acted upon in English courts and had received Parliamentary recognition. Modern law acknowledges this capacity of every corporation, not expressly or impliedly forbidden by its state of origin to avail itself of privileges accorded by international comity, as something so inherent in the very idea of incorporation that we would not, in my opinion, be justified, merely by reason of the presence in the clause expressing the provincial power of incorporation in such uncertain words as \u201cwith provincial objects,\u201d in ascribing to the Imperial Parliament the intention in passing the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d of denying to provincial legislatures, otherwise clothed with such ample Sovereign powers, the right to endow their corporate creatures with it. Bateman v. Service[31], at page 391. The impotency which such a construction of the statute would, in many instances, entail upon provincial companies affords a strong argument against adopting it. Had Parliament intended in the case of the provincial power of in-\u2019 corporation to depart from the ordinary rule by confining the activities of every provincial corporation within the territorial limits of the province creating it, it seems to me highly improbable that the words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d would have been employed to effect that purpose. Some such words as \u201cwith power to operate only in the province\u201d would have expressed the idea much more clearly and unmistakably. Inapt to impose territorial restriction the words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d may be given an effect, which seems more likely to have been intended and which satisfies them, by excluding from the provincial power of incorporation such companies as have objects distinctly Dominion in character either because they fall under some one of the heads of legislative jurisdiction enumerated in section 91, or because, they \u201care unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance.\u201d\nHow the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, with these passages before him, reached the conclusion that the answer given by me to the second question propounded in the Companies Case[32] meant that in my opinion the capacity of a provincial corporation, without territorial limitation expressed in its charter or implied in the nature of its objects, \u201cis limited to the province in which the business was being carried on\u201d (sic), assuming that he meant \u201climited to the province which granted the incorporation,\u201d I am at a loss to understand. But to remove the possibility of further misunderstanding I shall again state explicitly that a provincial corporation, not territorially limited by its letters patent or Act of Incorporation, or by the nature of its objects, in my opinion has capacity, within the limitation of its constating instrument as to the character and extent of its undertaking, to avail itself of the comity of a foreign state or of another province.\nThe recent decision of the Judicial Committee in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[33] was pressed upon us by counsel for the respondent. After a careful study of the judgment in that case I fail to find in it anything which conflicts with the views above expressed. All that was there decided is that a\nprovince cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers. This does not mean that these powers can be exercised in contravention of the laws of the province restricting the rights of the public in the province generally. What it does mean is that the status and powers of a Dominion company as such cannot foe destroyed by provincial legislation. Certain provisions of the British Columbia \u201cCompanies Act\u201d requiring the appellant, a Dominion company,\nto be registered in the province as a condition of exercising its powers or of suing in the courts,\nwere held to be \u201cinoperative for these purposes.\u201d\nThe question, says the Lord Chancellor, is not one of enactment of laws affecting the general public in the province and relating to civil rights, or taxation, or the administration of justice. It is in reality whether the province can interfere with the status and corporate capacity of a Dominion company in so far as that status and capacity carries with it powers conferred by the Parliament of Canada to carry on business in every part of the Dominion. Their Lordships are of opinion that this question must be answered in the negative.\nI may, perhaps, be pardoned if I quote from my opinion in the Companies\u2019 Case[34] the short passage dealing with this point (pp. 455-6):\u2014\nThe Dominion company, on the other hand, is a domestic company in all parts of Canada. It exercises its\u2019 powers as of right in every province of the Dominion. While a Dominion company is, generally speaking, subject to the ordinary law of the province, such as the law of mortmain (Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[35], at p. 117)\u2014while it may be taxed by the province for purposes of provincial revenue (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[36]), while it may be required to conform to reasonable provisions in regard to registration and licensing (The Brewers\u2019 Case[37]), a provincial legislature may not exclude it, or directly or indirectly prevent it from enjoying its corporate rights and exercising its powers within the province (City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[38]; Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[39]), as (subject perhaps in the case of alien corporations to the provisions of any general Dominion legislation dealing with them under clause 25 of section 91) it may do in the case of other corporations not its own creatures.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that question (a) should be answered in the affirmative. This case affords a striking illustration of the un-desirability of having the judges of this court express opinions upon abstract questions. Although it has been authoritatively stated time and again, and most emphatically in the Companies\u2019 Case itself[40], at p. 589; In re References[41], at pp. 561, 588 and 592; (see also In re Criminal Code[42], that the opinions\u2019 expressed in answer to such questions\nare only advisory and will have no more effect than the opinions of the law officers,\nand that they\ndo not affect the rights of the parties or the provincial decisions,\nand are \u201cnot binding upon us,\u201d \u201cor upon any of the judges of the provincial courts,\u201d the learned judge of the Exchequer Court has deemed it\nthe proper course for (him) to pursue to give effect to the opinion of the learned judges in the Supreme Court. * * * I am not sure (he says) that technically I am bound by these reasons, but I have too much respect for the opinions of the Appellate Court not to follow their views no matter what my own opinion might be on the question,\nand he carefully abstains from expressing any opinion of his own, determining the case, as he apparently thought (though erroneously), in conformity with the views expressed by a majority of the judges of this court in the Companies\u2019 Case[43]. While wishing to refrain from an animadverting on the course adopted by the learned judge, I may perhaps venture the observation that if a superior court judge of his experience finds advisory opinions given by the judges of this court so embarrassing that, although \u201cnot sure that technically (he is) bound\u201d by them he deems it his duty to follow them regardless of his own views, they are likely to prove even more embarrassing and productive of trouble and uncertainty in courts of inferior jurisdiction.\nI would answer question (b) in the affirmative for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

VII. c. 42, s. 17\u2014\u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d U.S. Sash., 1909, c 101, ss. 93, 93a.\nSection 93 of the Saskatchewan \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d R.S. Sask., 1909, ch. 101, authorizes any incorporated company to give a notice requiring a portion of the school taxes payable by the company to be applied to the purposes of separate schools, and section 93a, as enacted by section 3 of chapter 36 of the Saskatchewan statues of 1912-1913, authorizes separate school boards themselves to give a notice to any company which fails to give the notice authorized by section 93 requiring that its taxes should be apportioned between the boards according to the assessments of public and separate school supporters in the district. A number of companies neglected to give the notice provided for and the separate school board gave them notices requiring a portion of their taxes to be applied for the purposes of that board. In these circumstances the public school board claimed the whole of the taxes payable by the companies in question and the separate school board claimed a portion of such taxes. On a special case, directed on the application of the municipal corporation, questions were submitted for decision as follows: (a) Had the Saskatchewan Legislature jurisdiction to enact section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act\u201d; (b) if question (a) be answered in the negative, has the defendant (the separate school board) the right it claims to a portion of the said taxes; (c) if question (a) be answered in the affirmative, has the defendant the right it claims to a portion of the said taxes,?\nPer Davies and Duff JJ.

The Chief Justice and Anglin J. contra.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The enactment of section 93a was ultra vires of the Legislature of Saskatchewan. The Chief Justice and Anglin J. contra.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014The Legislature of Saskatchewan-had jurisdiction to enact section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d and the taxes payable by the companies in question should be apportioned between the public and the separate school boards in shares corresponding with the total assessed value of assessable property assessed to persons other than incorporated companies for public school purposes and the total assessed value of property assessed to persons other than incorporated companies for separate school purposes respectively.\nJudgment appealed from (7 West. W.R. 7) reversed, the Chief Justice and Anglin J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Brown J.[2], upon the special case submitted for decision.\nIn the year 1913 the Corporation of the City of Regina, Sask., collected school taxes from a number of companies whose property was assessed within the city and which had omitted to give notices as authorized by section 93 of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d R.S. Sask., 1909, ch. 101, requiring an apportionment of the taxes payable by such\u2019 companies and a share thereof to be applied for the purposes of separate schools. The respondent gave notices to the said companies, under section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d as enacted by the Saskatchewan statutes of 1912-1913, ch.36, sec. 3, that unless and until they had given notices as provided by said section 93 the school taxes payable by them would be divided between the public school district and said separate school district \u201cin shares corresponding with the total assessed value of assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for public school purposes and the total assessed value of the assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for separate school purposes respectively.\u201d The form of the notice so given was that provided by said section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act.\u201d In these circumstances the appellant, as plaintiff, claimed the whole of the said taxes and the respondent, defendant, also claimed a portion thereof for the purposes of their respective school districts. It was contended by the appellant that section 93a prejudicially affected the rights of certain classes of persons with respect to schools within the meaning of section 17 of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act,\u201d (D.) 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 42, that it was ultra vires of the Legislature of Saskatchewan, and that, in any case, upon its true interpretation, it did not entitle the respondent to any portion of the taxes which it claimed. The respondent contended that the section was intra vires of the legislature and, in the circumstances, gave it the right to a portion of the taxes in question. Thereupon the City of Regin a sought relief, under Supreme Court Rule 566A, and obtained an order directing the issue to be tried by means of a special case submitted for decision by the court. The special case submitted was, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThis is an action commenced by way of originating summons issued by the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, and Dominion of Canada, on the 12th day of November, 1913, for the purpose of determining the respective rights of the above plaintiff and defendant to certain school taxes collected by the said City of Regina.\n\u201cOn summons, namely, the 4th day of December, 1913, the Honourable Mr. Justice Lamont ordered that the question as to the rights of the plaintiff and defendant herein to the money in question be tried by means of a special case.\n\u201cPursuant to the said order, the following case has been stated for the opinion of the court:\u2014\n\u201c1. Gratton Separate School District Number 13 of Saskatchewan is a separate school district within the City of Regina existing under the \u2018School Act,\u2019 being chapter 100 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, and amendments thereto, and is a town district within the meaning of the \u2018School Assessment Act,\u2019 being chapter 101 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, and amendments thereto.\n\u201c2. Regina Public School District Number 4 of Saskatchewan is a public school district existing under said Act and amendments thereto, and is also a town district as aforesaid.\n\u201c3. The City of Regina is a municipal corporation existing under the \u2018City Act,\u2019 being chapter 84 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, and amendments thereto.\n\u201c4. Gratton Separate School is a Roman Catholic separate school established in the Regina Public School District Number 4 of Saskatchewan. \u201c5. The companies mentioned in schedule \u2018A\u2019 attached hereto are companies, the whole of the assessable property of which lying within the limits of the plaintiff school district was entered, rated and assessed upon the assessment roll of the City of Regina, for the plaintiff school district for the year 1913, and the taxes so assessed have been or are being collected as taxes payable for the plaintiff school district.\n\u201c6. Each of the companies mentioned in the said schedule \u2018A\u2019 has been duly served by the defendant with notice prescribed by section 93a of the \u2018School Assessment Act.\u2019\n\u201c7. None of the companies mentioned in the said schedule \u2018A\u2019 has to this day given any notice to the secretary-treasurer of the City of Regina, or the secretary of either the plaintiff or defendant, requiring any of the real or personal property for which such company is liable to assessment, to be entered, rated or assessed for the purposes of the said separate school.\n\u201c8. None of the companies mentioned in the said schedule \u2018A\u2019 has been entered as a separate school supporter in the assessment roll of the said city in respect of any property, and no property of any of the said companies has been assessed in the name of the company for the purposes of the said separate school.\n\u201c9. The defendant school district claims that the school taxes payable by the said companies for the year 1913 should be divided between it and the plaintiff school district, as provided in section 93a of the \u2018School Assessment Act\u2019; the plaintiff school district claims the whole of the taxes payable by said companies. \u201cThe questions for the opinion of the court are:\u2014\n\u201c(a) Had the Saskatchewan Legislature jurisdiction to enact section 93a of the \u2018School Assessment Act,\u2019 being section 3, chapter 36 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912-1913?\n\u201c(b) If question. (a) be answered in the negative, has the defendant the right it claims to a portion of said taxes?\n\u201c(c) If question (a) be answered in the affirmative, has the defendant the right it claims to a portion of the said taxes?\u201d\nThe special case was tried before His Lordship Mr. Justice Brown who, in his judgment, on 16th May, 1914, held that public school (Supporters were prejudicially affected by section 93a, hut that, nevertheless, the enactment was intra vires and that the respondent was entitled to the portion of the taxes which it claimed. The plaintiff (now appellant) appealed to the Supreme Court in banco which, by the judgment now appealed from, affirmed the decision of Brown J.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and Christopher G. Robinson for the appellant.\nH. Y. MacDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014On this appeal we are asked to say if we agree with the answers given by the two provincial courts to the three questions formulated by the trial judge in the terms and under the circumstances so fully explained in the opinions of my brother judges that it is unnecessary for me to do more than refer to them. We are all, with the exception of Mr. Justice Idington, of opinion that the first question was properly answered in the affirmative.\nTo hold, as in the majority we do, that the Legislature of Saskatchewan was competent to enact section 3, chapter 36 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912-13 (now known as section 93a) in amendment of section 93, chapter 30, of the ordinances of the North-West Territories passed in the year 1901, it is sufficient to refer to section 17 of the Saskatchewan Act, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 42 (Canada), which is in these terms:\u2014\n17. Section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d shall apply to the said province, with the substitution for paragraph (1) of the said section 93 of the following paragraph:\u2014\n(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to separate schools which any class of persons have at the date of the passing of this Act under the terms of chapters 29 and 30 of the ordinances of the North-West Territories, passed in the year 1901, or with respect to religious instruction in any public or separate school as provided for in the said ordinances.\n(2) In the appropriation by the legislature or distribution by the Government of the province of any moneys for the support of schools organized and carried on in accordance with the said chapter 29, or any Act passed in amendment thereof or in substitution therefor, there shall be no discrimination against schools of any class described in the said chapter 29.\n(3) Where the expression \u201cby law\u201d is employed in paragraph 3 of the said section 93, it shall be held to mean as set out in the said chapters 29 and 30; and where the expression \u201cat the union\u201d is employed in the said paragraph 3 it shall be held to mean that date at which this Act comes into force.\nIn construing this constitutional enactment we are not only entitled, hut bound, to consider the history of the subject-matter dealt with, and by the light derived from such source, to put ourselves as far as possible in the position of the legislature whose language we have to expound. In re Branch Lines, Canadian Pacific Railway[3], at pages 89-90; In re Representation in the House of Commons[4], at page 567; Halsbury, vol. 27, p. 141, sec. 260.\nWhen this section 17 was under consideration in Parliament it was deemed necessary, because of the bitter controversy to which it gave rise, to fully explain the meaning of the language used and the part which it was intended it should play in the general economy of the constitution then being provided for the new province. It was pointed out that the subject of education is separately dealt with and has its own code in section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d; and that the powers of the original confederating provinces to make laws in relation to education are expressly limited by this section in several respects. (1) The right to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law in each province at the date of the Union must be preserved; (2) The powers, privileges and duties conferred in Upper Canada upon separate schools and school trustees of the Roman Catholics are extended to the dissentient schools of Protestants in Quebec; (3) Where in any province a system of separate or dissentient schools exists by law at the Union, or is thereafter established, an appeal shall lie to the Governor-in-Council from any act or decision of any provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the minority.\nIf, therefore, section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d had been made applicable in its entirety to the new province, the effect would have been to preserve any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools (not merely separate) which any class of persons had by law in that part of the territory which was then being brought into the Union. If the words \u201cin the province at the Union\u201d meant the time at which the territory came into the Union as a province, the word \u201claw\u201d would have included the provisions of section 11 of the \u201cNorth-West Territories Act\u201d of 1875 and of chapters 29 and 30 of the ordinances of 1901.\nTo avoid the doubt and uncertainty which arose out of the \u201cManitoba Act\u201d it was decided to adopt the section we are now considering, which limits the rights and privileges of the minority, Protestant or Catholic, in any school district to those secured to it by chapters 29 and 30 of the ordinances and excludes the rights and privileges guaranteed either by section 11 of the \u201cNorth-West Territories Act,\u201d 1875, or by any other legislation in force in the territories with regard to any class of schools.\nIt is, therefore, necessary to examine the provisions of those ordinances to ascertain the nature and extent of the legislative control which the province has over education. Under chapters 29 and 30, the schools, whether public or separate, are the schools of all the ratepayers and they are in every respect on a basis of absolute equality. The Department of Education exercises the same control over all schools, and all the land in the province liable to assessment for municipal purposes is subject to assessment for school purpose. Provision is made for the taxation of land held jointly and for land held by companies.\nOnly three classes of schools are authorized: (a) Public (undenominational) schools; (b) Protestant separate; (c) Roman Catholic separate. And a separate school district can be established only in an existing public school district. No rights or privileges exist by those ordinances with respect to separate schools as contrasted with public schools; except the initial right of affecting the separation, which right carries with it certain advantages with respect to text-books, and the election of trustees who choose the teacher; this is a right common to all schools. It was also said and insisted upon at the time that the intention of Parliament was to secure to all the schools, whether public or separate, their fair share in the appropriation and distribution of any moneys for the support of schools, which in practice they had always received and which was necessary to place them in a position to play their necessary part in the general scheme of national education, and this explains why sub-section 2 was made a part of section 17. The importance of that sub-section is so very obvious in the consideration of both the questions now submitted that it will not be necessary to make further reference to it.\nTo answer the first question in the negative it must, therefore, be found that some right or privilege with respect to separate schools which a class of persons had at the date of the passing of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d was or is prejudicially affected by section 93# now in question.\nThat section reads:\u2014\nIn the event of any company failing to give a notice as provided in section 93 hereof the board of trustees of the separate school district may give to the company a notice in writing in the following form or to the like effect, that is to say:\u2014\nThe Board of Trustees of separate school district No. of Saskatchewan hereby gives notice that unless and until your company gives a notice as provided by section 93 of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act\u201d the school taxes payable by your company in respect of assessable property lying within the limits of school district No. of Saskatchewan * * * will be divided between the said public school district and the said separate school district in shares corresponding with the total assessed value of assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for public school purposes and the total assessed value of assessable property assessed to persons other than corporation for separate school purposes respectively.\nThe undoubted intention of the legislature as expressed in that language is to provide, in accordance with the spirit and the letter of sub-section 2 of section 17, that the separate schools, whether Protestant or Catholic, are to share equitably in the distribution of the taxes levied upon public companies in the different school districts. And, assuming that to be the intention of the legislature, in what respect can it be said that a right or privilege with respect to separate schools which any person had at the date of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d is violated or prejudicially affected by the section? Who are the persons prejudiced? The right of separation, the right to religious teaching, the right to elect trustees are not in any way interfered with and what other right had any class of persons at the date of the passing of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d with respect to separate schools? The section, I repeat, makes provision for the equitable distribution of moneys levied for the support of schools and nothing more.\nMr. Nesbitt, on behalf of the appellant, hesitatingly, and, I thought, almost apologetically suggested that because under section 93 of the ordinance in force at the Union, the school taxes paid by those companies which failed to take advantage of, or to exercise the right to give notice, went to the support of the public schools, there resulted in favour of the supporters of those schools a negative right of which they were deprived by section 93a. This contention is so effectively disposed of by my brother Anglin that I hesitate to do more than refer to what he says. The supporter of the public school, which is merely the school of the majority, Protestant or Catholic, in a school district has no right or privilege with respect to the separate school, which is the school of the minority in the same district. The separate school supporters alone have special rights or claims in relation to the separate schools in districts in which they have exercised their right to separation. That is to say, the minority in a school district composes\na class of persons which enjoy some special benefit, immunity or advantage with reference to separate schools\nin that district above and apart from those rights enjoyed either at common law or under statutory enactment by the other inhabitants of the same district or of the province at large; and it is the rights of that minority which may not be prejudicially affected. The only right or privilege with respect to the payment of rates enjoyed by any class of persons is that of the minority, whether Protestant or Catholic, which has established a separate school. That minority is exempt from the obligation to pay any rates except those they impose upon themselves (see section 41, chapter 29, ordinance of 1901). A company which by the very nature of things differs from the individuals, whether Protestant or Catholic, of whom it is constituted has not and cannot have any rights with respect to, education and nothing done in the distribution of the school taxes levied on its property can be held to be a prejudicial affection of its right with respect to separate schools. Further, can the contention that the benefit derived from the receipt of taxes collected on the property of a corporation, and which is dependent on the omission by that corporation to exercise an option or faculty which, if exercised at any time, is sufficient to cause the benefit to inure to another, be described in the language of section 17 as a right or privilege with respect to separate schools? And finally, by what right can a public school supporter claim that all the taxes levied on public companies should go to the exclusive relief of his obligation to maintain the school of his choice?\nMr. Justice Lamont in the court below seems to me to accurately state the position when he says\nthat the rights and privileges with which the legislature must not interfere are those of the minority in any school district, and nothing done in regard to that minority can in any way affect a public school supporter either in the same or in any other district.\nThat the latter\u2019s rates may be increased as a result of the legislation passed to provide for the equitable distribution of the money levied for school purposes as required by sub-section 2 of section 17 is possible, but that sub-section necessarily contemplates changes in the burden of taxation as the result of the changes in the distribution which it requires so as to prevent discrimination \u201cagainst schools of any class described in said chapter 29.\u201d\nI now come to the consideration of the second question.\nAs was said by their Lordships in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Brophy v. Attorney-General of Manitoba[5]:\u2014\nWhilst, however, it is necessary to resist any temptation to deviate from the sound rules of construction in the hope of more completely satisfying the intention of the legislature, it is quite legitimate where more than one construction of a statute is possible to select that one which will best carry out what appears from the general scope of the legislation and the surrounding circumstances to have been its intention.\nSection 93, which 93a was intended to amend, may be said to be applicable, if not in express terms by implication, only to those companies which have Protestant and Catholic shareholders, because it provides that the share of a company\u2019s property which may be assessed in any school district for separate school purposes shall bear the same ratio and proportion to the whole property of the company assessable within the municipality or school district as the amount or proportion of the shares or stock of the company held and possessed by persons who are Roman Catholics or Protestants bears to the whole amount of such shares or stock of the company. But the amending section contains no such provision. That section (93a) is applicable in terms to all companies which fail to give the notice provided for in section 93. The language used is\u2014\nIn the event of any company failing to give a notice as provided in section 93.\nMr. Justice Newlands in the court below and the majority here interpret that section so as to make it applicable exclusively to such companies as may give the notice required by section, 93. I think that, reasonably construed, the language is broad enough to comprise all the public companies which have failed to give the notice required by section 93. That seems to he a fair construction of the language used and has this additional advantage that it gives full effect to the evident intention of the legislature which was\nto divide the taxes collected from all companies who do not take advantage of section 93 between the public and separate schools in each district in shares corresponding with the total assessed value of the assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for public school purposes and the total assessed value of the assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for separate school purposes respectively.\nAll ratepayers, Protestant or Catholic, in each district contribute to the prosperity of those companies in proportion to their numbers, and why should they not all share in the distribution of the taxes levied on their property for school purposes? If the language used may be construed so as to produce that result, why should we be astute to give it another meaning which is not consistent either with common justice or the spirit and letter of the constitutional Act, subsection 2, section 17.\nIf, as Mr. Justice Lamont says, the legislature had intended that 93(a) should apply only to such companies as had shareholders of the religious faith of the separate school, one would have expected provision would have been made by which it could be ascertained what companies had and what companies had not shareholders belonging to such religious faith. No such provision is found. Without such provision section 93(a), limited to certain companies only, would provide no remedy and would be useless.\nThe very general language used in the section should be construed so as to give effect to what appears in the general scope of the legislation in the surrounding circumstances to have been the intention of the legislature.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal and answer the questions as they were answered below.\nDavies J.\u2014This was a special case agreed to by the parties to the action for the purpose of determining the respective rights of the public schools and separate schools to certain school taxes collected from companies by the City of Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThe questions submitted were whether the Saskatchewan Legislature had power to enact section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d and if so whether the Gratton Separate School Trustees had the right they claimed to a portion of the school taxes in dispute.\nThe provincial courts answered the questions in the affirmative, Newlands J. dissenting from the answer affirming the Separate School Trustees\u2019 right to claim a portion of the taxes.\nWith respect to the constitutional question as to the jurisdiction of the Legislature of the province to enact the section in question, 93a, the conclusion I have reached upon its proper construction relieves me from discussing or answering the question of the legislature\u2019s jurisdiction.\nThat conclusion is in accordance with that stated in his dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Newlands of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, sitting en banc, to the effect that the section 93a does not give the Board of trustees of Gratton Separate School District, the defendant respondent in this appeal, the right they claim to a portion of the taxes payable by the companies mentioned in Schedule \u201cA\u201d attached to the special case.\nIt being, therefore, unnecessary to answer the constitutional questions asked, I follow the opinion and advice of the Judicial Committee in the recent judgment delivered by them in the appeal of The John Deere Plow Company v. Wharton(1), and refrain from expressing any opinion. The Lord Chancellor, in delivering the judgment of their Lordships, said, at pages 338-9:\u2014\nThe structure of sections 91 and 92 and the degree to which the connotation of the expressions used overlaps render it, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, unwise on this or any other occasion to attempt exhaustive definitions of the meaning and scope of these expressions. Such definitions, in the case of language used under the conditions in which a constitution such as that under consideration was framed, must almost certainly miscarry. It is in many cases only by confining decisions to concrete questions which have actually arisen in circumstances, the whole of which are before the tribunal, that injustice to future suitors can be avoided. Their Lordships adhere to what was said by Sir Montague Smith in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company v. Parsons[6], to the effect that in discharging the difficult duty of arriving at a reasonable and practical construction of the language of the sections, so as to reconcile the respective powers they contain and give effect to them all, it is the wise course to decide each case which arises without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nThis extract is, of course, applicable to the Saskatchewan \u201cConstitutional Act,\u201d the provisions of which we are asked to construe by the special case.\nTurning then to the amending section 93a under review, I agree with the construction Mr. Justice New-lands places upon it. We must bear in mind that under the law as it stood when first passed in the North-West Territories ordinances, and as enacted and continued by the Saskatchewan Legislature up to the passing of the amendment 93a in 1913, a company which had no shareholders of the religious faith of the separate school was neither required to give nor could give the notice specified in section 93.\nSection 93 of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d and section 93a, which was passed either in amendment or by way of supplement to section 93 must be read and construed together.\nSection 93 is a permissive section merely authorizing a company by notice in that behalf to require certain specially designated parts of its property to be\nassessed for the purposes of the separate school and not for public school purposes with the proviso that the share to be assessed for separate school purposes should hear the same proportion to the whole property of the company assessable within the school district as the proportion of the shares of the company held by Protestants or Roman Catholics respectively bore to the whole amount of the shares of the company.\nSection 93a may have been drafted with the intention in the draftsman\u2019s mind of compelling all companies to give such notice. It provided that in the event of any company failing to do so an arbitrary division should be made of assessable school taxes payable by the company between the separate and the public schools, which division did not have any reference to the proportion of shares held in the company by Protestants or Roman Catholics.\nNow it is manifest that a company desirous of exercising the permission given by section 93 must before exercising it have ascertained with certainty the religious persuasions or beliefs or connections of its various shareholders. In no other way could the statutory division the company was authorized to require of its assessable taxes be made and the grossest injustice might be done to one or other of the respective schools, public or separate, if in the absence of such knowledge any company should attempt to exercise its privilege.\nAnd so after section 93a was passed its language, \u201cany company failing to give a notice as provided in section 93,\u201d must have reference to such companies only as possessed the knowledge necessary to enable them to give the notice requiring the proportional division of their taxes and yet failed to give it. It could not have reference to companies in which none of the shareholders were of the \u201csame religious faith\u201d as that of the separate school seeking the division of the taxes.\nIn the case before us we have no evidence whatever of the religious faith or religious connections of any of the shareholders of the different companies mentioned in Schedule \u201cA\u201d of the case.\nMr. MacDonald, who argued the case of the defendant separate school so ably, submitted that such knowledge was not necessary, because the section 93a applied to all companies that had not given the notice the section provided for quite irrespective of their power to give the notice from want of knowledge of the religious faith or connections of its shareholders.\nAs already pointed out by me I cannot accept such a construction, the effect of which would undoubtedly be to defeat the manifest purpose and object of section 93, and probably in many cases create gross injustice.\nIt never was nor could have been intended that companies not coming within section 93 at all and not having the knowledge requisite to give the notice should have their taxes diverted from the public school to the separate school as a penalty for not giving a notice they could not legally give. The amending section 93a is somewhat crudely drawn, but I do not entertain any doubt of its real meaning and intent.\nIn my judgment, therefore, the amendment does not apply to companies in which there are no shareholders of the religious faith of the separate school seeking a share of the taxes collected and I would answer the questions by saying that, apart altogether from the legislature\u2019s jurisdiction to enact section 93a, upon which I express no opinion, that section does not give the defendant the right it claims to a portion of the school taxes in dispute.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether or not section 17 of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d fixed the boundaries of the rights of separate schools in relation to taxes which such corporations as respondent may claim. The question has arisen between appellant and respondent representing the respective interests of public school and separate school supporters in that regard.\nSaid section 17 no doubt was designed to render impossible such inequitable legislation by the legislature of the new province as would enable one religious body or set of religious bodies to make, as it were, reprisals from each other. If the judgments in the courts below are right then the attempt has been an absolute failure, for it is frankly admitted by the learned trial judge, and indeed can hardly be seriously denied, that the operation of section 93a now in question will prejudicially affect every public school district and every public school supporter where a separate school district exists. I may add thereto that just to the extent the public school supporter is prejudicially affected the separate school supporter will be beneficially affected.\nIn creating the Province of Saskatchewan, and giving it the power enjoyed by other provinces, under section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d paragraph (1) of said section was substituted by the following:\u2014\n(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to separate schools which any class of persons have at the date of the passing of this Act under the terms of chapters 29 and 30 of the ordinances of the North-West Territories, passed in the year 1901, or with respect to religious instruction in any public or separate school as provided for in the said ordinances.\n(2) In the appropriation by the legislature or distribution by the Government of the province of any moneys for the support of schools organized and carried on in accordance with the said chapter 29, or any Act passed in amendment thereof or in substitution therefor, there shall be no discrimination against schools of any class described in the said chapter 29.\n(3) Where the expression \u201cby law\u201d is employed in paragraph (3) of the said section 93, it shall be held to mean the law as set out in the said chapters 29 and 30; and were the expression \u201cat the Union\u201d is employed in the said paragraph (3) it shall be held to mean the date at which this Act comes into force.\nIt is important to observe that by its very terms this substitution gives rise to a number of considerations different from those which were touched upon in a number of cases which depended upon the \u201cManitoba Act.\u201d That Act simply adopted the very language of section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d so far as the same could be applicable to a single province. This substitution introduces, in its every part, something which easily differentiates not only each such part, but the group of three parts as a whole, from not only the \u201cManitoba Act,\u201d but also from the prototype of both.\nTrue, the language of the first two lines is identical with the original, and that has been construed as governing the whole. Why was any more added if that sufficed? Why adopt a change if these lines embodied all that was desired and expressed all hoped to be affected thereby? What purposes were the significant words\nor with respect to religious instructions in any public or separate school as provided for in said ordinances, intended to subserve? Is it not clear that there was something for which the section was intended to operate relatively to public schools as well as separate schools? Why blend the two subject-matters in one sub-section if the first half of a short sentence was to be treated as confined to one subject, one point of view relative thereto, and the phrase, \u201cany class of persons\u201d which is wide enough to cover any class outside or inside those of the class supporting a separate school, be restricted in its meaning so as to cover only the latter in the first part, but both in the latter part?\nThe trouble is that these lines forming only the first part of a sentence and section in the Act to he construed herein constituted nearly the whole of a section in the \u201cManitoba Act\u201d which gave rise to much litigation and strife which has left a mark on men\u2019s minds and that operates now as if the two sections were identical.\nIf that part of this sub-section had been presented in its present setting for the first time and due consideration given that which is demanded by what follows and is implied in chapters 29 and 30 of the ordinances of the North-West Territories passed in the year 1901, I venture to think no one would have thought of making anything but the said ordinances the key-note or dominating factor in the interpretation of the whole section. Such, I submit, they clearly were intended by their incorporation therewith to become. So read and interpreted thus these two lines thereof can and will be given another meaning than the narrow one which has been suggested.\nI, therefore, turn to said ordinances to see how the terms of them delimit or bound the rights of the warring factions. For the taxing purposes involved in this case, which is all that can concern us, let us look at the terms of said chapter 29, section 45 thereof, which first provides for the rights and liabilities of separate school districts and then provides by subsection 2 thereof, as follows:\u2014\n(2) Any person who is legally assessed or assessable for a public school shall not be liable to assessment for any separate school established therein.\nYet this which is thus expressly forbidden to be done is what section 93a specifically enacts shall be done; in an indirect manner it is true but none the less effectually done.\nThen we have provision made by sub-section 2 above quoted, which specifically forbids, in the distribution of legislative grants, discrimination against schools of any class described by chapter 29, thereby shewing the intention of the legislature in dealing with the subject.\nAgain, in sub-section 3 above quoted we have the words \u201cby law\u201d in sub-section 3 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d declared to mean the law as set out in said chapters 29 and 30. Can there be a doubt, when we have regard to all these provisions and the considerations suggested thereby, that said chapters 29 and 30 were designed within said section 17 to permanently fix the boundaries of the rights of the separate schools and their supporters and the relations between them and the public schools and their supporters?\nIf so then let us again read the lines\nnothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to separate schools which any class of persons have,\nupon which stress is laid, and see if the phrases \u201cwith respect to\u201d and \u201cany class of persons\u201d must necessarily mean, and have relation to only those who are separate school supporters.\nI submit the literal meaning of the words used does not imperatively require such interpretation and may, taken in connection with the rest of the subsection and the section as a whole be read as appellant suggests. That protects both classes and insures them and each of them against an invasion of that which was guaranteed by chapters 29 and 30, which was the final result of nearly thirty years of experience and development in relation to a difficult problem.\nMoreover, we have in said chapter 30, sections 9 and 93, which expressly deal with the problem of corporate companies (the former in relation to such in rural districts and the latter in villages and town districts) and enable any such company in a separate school district to give notice of its desire to have the whole or part of its property assessed for separate school purposes and not for public school purposes, but in each case:\u2014\nProvided always that the share or portion of the property of any company entered, rated or assessed in any municipality or in any school district for separate school purposes under the provisions of this section shall bear the same ratio and proportion to the whole property of the company assessable within the municipality or school district as the amount or proportion of the shares or stock of the company so far as the same are paid or partly paid up, held and possessed by persons who are Protestants or Roman Catholics as the case may be bears to the whole amount of such paid or partly paid-up shares or stock of the company.\nWhat does this mean if not an express prohibition against any greater part thereof than indicated being made applicable to separate school support?\nSuch was the state of the law when the province was created and such limitation of the proportionate share of any corporate company\u2019s taxes, however reached, it was evidently designed to perpetuate. It seems companies did not respond to the invitation to allot a proportion of their assessments to separate school support and hence the enactment of 93a now in question.\nI can, in light of said section 93, conceive of legislation being asked for, as against local shareholders in such companies to make those who might be presumed to be supporters of separate schools assessable therefore, in respect of their shares, in ways I need not enter upon, and the company being given credit for that in its public school rating.\nWithout passing any opinion on that and only by way of illustration as something possibly arguable within the purposes of the chapters 29 and 30 incorporated into the \u201cSaskatchewan Act,\u201d I submit that in said section 93 thereof there may be found a field within which the legislature might properly operate. Indeed, I assume it was something of that kind that the legislature had in view.\nBut I cannot see how an adhesion to the lines laid down in said ordinances can permit of such drastic legislation as that contained in section 93a.\nI think it ultra vires the legislature and that the appeal should be allowed. I see no half-way house such as question (b) seems to suggest may exist within said sections 93 and 93a so far as parts of the assessments are concerned. The first two questions should be answered in the negative and doing so renders it unnecessary to answer the third.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout. Duff J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Davies. For the reason given by him I confine myself to passing upon the point raised by question (c) as to the construction of the statute.\nThe sections to be construed (secs. 93 & 93a, as the Act now stands,) are as follows:\u2014\n93. A company may by notice in that behalf, to be given to the secretary-treasurer of any municipality wherein a separate school district is either wholly or in part situated and to the secretary of the board of any public school district in which a separate school had been established and to the secretary of the board of such separate school district require any part of the real property of which such company is either the owner and occupant or not being such owner is the tenant or occupant or in actual possession of and any part of the personal property if any of such company liable to assessment to be entered, rated and assessed for the purposes of said separate school and the proper assessor shall thereupon enter said company as a separate school supporter in the assessment roll in respect of the property specially designated in that behalf in or by said notice and so much of the property as shall be so designated shall be assessed accordingly in the name of the company for the purposes of the separate school and not for public school purposes but all other property of the company shall be separately entered and assessed in the name of the company as for public school purposes:\u2014\nProvided always that the share or portion of the property of any company entered, rated or assessed in any municipality or in any school district for separate school purposes under the provisions of this section shall bear the same ratio and proportion to the whole property of the company assessable within the municipality or school district as the amount\u2019 or proportion of the shares or stock of the company so far as the same are paid or partly paid up, held and possessed by persons who are Protestants or Roman Catholics, as the case may be bears to the whole amount of such paid or partly paid up shares or stock of the company.\n(2) Any such notice given in pursuance of a resolution in that behalf of the directors of the company shall for all purposes be deemed to be sufficient and every such notice so given shall be taken as continuing and in force and to be acted upon unless and until the same is withdrawn, varied or cancelled by any notice subsequently given pursuant to any resolution of the company or of its directors.\n(3) Every such notice so given to such secretary-treasurer shall remain with and be kept by him on file in his office, and shall at all convenient hours be open to inspection and examination by any person entitled to examine or inspect the assessment roll, and the assessor shall in each year before the completion and return of the assessment roll search for and examine all notices which may be on file in the clerk\u2019s office, and shall thereupon in respect of said notices if any follow and conform thereto and to the provisions of this Ordinance in that behalf.\n(4) False statements made in any such notice shall not relieve the company from rates. Any company fraudulently giving such notice or making false statements therein shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100. Any person giving for a company such a statement fraudulently or wilfully inserting in any such notice a false statement shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a like penalty. (1901, chap. 30, sec. 93.)\n93a. In the event of any company failing to give a notice as provided in section 93 hereof the board of trustees of the separate school district may give to the company a notice in writing in the following form, or to the like effect, that is to say:\u2014\nThe board of trustees of separate school district No. of Saskatchewan hereby give notice that unless and until your company gives a notice as provided by section 93 of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d the school taxes payable by your company in respect of assessable property lying within the limits of the school district No. of Saskatchewan (naming the public school district in relation to which the separate school is established) will be divided between the said public school district and the said separate school district in shares corresponding with the total assessed value of assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for public school purposes and the total assessed value of the assessable property assessed to persons other than corporations for separate school purposes respectively.\nThis notice is given in pursuance of section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act\u201d as amended.\n(2) Unless and until any company to which notice has been given as aforesaid gives a notice as provided in section 93 hereof the whole of the assessable property of such company lying within the limits of the public school district shall be entered, rated and assessed upon the assessment roll for the public school district and all taxes so assessed shall be collected as taxes payable for the said public school district and when so collected such taxes shall be divided between the said public school district and the said separate school district in the proportions and manner and according to the provisions set out in the notice in the next preceding subsection mentioned.\n(3) Service of a notice under the foregoing provisions upon acompany may be effected by serving the same upon any officer or agent of the company upon whom service of a writ of summons issued out of the Supreme Court for Saskatchewan may be lawfully served for the company. (Sask., 1912-1913, chap. 36, sec. 3.)\nThe notice authorized by 93a is to be given only in the event of \u201cany company failing to give a notice as provided by section 93.\u201d And the consequences provided for by 93a(2) arise only in the absence of \u201ca notice as provided in section 93.\u201d I think the notice \u201cprovided in section 93\u201d or \u201cprovided by section 93\u201d means a notice of the character contemplated by section 93 before the passing of the amendment of 191213, now section 93a. It seems plain that section 93 only contemplated the giving of notice where some part of the real property of the company within the separate school district would properly be \u201centered, rated and assessed\u201d for the purposes of the separate school in accordance with the rule laid down in the proviso to that section. I think that follows from the language in which that section is expressed.\nThere is, it appears to me, little or no weight in the suggestion that in this view no provision is made for the case in which all the shareholders should be separate school supporters. The answer seems to be that \u201cany part\u201d as used here extends to every part. It is a very different thing to read \u201cany part\u201d in this context as meaning none.\nQuestion (c) should be answered in the negative.\nSince writing my judgment as above, which was filed 2nd February, my attention has been directed to the second and third paragraphs of the judgment of the Chief Justice filed some weeks later and published in the Western Weekly Reports of March 26th. The effect of those paragraphs is that all the members of the Court taking part in the hearing of the appeal except Mr. Justice Idington concur in the answer given by the Court below in the affirmative to the first question, that is to say, that the Legislature of Saskatchewan had jurisdiction to enact section 93a.\nIn view of this statement I think it necessary to re-state in explicit terms what is stated by reference to the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies\u2019 in the first paragraph of this judgment.\nHaving reached a clear opinion that on the proper construction of section 93a the respondents must fail, I consider it undesirable to express any opinion on the first question\u2014the question relating to the jurisdiction of the legislature to enact that section; or upon any of the thorny questions as to the meaning of section 17 of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d which may in a proper case require decision. This course is incumbent upon me, as explained by Mr. Justice Davies, by reason of a sound and settled rule that questions as to the limits of legislative powers should not be passed upon when the decision of the cause does not require it\u2014a rule whose observance is especially important in cases such as this.\nThis is all put very plainly in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies in which, as stated in the first paragraph hereof, I concur. In the circumstances, however, some expansion of that paragraph seemed desirable to prevent misapprehension; and I should perhaps add that not only have I expressed no opinion upon the first question \u2014 I have formed none.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014On this appeal we are asked to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc affirming the judgment of Brown J. on a special case. The questions submitted in the special case are as follows:\u2014\n(a) Had the Saskatchewan Legislature jurisdiction to enact section 93a of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act,\u201d being section 3, chapter 36, of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912-1913?\n(b) If question (a) be answered in the negative, have the defendants the right they claim to a portion of said taxes?\n(c) If question (a) be answered in the affirmative, have the defendants the right they claim to a portion of the said taxes?\nThe provincial courts have answered questions (a) and (c) in the affirmative.\nI am unable to accept Mr. MacDonald\u2019s ingenious contention that prior to the enactment of section 93a the public schools had not a legal right to the school taxes of companies which did not give the notice provided for by section 93 of the \u201cSchool Assessment Act.\u201d Taking into account all the relevant provisions of chapters 29 and 30 of the North-West Territories Ordinances, 1901, I am satisfied that such taxes were payable to the public schools. The terms of section 93 of chapter 30 in themselves make this reasonably certain. So construed they harmonize with section 41 of chapter 29. To make it clear that this is the correct view of these provisions it is only necessary to remember that until and unless a separate school is established under section 41 of chapter 29, the right of the public school to all the school taxes of the school district, including those of all companies (chapter 30, section 90), is incontestible. It is only upon the establishment of the separate school that this absolute right ceases and then to the extent to which the statute modifies or curtails it \u2014 but no further.\nI assume, therefore, that the effect of section 93a, where acted upon, is to deprive the public schools of the benefit of a portion of the taxes of companies that do not give notice under section 93, which they theretofore enjoyed. But I am not on that account prepared to hold section 93a to be ultra vires. Before it can he so held it must be found to be within the prohibition of section 17 of the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d (4 & 5 Edw. VII. (D.), ch. 42), which declares section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d applicable to Saskatchewan, substituting, however, a new paragraph for paragraph (1) of that section. With this alteration section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d as applicable to Saskatchewan reads in part as follows:\u2014\nIn and for the Province of Saskatchewan the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to separate schools which any class of persons have at the date of the passing of this Act, under the terms of chapters 29 and 30 of the ordinances of the North-West Territories passed in the year 1901 or with respect to religious instruction in any public or separate school as provided for in the said ordinances.\nIn order to ascertain what are the rights and privileges of any class of persons with respect to separate schools which the legislature may not prejudicially affect, we must examine chapters 29 and 30 of the North-West Territories Ordinances, 1901. Sections 41-45 of chapter 29 provide for the establishment of separate schools, the taxation of their supporters for the purposes of such schools, and their exemption from other school rates, and the exemption of persons legally assessed, or assessable as public school supporters from separate school rates. Under section 92 of chapter 30 separate schools in towns and villages are entitled to the benefit of a proportion of the taxes levied upon property held by joint tenants and tenants in common, of whom one is a separate school supporter; and section 93 makes a similar provision in regard to companies which give the notice for which it provides. These are the only provisions of chapters 29 and 30 which confer on any class of persons any rights or privileges with regard to separate schools. Certain other sections deal with religious instruction in all schools whether public or separate.\nThe right to establish separate schools is given only to the minority \u2014 Protestant or Roman Catholic \u2014 in the district (chapter 29, section 41). The persons qualified to vote must be \u201cProtestant or Roman Catholic\u201d (section 43); in cases of joint tenancy or tenancy in common, where there is a separate school, the holders, \u201cProtestant or Roman Catholic,\u201d are to be assessed in proportion to their interests (chapter 30, section 92); in the case of a company giving the requisite notice, a proportion of its property specified equal to the proportion of the stock held by \u201cProtestants or Roman Catholics, as the case may be,\u201d is to be taxed for separate school purposes. All these provisions make it clear that for the purposes of separate schools the community in each School district was regarded as divided into two classes \u2014 one, the majority, the other, the minority \u2014 one Roman Catholic, the other Protestant, the latter comprising all non-Roman Catholics. The legislature did not recognize any \u201cclass of persons\u201d comprised in the majority in the district as requiring or entitled to separate school rights or privileges. Upon whichever of these two classes should happen to he in the minority in a school district the legislature conferred the right of establishing a separate school with the incidental privileges for which the statute provided. The majority did not require and were not given any right or privilege with respect to separate schools. Their school was the public school. They were not a class of persons whom it was deemed necessary to protect. I agree with Brown J., that sub-section 1 of section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d as it applies to Saskatchewan\nis separate school protective legislation, affording protection for, but not protection against separate schools,\nand that its object is the same as that of the similar provision applicable to Manitoba, namely, \u201cto afford protection to denominational (separate) schools.\u201d Brophy v. Attorney-General of Manitoba[7]. As put by Lament J.:\u2014\nThe power of the legislature, therefore, is absolute in dealing with education unless its legislation prejudicially affects the minority, whether Protestant or Catholic, in any school district.\nI am unable to appreciate the negative right in regard to separate schools which Mr. Nesbitt contends the majority possessed under the North-West Territories Ordinances, 1901. If they received the entire taxes of certain companies merely because such companies omitted to give a notice under section 93, that was not a right or privilege; if it was, it was not a right or privilege with regard to separate schools; and the majority did not possess it as a class of persons having such right or privilege within the meaning of paragraph (1) of section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nI would, for these reasons, affirm the answer given to question (a).\nOn the second branch of the case, I agree in the opinions expressed by Brown J. and Lamont J. as to the proper construction of section 93(a). No doubt \u201cfailing\u201d was not the word most apt to express the intention of the legislature. It primarily suggests the idea of neglect or omission to discharge a duty or obligation. Section 93 did not impose an obligation on any company to give the notice for which it provides. On the other hand, there is nothing in that section which precludes a company which has no shareholders of the religious faith of the minority from giving a notice that it requires all its property to be assessed for public school purposes, although such a notice may be supererogatory. I agree with Mr. MacDonald that the proviso to section 93 relates solely to the duty of the assessor and does not limit the application of the first member of the earlier paragraph of the section to companies having shareholders of the religious faith of the minority, Protestant or Catholic. The provision for notice \u2014 permissive as it is \u2014 is applicable to all companies, whatever the religious complexion of the shareholders. The presence of the word \u201cfailing,\u201d therefore, affords no reason for excluding any company from the operation of section 93a.\nBut on broader grounds I am of the opinion that section 93a must be regarded as applicable to all companies. Equality of treatment and equal rights and privileges for public and separate schools would appear to be the spirit of the school legislation of Saskatchewan. Under section 93 separate schools could receive no share of the taxes of any company which omitted to give the prescribed notice, although all, or the majority of, its shareholders should be of the religious faith of the minority. As is pointed out by Brown and Lament JJ., comparatively few companies would give the notice. Thus a considerable portion of the school taxation to which they would be entitled on a basis of equality of treatment was lost to the separate schools. The provincial judges, familiar, no doubt, with the circumstances which impelled the legislature to enact section 93a [Lyde v. Barnard[8]] are of the opinion that its purpose was to remove this inequality. That seems reasonably obvious from the purview of the section itself and was not seriously contested at bar. Reserving to every company full power by giving a simple notice to ensure that its taxes shall be divided in proportion to the distribution of its shares amongst Protestants and Roman Catholics, sec. 93a provides that in the absence of such a notice (but only when the company has been duly called upon to give it) the taxes on its property shall be divided between the public school and the separate school in the proportion which the assessed value of the property of the ratepayers supporting the public school bears to the assessed value of the property of the ratepayers supporting the separate school. Having regard to the purpose of the legislature in enacting this measure, giving to it the-construction best calculated to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, I entertain no doubt that section 93a should be deemed applicable to all companies and that the words \u201cfailing to give\u201d should be read as meaning \u201cnot giving,\u201d an interpretation of which they are readily susceptible. Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co. [9]. Only \u201cabsolute intractability of the language used\u201d can justify a construction which defeats what is clearly the main object of a statute. Salmon v. Duncombe[10].\nIt is a familiar rule of construction that, although the court are prim\u00e2 facie bound to read the words of an Act according to their ordinary meaning in the language, if there are other circumstances which shew that the words must have been used by the legislature in a sense larger than their ordinary meaning, the court is bound to read them in that sense. Barlow v. Ross[11].\nThus the omission of an act which ought to be done has often been held to be within the purview of a statute requiring notice of action for anything \u201cdone\u201d under it. Wilson v. Mayor and Corporation of Halifax[12]; Poulsum v. Thirst[13]; Holland v. Northwich Highway Board[14]; Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[15]. See, too, Barman v. Ainslie[16]. It would be contrary to sound construction to permit the use of a term not altogether apt to defeat the intention of the legislature, which must not be assumed to have foreseen every result that may accrue from the use of a particular word. Nairn v. University of St. Andrews[17].\nSince the fact that no duty or obligation is imposed by section 93 on any company precludes our treating the word \u201cfailing\u201d as used in section 93a in what is perhaps its primary sense, viz., neglecting or omitting to discharge an obligation, I see no reason why we should not give to it a secondary meaning with which it is frequently employed, especially when by doing so we can effectuate the apparent purpose of the legislature.\nI would, for these reasons, also affirm the answer to question (c).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Barr, Sampson, Stewart & Johnston.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mackenzie, Brown, Macdonald & Bastedo.\n[1] 7 West.

Two of them were at variance with the third as to the mode of operating and all refused further advances. The company having no other means of procuring money, it was agreed that the two directors should sell their stock to the third for $60,000 secured by mortgage on the company\u2019s property, the debt of $43,000 to be discharged and the purchasing director to advance funds for operating and until the first payment had been made on the mortgage no such advances should be a charge on the company\u2019s property. Payments were made on the mortgage which afterwards fell into arrears and on action by the mortgagees an order was made for sale and delivery \u201cup of possession.\u201d More than a year after the mortgage was made the mining company incurred a debt to the respondent company which brought action for the amount and for a declaration that the mortgage was ultra vires of the company and that the judgment in the mortgage action was void. The action was dismissed at the trial. The Appellate Division held the mortgage void but only as to the excess over the indebtedness of the company at the time it was made.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (31 Ont. L.R. 221) and restoring that of the trial judge, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that the mortgage was valid; that though the expressed consideration was the price of shares sold by one holder to another the real consideration was the discharge of the company\u2019s existing indebtedness and securing of financial aid for the future.\nPer Davies, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The judgment in the foreclosure action was a conclusive answer to the attack on the mortgage by the company. The Great North-Western Railway Co. v. Charlebois ((1899) A.C. 114,) distinguished.\nAlso per Davies, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The trial judge having in effect decided that he had jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the mortgage, that decision was binding on all parties until reversed in appeal, and, having regard to what occurred at the trial, the decision on the point of jurisdiction was not appealable.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J., dissenting.\u2014The agreements and records made by the parties concerned in the transaction upon which alone the mortgage in question rests shew it to have been given solely to secure to the mortgagees the price of their sales of shares in the company to another shareholder and that, as such, the mortgage was ultra vires and void as against any creditors of the company.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nW.N. Tilley for the appellants.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondents.\nThe appellants, Hughes, and Mackechnie, and the respondent, Kirkegaard, were the owners of a mining property in the Township of Belmont, which they transferred to Cordova Mines Limited (a company they had incorporated for the purpose of acquiring the property), in consideration of the issue to themselves and their nominees of all the authorized capital stock of the company fully paid.\nCordova Mines Limited having issued all its capital stock in payment for the mine, it was necessary that money should be borrowed to carry on operations. These operations were extensive and were made possible by loans to the company from Hughes, Mackechnie, and Kirkegaard in equal shares. In April, 1912, Cordova Mines Limited was indebted to Hughes, Mackechnie and Kirkegaard in respect of these loans, including moneys then advanced to the extent of over $43,000. At this time Hughes, Mackechnie and Kirkegaard had drifted apart in their ideas as to the policy to be adopted in carrying on the company\u2019s affairs. Hughes and Mackechnie were on one side, Kirkegaard on the other. None of them was willing to advance more money unless his policy was adopted. A deadlock ensued. This deadlock was finally broken and the continuance of operations secured by an arrangement whereby Hughes and Mackechnie sold their shares to Montgomery, who was Kirkegaard\u2019s solicitor and trustee, for $60,000, payment of this amount to be secured by a mortgage from the company to Hughes and Mackechnie on the mine. Kirkegaard was to provide for the proper operation of the mine and to spend at least $3,000 per month in its development.\nThe form in which this arrangement was expressed and carried out consists of (1) an agreement between Hughes and Mackechnie of the first part, Joseph Montgomery, trustee, of the second part, and Peter Kirkegaard of the third part, dated 23rd April, 1912; (2) a supplemental agreement between Hughes and Mackechnie of the first part and Joseph Montgomery of the second part, dated 30th April, 1912, and (3) a mortgage from Cordova Mines Limited to Hughes and Mackechnie, dated 30th April, 1912.\nThe substance of the arrangement, so far as it affected the company, was set out and embodied in a minute of its directors held on the 30th April, 1912, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cIt was explained to the meeting that all moneys required by the company for expenses had heretofore been advanced by the three directors equally, and Messrs. Hughes and Mackechnie did not now desire to continue making advances, but were willing to dispose of their stock to other parties who were willing to guarantee the payment of the purchase price by a mortgage on the company\u2019s property, and it was considered advisable in the interests of the company that this should be done provided all shareholders consented thereto.\u201d\nAll the shareholders of the company concurred in this arrangement.\nIt was part of the agreement that the sum of $43,000 owing by the company was to be wiped out. All the debts owing by the company at the time of the arrangement were paid, and it was not contemplated that any further debts should be incurred. On the contrary it was expressly provided that until the first payment had been made on the mortgage all costs and expenses should be paid by Montgomery and his associates so as not to become a lien or charge on the company\u2019s property.\nThe result of the transaction was to free the company from its overdue debt of $43,000, and to obtain for it the new advances necessary for carrying on its operations and improving its property.\nHughes and Mackechnie, in pursuance of the agreement, transferred their shares to Montgomery, Kirkegaard\u2019s solicitor and trustee, and Kirkegaard proceeded to operate the mine and advanced to the com- pany large sums of money for that purpose. He and others associated with him made payments on account of the purchase money on the shares amounting to $19,000 or thereabouts to Hughes and Mackechnie. Thereafter the mortgage having fallen into arrear Hughes and Mackechnie, the appellants, brought proceedings against Cordova Mines Limited on the mortgage and on the 30th of April, 1913, upon consent of the company, judgment was pronounced for the immediate sale of the mortgaged premises and directing possession to be delivered to Hughes and Mackechnie.\nMore than a year after the mortgage the company incurred a debt to the plaintiff, respondent, the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited. The present action was brought by the plaintiff (a) to recover from the company the sum of $817.09 in respect of goods sold to it; (b) to have it declared that the mortgage above mentioned was illegal and ultra vires and a fraud as against the creditors of the company including the plaintiff, and that the consent judgment in the mortgage action brought by appellants was also void.\nOn the 11th of September, 1913, Cordova Mines Limited and Peter Kirkegaard filed a defence to this action. They admitted the debt owing by Cordova Mines Limited to the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited, but denied insolvency and denied that the mortgage was illegal or fraudulent.\nSince the commencement of this action judgment by default was obtained by the respondents, the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited, on the 22nd of September, 1913, for the sum of $817.09 against the mining company, and execution was issued in respect of this debt on the 26th of September, 1913.\nAt the trial Cordova Mines Limited, having changed its solicitors, asked leave to amend its defence, and, after most of the evidence was in, a new defence on the part of Cordova Mines Limited was filed, denying the making of the mortgage, saying that if made it was ultra vires and void, and claiming that it should be set aside.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action. The Appellate Division varied his judgment by declaring the mortgage valid for the amount of the indebtedness of the company at the time it was made and void for the excess. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent, the Northern Electric & Manufacturing Company, suing on behalf of itself and all other creditors, brought this action against the respondent Cordova Mines Limited, the appellants and respondent Kirkegaard to recover from Cordova Mines Limited the amount of $817.09 alleged to be due by it for goods sold and delivered and for an injunction to restrain the appellants and others from selling or offering for sale or dealing with the assets of the Cordova Mines Limited and to set aside a mortgage made by it to appellants. Judgment was recovered by default for the debt sued for against the Cordova Mines Limited, and execution issued thereon pending the progress of that part of the action relative to the setting aside of the mortgage, but upon the trial of the issues raised in respect thereof the action was dismissed except as against the Cordova Mines Limited.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed this judgment and substituted one of which the nature will appear later. The appellants appeal from that here and seek to have the trial judgment restored.\nThe respondents each resist the appeal and seek by way of cross-appeal the full measure of relief sought at the trial.\nIt may be observed that the cross-appeal seems somewhat informal, but no objection has been taken on that account and the parties seem to desire that the question of the validity of the mortgage in question as against the creditors or otherwise, be finally determined.\nThe respondent Kirkegaard and appellant seem to have acquired what was supposed to be a gold mine, and with two others, who were their nominees we are told, got themselves incorporated under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d\nThe supposed gold mine was transferred to the corporate company in consideration of the issue of five hundred thousand dollars of paid-up stock in said company of which appellants were to get, and got, two-thirds and respondent Kirkegaard the other third, saving and excepting the shares necessary to qualify the other two to whom I have referred as their nominees. Practically these three owners of the stock were equal partners in the venture, owed nothing and acted just as if never incorporated, save in having as a company a minute book\u2014now lost\u2014and a bank account in the name of the company.\nWhen money was needed each put up his one-third share thereof and kept on doing so in the development of the mine till the sum of $43,000 was spent.\nThere were no such rich veins struck as to found visions upon to present to the public as no doubt anticipated when getting incorporated. And very humanlike, each had his own plans and fancied if only his methods for future development were adopted they would certainly, if followed, lead on to fortune.\nFailing to agree, proposals were made by each of selling out to the other or other two. These negotiations ended in Kirkegaard agreeing to pay the appellants for their $333,320 of stock, the paltry sum of $60,000, to be secured by a mortgage for that sum on the entire property of the company to be given by the company.\nIn an agreement dated 23rd April, 1912, between appellants of first part, one Joseph Montgomery of the second part and said Kirkegaard of the third part, they put the proposition down in plain black and white as follows:\u2014\n1. The parties of the first part agree to sell to the party of the second part their two-third interest in the stock of the Cordova Mines Limited for the sum of sixty thousand dollars, payable $10,000 on the first day of August, 1912, and $10,000 every two months thereafter until fully paid, payment to be secured by a first mortgage on the property of the said Cordova Mines Limited payable as aforesaid with power of sale in usual form, but no personal covenant by the party of the second part.\n2. The said parties further agree to deliver to second party on execution of said mortgage all their stock in said company. Montgomery was but the trustee to take delivery of and to hold the stock thus purchased till such time as Kirkegaard had a chance to turn round and so develop the mine according to his plans as might enable him to pay the cash payment.\nBy other clauses in this agreement he bound himself to assume all the expenses of doing so and to do it in proper miner-like fashion and\nthat the proceeds of all ore mined during the period of payment as aforesaid, over and above what is used in actual mining expenses, shall be applied on payment of purchase price until fully paid.\nHaving executed this agreement personally, Kirkegaard went to California.\nHe testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. Had you any negotiations with the mortgagees after the signing of the agreement that is mentioned here?\nA. No, that closed the negotiations at the time.\nQ. Then the mortgage was prepared and executed without your privity in any way?\nA. Without my presence, yes.\nQ. Now, Mr. Kirkegaard there were three shareholders in this company other than the nominal shareholders?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Prior to the agreement that we call the Montgomery agreement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. These three shareholders were yourself and Dr. Mackechnie and Mr. Hughes?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The two defendants and yourself, and you were the President of the company?\nA. I was.\nIn his absence Montgomery, who seems to have represented him, entered, on the 30th of April, 1912, into an agreement in writing with appellants, in which former was called the purchaser and latter the vendors. Leaving out the formal parts, the following is a copy:\u2014 Whereas the vendors are the owners of two-thirds of the stock of Cordova Mines Limited, and the parties hereto are desirous of making an agreement in relation to the sale and purchase of the said interests.\nNow it is mutually agreed by and between the purchaser and vendors and their and each of their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns as follows:\u2014\n(1) The vendors do this day transfer to the purchaser all their stock in the Cordova Mines Limited, to be held by the said purchaser intact until the first day of August, 1912, or until the sum of ten thousand dollars has been paid by the Cordova Mines Limited upon its mortgage to the vendors, bearing even date herewith.\n(2) The purchaser shall have the power to transfer shares so sufficiently to form a qualified board of directors, which stock shall be reassigned in case of failure to pay the sum aforesaid.\n(3) The purchaser is to provide for the proper working of the mines in a miner-like manner of the Cordova Mines Limited, situate in the Townships of Belmont and Marmora and more particularly described in the said mortgage, the understanding being between the parties hereto that at least three thousand dollars per month shall be expended in the development of the said mines.\n(4) This agreement shall not supersede the agreement made on the twenty-third day of April, 1912, but shall be in addition thereto.\n(5) The purchaser hereby covenants with the vendors that all costs, expenses, charges and accounts made by the Cordova Mines Limited from the first day of May to the first day of August, 1912, up to such further time as the said ten thousand dollars is paid, will be paid for by him and his associates and shall not be a lien or charge upon any of the property of the said Cordova Mines Limited.\nIt appears, from minutes put in evidence, that same day a meeting of the directors was held at the office of Peter Kirkegaard, Toronto, with appellant Hughes (in chair), Vice-President and W.C. Mackechnie, Mr. J.F. Wills and Montgomery acting as secretary of the meeting.\nA waiver of notice of this meeting was filed by attorney Joseph Montgomery, Mr. Kirkegaard being absent in California. The remainder of the minute is as follows:\u2014\nStatement of outstanding liabilities of the company as of May 1st amounting to $ , subject to correction, was put in by the Secretary, which pursuant to agreement is to be paid in equal shares by the three parties, Peter Kirkegaard, W. Hughes, and W.G. Mackechnie.\nAgreement dated 23rd day of April, A.D. 1912, was produced providing for transfer of stock held by W. Hughes and W.G. Mackechnie to Joseph Montgomery subject to the condition of the company giving a mortgage to secure payment.\nIt was explained to the meeting that all moneys required by the company for expenses had heretofore been advanced by the three directors equally, and Messrs. Hughes and Mackechnie did not now desire to continue making advances, but were willing to dispose of their stock to other parties who were willing to continue advances provided the company would agree to guarantee the payment of the purchase price by a mortgage on the company\u2019s property and it was considered advisable in the interests of the company that this should be done provided all shareholders consented thereto.\nOn motion a by-law authorizing the giving of the mortgage was duly considered and passed.\nOn motion the transfer of the stock of William Graem Mackechnie and William Hughes to Joseph Montgomery of $333,320 is hereby authorized and accepted.\nOn motion the transfer of one share by C.A. Bleecker to W.R. Williams, and one share from J.F. Wills to H.P. Edge was authorized and accepted.\nThe mortgage thus provided for between Cordova Mines Limited and appellants dated same day is executed accordingly by Joseph Montgomery, Vice-President, and Wm. R. Williams, secretary, and sealed in presence of Mr. Wills.\nThe question raised herein is whether or not such a transaction can stand?\nI rather think no one pretends that in the bare nakedness of the transaction as thus expressed in these documents and this minute, that its result would be a valid enforceable mortgage.\nHowever that may be, those who, in varying shades of meaning given it, have seen their way to support it either in whole or in part rely upon something out- side of the sale of the stock to help so to support it as to defeat the creditors.\nThe respondent Kirkegaard was asked by counsel for appellant and answered thus:\u2014\nQ. Was it part of the arrangement between you and them that all these outstanding accounts should be wiped out?\nA. Yes.\nThis is spoken of the outstanding liabilities possibly $5,000, and the purpose of each of the three parties so contributing thereto was that when closed out each would have paid an equal share of the expenses up to the date of this mortgage estimated at $43,000. In that sense the $43,000 is spoken of as being wiped out. But how far does that carry us or support the mortgage? It is clear as noonday that these three men had been proceeding upon the basis, from the beginning, that the mine belonged to the three, who put in equal shares of all the expenditure in regard to it.\nThe company as such never borrowed any money from them, never had agreed to return them any money. The contributions thus given could not in law have been recalled and in fact had been poured into a worthless hole, or one that had proved so up to then.\nIt was no use to have kept up any kind of form of contract for the return of such moneys. That absurdity, whatever else they did, they spared themselves. If the hole in the ground proved unproductive the property was worthless. If it ever became productive and thus valuable, the market value of the stock would respond accordingly and recoup, in whole or in part or even with a profit, the moneys advanced. It was only thus and through such a channel that appellants ever expected to be repaid. And if not so repaid it was just so much money gone over which it would be foolish to cry.\nHence, when the mortgage was given and the above agreement entered into we do not find a word about releasing any claims for advances, not even the form of passing a receipt. It never entered the head of any one so concerned that they were creating a mortgage to secure such advances. In June following the entries in the company\u2019s books of contributions by appellants were squared off by an entry of some kind for which no authority was given. How does that avail?\nThey were creating a mortgage to secure the price of the sale of stock from two shareholders to another and nothing else. And that was a thing that the company as such had no legal capacity or power in any way to enter into or give. In any way you turn it round and try to make it work out, the transaction is tainted with attempting to do that which was an illegality. I use the word illegality with due fear of the well-founded observations of Lord Cairns in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[2], before my eyes. And for this reason that when you try to give vitality to the transaction and make it operative by mixing up the advances and what relates thereto with the consideration which was present to the minds of the parties whose agreement was to he carried out you blend two things (one possibly proper with one obviously improper) in one total consideration in such a way as to render it necessary to inquire whether or not you can sever that which may be good from that which is bad. You cannot, I submit with great respect, make of these two things, the past advance of money to im- prove the property and the sale of stock by two shareholders to another, a single united consideration to support this mortgage, for the ultra vires part thereof or element therein, is in such a connection illegal and taints the whole and thus renders the mortgage void.\nI recognize to the full the difficulty of drawing the line where that which is merely ultra vires is to be treated merely as an illegality so tainting a transaction as to render it worthless for every purpose and that where other considerations may be extended to those entering into an ultra vires transaction may be the basis of some legal right springing therefrom which would not be permitted as basis therefor to be extended to those who had in entering into a transaction thereby committed a crime.\nThe field of such an inquiry is a wide one and needless to enter upon here. For as I conceive the facts here to exist the importation of the old advances into the consideration for this mortgage is something the parties never had in mind, and the transaction such that nothing could in law rest thereon.\nIndeed, their economic conceptions of what they were about were too clear headed, it seems to me, to permit of such a mixing up of two things that could not form, either in law or in fact, a single consideration. The advances had made the stock possibly worth something. There is that relation of cause and effect between them.\nBut when we are asked to hold that the advances formed a part of the consideration and at same time that the stock value they in part created is to be taken as the consideration also, I submit this is a doubling up of consideration that cannot be listened to and I repeat was not at all in the contemplation of the parties.\nFor these reasons I, with great respect, cannot assent to the ground taken and the results reached by the learned trial judge.\nThe same reasons together with what I am about to repeat forbid me supporting the judgment of the court appealed from. A majority of that court agrees that the transaction so far as founded on the sale of stock is void, but seems in some way to reach the conclusion that it can be supported as to the advances.\nIt is to my mind impossible on such assumption of fact to sever the two considerations and say how far either is to be given effect to. The court first assumes the parties acted or were moved by considerations, which in fact did not move them, and seeks to sever these and give due value to each thereof. Thus it is what the court thinks is to be assigned as such values and not what the parties thought or expressed that the court directs a reference to ascertain.\nThe parties fixed $60,000 as the value of the appellants\u2019 share of the stock after the advances had been made. How much of that value rests upon the original acquisition of the land? How much upon the advances? How much upon the speculative value? How much of that again upon the assurance of Kirkegaard or Montgomery, or both, that so much would be expended in development?\nOr to put it another way, the appellants had put aside their own views to meet those of Kirkegaard and surrendered their chances of success for a price fixed at $60,000. How can any court say what proportionate part thereof is to be attributed to these advances, when the parties have neither directly nor indirectly done or said anything whereby the court can sever anything of the manifold considerations moving them, and take an account thereof?\nAs illustrative of the whole confusion of thought which has prevailed I most respectfully submit, involved in approaching the matter from the point of view taken below, counsel arguing before us, who usually express themselves clearly, seemed throughout to assume either $60,000 or $43,000 to be the basic value secured by this mortgage.\nIt is easy to understand the $60,000 sum being put forward. But why the $43,000 can be put forward I am at a loss to understand, not only for the numerous considerations already adverted to, but also for the further reason that it was only two-thirds of this sum that appellants advanced, and they got repaid $19,000, on account of the mortgage debt.\nSurely if the true and lawful consideration is to be fixed, the proper way is to allow thereon credit for that which has been paid, and not to attribute it to that which on this theory of the mortgage could have no existence. And to crown the whole of what I respectfully submit is an absurd result the two appellants are to be secured their advances and Kirkegaard who had advanced an equal share and ventured on new risks is left unprotected for his advances. Certainly whatever was had in view such a result never was contemplated by any one of those concerned. That result is clearly involved in the departure made by the court from what the parties have so clearly expressed to have been their purpose. Making a bargain for people which they never made or intended is always a rather hazardous proceeding; even when trying to do justice.\nI need not dwell longer on what seems, I submit with great respect, an attempt to uphold in order to do a supposed justice between certain parties, what will, if upheld, defeat the creditors who have given what is of value to the whole concern and made it worth fighting about and is to benefit only those who have not made it thus valuable.\nI submit the better way is to let the mortgage be taken for what those creating it intended and said, in no uncertain language.\nSo taken it falls within what the doctrine declared and held by the judgment in Trevor v. Whit-worth[3], could not be done by such a company.\nThe decisions in the cases of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[4], and Mann and Beattie v. Edinburgh Northern Tramways Co.[5], exemplify in a wider sense what may be ultra vires a corporate company.\nThere is no power pointed to in the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d which would enable by any reasonable construction thereof such a power as asserted here to be exercised by the company.\nWhen the cardinal purpose of the transaction so offends against the limits of the powers given the company it matters not to refer to the incidentals relative to such a purpose being such as might give some scope to the operation of the powers of the company.\nKirkegaard, with whom the contract was made upon which the mortgage is founded, did not bind himself to do anything, but his partners bound themselves not to interfere with his executing his plans and purposes so long as he paid the expenses thereof and did not bring the company under any obligation and accounted for the profits of such proceedings in way of development.\nThe Montgomery agreement did no more than supplement and was not to supersede the purpose of that which appellants and Kirkegaard had entered into.\nMontgomery was not called and how he came to bind himself, as in last part of his agreement, is not explained. Certainly Kirkegaard in California or on his way there could not have so stipulated or been party to the arrangement it expresses, I do not, therefore, see how it can affect the matter.\nThe matters involved in the transactions in question herein present what was done in the least offensive sense possible as there were no other shareholders and creditors, for then existing liabilities were to be taken care of.\nBut the doctrine that the majority of the shareholders in any company can if they choose sell, to any one, their shares and obtain by virtue of their voting power a first mortgage on the whole undertaking for the price of such sale of shares, is rather novel and startling. Yet it seems such is the possible logical outcome of maintaining the proposition appellants contend for. I think such a contention should fail.\nThen it is contended, that even so, the respondent the company suing on behalf of itself and all other creditors cannot impeach the transaction.\nIn the first place it is said that the company had no judgment or execution when instituting these proceedings.\nThe case of Neate v. The Duke of Marlborough[6], and such like cases were taken as upholding that position and they stand for what they decided. But the cases of Reese River Silver Mining Co. v. Atwell[7], following Goldsmith v. Russell[8], pointed out that such objection could not prevail where the creditor sued on behalf of himself and all other creditors.\nThen the case of Longeway v. Mitchell[9], decided by the late Vice-Chancellor Strong, afterwards Chief Justice of this Court, no mean authority on such a subject, followed that line of cases and in doing so made some observations on page 194, to which I would refer as justifying the position I am about to take relative to the jurisdiction of the court to set aside as against creditors even if not a transaction expressly within the Statutes of Elizabeth.\nAssuming the mortgage in question is to be treated under the Statute of Elizabeth merely as a voluntary conveyance and void as against creditors, it is alleged there are no creditors antecedent to the creation of the mortgage, and where absolute good faith exists, as found here by the learned trial judge, in such a case later creditors, it may be said, cannot impeach the transaction.\nCounsel for respondent seemed to allege that there are antecedent creditors yet unpaid, and the counsel for the appellants suggested that there are no such creditors. I cannot find it clearly proven either way. The intention to have such creditors paid was proven. But is the conveyance to be treated as a voluntary conveyance has been? I think not.\nIt is a deed which is absolutely void and is not merely like the voluntary or fraudulent conveyance which stands good till set aside.\nIn some way I am quite unable to appreciate the jurisdiction to deal with such a void deed is doubted. If we have regard to the jurisdiction of the courts of equity, for example, over that wide and varied field which for want of a better term has been called constructive fraud, and over injunctions and all other auxiliary grounds of the jurisdiction which such courts have long taken and asserted relative to proceedings in a court of common law in order that justice may be done, the rights of suitors preserved and property held for the benefit of creditors, so that it may not be by fraud or evil practice of any kind removed beyond the reach of creditors, I see no difficulty in the way of the creditor suing here.\nIt is quite clear that the facts here demand the exercise of some such jurisdiction. The appellants as mortgagees took proceedings on the mortgage and got judgment and intended to proceed to sell the property under this void mortgage.\nThe creditor suing herein got an interim injunction and is entitled, if successful, to have that made permanent. Strangely enough it asks for it in the writ, but omitted specifically to pray for it in the statement of claim, but is entitled thereto, I assume, under the general prayer for other relief, though in days gone by a specific prayer might have been exacted.\nIn any event for my present purpose that is only illustrative of what remedies are needed and what has been got in part. For no point is made of it in argument.\nBut why, as has been suggested, should the creditor be restricted to the cases of fraudulent conveyances for the exercise of such a jurisdiction? Is it because that is the most familiar in practice? In light of such possible suggestion it is rather curious to find as we do in Story on Equity when adverting to such assignments the following:\u2014\n377. These cases of interposition in favour of creditors being founded upon the provisions of positive statutes, a question was made at an early day whether they were exclusively cognizable at law, or could they be carried into effect also in equity. The jurisdiction of courts of equity is now firmly established, for it extends to cases of fraud, whether provided against by statute or not. And, indeed, the remedial justice of a court of equity in many cases arising under these statutes, is the only effectual one which can be administered; as that of courts of law must often fail from the want of adequate powers to reach or redress the mischief.\nOf course it is a long time since the power of the Court of Equity was questioned in that regard, but it is very curious now to find in the existence of that jurisdiction, which exists only as a branch of and by virtue of the application of principles of equity jurisprudence asserting a much wider and more comprehensive jurisdiction, a reason for the non-application of the latter.\nI have no doubt of the jurisdiction and no doubt of the right of the creditor seeking herein to invoke it and claim that the mortgage being void must be so declared and appellants restrained from using said mortgage as an impediment to the creditors asserting their rights. Whatever equities may arise as between the original partners, arising either out of the implications in the agreement between them or the covenant of Montgomery, not a party hereto, cannot affect the other creditors of the company, and must abide by future independent litigation or in course of liquidation should the company be wound up.\nThe judgment got upon the mortgage can stand on no higher ground than the mortgage itself. The judgment in the case of the Great North-West Central Railway Co. v. Charlebois[10], is authority for such a proposition if authority be necessary.\nIt does not in the view I have taken seem necessary to dwell upon many other things argued, and especially as to the attitude of the Cordova Mines Co.\nI may refer to the case of Re Pooley Hall Colliery Co.[11], where a single creditor got a summons to have it declared that certain holders of debentures in excess of what the company had power to issue, should not have the priority which the debentures, if good, would have given and that was made absolute, yet the holders entitled to rank as creditors but only in pari passu with others.\nIndeed, the case of Trevor v. Whitworth[12], cited above for another purpose is on same line.\nThe Southampton Boat Co. v. Pinnock[13], may be looked at as another mode of treating the right to impeach an ultra vires mortgage.\nIn conclusion I think the appeal should be dismissed\u2014the cross-appeal allowed with costs throughout and the declaration made as prayed for and injunction granted with such references as needed to work out the result. The equities I have referred to as possibly existing between appellants and Kirkegaard should not be interfered with or taken as determined by this suit.\nDUFF. J.\u2014The appellants, Hughes and Mackechnie, and the respondent, Kirkegaard, were the owners of a mining property in the Township of Belmont, which they transferred to Cordova Mines Limited (a company they had incorporated for the purpose of acquiring the property) in consideration of the issue to themselves and their nominees of all the authorized capital stock of the company fully paid.\nCordova Mines Limited having issued all its capital stock in payment for the mine, it was necessary that money should be borrowed to carry on operations. These operations were extensive and were made possible by loans to the company from Hughes, Mackechnie and Kirkegaard in equal shares. In April, 1912, Cordova Mines Limited was indebted to Hughes, Mackechnie and Kirkegaard in respect of these loans, including moneys then advanced to the extent of over $43,000.\nAt this time Hughes, Mackechnie and Kirkegaard had drifted apart in their ideas as to the policy to be adopted in carrying on the company\u2019s affairs. Hughes and Mackechnie were on one side, Kirkegaard on the other. None of them was willing to advance more money unless his policy was adopted. A deadlock ensued. This deadlock was finally broken and the continuance of operations secured by an arrangement whereby Hughes and Mackechnie sold their shares to Montgomery, who was Kirkegaard\u2019s solicitor and trustee, for $60,000, payment of this amount to be secured by a mortgage from the company to Hughes and Mackechnie on the mine. Kirkegaard was to provide for the proper operation of the mine and to spend at least $3,000 per month in its development.\nThe form in which this arrangement was expressed and carried out consists of (1) an agreement between Hughes and Mackechnie of the first part, Joseph Montgomery, trustee, of the second part, and Peter Kirkegaard of the third part, dated 23rd April, 1912; (2) a supplemental agreement between Hughes and Mackechnie of the first part and Joseph Montgomery of the second part, dated 30th April, 1912; and (3) a mortgage from Cordova Mines Limited to Hughes and Mackechnie, dated 30th April, 1912.\nThe substance of the arrangement, so far as it affected the company, was set out and embodied in a minute of its directors held on the 30th April, 1912, as follows:\u2014\nIt was explained to the meeting that all moneys required by the company for expenses had heretofore been advanced by the three directors equally, and Messrs. Hughes and Mackechnie did not now desire to continue making advances, but were willing to dispose of their stock to other parties who were willing to guarantee the payment of the purchase price by a mortgage on the company\u2019s property, and it was considered advisable in the interests of the company that this should be done provided all shareholders consented thereto.\nAll the shareholders of the company concurred in this arrangement.\nIt was part of the agreement that the sum of $43,000 owing by the company was to be wiped out. All the debts owing by the company at the time of the arrangement were paid, and it was not contemplated that any further debts should be incurred. On the contrary, it was expressly provided that until the first payment had been made on the mortgage all costs and expenses should be paid by Montgomery and his associates so as not to become a lien or charge on the company\u2019s property.\nThe result of the transaction was to free the company from its overdue debt of $43,000, and to obtain for it the new advances necessary for carrying on its operations and improving its property.\nHughes and Mackechnie, in pursuance of the agreement, transferred their shares to Montgomery, Kirkegaard\u2019s solicitor and trustee, and Kirkegaard proceeded to operate the mine and advanced to the company large sums of money for that purpose. He and others associated with him made payments on account of the purchase money on the shares amounting to $19,000 or thereabouts to Hughes and Mackechnie. Thereafter the mortgage having fallen into arrear Hughes and Mackechnie, the appellants, brought proceedings against Cordova Mines Limited on the mortgage and on the 30th of April, 1913, upon consent of the company, judgment was pronounced for the immediate sale of the mortgaged premises and directing possession to be delivered to Hughes and Mackechnie.\nMore than a year after the mortgage, the company incurred a debt to the plaintiff, respondent, the Northern Electric & Manufacturing Company Limited. The present action was brought by the plaintiff, respondent (a) to recover from the company the sum of $817.09 in respect of goods sold to it; (b) to have it declared that the mortgage above mentioned was illegal and ultra vires and a fraud as against the creditors of the company including the plaintiff, respondent, and that the consent judgment in the mortgage action brought by appelants was also void. On the 11th of September, 1913, Cordova Mines Limited and Peter Kirkegaard filed a defence to this action. They admitted the debt owing by Cordova Mines Limited to the Northern Electric & Manufacturing Company Limited, but denied insolvency and denied that the mortgage was illegal or fraudulent.\nSince the commencement of this action judgment by default was obtained by the respondents, the Northern Electric & Manufacturing Company Limited, on the 22nd of September, 1913, for the sum of $817.09 against the mining company and execution was issued in respect of this debt on the 26th of September, 1913.\nAt the trial Cordova Mines Limited, having changed its solicitors, asked leave to amend its defence, and, after most of the evidence was in, a new defence on the part of Cordova Mines Limited was filed, denying the making of the mortgage, saying that if made it was ultra vires and void, and claiming that it should be set aside.\nMr. Justice Middleton delivered judgment dismissing the action as against all the defendants (other than the defendant, Cordova Mines Limited, against whom judgment had already been entered as stated above for $817.09) and declaring that the mortgage in question was a good and valid mortgage, and ordering the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants (other than the defendant, Cordova Mines Limited), their costs.\nThe plaintiffs, the Northern Electric & Manufacturing Company, Limited, appealed to the Appellate Division; Cordova Mines Limited did not serve any notice of appeal, but counsel for it appeared on the argument.\nThe Appellate Division on the 6th of April, 1914, allowed the appeal in part, declaring that the mortgage was ultra vires to the extent that it exceeded the liabilities of the Cordova Mines Limited cancelled by the arrangement made at the time the mortgage was given, but valid to the extent of such liabilities.\nIt is no longer seriously argued that the mortgage is impeachable as in fraud of creditors.\nI have not been able to discover any solid ground upon which the plaintiff obtains a locus standi to attack a transaction as ultra vires which was entered into a year before he became a creditor of the company. Another question ought to be disposed of in limine which is suggested by the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell. It is the question whether the judgment of the second Appellate Division ought not to be reversed and the action dismissed on the ground that it was not competent for Mr. Justice Middleton to amend the pleadings in such a way as to permit the company being a party defendant only to attack the mortgage as ultra vires. I do not think it is necessary to pass upon the question whether or not on a proper construction of the Ontario \u201cJudicature Act\u201d and the Consolidated Rules the learned trial judge had power to make the order he did make. I do not think that question arises. The learned trial judge exercising such of the powers of the Supreme Court of Judicature for Ontario as were vested in him as trial judge had, unquestionably, power and authority to hear and pass upon an application by one of the parties for leave to make such an amendment and as necessarily involved therein to adjudicate upon the question whether or not the authority conferred upon him by the Consolidated Rules was broad enough to enable him to make such an order. It seems to be quite clear that he did pass upon that question, that he held authority to be vested in him to grant the amendment and to adjudicate upon the issue raised by the amendment as trial judge. It seems obvious enough that neither the learned trial judge nor any of the counsel present supposed that he was trying the issue as arbitrator or in a proceeding ex vi\u00e2 or ultra vires or in any manner contrary to the course of the court. It may be added that the learned trial judge having tried the issue and pronounced judgment upon it, it seems self-evident that this judgment necessarily involved an adjudication to the effect that he had jurisdiction to pronounce it, an adjudication which as that of a judge exercising the authority of a Superior Court of general jurisdiction to decide upon the scope of its own jurisdiction is binding upon the parties until reversed on appeal. The judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton was not challenged, as I understand it, in the court of appeal by either of the parties on the ground that he had not jurisdiction to pronounce it, and having regard to what took place at the trial I do not think it would have been open to either of them to raise that question. For the same reason I think the point is not open here; and it may be added indeed that the question was not raised by either of the parties in this court.\nAs to the merits. It is, of course, not contended that the mortgaging of its property for the purpose of securing the payment of the purchase price of shares bought by one of its shareholders for his own benefit would in itself, special circumstances apart, be within the powers of this company; but the broad common sense of the matter seems to be that the company being overwhelmed with debts, the shareholders being involved in disagreements, making effective adminis- tration impossible, and the plan which was proposed and carried out promising an escape from these difficulties and prosperity for the company\u2019s undertaking as against ruin otherwise certain, the transaction ought not to be regarded as outside a reasonable application of the doctrine of ultra vires merely because it involved as one of its incidents as part of the consideration moving to one of the shareholders for services in procuring payment of the company\u2019s debts and further advances to enable it to carry on its business a guarantee or payment of a limited part of the purchase price of shares in the company, the purchase of which was of the very essence of the plan decided upon. The two points to be considered in every such question are, first, is the power to enter into the challenged transaction, if not expressly given, prim\u00e2 facie vested in the company by implication as being reasonably necessary to enable the company to carry on its authorized undertaking? And secondly, if notwithstanding it is prim\u00e2 facie given by implication from necessity is it the proper inference from all the instruments defining the company\u2019s objects and powers and prescribing the regulations for the conduct of its business that such a power has been denied? On the first question, Lord Blackburn\u2019s observation in Mackay v. Dick[14], to the effect that in business \u201cimpossible\u201d and \u201cimpracticable\u201d are convertible terms should be borne in mind. \u201cNecessary\u201d here means necessary in the business sense. I think the observation of Lord Macnaghten in Parkdale Corporation v. West[15], quoted in Mr. Shepley\u2019s factum, are pertinent; and I think a case of necessity in this sense has been abundantly established. As to the second point, our attention has not been called to any provision of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d expressly forbidding such a transaction and I do not think any argument has been advanced which goes very far to establish ground for implying such a prohibition. It seems to have been assumed in the court below that the transaction is by analogy to be treated as governed by the rule (judicially established) which incapacitates a company from purchasing its own shares in the absence of authority expressly given. With great respect, I am unable to discover the analogy.\nThere is another ground, however, upon which, in my judgment, the attack fails. As mentioned above the company was at the time of the transaction indebted to the three persons interested in the sum of $43,000. It was admittedly a part of the arrangement that this debt was to be wiped out or merged in the mortgage debt and I think it is clear that such was the effect of the transaction. It would, of course, have been within the power of the company in the circumstances existing to have procured the discharge of its liabilities by a lender at the price of $60,000 and to have given a mortgage to secure this sum. If the transaction had taken that form with the consent of all the shareholders and parties interested it would have been unimpeachable. Again, the transaction might have taken the form of a mortgage securing the payment of $43,000 to the mortgagees the amount of the company\u2019s liabilities discharged and of a further sum of $17,000 for the benefit of the purchaser as in part payment of the purchase price of shares. If it had taken this latter form nobody would have thought of disputing the validity of the mortgage as a security for the sum of $43,000; and I understand the majority of the court of appeal to have held that to the extent to which liabilities of the company were in fact discharged by the parties to the arrangement, the mortgage ought to be treated as a valid security. Now it appears to me to be indisputable that as the transaction could have been expressed in such a form as to make it unimpeachable as a security for $43,000, that is to say, as the transaction in its substance was to that extent intra vires and inexpugnable, any objection based upon the form of it must have been curable by a subsequent agreement between the parties declaring that the mortgage should stand as security for this sum of $43,000. In fact as mentioned above, the sum of $19,000 has been paid by Kirkegaard and had been paid by him at the date when judgment was recovered against the company in the foreclosure action. It appears to me to follow that the judgment in the foreclosure action must be held to have precisely the effect of an agreement such as I have suggested. The decision of the Judicial Committee in Great North-Western Central Railway Co. v. Charlebois[16] appears to be beside the point. In the transactions which came into question in that case the persons having control of the company sought by a consent judgment to impart legal authority to arrangements which in their essence were of such a character that the company had no power to enter into them. The impeached transactions had been made to assume a form in which on the surface they appeared to be within the powers of the company. The consent judgment was only the final step in the scheme which from its commencement was never anything else but a fraud upon the company\u2019s powers. Their Lordships held that the judgment being a consent judgment could take no higher validity than the ultra vires agreement upon which it was based.\nThe principle of that decision can, I conceive, have no application to this case where the transaction to which the judgment gives effect is in so far as effect is given to it by the judgment unimpeachable in substance; and for the short reason that it was not beyond the powers of the company but within the powers of the company by a valid agreement to disembarrass the transaction of the objectionable features which concerned the form of it alone and to giving legal and binding effect to the substance of it.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts of this case are stated in the judgments delivered by the learned trial judge and the learned judges of the Appellate Division, reported in 31 Ont. L.R. p. 221.\nApart from the serious difficulties in the way of the plaintiff as to parties and procedure, discussed in the opinion of Mr. Justice Riddell, but upon which I understand counsel for the appellants do not desire that the action should be disposed of, I am of the opinion that, when the substance of the impugned transaction is considered rather than the form which it took, the attack made upon it should not succeed. There is no suggestion that it was in any sense fraudulent. The intention of all the parties to it was to do what appeared to be in the best interest of the company\u2014in fact the only thing which would save it from immediate ruin and dissolution. Its stock had been fully issued. It had not a dollar with which to carry on its undertaking and it owed the three directors and shareholders, Hughes, Mackechnie and Kirkegaard, $43,000 for advances made by them. By the arrangement in question its existing creditors were provided for and the scheme contemplated that the company should not become liable for any new debts and that further advances should be made to it for development purposes and to enable it to continue its operations.\nBut it is said that the giving by the company of a mortgage upon its assets to secure the payment of the purchase price ($60,000) of the shares of its stock acquired from the mortgagees, Hughes and Mackechnie, by Kirkegaard, who thus became in reality the sole shareholder\u2014certain qualifying shares being held by his nominees\u2014was ultra vires. If this were the substance of the transaction it could not be supported. But, in substance, though not in form, the company, in consideration of giving the mortgage, secured a release of the debt of $43,000, which it owed in equal shares to the two mortgagees and Kirkegaard. It also obtained in fact, though not in a form which would entitle it to sue upon it, the benefit of an agreement by which Kirkegaard undertook with the mortgagees to make advances to the extent of $3,000 a month for the development of the company\u2019s property and the carrying on of its operations. Under this agreement, Kirkegaard, who is now hostile to the mortgagees and the instigator of this litigation, swears that he actually advanced to the company upwards of $60,000; and, on this point, there is no reason to doubt his word.\nIn the trial court the mortgage was held valid and the action dismissed. In the Appellate Division it was held good to the extent to which it represented the company\u2019s indebtedness, but void as to the balance; and an account was directed as to any payments made to the mortgagees out of the company\u2019s funds, by which it was directed that the $43,000 representing such indebtedness should be reduced, the mortgage to stand as security for the balance only.\nPayments have already been made on account of the mortgage, the learned trial judge finds \u201cnot by the company but by Kirkegaard and his associates,\u201d to the extent of $19,000. Kirkegaard himself swears to this fact and tells of $18,000 borrowed by him from one Nelson and $2,000 from one Johnson. Here again there is no reason to discredit his testimony. It would certainly have been better had there been a formal assignment by Kirkegaard to Hughes and Mackechnie of his interest in the $43,000 claim against the company and a formal release to the company of that entire claim. There can be no doubt, however, on Kirkegaard\u2019s evidence, that Mackechnie and Hughes in fact acquired his interest and that the company\u2019s debt of $43,000 was extinguished by the arrangement made; and that is assumed by the judgment in appeal. While the agreement by Kirkegaard for future advances should have been with the company and not with Hughes and Mackechnie, they had the same interest as the company in having those advances made and they were in fact made to the company to the extent of $60,000. Had the mortgage ex facie been given in consideration of the release of the company\u2019s debt of $43,000 and of a covenant by Kirkegaard with the company to advance to it $3,000 per month up to the amount of $17,000, it would clearly be intra vires and the advisability of giving it would have been a question for the directors or, at the highest, for the whole body of the shareholders. Subsequent creditors not then in contemplation would certainly have no status to attack it. That in substance, though not in form, was the real transaction. The shareholders authorized it and the company has had the full benefit of it. With the transfer of shares from Hughes and Mackechnie to Kirkegaard and the securing of the purchase price the company is not concerned.\nWhile in form the case at bar may bear some resemblance to Trevor v. Whitworth[17], and Great North Western Central Railway Co. v. Charlebois[18], cited by Mr. Justice Clute, in substance the facts dealt with in those authorities differ toto c\u0153lo from those now before us. In Trevor v. Whitworth17 the claim against the company was by a shareholder for the balance of the purchase price of shares sold by him to it. This dealing in its own shares was held to be ultra vires of the company. In the Charlebois Case18, the company had been made to give a mortgage of \u00a3200,000 for a consideration of only $50,000. Here the defendant company has had the full $60,000 for which it gave the mortgage and nearly $50,000 more as the direct outcome of the impeached transaction.\nI think the judgment of the learned trial judge was right. It should not have been disturbed and should now be restored; and the appellants should have their costs in this court and the Appellate Division.

With regard to obtaining materials for the construction of railways, the effect of sub-section 2 of Section 180 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37, merely requires the general provisions of the Act relating to the using and taking of lands to be observed in so far as they are appropriate to the expropriation of the lands and settling the compensation to be paid therefor; section 192 of the Act has no application to such a case. Notices were given, in compliance with sections 180, 193 and 194 of the \"Railway Act,\" and, before any change had taken place in respect to the value of the lands to be taken, the railway company obtained an order of a judge permitting it to do so and took possession of the lands in question.\nHeld, that the title of the company to the lands, when consummated, must be considered as relating back to the date when possession was taken and that the compensation payable therefor should be ascertained with reference to that time.\nJudgment appealed from (6 Alta. L.K. 471) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], dismissing an appeal from an award of arbitrators appointed under the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37, to ascertain the amount of the compensation payable by the railway company upon the expropriation of lands for railway purposes.\nIn June, 1908, the Saskatchewan Land and Homestead Company and certain other persons were interested in lands in the Province of Alberta which were required by the railway company for the purposes of obtaining stone, gravel, earth, sand, water and other material to be used in the construction and operation of the railway. Notices were served upon the parties interested in the lands by the railway company, under the provisions of sections 180, 193, and 194 of the \"Railway Act.\" Shortly afterwards, the company obtained an order from a judge for immediate possession of the lands, under section 217 of the Act (upon depositing $1,150), and, thereupon, it entered into possession of the property. The parties were unable to agree as to the amount of compensation to be paid for the taking and using of the lands, but arbitrators were not appointed until the year 1912 and the arbitration did not take place until the month of September of that year. Attached to the notice to treat was a certificate by a land surveyor, as required by section 194 of the Act, fixing the value of the property and the compensation to be offered at $733.05, and, in making their award, the majority of the arbitrators adopted that amount as the proper compensation payable by the railway company. On an appeal from the award to the Supreme Court of Alberta, the decision of the arbitrators was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nWhiting K.C. and A. B. Cunningham for the appellants.\nThe court and the arbitrators erred in fixing the amount of the compensation at $733.05; in finding that the date with reference to which compensation or damages should be ascertained was the date of the order for immediate possession, viz., 24th July, 1908, and in making no allowance for the value of the land for gravel purposes.\nWe rely upon the following authorities:\u2014\nVezina v. The Queen[2]; Trent-Stoughton v. Barbadoes Water Supply Co.[3]; Ripley v. Great Northern Railway Co.[4]; In re Gough and Aspatria. Silloth and District Joint Water Board[5]; Bailey v. Isle of Thanet Light Railways Co.[6]; In re Tyneworth and the Duke of Northumberland[7]; Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[8].\nThe actual value in 1912 is the proper measure of the prospective value in 1908. Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries v. Pontypridd Waterworks Co.[9]. The burden is not imposed upon a person whose land is taken from him against his will of proving by costly experiments the mineral contents of his land as a condition precedent to obtaining compensation. Brown v. Commissioner for Railways[10]. The land owner is entitled to more than an ordinary vendor, because he is a vendor who is compelled to sell. The Queen v. Essex[11], at page 451.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the respondents. The respondents, by their conduct, are estopped from making any claim for extraordinary damages; they consented to possession being taken, on the deposit of $1,150 by the railway company, which then proceeded to make use of the material and it was not until several years afterwards that the owners first suggested any extraordinary value; this claim was not based upon the value at the time of the consent, but upon a value alleged to have been acquired by the property long after the removal of the material.\nSection 192, with regard to the date by reference to which the value of lands is to be ascertained in the case or arbitrations, can by no possibility have any application to arbitrations with regard to lands taken under section 180. Section 192 depends for its operation upon there being a necessity to deposit a plan with the registrar of deeds, and there is no provision authorizing the registrar to receive any plan not certified by the Board of Railway Commissioners. As section 180 expressly relieves the railway company from the necessity of obtaining any approval of a plan required under that section, there is no way in which any plan can be deposited with the registrar of deeds so as to make section 192 apply.\nThe rule adopted under the English \"Lands Clauses Consolidation Act,\" 1845, must be resorted to, viz., that the value is to be ascertained as of the date upon which the notice to treat is given. Hudson on Compensation, vol. 1, p. 161; Penny v. Penny [12]; Tyson v. Mayor of London[13]. Possession having been taken with the consent of the owners, the railway company must be deemed to have become equitably entitled to the lands when they entered into possession, subject to the ascertainment of the proper value as of that date. Carnochan v. Norwich and Spalding Railway Co.[14]; Mercer v. Liverpool, St. Helen's and South Lancashire Railway Co.[15].\nThe order for possession having been made, and the company having gone into possession pursuant to it, there was no right of withdrawal. See \"Railway Act,\" section 207; Canadian Pacific Railway v. Little Seminary of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[16]; Re Haskill and Grand Trunk Railway Co.[17]; Atwood v. Kettle River Valley Railway Co.[18].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014With some hesitation I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent acting under section 180 of the \"Railway Act,\" sought to expropriate a piece of gravel-bearing land which belonged to the appellants and, accordingly, by notice of the 30th of June, 1908, served pursuant to said section on appellant and others concerned therein informed them of such intention and tendered the sum of $733.05 as compensation for said land and for any damages to be suffered by the exercise of the powers conferred by said section and notified them that if the said offer was not accepted within ten days after service of said notice the appellant would apply to a judge for the appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators as provided by section 196 of the said Act. Attached to said notice was a plan and certificate of a Dominion land-surveyor such as required in such cases by section 194 of said Act.\nThe then Chief Justice of Alberta on the 24th July, 1908, made, under section 217, an order upon consent of all parties interested that upon payment into court of $1,150 the respondent might enter into immediate possession of said lands.\nThe respondents, accordingly, shortly thereafter entered into possession and from time to time removed a very large quantity of gravel. No steps towards arbitration seem to have been taken until the year 1911, when a board of arbitrators was named, but for some reason failed to act and a new one was constituted in the year 1912, which proceeded with the reference and heard a great deal of evidence directed by both sides almost entirely to the then marketable value of the gravel according to the quality thereof about which there was much conflict of opinion.\nThe majority of the arbitrators held that the value of the property expropriated must be taken to be that which it was worth in 1908, when possession was taken, and awarded the amount tendered then. One of the arbitrators dissented from this view, holding that by section 192, as amended in 1909, its value at the time of the hearing was what ought to govern.\nThe appellant asked the court of appeal to set the award aside, but that court dismissed that appeal and hence this appeal.\nThe first and chief question thus raised is whether or not the said section 192, as so amended, is applicable.\nSection 191, sub-section 1, is as follows:\u2014\n191. After the expiration of ten days from the deposit of the plan, profile and book of reference in the office of the registrar of deeds, and after notice thereof has been given in at least one newspaper, if any published, in each of the districts and counties through which the railway is intended to pass, application may be made to the owners of lands, or to persons empowered to convey lands, or interested in lands, which may be taken, or which suffer damage from the taking of materials, or the exercise of any of the powers granted for the railway; and, thereupon, such agreements and contracts as seem expedient to both parties may be made with such persons, touching the said lands or the compensation to be paid for the same, or for the damages, or as to the mode in which such compensation shall be ascertained.\nThe second sub-section provides in case of disagreement that all questions shall be settled as thereinafter in said Act is provided. Then follows under the caption of \"Compensation and Damages,\" section 192, as unamended, as follows:\u2014\n192. The deposit of a plan, profile and book of reference, and the notice of such deposit, shall be deemed a general notice to all parties of the lands which will be required for the railway and works.\n2. The date of such deposit shall be the date with reference to which such compensation or damages shall be ascertained.\nIt is to be observed in the first place that the deposit of plans in the registry office is constituted by this section notice to all concerned and that service thereof on those concerned is not required until proceedings taken for arbitration.\nIn the next place it may be observed that, for what is done under and by virtue of section 180, no plans are required to be deposited or approved of as are other plans by some appointed authority before deposit.\nNow let us turn to section 180 and see what it provides. It is as follows:\u2014\nWhenever\u2014\n(a) any stone, etc., or other material is required, etc.; or (b) (as therein appears); and (c) (as therein appears) * * * the company may, if it cannot agree with the owner of the lands for the purchase thereof, cause a land surveyor, duly licensed to act in the province, or an engineer, to make a plan and description of the property or right-of-way, and shall serve upon each of the owners or occupiers of the lands affected a copy of such plan and description, or of so much thereof as relates to the lands owned or occupied by them respectively, duly certified by such surveyor or engineer.\nContrast this with the mode of service by deposit in the registry office and we see at a glance how radically different the two modes of procedure are as framed by this section 180 and the section 192. I, with respect, submit the latter is dragged in needlessly to aid section 180, which, in that which section 192 has regard to, needs no aid, but is a self-contained section and power in that regard.\nTrue, sub-section 2 of section 180 provides as follows:\u2014\n2. All the provisions of this Act shall, in so far as applicable, apply, and the powers thereby granted may be used and exercised to obtain the materials or water so required, or the right-of-way to the same, irrespective of the distance thereof: Provided that the company shall not be required to submit any such plan for the sanction of the Board.\nAnd it is urged that it expressly relates to such powers being exercised to obtain material and it is pointed out that section 191 in express terms refers to lands which may be taken,\nor which may suffer damage from the taking of materials.\nSurely there are conceivable manifold possibilities of situations or conditions being opened up or created by or for the planning of a railway, and its construction, whereon this taking of materials might operate without going outside the obvious purposes of this all comprehensive section relative thereto.\nEven if it could not be made operative as clearly as it can be shewn, in every word thereof, by a little effort of the imagination, applied to railway building, without making it apply to section 180, which even in its express language it does not fit, that would not render it necessary to pervert the obvious meaning of section 180.\nIn short, what was to be done under section 180 never required the deposit of a plan or profile in the registry office or elsewhere, but substituted therefor, and the publication thereof in a newspaper as required by section 191, service on those concerned, and to avoid any misapprehension as to the sanction of the board being required that was expressly dispensed with. Section 192 seems, therefore, as it originally stood, entirely inapplicable to what was to be done by virtue of section 180 providing a very common-place power such as municipalities have to enable them to execute or repair works, they possess.\nSuch being my conclusion I need not follow up the amendment of 1909 and its possible effect; yet I may be permitted to point out that it was no doubt enacted to put an end to the serious wrong done by railway companies filing plans in the registry office and keep- ing them there for an unreasonable length of time, to the detriment of the proprietors of lands affected thereby, without taking any steps to expropriate any part of such lands or indeed, as has been known, never proceeding with the construction of the railway.\nSuch proprietors of land had no remedy unless by making an application to the Railway Board. They had no powers of initiative to force an arbitration unless and until something more was done. The company alone was given the right to serve a notice to treat and often left that off till executing the work.\nAnd reading the amendment it seems to me that the language hardly fits a case such as this in the way appellant suggests. On the other hand it does suggest, that it might well be argued, that it could not apply where the work was done and presumably an agreement had been reached or arbitration had taken place within a more reasonable time than, as in this case, three years before the amendment.\nTo give effect to the contention would be in this case to make the amendment, retrospective over a period of three years. I need not come to any opinion on this phase of the case and express none beyond this that it is one of the curious phases of a rather peculiar case.\nPassing all that and agreeing in the contention acted upon by the arbitrators, must we set aside the award simply because there was no evidence presented by the appellant applicable to its claim?\nIt is rather a novel situation that is thus presented and, so far as I can find, barren of express authority to guide us.\nThe parties proceeded, by the respondents present- ing to the arbitrators the notice required by section 193 of the \"Railway Act,\" accompanied by the certificate of a sworn surveyor, required by the 194th section thereof, stating as therein required his opinion that the sum offered is a fair compensation for the land and damages thereto; the appellant tendering a mass of evidence which shewed how much, at the time of the hearing, gravel existed on the premises in question, and how much had been taken, and its value for a variety of purposes at that time; without directly giving evidence of the market value of the land at any time, and by the respondents meeting that case by similar evidence.\nHardly any of this, it is admitted, touched in truth the correct issue.\nIt is, therefore, claimed by appellant that there was no evidence upon which the arbitrators could act and that, hence, the award ought to be set aside. On principle it does not seem to me to lie in the mouth of appellant to set up such a contention. The only semblance of authority I can find is such cases as Graven v. Craven[19], and Grazebrook v. Davis[20].\nThe former was a motion to set aside an award for the reason that the arbitrator had refused to hear evidence. But it was shewn that none was in fact tendered; after hearing the arbitrator had expressed an adverse opinion as to the possibility of its being applicable.\nThe latter was an action on a bond of submission where on demurrer it was held a plea which failed to allege the tender of evidence could not be maintained.\nThese cases seem to proceed upon the theory that it was the duty of the party complaining of the award to have expressly tendered evidence that would be relevant.\nIn this case in hand we must, I think, look at the nature and scope of the reference which seems by the Act to be designed to try the issue of whether or not the offer made is fair, and to lay the foundation for such a trial by requiring the tender of such a specific sum and prima facie proof, in the shape of a surveyor's certificate, that it is so.\nThat presents an issue upon which the burden of proof to displace the certificate rests upon the party who claims a greater sum.\nIn this case the appellant failed to do so by tendering what, on the view I hold of the Act, was admittedly entirely irrelevant evidence.\nThis mode of presenting the issue is in marked contrast with the proceedings under the \"Lands Clauses Consolidation Act\" of 1845, under which the offer cannot be brought before the court trying the question of compensation.\nI, therefore, think the award made was justifiable and must be upheld. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIt certainly is to be regretted that so much expense was incurred for so little. Let us hope when dismissing this appeal with costs, that in taxing costs of the reference, if attempted, justice may be so far done that respondents reap nothing from the useless expenditure of putting forward irrelevant evidence.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the conclusion at which the appellate court of Alberta has arrived. Section 180 of the \"Railway Act,\" under which the proceedings were taken, is in the following terms:\u2014\n180. Whenever\u2014\n(a) any stone, gravel, earth, sand, water or other material is required for the construction, maintenance or operation of the railway, or any part thereof; or,\n(b) such materials or water, so required, are situate or have been brought to a place at a distance from the line of railway; and,\n(c) the company desires to lay down the necessary tracks, spurs or branch lines, water pipes or conduits, over or through any lands intervening between the railway and the land on which such materials or water are situate, or to which they have been brought;\nThe company may, if it cannot agree with the owner of the lands for the purchase thereof, cause a land surveyor, duly licensed to act in the province, or an engineer, to make a plan and description of the property or right-of-way, and shall serve upon each of the owners or occupiers of the lands affected a copy of such plan and description, or of so much thereof as relates to the lands owned or occupied by them respectively, duly certified by such surveyor or engineer.\n2. All the provisions of this Act shall, in so far as applicable, apply, and the powers thereby granted, may be used and exercised to obtain the materials or water, so required, or the right-of-way to the same, irrespective of the distance thereof; provided that the company shall not be required to submit any such plan for the sanction of the Board.\n3. The company may, at its discretion, acquire the lands from which such materials or water are taken, or upon which the right-of-way thereto is located, for a term of years or permanently.\n4. The notice of arbitration, if arbitration is resorted to, shall state the extent of the privilege and title required.\n5. The tracks, spurs or branch lines constructed or laid by the company under this section shall not be used for any purpose other than in this section mentioned, except by leave of the Board, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board sees fit to impose.\nThis section obviously provides for two distinct cases: First, the case in which the company desires to take land adjoining the railway containing the material required and no necessity exists for constructing a spur or branch line through any property except that owned by the company and that intended to be taken Secondly, the case in which the plan of the railway company involves the construction of a spur or branch line through lands intervening between the railway and that where the material is situated. The effect of sub-section 2, in my opinion, is that in the first case the provisions of the Act are to be followed in so far only as they are appropriate to the taking of and compensation for land not required in the construction or working of the railway itself: and in my judgment section 192 has no application in such a case.\nIt is not necessary to determine for the purposes of this case the exact stage of the proceedings with reference to which the amount of compensation or damages payable by the railway company is to be determined. On the 30th of June, 1908, notices were served on the persons interested in the land in question together with a plan and description of the properties in compliance with section 180 and containing the description and declaration mentioned in section 193, together with a notice of an application for possession to be made under section 196 in the event of the railway company's offer not being accepted. On the 24th of July, 1908, an order was made by the Chief Justice of Alberta giving the railway company leave to enter into possession of the lands and this order appears to have been acted upon without delay. Whether, therefore, the amount of compensation and damages falls to be determined under the statute, first, by reference to the date when the plan and description under section 180 was served upon the owners, or, secondly, when notice to treat was given under section 193, or, thirdly, when the right to take possession became consummated by the order referred to it appears to be unnecessary to decide. It is not suggested that any change took place in the relevant circumstances be- tween the 30th of June, 1908, when the notices were served and the 24th of July, 1908, when the order for possession was obtained.\nThe company at that date came, in my opinion, under an enforceable obligation to take the property and to proceed with the ascertainment of the amount of compensation. It seems reasonable, therefore, as it is strictly in accordance with legal analogy to hold that the company's title once consummated relates back at least to this date; and the appellant cannot complain of having the compensation ascertained with reference to it.\nThe relation of vendor and purchaser was, I think, constituted completely when the right of possession was obtained. Only the ascertainment of the price remained.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Not, I confess, without some lingering misgivings I have reached the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe mention in section 191 of the \"Railway Act\" of lands \"which suffer damage from the taking of materials\" no doubt affords some ground for the appellants' contention that the group of sections in which section 191 is found, dealing with the preparation, filing with the Board, approval and deposit for registration of plan, profile and book of reference, applies to expropriations under section 180 \u2014 the only section of the Act which deals with the acquisition of lands required for the purpose of taking materials from them. But I am, nevertheless, of the opinion that the group of sections to which I have referred does not apply to cases under section 180. That section itself provides for the making of a plan and description by a surveyor, and requires, the company to serve a copy thereof on the owners whose lands are to be taken. Submission of this plan to the Board of Railway Commissioners is expressly dispensed with. Registration of it is not provided for. Having regard to these special provisions and to the nature of the subject-matter, I am satisfied that the application of the sections dealing with the plan, profile and book of reference to expropriations under section 180 is inferentially excluded by sub-section 2 of that section, which declares that\nall the provisions of this Act shall, so far as applicable, apply.\nIf the statute required that a plan, profile and book of reference should be prepared, etc., in cases under section 180, as in the case of lands to be acquired for the ordinary right-of-way, there would be no reason for the requirement of a special plan and description or for the service of copies of them on the owners to be affected, as section 180 prescribes.\nIt follows that the provisions of section 192 and the amendment thereto of 1909 (8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 37, sec 3), relied upon by the appellants, do not govern this case, no provision being made for the deposit in the registry offices of copies of the plan and description prescribed by section 180, similar to that made for the deposit of copies of the plan, profile and book of reference in the case of lands taken for the ordinary right-of-way.\nIn the absence of any provision in the statute fixing a different date, I agree that the valuation of land taken under section 180 must be made either as of the date when the copy of the plan, profile and book of reference is served upon the owner (treating that as the equivalent of service of notice to treat under the English statute) or as of the date when actual possession is taken, whether by consent or under the authority of a warrant or order of the court. In the present case possession by consent having closely followed upon the service of the copy of the plan and description, it is immaterial which date is taken. Unless some explicit statutory provision should render such a course inevitable, it would seem to be unreasonable to require a railway company to pay, for land which had been taken possession of by consent and materials of which a considerable part had been used four years before, their value at the date of the arbitration hearing, which had been then greatly enhanced by adventitious circumstances. The fact that, since the amendment of section 196 of the \"Railway Act\" in 1907 (6 & 7 Edw. VII. ch. 37), owners have the same opportunity as the company to apply for the appointment of arbitrators, removes any hardship to which the former state of the law may have subjected them.\nI agree with Harvey C.J. that there was some evidence before the arbitrators which entitled them to fix the value of the land taken in 1908 at the figure which they have allowed, although it would have been much more satisfactory, to me at all events, had the attention of all parties been more clearly directed during the proceedings before the arbitrators, to the fact that the value was to be fixed as of that date.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The gravel land that a railway company desires to expropriate may be taken without any plans being submitted to the Board of Railway Commissioners. The procedure is different in the other cases of expropriation. The railway company is then bound by the law to have its plans approved by the Board. In the former case the company proceeds under section 180 of the \"Railway Act,\" that says:\u2014\nWhenever\u2014\n(a) any stone, gravel, earth, sand, water or other material is required for the construction, maintenance or operation of the railway, or any part thereof; or,\n* * * * *\n(c) the company desires to lay down the necessary tracks, spurs or branch lines, water pipes or conduits, over or through any lands intervening between the railway and the land on which such materials or water are situate, or to which they may have been brought;\nThe company may, if it cannot agree with the owner of the lands for the purchase thereof, cause a land surveyor, duly licensed to act in the province, or an engineer, to make a plan and description of the property or right-of-way, and shall serve upon each of the owners or occupiers of the lands affected a copy of such plan and description, or of so much thereof as relates to the lands owned or occupied by them respectively, duly certified by such surveyor or engineer,\n2. All the provisions of this Act shall, in so far as applicable, apply, and the powers thereby granted may be used and exercised to obtain the materials or water, so required, or the right-of-way to the same, irrespective of the distance thereof; provided that the company shall not be required to submit any such plan for the sanction of the Board.\nIn the present case a certified copy of a plan of the lands required was served with the notice to treat and, later on, the railway company was, with the consent of the owners, put in possession (section 218) under a warrant given by a judge.\nThe appellants contend that the expropriation of a gravel pit would require virtually the same procedure as regards the location of the line and the proceedings in expropriation, that section 192, should govern in this case and that the date with reference to which compensation is to be ascertained should be the time at which the hearing of the witnesses should take place.\nI cannot concur in such a view.\nIt seems to me reasonable that the damages or compensation should be determined according to the value that the land taken had when the company took possession of it.\nIn the ordinary cases of expropriation the \"Railway Act\" states (section 215) that the value shall be ascertained as of the date of the deposit of the plan. Now, with regard to gravel pits, no such deposit is provided for. But the plan duly certified by a surveyor will be served upon the owner.\nThen the value could be ascertained from the date on which such a notice would be given, or it could be ascertained from the date at which the expropriated party has given consent for possession.\nThere is no difference as to the value of the gravel pit at those two dates.\nBut it would be certainly unfair and illegal to have this value determined by the date at which the case was heard a long time after.\nFor those reasons the judgment of the Supreme Court en banc, confirming the award of the majority of the arbitrators, should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 6 Alta.

When the train was being moved for the purpose of cutting out the car, the uncoupling mechanism failed to work and, in consequence, the plaintiff, an employee, sustained injuries. Subsequently the coupler was taken apart and it was then discovered that the locking-block was jammed with ice (not visible from the exterior) which had formed inside the chamber and prevented its release by the uncoupling device used to disconnect the car before the train was moved. In an action for damages, instituted in the Province of Manitoba, the jury found that the company had been negligent \u201cthrough lack of proper inspection,\u201d and judgment was entered on their verdict. On appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba setting aside the verdict and entering judgment for the defendants:\u2014\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014The obligation resting upon the company, both under the statute and at common law, was discharged by the customary inspection of the car which had been made according to what was shewn to be good railway practice, and there was no further duty imposed in regard to unusual conditions not perceivable by the ordinary methods of inspection.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014Viewed as a finding upon a question of fact, the verdict of the jury upon the technical question as to the system of inspection should be set aside as being against evidence. Jackson v. Grand Trunk Railway Go. (32 Can. S.C.R. 245); Jones v. Spencer (77 L.T. 537); Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill (47 L.T. 29); Jackson v. Hyde (28 U.C.Q.B. 294); and Field v. Rutherford (29 U.C.C.P. 113), referred to.\nPer Anglin J. (Idington J. contra).\u2014The defence of common employment, although taken away by legislation in the Province of Saskatchewan, where the injuries were sustained, was available as a defence in the courts of Manitoba, where the action was brought. The \u201cHalley\u201d (L.R. 2 P.C. 193) referred to.\nJudgment appealed from (23 Man. R. 435) affirmed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ, dissenting.\u2014Section 264 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d imposes upon railway companies the absolute and continuing duty not only to provide, but also to maintain in efficient use the apparatus thereby required; where it is shewn that the apparatus failed to operate, when used, the onus is upon the railway company, in an action under section 386 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d to shew that there had been a thorough inspection thereof made to ascertain that it was in efficient working order before the train was moved. Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co. (25 S.C. Repr. 159) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and the judgment entered at the trial, by Curran J., and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note and the questions in issue on the present appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nF. B. Proctor for the appellant.\nC. H. Locke for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. The car-coupler was of a type which complied in all respects with the requirements of the statute and had been approved of by the Master Car Builders\u2019 Association. It did not work on the occasion in question because of an obstacle created by unusual climatic conditions that could not be detected by the ordinary methods of inspection which were reasonably sufficient to ensure the employees of the company against accidents, and there was nothing special in the circumstances which required extra precautions to be taken.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal in the conclusion that in fact the car-coupler was effective and the inspection adequate and, therefore, that the company was, in the circumstances, without fault.\nDavies J.\u2014Two contentions were urged by Mr. Proctor why the judgment of the Court of Appeal, directing judgment to be entered for the defendant, should be reversed. One was that section 264 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d casts an absolute and unqualified duty upon railway companies to provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means, inter alia,\n(c) to securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars;\nand the other was that, under the findings of the jury, the plaintiff was entitled at common law, irrespective of the statute, to a judgment for the damages awarded.\nThe question as to the proper construction of section 264 is a most important and far reaching one. I am, however, not able to accept the suggested interpretation as the true one. The statutory duty so far as regards sub-section (c), with which only we are concerned, consisted in providing car-couplers which would couple automatically by impact and which would uncouple without the necessity of men going in between the cars.\nIn all of the cases provided for in the section the statutory duty went beyond that imposed by the common law; but I am not prepared, as at present advised, to hold that it imposed the absolute or unqualified duty contended for, involving obligations which neither skill, care or absence of negligence, could avail to avoid.\nIn the present case, however, the defendant did not obtain any finding from the jury as to a breach of their statutory duty and, in the absence of such a finding, his contention must fail.\nOn the common law liability of the company invoked by the plaintiff, the only findings of the jury were that the defendant company was guilty of negligence and that this negligence was \u201cthrough lack of proper inspection.\u201d\nThis express finding negatives any other negligence on the defendants\u2019 part.\nI am unable to find any evidence warranting the jury\u2019s finding. We have the express evidence of Neill, who at the time of the accident was defendants\u2019 car-inspector at Melville, and of Couchman, who was plaintiff\u2019s witness, that on the arrival of the train on the night of the accident an inspection was made by them one on each side of the train with a lantern and the couplers of each car were inspected from the outside and that there were no visible signs of snow or ice on the couplers, or other evidence to cause any suspicion as to their not being all right and in good order.\nIt must be borne in mind that the jury did not find any defect in the coupler. As a matter of fact, after the accident occurred, the discovery was made that the coupler did not work. It was at once taken off and opened and examined by Neil, who states that he found it nearly filled with ice which, he surmised, had fallen on the outside of the coupler in the shape of snow which had melted and dropped into the coupler and that, after the ice was removed, he found it \u201cworked fine\u201d and was in first-class condition.\nThe uncontradicted evidence is that the coupler was a standard one approved of by the Master Car Builders\u2019 Association and one of the best on the market.\nThe truth is, that there was nothing the matter with the coupler itself, but that, owing to climatic conditions, it had become partially filled with ice, which prevented its proper working and that its condition was not detected until after the accident happened, when it was taken apart by Neil, and could not be detected by such an outside examination as good railway practice called for and as was made by Neil and Couchman.\nThe system of inspection as made by Neil and Couchman was approved of by Mr. Cowan, general car foreman of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, and other experts as good railway practice. All the experts agreed that any pulling of the cars apart to inspect the couplers was impracticable, and that the inspection sworn to alike by Neil and Couchman was the only practicable one. No witness gave evidence of anything omitted by these inspectors which ought to have been done by them and if the jury, in the absence of evidence, drew inferences as to what should have been done in addition to what was done they should have stated what these inferences were and not put their finding in the vague and unsatisfactory language they used.\nThere was much discussion as to the meaning and effect of their finding \u201cthrough lack of proper inspection.\u201d There is an air of delightful vagueness and uncertainty about it amply justified by the absence of any evidence.\nI am willing to accept the interpretation offered by appellant of its meaning as a possible one and as meaning that a proper inspection would have revealed the unworkable condition of the coupler. But surely that which was wanting in the inspection as made should have been stated in the finding. All the experts agree that it was a good and proper inspection and several suggestions made to them of a possibly better inspection were stated to be impracticable.\nUnder these circumstances, in the total absence of any evidence to support the finding and because of its vagueness and uncertainty, I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant acting as a brakesman and switchman in respondent\u2019s yard in Melville, in Saskatchewan, on the 19th January, 1912, in a shunting operation conducted after dark, when on top of a car to be cut out of the train and kicked into a siding, was thrown to the ground by reason of the car, instead of responding to the intended kick and moving onward, remaining attached to the train. The violent unexpected jerk which appellant thus got and brought him to the ground was, he alleges, the result of another man who was assisting in the intended operation having failed to raise the coupling pin of the car and thereby disconnect it from the moving train when brought to a halt. The man detailed to raise said pin did his duty by pulling upon the lever which was intended to uncouple the cars at the given signal, but he failed because the pin was so jammed in from some cause or other that his pull produced no effect.\nIt is not seriously denied that all this happened and was in truth the cause of appellant\u2019s fall to the ground when the cars ran over his arm and resulted in it having to be cut off at the shoulder.\nThe jury found a verdict of negligence against respondent by answering questions submitted by the learned trial judge and assessed the damages at six thousand dollars. One of these questions was: \u201cIf so in what did this negligence consist\u201d? The answer was: \u201cThrough lack of proper inspection.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge upon this and other answers entered judgment for the appellant. The respondent herein then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which, by a majority of three to two, reversed said judgment and dismissed the action.\nThe meaning of this verdict is, to my mind, the only serious difficulty in appellant\u2019s way to success, and to understand it we must, as in all such cases of an enigmatical sort of verdict, look at the proceedings at the trial and the course thereof and especially the learned trial judge\u2019s charge and other indications of what the parties, in truth, were engaged in trying.\nWhen we do that in this case there cannot be much doubt of the meaning of the jury\u2019s verdict.\nThe respondent\u2019s counsel at the close of the case moved for a nonsuit. In doing so he said:\u2014\nI suppose the most my learned friend could wish to shew is that this man was injured by reason of a coupler failing to work. There is no question that is the reason this accident occurred. The plaintiff expected it to open and it did not open, and he charges that we are liable in damages because it did not open. Now, he has to go farther than that.\nThen he proceeded to argue on the evidence as to the inspection of the coupler in question and urged that no more could be desired and hence no actionable negligence shewn.\nThereupon the learned trial judge asked: \u201cWhat about the statutory duty? To which counsel replied thus:\u2014\nThe statutory duty is met by this Climax Coupler, which is a standard coupler. The statute was never intended to insure workmen against any latent defect.\nNext morning, the court having adjourned, the learned judge ruled that the common law duty and the duty cast upon the defendant by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d were sufficient to satisfy the present onus and that they ought to take into consideration the whole case,\nIn charging the jury he dealt with every phase of the case and directed the jury that there was a common law duty of the employer to provide proper materials and a proper place to work in, and after enlarging upon that, pointed out the requirements of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in respect of automatic couplers at length.\nHe then said:\u2014 The next question for you to consider is, have they maintained that coupler in a satisfactory working condition so as to ensure the highest degree of efficiency from it in order to carry out in actual practice the protection to life and limb as defined by the statute; in order to avoid the necessity of men going in between the cars to couple and uncouple them and when men are operating on the cars the levers can be drawn by some one on the ground? There is no question about it on the evidence here that that coupler did not work when Ault attempted to cut off the car on that night.\nAnd, thereupon, he proceeded with some detail to deal with the evidence bearing thereupon and the kind of inspection it presented.\nIt seems to me that the return of the jury to this charge and the questions submitted must be read as assuming that the facts admitted by every one are to be taken for granted and that if the law imposes the duty upon respondent of maintaining the coupler in efficiency, whether inspected or not, then, regardless of inspection, there was negligence, but if there was anything further needed they found that there had been no proper inspection.\nThe first question thus raised is as to the nature and extent of the obligation imposed by section 264 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d upon respondent.\nThis section is under the caption \u201cOperation, Equipment and Appliances for Cars and Locomotives.\u201d\nIt enacts:\u2014\n264. Every company shall provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means \u2014\nand then follow (a) and (b), not concerning us, and (c), which is as follows:\u2014\n(c) To securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train, with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars. Is this rigid requirement observed by supplying a coupler that in fact was, and had been, no one knows how long, absolutely useless for any purpose?\nWe are not told when it was last fit for use. The counsel for respondent at the trial seemed to assume that having furnished a coupler of an approved type its duty ended, and that the onus rested upon the appellant to demonstrate all else relative thereto and its inefficiency if so in fact and, above all, the negligence that had produced such inefficiency.\nI do not think such is the law to be found in this enactment. We must look at section 386 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which gives the right of action in express terms as well as imposing penalties.\nI incline to the opinion that the statute, in light thereof, is to be read just as the plain language of these sections expresses and clearly implies. No excuses are permitted. No exception is expressed. Why should we read something of that kind into the Act when not there?\nIn the view I thus suggest of the meaning of this statute there is an end of all the many contentions of the respondent. But it is not necessary to adhere to such view to maintain the judgment of the trial judge.\nTaking much lower ground and, for argument\u2019s sake, assuming the rule applicable to cases resting upon the common law obligations of the employer or, indeed, upon some statutes by their provisions implying analogous modifications of the rigid rule (which I suggest this one lays down) that upon the careful and prudent inspection of a competent officer, reasonably finding the requirements of the law had been observed, yet an accident might occur for which the master could not be held liable, how far does that carry the defence herein?\nThis car formed part of a train made up at Fort William, in Ontario, but how long before the nineteenth of January, on the evening of which it came into the Melville yard, no one seems to know, or, indeed, to have cared.\nIt travelled in its last stages at least through weather conditions that shewed a temperature of twenty to twenty-five degrees below zero. The coupler was filled with ice and snow. It was so solidly frozen that it was only after the man responsible for its inspection at the Melville yard had taken it apart that he was able to discover what was the matter.\nIt is suggested by some of the witnesses that it probably was next to the engine, though apparently not there at its coming into the yard.\nIt appears such a situation, or where steam might reach it and get frozen, or dropping of water from eaves of a building or car, or in other ways such as by a snow storm and snow melting, the condition found might have been produced. It is admitted by the witnesses who ought to know that such things do happen.\nThere was ample evidence before the jury from which men of sense exercising common local knowledge might well have said all these things might, from its history, have happened to this car since it had got placed in train No. 91 at Fort William. And how much further east it had travelled from, without any inspection, no one knows.\nAre we to say, as matter of law, that the most cursory sort of examination, under such circumstances, of Mr. Neill by the aid of his lantern watching, I infer, only for breakages, not for the workability of this coupler and failing to test it by hammer or otherwise, is the sort of examination a jury are debarred from finding fault with? Are we to tell men of sense who do condemn it, that they are expressing an opinion which nine out of twelve reasonable men cannot properly pronounce?\nI cannot think such is the law or that the excuses given, I care not by whom, in regard to the use and inspection of a piece of mechanism which the jurors possibly understood quite as well as the witnesses and, under the circumstances, could appreciate better than lawyers, must be held valid.\nThe excuses given for not making a better inspection seem to me most frivolous. And there is evidence from which the jury might well have discarded some of the evidence upon which respondent must rely to establish this defence.\nThe radical error, I repeat, in what has been put forward is the assumption that the, burden rested upon the appellant, when in law the burden rested on respondent, to shew some reasonable grounds for being discharged from its statutory obligation.\nThere is a case of Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co.[2], upon a similar statute in which it was contended that because on the engine and the dining car, respectively there in question, which needed coupling, there was a good coupler affixed, but the two couplers were not of the same make or kind, though each in its way was excellent. They could not be made to work automatically or together without a man going in between the engine and the car to make them couple. It was argued even up to the Supreme Court of the United States that the statute had been fully complied with.\nThe argument there failed and this contention ought equally to fail.\nI quite agree with the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal when he answers all the exaggerated consequences suggested by some to frighten others, as to making a more thorough inspection, that all that was needed was to see that before an operation such as involved herein was attempted the car to be dealt with should be so thoroughly examined as to make sure that the coupler would work and that there existed no need for severing each car in a whole train.\nI may add that the kind of inspection supposed to be made by men like Mr. Neill, doing what he was doing, was no doubt for the purpose of seeing that nothing was broken and hence make sure that the car would not uncouple and become a source of danger to the train or other trains by such uncoupling.\nThe operation in question was of an entirely different character and for another purpose and needed the full assurance that the coupler would uncouple.\nAgain it is urged that the statute is only for the protection of the man operating the coupler. I do not think so. It was designed, whatever its origin, to provide for the safety of all concerned in working on a train on which that might come into play, and it is in this connection that a distinction may be possibly drawn between the degrees of obligation imposed in relation to those directly and indirectly concerned, that induces me to put the disposition of this case upon the lower ground I have taken. I may say the case just cited furnishes a contention somewhat analogous to that made here, but which failed there.\nAnother contention was set up herein before us, though not presented in the courts below, and that was that the law of Manitoba must govern and, by that, the negligence involved in failing to inspect was that of a fellow-servant and, hence, the doctrine of common employment applied and as the action rests upon the common law or statute, must fail.\nUnfortunately for the argument the accident took place in Saskatchewan where the doctrine was abrogated in 1900 by an ordinance, chapter 13, section 2, which is copied into the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d of 1907, now found in R.S. Sask. of 1909, and is in section 31 thereof, which is as follows:\u2014\n31. The law to be administered in this province as to the matters next hereinafter mentioned shall be as follows:\u2014\nand of its numerous declarations of the law, one is this:\u2014\n14. It shall not be a good defence in law to any action against an employer or the successor or legal representative of an employer for damages for the injury or death of an employee of such employer that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of an employee engaged in a common employment with the injured employee any contract or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe objection that it only applies to actions in the Supreme Court is not tenable, indeed is neither justified by the terms or implications of the enactment.\nThis objection in any event, even had the law not been changed, would only apply to the common law aspect.\nThe statute that imposes the duty in question herein rests it upon such express ground that its non-observance can in any aspect only be excused by something which defendant must set up and prove. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and judgment of the trial court restored.\nDuff J. (dissenting). \u2014 This was an action in which the respondent, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, was charged with the violation of section 264 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in respect of which reparation was claimed under sub-section 2 of section 3.86 of the same Act. The first mentioned section provided in so far as relevant to this case:\u2014\nEvery company shall provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means\u2014\n* * * * *\n(c) to securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train, with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars.\nThe material parts of section 386 are as follows:\u2014\n386. Every company required by this Act\u2014\n(a) to provide and cause to be used on its trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means, for the secure coupling and connecting of the cars and the engine composing the train,\n* * * * *\nwhich fails to comply with any requirement of this Act in that behalf shall forfeit to His Majesty a sum not exceeding two hundred dollars for every clay during which such default continues.\n2. Every such company shall also be liable to pay to all such persons as are injured by reason of the non-compliance with such requirements * * * such damages as they are legally entitled to.\nFor the purposes of this appeal it must be taken as having been established that the appellant was injured by reason of the fact that the coupler connecting two of the members of one of the trains of the respondent company on which the appellant was working at the time was not in such a condition that it could be \u201cuncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars.\u201d On the questions of law involved the conclusions I have reached are as follows.\nI think the duty imposed by section 264 \u201cto provide and cause to be used\u201d modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means is a continuing duty. I also think that the clause,\nwith couplers that couple automatically by impact and which can be uncoupled without necessity, etc.,\nwhile it grammatically qualifies the verbs \u201ccouple\u201d and \u201cconnect,\u201d designates an essential attribute of the \u201capparatus, appliances and means\u201d to be employed for connecting the different members of the train, and that it is a requirement of the statute that the apparatus so employed shall fall within the description contained in that clause. It follows, I think, that the duty to \u201cprovide and cause to be used\u201d efficient apparatus, etc., whether it is to be regarded as absolute or qualified duty, involves the duty to maintain the coupling apparatus in such a state that it will fulfil the condition of being capable of being uncoupled as provided by sub-section (c).\nThe next point is whether the duty imposed by this section is an absolute or qualified duty, and if qualified, what is the nature of the qualification? In the first place it seems to me to be too clear for argument that the common law doctrine of common employment cannot be imported as a qualification. I think that does not require discussion.\nIn the next place I do not think the absolute language of the statute can be read as importing only a duty to see that ordinary care is taken for the providing and maintaining the apparatus required. I think it may be assumed that the legislature was satisfied that the requirements of the section were not impracticable or, at all events, that any suggestion to the contrary had been fully met by the provision contained in sub-section 7. On the other hand I think there is sufficient ground, having regard to the fact that section 386 provides for a penalty for non-compliance, for thinking the legislature did not intend to punish every case of non-compliance, then the circumstances bring it within the category of those cases which, in the language of lawyers, fall under the head \u201cinevitable accident.\u201d That is my view of the construction of the section. I may add, however, that what I am about to say with regard to the evidence would be equally conclusive in favour of the appeal if the proper view were that the duty imposed was a duty that the company could discharge by seeing that all ordinary measures had been taken to provide and maintain the appliances mentioned.\nIn either view it seems clear that the failure of the coupler to work cast the burden of explanation upon the defendant company; and in this view, which appears to have been the view of the learned trial judge himself, the jury ought to have been told that the fact that the coupler failed to work cast upon the company the onus of proving in fact such circumstances as would support a defence of \u201cinevitable accident,\u201d or at least the burden of shewing that ordinary care had been taken in the providing and maintaining of the coupling apparatus. The jury might have awarded a verdict in favour of the appellant because they were not satisfied with the company\u2019s explanation of the accident, as, for example, being doubtful on proper judicial grounds whether the facts were being fairly and fully disclosed to them; or, on the other hand, they might have found that in some particular there had been a failure to perform the duty to exercise due care. The jury have found plainly enough that there was negligence. There was, they say, a negligent failure to inspect. I do not see how (subject to the point I am about to mention) it is possible on the evidence before us to refuse to give effect to this verdict. The learned trial judge was obviously dissatisfied with the evidence of several of the witnesses called on behalf of the company, and I do not think we can possibly say that the jury were not entitled to reject that evidence. The only point upon which I have had any doubt is whether or not there ought to be a new trial. The objection taken by Mr. Dennison that the learned trial judge did not in his charge bring to the attention of the jury the elements in the company\u2019s case which it would be their duty to consider was certainly not without substance; but in view of the opinion of the majority of the court that the appeal should be dismissed it is unnecessary to consider that point.\nAnglin J. \u2014 Although I was unavoidably prevented from hearing the conclusion of the argument in this case, I understand that it is the desire of the parties that J should take part in the judgment.\nIn my opinion this appeal should not succeed. In answer to the question, \u201cIn what did the negligence of the defendants consist?\u201d the only finding of the jury is \u201cThrough lack of proper inspection.\u201d All other charges of negligence preferred by the plaintiff have thus been negatived. Andreas v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[3].\nAs is pointed out by Perdue J.A.:\u2014 Failure to inspect was not in itself the direct cause of the accident. There must have been something wrong with the coupler which caused it to fail and the jury have made no finding as to this.\nAs put by Osier J.A. in Schwoob v. Michigan Central Railroad Co.[4]:\u2014\nWant of inspection, unless there was some existing defect which inspection would have disclosed, is not defect, or, by itself, negligence.\nThree suggestions are made in regard to the cause of the failure of the coupler to operate\u2014that there was a defect in it due either to original vice, or to a state of disrepair, or that the failure was due to the presence of ice in the cup or chamber.\nThe finding of lack of proper inspection is consistent with the existence of any one of these conditions. It is impossible to say which of them the jury had in mind. Indeed, the appellant himself suggests that the jury may have had in view some defect in the engine, which, it is said, was leaking steam. This possibility only serves to shew how inconclusive and unsatisfactory the finding really is.\nThere is not a tittle of direct evidence either of original defect or of a state of disrepair. The coupler is shewn to have been one of the best on the market \u2014 a standard appliance and such as admittedly met the requirements of section 264(c) of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The only indirect evidence of anything being wrong with it is that afforded by the fact of its failure to work. That might be due either to a defect of the mechanism or to the presence of ice or snow, and does not, therefore, in itself, afford any proof of the existence of either condition. The only direct evidence in the record upon this point is that of Neill, who says that, on subsequent examination made by him, ice was found in the cup or chamber in quantity sufficient to account fully for its failure to operate and that on the removal of this ice the coupler \u201cworked fine.\u201d He also says that it was not worn and that every part of it was in first-class condition. This evidence is uncontradicted. If it may be assumed that in this particular the jury dealt with the case upon the evidence, it may perhaps be inferred that they meant to find that a \u201cproper inspection,\u201d before the accident occurred, would, if made, have disclosed the presence of the ice afterwards found by Neill. They have not so found, however, and their finding is consistent with their having proceeded on an assumption of some entirely different defect which, on inspection, would have been discovered.\nBut assuming that the presence of the ice in the coupler is what they thought \u201cproper inspection\u201d would have detected, there are other serious difficulties in the way of sustaining their verdict. There is no evidence as to the \u201chistory\u201d of the car carrying the refractory coupler for any period preceding the accident \u2014 nothing to shew when it was coupled to the adjoining car \u2014 nothing to enable us to say when the coupler had last been operated \u2014 nothing to inform us to what weather conditions it had been exposed \u2014nothing to exclude the view that on the last occasion when the car should have been inspected, prior to its arrival at Melville, the coupler was free from ice and in perfect order. The car had arrived in the Melville yards forming part of a fast freight train only a short time before the accident and had been inspected. It is, therefore, against the sufficiency of this inspection that the jury must be taken to have pronounced. The evidence as to the inspection actually made at Melville is given by the men who made it \u2014 Neill and Couchman. Their evidence is that they inspected the cars forming the train according to instructions. They and a number of other fully qualified railway men in the employment of the defendants and in that of other railway companies testify that the inspection which is sworn to have been made is the only kind of inspection that is practicable in the case of a train stopping en route. This evidence is uncontradicted. It is not within the province of jurymen to constitute themselves experts on such a technical question of proper railway practice and, without any evidence to warrant such a course and against all the evidence before them, to find that the method of inspection prescribed is improper. Jackson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5]. If the verdict means that the system of inspection was improper, viewed as a finding upon an ordinary question of fact it should be set aside, not as being against the weight of evidence, but as being against the evidence; Jones v. Spencer[6]. As Lord Herschell puts it, at page 538:\u2014\nI cannot myself say * * * that the jury have found their verdict upon the evidence.\nViewed as a finding upon a matter of technical knowledge it is still less defensible. Managers of Metropolitan Asylum District v. Eill[7]; Jackson v. Hyde[8]; Fields v. Rutherford[9].\nBut it is contended that the jury may have meant that the inspectors were negligent and did not carry out their instructions. It is admitted by every witness who gave evidence on the subject \u2014 although they say that it is of rare occurrence \u2014 that ice such as is said to have been found in the coupler in question might be there without any trace of its presence being visible on the outside of the coupler. The men who made the inspection both say:\u2014\nThere were no visible signs to shew that there was anything wrong with that coupler.\nThey examined it again after the accident and by visual inspection could still see nothing wrong. The yard foreman, Taylor, corroborates them on this point. Ault, the plaintiff\u2019s fellow-workman, called by him as a witness, says the same thing. The evidence of these witnesses is uncontradicted. Neill swears that the condition afterwards found by taking the coupler apart could not have been discovered by the inspection which it was his duty to make and which he and Couchman both say they actually made.\nBut negligence of Neill and Couchman in the actual inspection, if found, and properly found, would not have sufficed to sustain the verdict at common law, because the defence of common employment, although taken away by legislation of the Province of Saskatchewan, in which the accident happened, is available in the Province of Manitoba in which the action has been brought. The \u201cHalley\u201d[10]. The findings are insufficient to warrant a judgment under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba has deemed it a proper exercise of their discretion and within their power to direct the entry of judgment for the defendant dismissing the action instead of ordering a new trial. No objection to this course is taken by the appellant. Upon this question of practice I am not disposed to interfere.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the verdict for the plaintiff was properly set aside and that the judgment dismissing the action should be affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Geo.

On an appeal from this judgment, the Court of Review, of its own motion, added more specific directions as to the works to be done and, instead of authorizing the plaintiff to construct the works, in case of default, reserved his recourse for future damages and dismissed the appeal.\nHeld, that the judgment of the Court of Review had confirmed that of the court of first instance and, therefore, an appeal therefrom would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of section 40 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d R.S.C. 1906, ch. 139. Hull Electric Co. v. Clement (41 Can. S.C.R. 419), followed.\nMOTIONS to set aside the judgment of the registrar, acting as a judge in chambers, affirming the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal from the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec, and also to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The respondent moved to set aside the judgment of the registrar and also to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that, as the judgment of the Court of Review had modified the judgment of the Superior Court, an appeal lay to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, and, consequently, that an appeal would not lie from that judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada. The circumstances of the case are stated in the judgment of the registrar, as follows:\u2014\nCannon K.C. for motion.\nBelleau K.C. contra.\nThe Registrar:\u2014This is a motion to affirm jurisdiction of the court.\nIt would appear from the pleadings that the lands of the plaintiff, having been by the works of the defendants compelled to receive more water than they were by nature called upon to carry, the plaintiff brought an action in 1911 for redress. The parties came to an agreement on October 28th, 1911, set out in the statement of claim, which provided for the construction by the defendants of certain drainage works which would relieve the plaintiff from the injuries complained of and the action was thereupon dropped, the defendants paying the costs and damages.\nSubsequently the defendants altered the drainage system with the result that the plaintiff\u2019s land was again subjected to an overflow of water and the present action was taken in which the plaintiff by the 10th paragraph of his pleadings, declared himself to be the proprietor of the lands in question and, by the 11th, declared that he was not subjected to any servitude with respect to the water now being brought Upon his property by the defendants. He also asked that it be declared that the defendants should make the works necessary to relieve him from the injuries complained of and in default of so doing that he, the plaintiff, be authorized to make these works at the cost and charges of the defendants and that the defendants be ordered to pay damages to the amount of $250.\nThe defendants denied generally the allegations of the plaintiff and also alleged that the works subsequently made by them and which the plaintiff now complains of were so made at his express request and that the result of the works was to carry the water in its natural channel as it existed before the construction of the railway.\nThe case was tried before the Hon. Mr. Justice Letellier, who gave judgment as follows:\u2014\nNous maintenons l\u2019action et d\u00e9clarons que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a aucun droit d\u2019exercer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur la servitude d\u2019\u00e9coulement des eaux qui r\u00e9sulte des travaux de la construction de son chemin de fer; et nous lui ordonnons de cesser l\u2019exercice de cette servitude et de cesser de faire couler dans le foss\u00e9 de ligne et la d\u00e9charge du demandeur, les eaux qu\u2019elle lui envoie venant dans le foss\u00e9 de ligne et conduite par le talus et le foss\u00e9 du chemin de fer; et nous lui ordonnons de faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin, et qu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de la faire avant le mois d\u2019octobre, 1914, le demandeur soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire ces travaux aux frais de la d\u00e9fenderesse et \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens, en par lui donnant avis du temps o\u00f9 il fera ces travaux; et nous condamnons de plus la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer au demandeur la somme de $250 de dommages avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u00e9pens, de l\u2019action.\nThe defendants thereupon inscribed in review where the judgment was confirmed in the following language:\u2014 Confirme le dit jugement avec d\u00e9pens, sujet \u00e0 la modification suivante du dispositif qui se lira comme suit:\u2014\nNous maintenons l\u2019action et d\u00e9clarons que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a aucun droit d\u2019exercer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur la servitude d\u2019\u00e9coulement des eaux, lequel r\u00e9sulte des travaux de construction du chemin de fer:\u2014Nous ordonnons de plus \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de discontinuer l\u2019exercice de telle servitude et de cesser de faire se d\u00e9verser dans le foss\u00e9 de ligne et les d\u00e9charges du demandeur les eaux qui s\u2019y \u00e9coulent par suite du talus et du foss\u00e9 du chemin de fer; et nous ordonnons \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre fin au dit trouble conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la transaction intervenue entre les parties le vingt-huit octobre 1911, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par elle de ce faire d\u2019hui au premier mai prochain, la Cour r\u00e9serve au demandeur tout recours pour dommages ult\u00e9rieurs, et nous condamnons de plus la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer au demandeur la somme de deux cent cinquante piastres de dommages avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et les d\u00e9pens de l\u2019action.\nThe defendants now desire to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review, claiming that no appeal lies to the Court of King\u2019s Bench and that an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada under section 40 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which, reads as follows:\u2014\nIn the Province of Quebec an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the Superior Court in Review where that court confirms the judgment of first instance, and its judgment is not appealable to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, but is appealable to His Majesty in Council. 54-55 V. c. 25, s. 2.\nIt will be perceived that, substantially, the only modifications made by the Court of Review of the judgment of the Superior Court are two:\u2014\n1. That while the earlier judgment simply orders that the necessary works be done to put an end to the cause of complaint, the subsequent judgment provides that the manner of doing these works shall be that provided for in the agreement between the parties above referred to and,\u2014\n2. That in case of default instead of authorizing the plaintiff to make the works himself, it reserves to him the right of further recourse by action in the event of future damages. The question between the parties in the present motion, therefore, resolves itself shortly into this.: Has the judgment in the Court of Review confirmed, although modifying, the judgment below, or has it rectified an error in that judgment? It is to be noted that the Court of Review expressly uses the words \u201cconfirme le dit jugement\u201d and that the modification in question which the plaintiff now claims to be so material to his interests, was not asked for by him by way of a cross-appeal, but was of its own motion granted to him by the court as a result of the defendants\u2019 appeal.\nTwo cases are cited by the defendants in favour of their motion. The first is Beauch\u00eane v. Labaie[1], a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Quebec, which is very much in point. The judgment turned upon the interpretation which should be placed upon what now appears as article 43(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, which provides that an appeal shall lie to the Court of King\u2019s Bench sitting in appeal, except:\u2014\nAt the suit of the party who has inscribed in review a cause in which the sum demanded or the value of the thing claimed amounts to or exceeds five hundred dollars, and who has proceeded to judgment on such inscription, when the judgment confirms that rendered in the first instance.\nIn that case upon an appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Superior Court the Court of Review said\nConsid\u00e9rant que le dit jugement est correct quant au droit du demandeur Labb\u00e9 au p\u00e9titoire, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire, \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame, maintient cette partie du jugement, mais quant \u00e0 la condemnation pour deux ann\u00e9es de fruits et revenus, consid\u00e9rant que le demandeur n\u2019a acquis l\u2019immeuble que le 4 f\u00e9vrier, 1874, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu cession de fruits et revenus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant cette date, la cour ici pr\u00e9sente revise et renverse cette partie du dit jugement avec d\u00e9pens de la cause en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Arthabaska contre le d\u00e9fendeur.\nNotwithstanding this modification of the judgment of the Superior Court, it was held by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that the judgment of the court below was confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Review and that no further appeal lay.\nThe defendant also relies on the case of Hall Electric Railway Co. v. Cl\u00e9ment[2], where a judgment for the plaintiff in the Superior Court for $6,000 was, upon appeal by the defendant to the Court of Review, reduced to $3,500. The defendant, dissatisfied with this, appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, where it was held that no appeal lay, because the judgment in review had confirmed the judgment below. The judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was affirmed by the Supreme Court, this court holding that the defendant, when dissatisfied with the judgment of the Court of Review, should have appealed directly to the Supreme Court, it being a case in which no appeal lay to the Court of King\u2019s Bench because the Court of Review had confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe plaintiff relies on the case of Fraser v. Burnette[3], but in that case the Court of Review expressly and in terms reversed the judgment of the Superior Court. He also relies upon Simpson v. Palliser[4], but in that case also the Court of Review in terms declared that there was error in the judgment of the Superior Court, and this is the ground upon which the Supreme Court said that no appeal lay from the judgment of the Court of Review to this court, but only to the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIt appears to me that a review of these decisions justifies it being held that where the judgment in review confirms the judgment below in favour of the plaintiff, although some additional or other relief is also given to the plaintiff, not as a result of a cross-appeal by him, but by the court of its own motion for the purpose of more effectively carrying out the judgment of the trial judge, no appeal lies to the Court of King\u2019s Bench by the defendant, and, therefore, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, if the judgment would have been the subject of a further appeal to the Privy Council, had the case been a proper subject for an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench. In the present case it is admitted that had the judgment in review simply confirmed the judgment below, the case would have been appealable to the King in His Privy Council. This is an action n\u00e9gatoire raising an issue with regard to a servitude which under the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court is a matter concerning \u201ctitles to land\u201d and is, therefore, appealable to the Privy Council under article 68, sub-section 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and is also appealable to the Supreme Court, where substantially the same language is used in section 46, sub-section (b), of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the jurisdiction of the court should be affirmed.\nA motion is now pending returnable on the 1st day of the February session to quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction. I would have refused to entertain the present motion until the court had dealt with the motion to quash were it not that both parties were desirous of having the present motion disposed of because, if I were against the jurisdiction of the court, the defendant would be within the delays provided by the Code of Civil Procedure for launching an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, but the time for taking such proceedings will expire before the 2nd of February. My order as to costs, therefore, will be that the costs of this motion be costs to the defendant in any event of the cause unless the motion to quash is granted, in which event my order affirming jurisdiction will, of course, fall.\nE. Belleau K.C. for the respondent, supported the motions.\nL. A. Cannon K.C. for the appellants, contra.\nDavies J.\u2014I concurred with the judgment of this court in the case of Hull Electric Co. v. Cl\u00e9ment[5] only because, as I stated, the settled jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec upon the meaning of sub-section 4 of article 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec was that a judgment of the Court of Review confirming one of the Superior Court and affirming the right of the plaintiff to recover in the action, but reducing the amount of damages awarded to plaintiff was a confirmation of the judgment of the Court of Review within the meaning of the article of the Code referred to and was not appealable to the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nI think the registrar was right in affirming our jurisdiction to hear this appeal direct from the judgment of the Court of Review which confirmed, but modified, that of the Superior Court; and that the appeal from his judgment should be dismissed with costs and the motion to quash the appeal should be refused with costs.\nNo absolute rule can, in my opinion, be laid down. The question in each case must be not simply whether there was a formal confirmation of the Superior Court, but whether the modification was a substantial modification of the judgment of the lower court. Here the substantial question in controversy was decided by both courts in respondent\u2019s favour; the modification related merely to the manner in which effect should be given to that judgment.\nI think, therefore, that no appeal would, under the jurisprudence of that court, lie to the Court of King\u2019s Bench; but, as it is conceded one would lie to the Privy Council, the appeal will lie here.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal seems to me within the principle affirmed by the judgment of this court in Hull Electric Co. v. Cl\u00e9ment[6], and, hence, the motion to quash must be refused and the counter motion of appellant against the ruling of the registrar dismissed, each with costs of motion.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion the jurisdiction of this court to entertain this appeal is settled by Hull Electric Co. v. Cl\u00e9ment6. The Court of Review pro tanto affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court against the defendant, and from the judgment so affirmed it has a right of appeal to this court. Unless the plaintiff should launch and maintain a cross-appeal the variation of the judgment made by the Court of Review will not be a subject for consideration in this court.\nThe appellant is entitled to the costs of the motions before us to quash and by way of appeal from the order of the registrar affirming jurisdiction.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit de savoir si nous avons juridiction pour entendre cette cause.\nLe demandeur intim\u00e9, Gignac, avait, en 1911, institu\u00e9 une action n\u00e9gatoire contre l\u2019appelante en all\u00e9guant que cette derni\u00e8re laissait \u00e9couler sur son terrain des eaux qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de recevoir. Une transaction \u00e9tait intervenue le 28 octobre, 1911, et la compagnie appelante avait reconnu comme bien fond\u00e9es les plaintes du demandeur, Gignac, et s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e de faire certains travaux.\nLes travaux convenus auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s mais ils furent subs\u00e9quemment d\u00e9molis par la compagnie et alors la pr\u00e9sente action n\u00e9gatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e. Cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nNous maintenons l\u2019action et d\u00e9clarons que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a aucun droit d\u2019exercer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur la servitude d\u2019\u00e9coulement des eaux qui r\u00e9sulte des travaux de la construction de son chemin de fer; et nous lui ordonnons de cesser l\u2019exercice de cette servitude et de cesser de faire couler dans le foss\u00e9 de ligne et la d\u00e9charge du demandeur, les eaux qu\u2019\u00ealle lui envoie venant dans le foss\u00e9 de ligne et conduite par le talus et le foss\u00e9 du chemin de fer; et nous lui ordonnons de faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin, et qu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de les faire avant le mois d\u2019octobre 1914, le demandeur soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire ces travaux aux frais de la d\u00e9fenderesse et \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens, en par lui donnant avis du temps o\u00f9 il fera ces travaux; et nous condamnons de plus la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer au demandeur la somme de $250. de dommages avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u00e9pens de l\u2019action.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse a port\u00e9 la cause devant la Cour de Revision, o\u00f9 le jugement fut confirm\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nLa Cour * * *\nConfirme le dit jugement avec d\u00e9pens, sujet \u00e0 l\u00e0 modification suivante du dispositif qui se lira comme suit:\u2014\nNous maintenons l\u2019action et d\u00e9clarons que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a aucun droit d\u2019exercer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur la servitude d\u2019\u00e9coulement des eaux, lequel r\u00e9sulte des travaux de construction du chemin de fer.: Nous ordonnons de plus \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de discontinuer l\u2019exercice de telle servitude et de cesser de faire se d\u00e9verser dans le foss\u00e9 de ligne et les d\u00e9charges du demandeur les eaux qui s\u2019y \u00e9coulent par suite du talus et du foss\u00e9 du chemin de fer; et nous ordonnons \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre fin au dit trouble conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la transaction intervenue entre les parties le vingt-huit octobre, 1911, et a d\u00e9faut par elle de ce faire d\u2019hui au premier mai prochain, la Cour r\u00e9serve au demandeur tout recours pour dommages ult\u00e9rieurs, et nous condamnons de plus la d\u00e9fenderesse a payer au demandeur la somme de deux cent cinquante piastres de dommages avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et les d\u00e9pens de l\u2019action.\nL\u2019appelante appelle \u00e0 cette cour du jugement de la Cour de Revision.\nEn vertu de la section 40 de l\u2019acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame, il y a appel devant cette cour d\u0435 tout jugement de la Cour de Revision confirmant celui de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nJe dois dire que par contre, en vertu de l\u2019article 43 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure confirm\u00e9s par la Cour de Revision ne sont pas susceptibles d\u2019appels \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nNous avons donc \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si dans la pr\u00e9sente cause le jugement a quo a confirm\u00e9 celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nComme on le voit, l\u2019action n\u00e9gatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour de Revision. Suivant la demande qui en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l\u2019action, la d\u00e9fenderesse fut condamn\u00e9e, en outre, \u00e0 faire certains travaux.\nEn Cour Sup\u00e9rieure on avait ordonn\u00e9 de faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires.\nEn Cour de Revision on a sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 que les travaux devraient \u00eatre faits suivant la convention des parties. Mais dans son principe le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est le m\u00eame; on a simplement sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 plus clairement la nature des travaux \u00e0 faire.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de doute que la partie du jugement qui maintenait l\u2019action n\u00e9gatoire puisse \u00eatre port\u00e9e devant cette cour. En effet, la Cour de Revision sur ce point a confirm\u00e9 simplement le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la compagnie appelante n\u2019aurait pas le droit d\u2019aller devant la Cour du Banc du Roi pour faire renverser cette partie du jugement.\nC\u2019est du moins la pratique suivie par la Cour du Banc du Roi depuis la d\u00e9cision rendue en 1876 dans la cause de Beauch\u00eane v. LaBaie[7]. Et la Cour Supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens dans la cause de Bull Electric Co. v. Cl\u00e9ment[8].\nL\u2019autre partie du jugement qui d\u00e9termine comment les travaux devront \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s n\u2019est que la cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019action n\u00e9gatoire elle-m\u00eame. Elle ne touche pas \u00e0 la substance du litige, mais elle rend plus explicite l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nElle enl\u00e8ve, il est vrai, au demandeur la facult\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter lui-m\u00eame les travaux. Mais il ne se plaint pas de cela. Le jugement a quo d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9clare formellement que l\u2019on confirme celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est partiellement confirm\u00e9 ou infirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision, la Cour Supr\u00eame devra exercer sa discr\u00e9tion pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre port\u00e9 directement devant elle, ou bien s\u2019il doit au pr\u00e9alable \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 la Cour de Banc du Roi.\nGarsonnet, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, vol. 5, p. 328.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur a voulu \u00e9videmment \u00e9viter les appels trop nombreux et alors il a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les jugements confirm\u00e9s par la Cour de Revision seraient imm\u00e9diatement port\u00e9s au Conseil Priv\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame. Dans les jugements partiellement confirm\u00e9s, la Cour Supr\u00eame rencontrera certainement mieux les vues du l\u00e9gislateur en permettant de suite l\u2019appel qu\u2019en ordonnant aux parties de passer par la Cour de Banc du Roi.\nLes motions doivent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9es avec d\u00e9pens.\nMotions refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, Parent & Fitzpatrick.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bellean, Baillargeon & Belleau.\n[1] 10 R.L. 115.\n[2] 41 Can.

Lapointe v. Messier (49 Can. S.C.r. 271) followed.\nPer Duff J.\u2014In the circumstances of the case the pretended contract was ultra vires and void and no right of property passed to the company. Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche (l.r. 7 h.l. 653) followed. And, further, as the notary before whom the deed in question was executed was, at the time of its execution, an official of the company assuming to purchase the lands, the deed was without validity as an authentic conveyance of the lands to the company.\nPer Idington J., dissenting.\u2014As the plaintiff obtained his conveyance in circumstances which placed him in the same position as the vendor, who had knowingly entered into the illicit contract with the company and to whom the right of recovery was not open, there could be no relief given by the courts as prayed in the action.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 43 S.C. 50) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review[1], affirming the judgment of St. Pierre J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe plaintiff, respondent, acquired certain lands in the District of Montreal, from one Drolet, in November, 1907, by notarial deed, duly registered. The Ph\u0153nix Land Improvement Company, a company incorporated under the statutes of the Province of Quebec, and empowered to deal in real estate, had, in June, 1905, acquired the same lands from Drolet, by virtue of a deed of conveyance executed before a notary who was, at the time of the execution of the deed, president of the company. To the knowledge of Drolet, the lands had been acquired by the company for the purpose of enabling it to carry on a lottery scheme and a portion of them was, in fact, made use of for that purpose. In these circumstances the plaintiff brought the action against the company which, after the institution of the action, was dissolved on proceedings by scire facias instituted by the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec. The appellant was appointed curator for the purpose of the liquidation of the company and took the place of the original defendant in the action. At the trial in the Superior Court the plaintiff's action was maintained, he was declared to be the lawful owner of the property in dispute and the deed to the company was set aside as null and void. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from. The questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLamar die K.C. for the appellant.\nSt. Germain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is the curator of the estate of a company which has been dissolved on account of its carrying on the illegal business of a lottery.\nCertain lands had been conveyed to it by one Drolet, as he says (and the courts below find as a fact), for the express purpose of promoting said lottery business. This deed of conveyance was registered. Drolet wants his property back and to get the benefit of it after having thus used it.\nEighteen months after instituting proceedings in the way of prosecuting officers of the company for carrying on the lottery, Drolet conveyed the lands in question to respondent Bedard, who would seem thereby to stand in no higher position in law than Drolet himself.\nThe appellant contests the finding of fact by the courts below. Though there is a good deal to be said for his contention, especially as the learned judges were not unanimous in such finding and it largely turns upon the inferences to be drawn from a contre lettre which is capable of a double meaning, I do not find it necessary, in the view I take of the rights of the respondent in law to maintain the action, to express an opinion upon the correctness of this finding of fact. I assume, therefore, for argument's sake, that these findings were quite correct and that Drolet, and the company which the appellant, as curator, represents, entered upon a lottery scheme clearly contrary to law, and that he, to enable the illegal scheme (indeed, most fraudulent as he presents it) to become operative, contributed these lands and got nothing in return therefor but some evidence of promises to be fulfilled in the devious ways that he and some of the company's officers had designed and contrived might have worked out to their mutual benefit as, to put it plainly, a set of rascals.\nIt does not occur to me that in law our courts of justice are either bound or permitted to help such a man, when seeing his venture is likely to prove unprofitable for him, to retire therefrom unscathed with all his property.\nIt is a pretty strong proposition in itself, but when it is made to operate (as presumably it does here, or may, if we dismiss this appeal, in the like case any day) to the detriment of creditors, who must be presumed innocent, I cannot assent thereto.\nThe articles 989 and 990 of the Civil Code are relied upon by respondent to shew that the contract was without effect. But how far does that carry him?\nThe contract was completely executed and there was a consideration. That consideration may be said to be tainted with illegality. The question in such case is whether or not the respondent can rely upon articles 1047 and 1048 of the Civil Code, or otherwise be enabled to recover back what he has given, with his eyes open, not ignorantly, or induced thereto by false pretences, by another party, but as the result of his own planning.\nCounsel referred to the case of the Consumers' Cordage Company v. Connelly[3], and the authorities collected therein so laboriously by the late Mr. Justice Girouard.\nUnfortunately for the respondent the result of that rather unsatisfactory case was that the judgment was ultimately set aside in the Privy Council and a new trial ordered (see note on front page iv. of 33 Can. S.C.R.), and in itself, therefore, as well as for other reasons, cannot be held a binding authority for the proposition he has to maintain herein.\nThe facts of that case, so far as seen from different points of view by the judges taking part in it, seemed to entitle the plaintiff to a recovery quite independently of the view maintained by Mr. Justice Girouard. In short, the point here involved was not necessary to be decided by the court for the determination of that case, or any part of it.\nThe decision in the case of L'Association St. Jean-Baptiste de Montreal v. Brault[4], seems much more in point. It was a case arising out of a lottery held, in violation of the Criminal Code, as this was according to the finding of fact, which I assume for the present to be correct, and to recover a sum of over $2,000 interest earned by a deposit which it was arranged should he made in a bank and, barring the law rendering the transaction illegal, that earning of interest certainly, as Mr. Justice Girouard put it, at page 617, might be said in common honesty to belong to the plaintiff. The appeal, however, was allowed in that case and the action dismissed.\nIt is to be observed this was decided a few months before the Consumers' Cordage Case[5], and that Mr. Justice Sedgewick assented to the judgment which, certainly of necessity, decides the neat point of the right to recover back entirely the other way from what in the Consumers' Cordage Case5, Mr. Justice Girouard argued for. I take it that Mr. Justice Sedgewick in the later case was not changing his mind, but merely concurred in the result. That result might have been reached quite independently of the reasons which Mr. Justice Girouard proceeded upon by the application of the law relative to allowing or disallowing interest which was all that was involved.\nSo far, therefore, as this court is concerned that would seem decisive of this case unless it can be distinguished in the way some authorities seem to make by a distinction between the principal and interest or fruits of that sought to be recovered back.\nIn that case amongst many other cases relied upon by counsel for appellant, was the case of McKibbin v. McCone[6], wherein Mr. Justice Routhier not only denied the right to recover back the moneys paid under an illegal contract, but supported his views by an elaborate collection of authorities and a vigorous judgment wherein he maintained the law which has been so well expressed by the Roman maxim \u201cex turpi causa non oritur actio\u201d and has stood, as good law, so long and in so many countries.\nI do not intend going into a review of the authorities. I merely desire to point out that the provisions of articles 1047 and 1048 of the Civil Code do not seem to me to extend to an action of this kind under such circumstances as exist here.\nI think the line may be drawn where the opinion judgment of Boss\u00e9 J. speaking for the majority in the case of Rolland v. La Caisse D'Economie Notre-Dame de Quebec[7] puts it. That case, like Langlais v. La Caisse D'Economie Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec[8], decided by Andrews J., in truth revolves round consequences of corporate acts done ultra vires. In this latter the learned judge seems to recognize the same line as Boss\u00e9 J.\nI would put contracts for promoting lotteries and other criminal acts (distinguishable from those merely invalid) amongst those which are contrary to good morals.\nThere are no doubt many cases of another character such as acts ultra vires and possibly mere municipal regulations, or enactments imposing a penalty in cases involving hardly (if any) moral turpitude, which might give rise to other considerations though in a sense illegal. Counsel on each side put in since argument, a supplementary factum, and I have given attention to the cases therein referred to.\nI am surprised to see myself quoted in the case of Lapointe v. Messier[9], as countenancing the doctrine respondent contends for. Certainly nothing was further from my thoughts. I thought I was, as I generally try to be, careful to avoid any unnecessary expression of opinion, and certainly expressed none on the point raised herein. I was well aware then, as now, of the divergent views that were held on the subject. The facts in that case, as I viewed them, and the conduct of appellant aided me to view them, did not permit the question being raised, and I expressly said:\u2014\nThere is no room left for arguing that this is a suit to recover back that already paid. If there were I should have to consider the effect of 58 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 11, cited in the appellant's factum.\nThat section 11 is as follows and differs from the provisions of the Civil Code.\nEvery person who has paid any money, commission, fee or reward, to any member of a municipal council for services performed or to be performed by such member of the municipal council, in his official capacity, whether it be service rendered by himself, directly or indirectly, or through a third party, or for the prosecution of any business before the council or before any committee thereof, may recover the same, at any time, by suit at law, in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIt seems to have escaped the attention of the courts in some other cases as well as the counsel in this case.\nAnd, with great respect, I still think that it was not necessary to the decision of the Lapointe Case[10] to decide the question raised herein.\nNotwithstanding the conflict of authorities and of opinion, I think public morality is best served by an adherence to the principle expressed in the Roman maxim already cited.\nAnd as to the cases in which, under articles 1047 and 1048 of the Civil Code, the recovery back may be allowed, this court is on record in the case of Petry v. La Caisse D'Economie de Notre Dame de Quebec[11], against it where, in the view of the court, there was no error but clear intention. In principle that case seems to me though involving many different considerations from what we are presented with herein, adverse to respondent. The efficacy of illegality as an answer to the action has been recognized in Quebec in many cases, for example, in Ferguson v. Scott[12], where purchase money stipulated in a transaction arising out of a lottery was held to be non-recoverable. Are we to say the converse is correct and that a man who got his price can recover back his land and keep the price?\nIn LeBlanc v. Beaudoin et B\u00e9dard[13], where a convicted felon could not recover an immovable given in way of compromise of the felony, and Massue v. Dansereau[14], where held money paid for excessive interest when usury laws in force could not be recovered back, with others, shew the jurisprudence of Quebec is not, to say the least, unanimously established in respondent's favour.\nI, therefore, think this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I express no opinion upon the question which was discussed whether according to the law of Quebec (art. 989 C.C.), in the circumstances of this case, the respondent was entitled in strict law to the judgment prayed, without regard to possible equities affecting creditors and others interested in the company.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed upon the ground that the pretended contract of purchase was in the circumstances ultra vires of the company; and that under this pretended contract (the notarial acte de vente has, in my opinion, no validity as an authentic deed by reason of the fact that the notary being an officer of the company purchaser and lacking, therefore, the essential quality of indifference between the parties was incompetent) no right of property passed to the company.\nThe doctrine of ultra vires I have no doubt applies to the contract of the Ph\u0153nix Land Improvement Company. That doctrine is not a principle of the English common law and does not rest upon any theory as to the nature of corporations or as to the legal relationship subsisting between a corporation and its governing body. (See the judgments of Lord Cairns in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[15], of Lord Haldane in Sinclair v. Brougham[16], and Bonanza Greek Gold Mining Co. v. The King[17].) It is a rule resting upon the interpretation of the legislative enactments through which the companies to which it applies derive their corporate existence and capacity. The Phoenix Land Improvement Company, while created through the instrumentality of letters patent, exists as a corporation and enjoys such capacity as it possesses in virtue of the Quebec statute in pursuance of which the letters patent were granted, and I think the reasoning of Lord Cairns in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche15 applies to that statute.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal on the ground that the deed from Drolet to the land company was void for illegality and that property transferred for an illicit consideration may be recovered back. Article 989 C.C. Lapointe v. Messier[18]. Brodeur J.\u2014Le contrat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait entre la compagnie Ph\u0153nix Land Improvement et Drolet le 28 juin, 1905, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment fait dans le but d'exploiter une loterie. La preuve sur ce point est, il est vrai, un peu contradictoire, mais les termes de la contre-lettre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Drolet doivent faire dispara\u00eetre tout doute \u00e0 ce sujet.\nD'ailleurs il s'agirait l\u00e0 d'une question de fait et, les cours inf\u00e9rieures s'\u00e9tant prononc\u00e9es sur ce point contre les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant, il n'y a pas lieu pour nous de renverser cette opinion.\nL'exploitation d'une loterie ne pouvait facilement se faire par cette compagnie sans avoir certains lots de terrain et alors Drolet, qui \u00e9tait actionnaire de la compagnie et bien au courant de ses affaires, a consenti par cet acte du 28 juin, 1905, \u00e0 lui passer un titre pour ces lots de terre. C'\u00e9tait de sa part et de la part de la compagnie une participation \u00e0 une violation de la loi et \u00e0 une fraude que l'on voulait pratiquer sur un public cr\u00e9dule.\nToute consid\u00e9ration d'un contrat est ill\u00e9gale si elle est prohib\u00e9e par la loi ou contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public (art. 990 C.C.), et ce contrat est sans effet. (Art. 989 C.C.; Association St. Jean-Baptiste v.

Through W.\u2019s agency a contract was entered into whereby a company in Toronto agreed to purchase from the Quebec company during one year paper of a specified kind to the extent of not less than $35,000 to be furnished from time to time on receipt of specifications and directions as to destination. When paper to the value of over $5,000 had been shipped under this contract the Toronto company refused to furnish further specifications on the ground that said paper was not satisfactory and the contract was not further performed.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. (Duff J. contra), that the contract with the Toronto company constituted an \u201caccepted order\u201d within the terms of the agreement with W. who, as it was through the fault of his principals that the contract was not performed, was entitled to the balance of his commission on the contract price of $35,000.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014If under the contract the only \u201caccepted orders\u201d were those filled from time to time on receipt of specifications and directions from the purchasers the discontinuance of their sending in the same was due to the failure of the vendors to furnish satisfactory paper and W. was entitled to damages for being prevented by such failure from earning his commission. As the evidence shewed that he had done all that could be incumbent upon him to have the contract performed the measure of his damages would be his commission on the contract price.\nPer Duff J. dissenting.\u2014The only \u201caccepted orders\u201d under the con- tract were those to be filled from time to time on receipt of specifications. As his case under the pleadings was confined to recovery of the commission on the basis of the contract with the Ontario company being an \u201caccepted order\u201d and as no claim was put forward (or investigated) at the trial on the basis of the appellant having wrongfully been prevented earning his commission by procuring \u201caccepted orders\u201d or advanced by the appellant at any stage of the proceedings, the judgment could not be sustained on that basis unless it was clear that all the evidence bearing upon such a claim was to be found in the record.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nHamilton Cassels K.C. for the appellant.\nMasten K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant\u2019s case is that he was entitled under the agreement with the respondent company to a commission \u201con all accepted orders,\u201d which is in the circumstances the equivalent of \u201call sales, whether followed by delivery or not,\u201d and that the contract with the Buntin, Reid Co. is a sale within the meaning of that commission agreement.\nThe whole case, therefore, depends upon the nature of the latter contract. I have no doubt that for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Middleton, the Buntin, Reid order once accepted constituted an agreement binding upon both parties to it. It contains the essential elements of a contract of sale, the thing sold is properly described and the respondents were thereafter entitled to the benefit of that contract if they wished to enforce it. That agreement should, in my opinion, be treated as an accepted order.\nThe trial judge found, and that finding is not disturbed, that the Buntin, Reid Co. was able to pay for the goods and that the default in carrying out the agreement was wholly attributable to the respondent company. The appellant is, therefore, entitled to his commission.\nIt is urged that with the concurrence of the appellant a rebate of 10c. a hundred pounds on paper to be supplied under the contract was to be allowed the Buntin, Reid Co. There is no doubt that,such an arrangement was made, and the only question is:\u2014Who was to pay the rebate?\nI would be disposed to hold that the evidence is not sufficient to justify the deduction of that rebate out of the appellant\u2019s commission, but out of deference to the opinions of my brother judges, I agree that the deduction should be made.\nI would allow the appeal for the balance with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent by a letter dated 15th January, 1912, agreed to pay appellant a commission of five per cent. on all accepted orders.\nHe acting thereunder procured a binding contract duly executed between the Buntin Reid Company and respondent whereby the former bound themselves to purchase from the latter during a period of one year, not less than thirty-five thousand dollars worth of paper at a price named, and of a kind specified, to be fully up to the standard of samples submitted, and to be shipped as directed, from time to time to points named in Ontario.\nIt is contended that contract was not, though duly executed and binding upon the purchaser, an order within the meaning of the said obligation.\nThe learned trial judge held it was such an order and entered judgment accordingly but the Appellate Division, holding it was not such an order, reversed the judgment.\nThe first, and as Mr. Justice Middleton appropriately calls it the dominating and controlling, clause of the letter of the contract is followed by a paragraph therein which is relied upon by the Appellate Division. It provides that\nthis commission shall be payable immediately the order is shipped and failing the customer paying the account, we shall deduct from the first settlement with you the commission paid on said order.\nIf this term \u201cshipped\u201d is to be construed as the Appellate Division seems to hold, it would have been quite competent for the respondent to have dishonoured every order got, no matter how much labour or expense appellant may have been put to in obtaining same. I cannot think that ever could have been contemplated by the parties; so the term \u201cshipped\u201d must be given a more reasonable meaning and not as applicable to what might but for the default of the respondent have been shipped.\nThen the provision that the commission might have been deducted in the event of the customer failing to pay, certainly cannot apply to the case of non-shipment. It seems clearly pointed to the sensible meaning of the case of the customer through want of means or failure to meet his obligations making de- fault in payment. It certainly, even in such a case does not extend to a time when the customer had ultimately paid. It is not necessary to solve all the riddles within the expression, but as I read that, it was designed, merely to secure orders being got from first-class customers, of good financial standing, and thus to enlist the assistance of appellant in securing the easy collection of accounts.\nIt does not seem to me that either of these terms of that clause were designed to cover the case which has arisen.\nThe Buntin, Reid Company\u2019s firm admittedly stands high in the commercial world and no question can arise as to their financial responsibility.\nIt seems they refrained from giving specifications for further deliveries because of respondent having failed to live up to its contract. If so the appellant is not to be deprived of his commission on their accepted order, any more than the real estate agent, whose commission has been earned by a mere introduction or actual sale, no matter how little may come of the transaction later through any one of a multiplicity of causes likely to arise in such dealings.\nIf this order failed through no fault of respondent to produce the specifications enabling delivery within its terms, then a right of action accrued to the respondent against the Buntin, Reid Company for damages which would include (not in terms but incidentally by reason of the legal measure of damages in such a case) this very commission.\nIt would be somewhat anomalous if after defeating appellant here, respondent sued and got such damages. How could Buntin, Reid & Company an- swer their default and ask any consideration for what had happened in this action?\nIf respondent failed by reason of its own default then it surely cannot be excused herein.\nIt seems to me that it never was intended the provision in this second clause meant any more than that on the one hand the time of shipment was a convenient term for payments, and to be read as if shipped or ought to be shipped, and on the other hand a spur to stimulate appellant and not a means of depriving him ultimately of all compensation.\nThe third clause seems to put that beyond doubt. It is as follows:\u2014\nYou shall have the exclusive agency for the Province of Ontario with the above exception and at any time this agreement should cease we shall pay you on all accepted orders up to the termination of this agreement.\nHis engagement ceased before this action and this term of the contract thus came into operation.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the trial judgment be restored.\nSince writing the foregoing I find some of my brother judges proceeding upon a ground neither taken in the pleadings nor in the notice of appeal to the Appellate Division nor in the factums here, to cut down the amount claimed. Indeed, the factum of respondent signed by able and experienced counsel puts the matter in dispute in appeal neatly thus:\u2014\nSo that the issue is narrowed to the question whether or not the respondents are bound under the terms of the documents hereinafter set forth to pay to the appellant a commission on paper which has never been supplied because orders specifying the necessary particulars of same were never received. In other words, the question in dispute is narrowed to whether or not the respondents should pay the said sum of $1,491.36. I most respectfully dissent from such a departure from the grounds upon which the case has heretofore proceeded.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur in the construction put upon the phrase \u201caccepted order,\u201d in the letter of the 15th January, 1912, by the first appellate division.\nThat seems to be sufficient to dispose of the appellant\u2019s claim as presented in the statement of claim. It was suggested, however, during the course of the argument, from the bench, and after some hesitation the appellant\u2019s counsel, who had not taken the ground in his factum, accepted the suggestion, that there was evidence sufficient to support a claim on the ground that the respondents had by their conduct wrongfully prevented the appellant earning his commission by procuring \u201caccepted orders\u201d on the principle expressed by Mr. Justice Willes in Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee, T. and C. Plantation Co.[1], in a passage adopted by the Judicial Committee in Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[2], at page 626, as follows:\u2014\nI apprehend that wherever money is to be paid by one man to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay, is liable to the party who is to receive the money if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that he should receive it.\nIt is true that there is some evidence and perhaps on the case as it stands sufficient evidence can be collected to justify (standing by itself) the inference that it was the failure of the respondents to live up to the terms of their contract with the Buntin Reid Co. of the 4th June, 1912, which the appellant had procured that led to a discontinuance of the sending of orders by the Buntin Reid Co. under the terms of that contract, and thereby prevented the earning of commissions which would have been earned if orders had been sent and filled as contemplated by the contract.\nThat, however, was not the case made by the plaintiff on the pleadings and I do not think it can fairly be said that any such case was investigated at the trial. In order to understand exactly what did happen at the trial it is perhaps necessary to glance at the pleadings. In paragraph 6 of the statement of claim it is alleged that the plaintiff obtained many orders for the defendants which were accepted by the defendants. In paragraph 7 particulars of the orders obtained by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendants in respect of which the defendants have not paid to the plaintiff the stipulated remuneration, are given; and amongst the orders specified there is this:\u2014June 4th, 1912, order of Buntin Reid Co., $35,000. The statement of defence in paragraph 3 meets this claim as follows:\u2014\nSave and except the orders as hereinafter mentioned none of the orders referred to in the statement of claim were accepted, shipped and paid for to or by customers in the plaintiff\u2019s district in the province of Ontario\nthe exceptions comprising a number of orders amounting to $1,444.63. Then in paragraph 5, the defendant company says that the commission on the whole of the Buntin Reid contract never became payable on the following grounds: (a) The paper was not sufficiently specified in the contract to make it possible to ship the goods without further instructions;\n(b) The particulars necessary were not stated in the contract; (c) Orders were never given nor were goods ever shipped or paid for except those on which the plaintiff has received commission.\nBesides joining issue, the plaintiff meets this defence by alleging that the non-delivery of the goods to the Buntin Reid Co. to the value of $35,000 was occasioned entirely by the defendants\u2019 default, \u201cthe Buntin Reid Co. being at all times ready to take delivery if the defendant company on its part had been ready and able to deliver the same.\u201d\nThe plaintiff\u2019s case on the pleadings therefore was that the agreement with the Buntin Reid Company was an \u201caccepted order\u201d within the meaning of the letter of the 15th of Jan., 1912, and that the condition that the commission should be payable \u201cimmediately the order is shipped\u201d in the second paragraph of the letter had become inoperative because the non\u2011shipment of goods was due to the default of the defendant company.\nThat was the plaintiff\u2019s case on the pleadings. At the trial that case was supported by evidence put forward to shew that the Buntin Reid Company had discontinued sending orders because of the difficulty of getting their orders filled; in short because of the failure of the defendants to fulfil their contract. It is important to emphasize the point for the purposes of the question now under discussion that the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim here is the proposition that the contract with Buntin Reid was an \u201caccepted order\u201d within the first paragraph of the letter referred to.\nThe alleged default of the respondents in the performance of their contract is not put forward as the Substantive ground of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged right of recovery as shewing, in other words, that the respondents had by their conduct wrongfully prevented the appellant obtaining \u201caccepted orders,\u201d but for the purpose, as I have already mentioned, of shewing that the condition comprised in paragraph 2 had become inoperative. The learned trial judge held that the plaintiff had established his right to recover on this basis his judgment shewing very clearly that he was not passing upon any claim of the character now suggested.\nThe contract in the first place provides for payment of commission on all accepted orders, and this, I think, is the dominating and controlling clause, to which all other provisions are subsidiary. This general provision is followed by a clause providing that the commission is to be payable \u201cimmediately the order is shipped, and failing the customer paying the account we shall deduct from the first settlement with you the commission paid on said order.\u201d\nIt is contended by defendant that this limits the generality of the primary obligation and shews that the commission is not to be paid unless the order is actually shipped.\nI do not think that this is the true construction of the clause. The parties were contracting upon the assumption that each would perform its obligations. The commission was to be paid upon all orders accepted. Some of these orders would be for immediate delivery, some for future delivery. The commission was not to be paid until the goods were shipped, that is, until the time provided for shipment. The defendants cannot free themselves from liability to pay commission, by breach of contract.\nThe Buntin, Reid Company are undoubtedly of good financial standing, and, if they are in default, can readily be made answerable for damages. I think the defendant is in this dilemma: If the failure to complete the Buntin, Reid contract arose from its own fault, then it must pay the plaintiff\u2019s commission. If the failure arises from the fault of the Buntin Reid Company, the defendant has an adequate right of action against them for damages, and this does not relieve them from payment of commission.\nIf driven to determine the issue as to whose fault it was that the contract was not completed, I should find that the defendant and not the Buntin Reid Company were to blame. In every aspect of the case the plaintiff, I think, is entitled to succeed.\nThe basis of all this is, of course, the proposition upon which the learned judge\u2019s judgment is founded namely, that the Buntin Reid contract constituted an \u201caccepted order\u201d within the letter to the plaintiff.\nThe result is that the ground of relief now suggested that the respondents\u2019 conduct by preventing the appellant from obtaining orders precludes them from denying that \u201caccepted orders\u201d were obtained for the amount of $35,000, was never investigated at the trial. While a good deal of the evidence that was given would have been quite relevant to that issue the respondents were not called upon to meet it and judgment cannot be given against them upon an issue which they were never called upon to meet, by reason of evidence put forward alio intuitu unless indeed we could be satisfied that we have all the evidence that could be produced before us now. The respondents were entitled to go into court meeting the claim of the appellant which was based upon the proposition that the Buntin Reid contract was an \u201caccepted order\u201d within the meaning of the letter, by simply denying that proposition. Succeeding in this the appellant\u2019s case as put forward is destroyed at its foundation. In these circumstances as has been pointed out again and again in the judgments of this court as well as of other courts of appeal, we should be running the gravest risk of doing injustice by allowing a case now to be made on another foundation at this stage. Rudimentary fair play forbids it.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, subject, however, to a reduction in the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery as stated below. On one possible construction of the agreement between the plaintiff and defendants his commission was earned when the defendants saw fit to accept the offer, or order, which he had procured for them from The Buntin Reid Company. In that view his right to payment would arise when the order was shipped, or, in the event of the order not being filled, when the time for filling it according to its terms had elapsed. The defendants might have declined to accept the order in the form in which it was procured. They might have insisted upon its being in such form that further specification by the purchasers would not be necessary. They saw fit to accept it, and it may be that it was an \u201caccepted order\u201d within the meaning of that term in their agreement with the plaintiff. But 1 am not altogether satisfied that the construction put upon the correspondence by the Appellate Division was not correct, namely, that \u201caccepted orders\u201d meant orders upon which, without further specification of the goods to be supplied, the defendants should be entitled to make delivery and thereupon to sue for the price. I proceed to deal with the case on this footing.\nThe order, if it may be so termed, obtained by the plaintiff from the Buntin Reid Company was subsequently filled in part. That it was not wholly filled was, on the evidence, due to the failure of the defendants to furnish, upon the specifications which were sent them by the Buntin Reid Company, goods of a satisfactory quality and in compliance with their obligations. It may be that the defendants\u2019 failure to supply satisfactory goods upon these early specifications did not relieve the Buntin Reid Company from their obligation to send in further specifications to the extent stipulated in their contract. But if the failure of the defendants to obtain such further specifications and directions for shipment was ascribable to their own default in supplying goods of a merchantable quality and in compliance with the contract, whatever may have been the effect upon the legal rights of the defendants and the Buntin Reid Company inter se, the plaintiff was thereby prevented from becoming entitled to payment of his commission, if, in order that he should become so entitled it was necessary that the Buntin Reid Company should send in specifications and directions for shipment. Under these circumstances the plaintiff would be entitled to recover damages from his principals. If he had done all that was incumbent upon him in order to earn his commission on the Buntin Reid order, and if the sole reason why the contract made through him was not fully carried out was the default of the defendants, his damages would be the amount of the commission itself. If there was still something to be done by him in the discharge of his duty to the defendants\u2014for instance, if it was part of his obligation to procure the actual specifications and shipping directions from the Buntin Reid Company and he had not taken the steps necessary for that purpose, although he had omitted to do so solely because he knew it would be labour wasted in view of the refusal of that company to take further shipments\u2014his damages would be somewhat less than the full amount of his commission. I am not satisfied that it was part of the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to procure such specifications and shipping directions. Had it not been for the de- faults of the defendants in regard to the early shipments, further specifications and shipping directions would, in all probability, have come to them from The Buntin Reid Company without any further solicitation or intervention on the part of the plaintiff. But upon the evidence it appears that the plaintiff in fact did his utmost to obtain such further specifications and directions and that his efforts proved unavailing solely because The Buntin Reid Company declined to take chances of incurring liability for damages to their own customers through supplying to them such defective and unmerchantable goods as the defendants had furnished upon the first specifications sent to them. These defaults of the defendants were beyond any reasonable doubt the real cause why The Buntin Reid Company did not take from them goods in quantity greater than the minimum of $35,000 worth stipulated for in their order or contract. But for those defaults the defendants would, in all human probability, have had from The Buntin Reid Company demands for paper in excess of the minimum quantity specified in their contract. In point of fact The Buntin Reid Company purchased, during the currency of their contract with the defendants, from other paper mills, at a price materially higher than that which they had agreed to give to the defendants, $46,940.23 worth of paper of the class and quality covered by their contract with the defendants. If, therefore, the plaintiff did not fully earn his commission by procuring an order which the defendants accepted, and if in order to fully earn it he was further obliged to obtain specifications and shipping directions from the Buntin Reid Company, he was prevented by the default of the de- fendants themselves from obtaining such specifications and directions although he made the necessary efforts to do so, and in that view of the case he is entitled by way of damages to a sum equivalent to the commission which he was thus prevented from earning.\nThe respondent objects that in his statement of claim the plaintiff confines his demand to the recovery of commission eo nomine and does not prefer an alternative claim for damages on the footing that the defendants had prevented his earning his commission, and that he should not now be allowed to recover on such an alternative claim. In his reply, however, the defendant alleges the facts necessary to support such an alternative claim, and at the trial these facts, which could be relevant only if a claim for damages on the basis indicated was to be considered, were fully gone into in evidence. Under these circumstances there is no difficulty in dealing with the case as if a prayer for the alternative relief had been formally included in the statement of claim. Nor can the defendants very well object to this being done, since it was pressed at bar on their behalf that a matter of defence presently to be dealt with, which they did not plead and to which I find no allusion in the judgment of the trial judge, in their reasons of appeal to the Appellate Division, or in their factum in this court, should now be taken into consideration.\nThe defendants allege that when the bargain with The Buntin Reid Company was made it was arranged, with the concurrence of the plaintiff, that the purchasers should be allowed a rebate of ten cents a hundred pounds on paper to be supplied under the contract, and that this rebate should be paid by the plain- tiff out of his commission. That an arrangement for such a rebate was made is common ground. The plaintiff, however, denies that he was to pay it. Although this arrangement is not pleaded in the statement of defence, nor alluded to in the Appellate Division, nor in the respondents\u2019 factum, it was investigated at the trial. The evidence upon it of the plaintiff and that of the defendants\u2019 manager is in direct conflict. The question, however, is concluded against the plaintiff, in my opinion, by two letters written by him to the defendants on April 19th 1913, and April 30th, 1913, in the first of which he says:\u2014\nI refuse to further continue allowing them (The Buntin, Reid Company) a rebate on my portion of that commission,\nand in the second, alluding to this former letter, he speaks of\nthe continuance of allowing them a rebate of a portion of the commission paid me.\nThese letters are not satisfactorily explained. While the agreement for the rebate was discreditable to the defendants, it was not of such an illegal or illicit character that they are precluded from claiming the benefit of it as against the plaintiff. Calculated on the basis of the price mentioned in the contract, the plaintiff\u2019s full commission of 5 per cent. would amount to 32\u00bd cents on every hundred pounds of paper to be supplied. Deducting from this ten cents per hundred pounds would leave his net commission 22\u00bd cents per hundred pounds. His recovery for commission at the trial, where this partial defence was not given effect to, was $1,596.43 of which $1,491.36 represented commission on the Buntin Reid order. This would be at the rate of 32\u00bd cents per hundred pounds. The ten cents a hundred pounds rebate would amount to $458.88. Deducting this sum from the total recovery $1,596.43 there is a balance of $1,137.55 and that is the sum for which the plaintiff is, in my opinion, entitled to judgment.\nI think the plaintiff should have his costs of the appeals to this court and the Appellate Division, as well as his costs of the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cassels, Brock, Kelley & Falconbridge.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Masten, Starr & Spence.\n[1] 17 C.B., N.S., 733.\n[2] [1910] A.C. 614.\n",

Chicoutimi Pulp Co., (1915) 51 S.C.R. 179\nDate: 1915-03-15\nWilliam Price (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Chicoutimi Pulp Company (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1914: November 11, 12; 1915: March 15.\nPresent: Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019s BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nLibel\u2014Business reputation\u2014Action by incorporated company\u2014Truth of facts alleged\u2014Fair comment\u2014Justification\u2014Public interest\u2014Qualified privilege\u2014Charge to jury\u2014Misdirection\u2014Misleading statements\u2014Practice\u2014Evidence of special damage\u2014New trial.\nThere being a dispute between the parties as to the ownership of certain lands, the plaintiffs, a commercial corporation, obtained special legislation vesting the lands in question in the company. On becoming aware of this legislation, the defendant published letters in several newspapers accusing the company of obtaining it by political influence and preventing him vindicating his title in the courts. In an action to recover damages for libel, the trial judge told the jury that the defendant\u2019s defence of justification would be established if they were satisfied that, although in fact untrue, the defamatory statements had been made in honest belief of their truth, and that, if the publications were an honest comment on the facts as stated, that, in itself, would be sufficient to establish the defence of fair comment. On the findings of the jury, judgment was entered for the defendant, but this judgment was set aside, on the ground of misdirection, by the judgment appealed from and a new trial ordered.\nHeld, per curiam, that where a libel conveys imputations calculated to injure a trading corporation in respect of its business the corporation can maintain an action for damages.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The publication complained of was capable of being read as charging the company with having used political influence for the purpose of procuring legislation giving it possession of property in derogation of what, to its knowledge, were the defendant\u2019s rights, and this was an imputation calculated to injure the commercial corporation in its business.\nHeld, per Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., Davies J. dissenting.\u2014That the directions by the trial judge as to the defences of justification and fair comment were erroneous and misleading. Per Davies J. dissenting.\u2014Taken as a whole, the charge of the trial judge was clear and explicit and placed the material issues fairly before the jury, and, consequently, the judgment entered at the trial on the findings of the jury ought not to be disturbed.\nPer Anglin J. dissenting.\u2014That, as a judge could not properly rule or a jury reasonably find that the defendant\u2019s letters were calculated to injure the property of the plaintiff\u2019s or their business reputation, as a commercial corporation, they could not recover without proof of special damage.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 22 K.B. 393) affirmed, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], setting aside the judgment entered in the Superior Court, District of Quebec, on the findings of the jury, by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed with costs, and ordering a new trial without costs.\nThe trial took place before His Lordship Mr. Justice Dorion and a jury and, in answer to questions submitted to them, the jury found that the allegations in the letters published by the defendant, as mentioned in the head-note, were substantially true, that the matter therein referred to was one of public interest, that the defendant had made the publications in the interest of the public and in good faith, and that no damage had been thereby caused to the plaintiffs. On these findings the learned trial judge entered judgment for the defendant. On an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the judgment entered by the trial judge was set aside on the ground of misdirections in the charge to the jury and a new trial was ordered, Trenholm J. dissenting. From this judgment the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking to have the judgment in the Superior Court restored, and the defendants cross-appealed on the ground that the Court of King\u2019s Bench erred in refusing to allow them their costs on the appeal to that court.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and L. St. Laurent for the appellant and cross-respondent.\nE. Belleau K.C. and A. Taschereau K.C. for the respondents and cross-appellants.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014 This was an action brought by the respondents, an incorporated company, against the appellant for an alleged libel contained in a letter published by him in the public newspapers charging the company with having promoted the passage of a bill through the Legislature of the Province of Quebec transferring to them certain property which the plaintiff claimed as his, and characterizing it as an act of spoliation and theft. The alleged libel charged that\nthe intention of the promoters was to obtain a legislative title to property which the Chicoutimi Pulp Company pretended to own but its title to which was manifestly so insufficient that it was afraid to submit it to the test of a legal decision;\nand, after saying he was advised that though the intention of the promoters was clear, it was doubtful whether the object had been obtained, he goes on to say:\u2014\nShould i find that my property really has been transferred to the Chicoutimi Pulp Company i shall come back to the legislature to undo the injustice done and return the property stolen.\nThe trial of the action took place before Mr. Justice Dorion and resulted in certain findings of the jury in answer to questions submitted to them upon which findings the trial judge directed judgment to be entered for the defendant.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench set aside this judgment and directed a new trial to be had on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the jury. With great respect, however, I think that they were wrong and that their error arose from the fact which seems to have entirely escaped their attention that the proceedings of the legislature and its Private Bills Committee with respect to which the alleged libel was written was, at any rate so far as defendant was concerned whose legal rights as claimed by him were being dealt with, what is known as an occasion of qualified privilege. Such an occasion is one on which public comment and observation might properly be made in the absence of malice such comment being such as a jury would find to be fair and reasonable.\nThe letter complained of sets out the text of the clause proposed and added to the bill introduced in the Legislative Assembly for amending the plaintiff company\u2019s charter the latter words of which clause contain the words of enactment which the defendant so bitterly complained of, namely,\nand all the said lands are declared to have been and to be the property of the Chicoutimi Pulp Company.\n\u201cThe said lands\u201d included those to which the plaintiff claimed title and which he declared were by this legislative enactment sought to be transferred to and vested in the company.\nThe letter also sets out the amendment proposed by the Attorney-General when the bill reached the Private Bills Committee of the Legislative Council and accepted by that committee, which amendment omitted the objectionable words above quoted. The letter also states the proceedings in the council, when the bill was reported to them, restoring the clause with the objectionable words which had been elided by the committee and giving the names of those who voted pro and con.\nThe alleged libellous comment upon this action of the legislature and upon the company and such of its officers as were members of the legislature I have already given.\nThe questions for submission to the jury were in accordance with the practice of the Province of Quebec decided on and fixed by one of the judges after issue had been joined on the pleadings and before the action went down to trial.\nTwo important questions there were, it seems to me, which directly arose out of the action and on the determination of which it should be disposed of; one was whether the occasion was one of qualified privilege and the other whether defendant\u2019s comments were fair and legitimate criticism upon the facts.\nThe first question was for the trial judge to determine and, in my opinion, he did so correctly when he held the occasion one of qualified privilege.\nIn the case of Stuart v. Bell[2], at page 345, Lindley L.J. says:\u2014\nA privileged communication is one made on a privileged occasion, and fairly warranted by it, and not proved to have been made maliciously. A privileged occasion is one which is held in point of law to rebut the legal implication of malice which would otherwise be made from the utterance of untrue defamatory language. This is the effect, in a few words, of the leading cases on the subject.\nEver since the case of Wason v. Walter[3] was decided it has been held that fair reports of proceedings in Parliament, although disparaging to the character of individuals, have a common law immunity similar to reports of proceedings in courts of justice.\nWhether or not the subject matter of the comment or criticism is a matter of public interest is a question of law for the judge, but the matter defended as comment must be comment and not mere assertion of fact. A man cannot, under the pretence that what he is publishing is comment only, misrepresent the facts. But whether he has or has not misrepresented them comes within the province of the jury to determine and not the judge.\nThe other question, whether the comment was fair or not, it is much to be regretted, was not specifically submitted to the jury to answer.\nThe learned judge, however, was most careful in his charge to tell the jury that the criticism on such a qualified privileged occasion must be fair, reasonable and legitimate and that unless they found it to be so they should find a verdict for the plaintiffs and condemn the defendant.\nAs to what is fair and reasonable comment, I quote the opinion of Bowen L.J. in Merivale v. Carson[4], at page 283:\u2014\nThis leaves unsettled the inquiry, and perhaps it was intended in Campbell v. Spottiswoode[5] (a case which has never been questioned) to leave it unsettled, what is the standard for the jury of fair criticism? The criticism is to be fair, that is, the expression of it is to be fair. The only limitation is upon the mode of expression. In this country a man has a right to hold any opinion he pleases, and to express his opinion, provided that he does not go beyond the limits which the law calls fair, and, although, we cannot find in any decided case an exact and rigid definition of the word fair, this is because the judges have always preferred to leave the question what is \u201cfair\u201d to the jury.\nIn the case above referred to of Wason v. Walter[6], Lord Chief Justice Cockburn delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench after holding the publication of the reports of Parliamentary privilege as coming within the rules applicable to occasions of qualified privileges went on to say, at page 96:\u2014\nThe publication of the debate having been justifiable, the jury were properly told the subject was, for the reasons we have already adverted to, pre-eminently one of public interest and, therefore, one on which public comment and observation might properly be made, and that, consequently, the occasion was privileged in the absence of malice. As to the latter, the jury were told that they must be satisfied that the article was an honest and fair comment on the facts \u2014 in other words, that, in the first place, they must be satisfied that the comments had been made with an honest belief in their justice, but that this was not enough, inasmuch as such belief might originate in the blindness of party zeal, or in personal or political aversion; that a person taking upon himself publicly to criticize and to condemn the conduct or motives of another, must bring to the task, not only an honest sense of justice, but also a reasonable degree of judgment and moderation, so that the result may be what a jury shall deem, under the circumstances of the case, a fair and legitimate criticism on the conduct and motives of the party who is the object of censure.\nThe charge of the learned judge was very lengthy and was signed and fyled by him in the records of the court, as required by the procedure in Quebec. We had the original record with this charge before us and I must say that, taken as a whole, it is a correct explanation of the law and a fair and clear charge and direction to the jury as to what they should find in order to bring in a verdict one way or the other.\nTheir answers to the questions which had been settled and which were put to them (neither party asking for an additional question) must be read in the light of this charge. Dealing with the question of fair comment, the learned trial judge said:\u2014\nThe law gives every citizen the right to discuss public affairs in the newspapers, in public meetings, et cetera, to express opinions; in short, to comment on public affairs. Such comments are necessary in a country like ours where there is constitutional government, in order that public opinion may be enlightened. In the present case, the question that arises is one of public order, that is, whether it is right that the legislative power should invade the judicial power. But these comments when made must be fair; they must not go beyond the limits of a fair and reasonable criticism of the facts, whether true or false. The comment has to be considered separately from the question of fact. The report of the facts may be false and malicious, and the comment fair. In the same way, the report of the facts may be true and made without malice, but the comment may be unfair.\nThe defendant must be condemned, where he has maliciously reported facts, which are not true, without unjustly commenting on them, and where he has commented unfairly on facts reported, even if true.\nOn the other hand, if he has reported without malice what he thought to be true and if he has expressed reasonable opinions, justified by the facts as reported he must be exonerated, however severe may have been his comments, however damaging may have been the publication of the facts and comments.\nNo doubt sentences may be found in different parts of the charge which, divorced from their context, may be said not to correctly state the whole law. But taken as a whole, and that is the only way a judge\u2019s charge should be passed upon, I think this charge is not open to the objections respondents make.\nBramwell L.J., in Clark v. Molyneux[7], says, at page 243:\u2014\nI certainly think that a summing up is not to be rigorously criticized; and it would not be right to set aside the verdict of a jury because in the course of a long and elaborate summing up the judge has used inaccurate language; the whole of the summing up must be considered in order to determine whether it afforded a fair guide to the jury and too much weight must not be allowed to isolated and detached expressions. The jury found amongst other things that the article complained of was \u201csubstantially true,\u201d that \u201cit dealt with questions which interest the public,\u201d that \u201cit was published in the public interest and in good faith\u201d and that \u201cit did not cause any damage to the plaintiff.\u201d\nNow these findings could not have been made unless, as the judge charged them, the jury reached the conclusion that the comments of the defendant upon the qualified privileged occasion were fair, legitimate and reasonable.\nThere does not seem to be any doubt that the president and vice-president of the company who were members of the legislature, and who respectively moved, in the assembly and in the council, the clause complained of, acted in good faith in promoting and carrying it because they believed that the defendant was a party to an all round understanding or agreement made between the two litigants and representatives of the Provincial Government whereby defendant was to relinquish his claims to the lands in dispute in return for other lands he was to get from the Crown.\nOn the other hand, the defendant from the first bitterly denied being a party to or consenting to any such agreement and much of the evidence taken at the trial had reference to these two divergent claims.\nThe charge went very fully into this evidence and submitted it fairly to the jury as an important factor for them to consider in determining whether the defendant was or was not guilty of malice.\nThe contention on the part of the respondents, defendants, as I understood it, was that the absence of any reference in his letter to this contention of the respondent company shewed malice on his part. It was not perhaps an unfair argument to present and it was urged with force not only here but before the court and jury that tried the case. But it could not be denied that it was purely a question for the jury, one of the factors which they had to consider in deciding upon the answers they gave to the questions asked them and, therefore, not one with which the courts ought to interfere if there was any evidence on which the jury could find as they did. That there was ample evidence for the jury so to find I think is clear.\nOn the whole, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nHaving reached this conclusion, it is perhaps not necessary for me to express an opinion upon another important question which might well have arisen but which does not seem to have been discussed at the trial or in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, namely, whether an action by an incorporated company, such as the plaintiff, will lie at all for such an alleged libel as the one in question or whether it must be brought by the individuals acting for the company or composing it.\nThe question was considered in the case of the South Hetton Coal Company v. North-Eastern News Association[8], by the Court of Appeal in England, where it was held that an action of libel will lie at the suit of an incorporated trading company in respect of a libel calculated to injure its reputation in the way of its business. In that case, Lord Esher, at pages 138-139, says:\u2014\nAlthough the law is the same with regard to libel on a firm or company as with regard to libel on a person, the conditions under which the particular statement can be libellous may not exist with regard to them. There are other statements which would have the same effect, whether they were made with regard to a person, or a firm, or a company; as, for instance, statements with regard to conduct of business. It may be published of a man in business that he conducts his business in a manner which shews him to be a foolish or incapable man of business. That would be a libel on him in the way of his business, as it is called \u2014 that is to say, with regard to his conduct of his business. If what is stated relates to the goods in which he deals, the jury would have to consider whether the statement is such as to import a statement as to his conduct in business.\nOn the same page he says that while an exhaustive rule cannot be laid down as to what would be a libel on a company,\nstatements may be made with regard to their mode of carrying on business, such as to lead people of ordinary sense to the opinion that they conduct their business badly and inefficiently.\nAt page 141, Lopes L.J. says:\u2014\nWith regard to the first point I am of opinion that, although a corporation cannot maintain an action for libel in respect of any thing reflecting upon them personally, yet they can maintain an action for a libel reflecting on the management of their trade or business, and this without alleging or proving special damage. The words complained of, in order to entitle a corporation or company to sue for libel or slander, must injuriously affect the corporation or company as distinct from the individuals who compose it. A corporation or company could not sue in regard of a charge of murder, or incest, or adultery, because it could not commit these crimes. Nor could it sue in respect of a charge of corruption or of an assault, because a corporation cannot be guilty of corruption or of an assault, although the individuals composing it may be. The words complained of must attack the corporation or company in the method of conducting its affairs, must accuse it of fraud or mismanagement, or must attack its financial position.\nHe then adopts the limits of a corporation\u2019s rights suggested by Pollock C.B. in Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co. v. Hawkins[9], at page 90, where he says:\u2014\nThat a corporation at common law can sue in respect of a libel, there is no doubt. It would be monstrous if a corporation could maintain no action for slander of title through which they lost a great deal of money. It could not sue in respect of an imputation of murder, or incest, or adultery, because it could not commit those crimes. Nor could it sue in respect of a charge of corruption, * * * although the individuals composing it may. But it would be very odd if a corporation had no means of protecting itself against wrong and, if its property is injured by slander, it has no means of redress, except by action. Therefore, it appears to me clear that a corporation at common law may maintain an action for a libel by which its property is injured.\nKay L.J. gives judgment to same effect.\nIn the case before us, while in the view I take of the facts, the qualified privileged occasion, the trial judge\u2019s charge and the findings of the jury, it is not necessary for me to decide whether this action would lie at all, I may say that I entertain very grave doubts whether, under the authorities, it would, and my inclination is towards the view that it would not. I prefer, however, to base my judgment upon the grounds previously stated that the occasion was one of qualified privilege and that the findings of the jury read in connection with the judge\u2019s charge really mean that the language complained of was fair and legitimate criticism.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action of libel brought by the respondent against the appellant founded upon the publication by the latter in three newspapers published in the Province of Quebec of a letter written by him.\nThere was a private bill pending before the Legislature of Quebec promoted by the Town of Chicoutimi. This bill was so amended as to incorporate therein a declaration confirming the respondent\u2019s title to some grants made by the Crown.\nThe appellant in said letter recited the proceedings in the legislature which I need not dwell upon at length.\nIn the course of his statements therein referring to this amendment he said:\u2014\nNow a portion of the lands described in this paragraph never has been and is not now the property of the Chicoutimi Pulp Company, but is my property.\nAnd then he proceeded to state the history of the amendment and commented thereupon as follows:\u2014\nThe intention of the promoters was to obtain a legislative title to property which the Chicoutimi Pulp Company pretended to own, but its title to which was manifestly so insufficient that it was afraid to submit it to the test of a legal decision.\nI think the public must conclude that the Chicoutimi Pulp Company had no confidence in their pretended title, otherwise the unheard of recourse to a declaratory law with respect to private property would have been unnecessary.\nWhile the value of the land at issue may not be very great the principle involved in legislation of this character is of supreme importance to the public; not alone to those persons whose property the Chicoutimi Pulp Company may covet, but to all people whose property may be coveted by others haying sufficient influence to obtain legislation of this kind.\nI may, however, add that I am advised that though the intention of the promoters is clear, it is doubtful whether the object has been attained, and I propose forthwith to test the question and if necessary carry it to the Privy Council; should I find that my property really has been transferred to the Chicoutimi Pulp Company, I shall come back to the legislature and ask that body to undo the injustice done and return the property stolen.\nI suggest for the consideration of the public whether legislation of this character is not calculated to prove injurious to Canadian enterprise seeking capital on the English or foreign money markets. If companies can promote and carry legislation transferring to them other people\u2019s property, they can also promote and carry legislation by which creditors will be deprived of their security, or, if desired, of their recourse against their debtors. Is it reasonable under these circumstances to expect that capitalists will invest money in this province.\nThe respondent\u2019s action is founded upon the letter as a whole, but must rest upon these quotations.\nAmongst many other things pleaded in defence the appellant alleged as follows:\u2014\n14. The letter published under his signature in the Chronicle, the Montreal Star, and the Gazette, was written and signed by him and was published at his request.\n15. The statements of fact contained in the said letter are true in substance and in fact.\n* * * * *\n18. This amendment was introduced without notice of any kind to the defendant or to the public and contrary to all Parliamentary rules, regulations and usages concerning private bills, and the persons who so introduced it intended thereby and the object of such amendment was to endeavour to obtain a statutory or legislative title to certain lands which did not belong to the plaintiff, but did belong to the defendant and which were in question at that time and with respect to which litigation was threatened.\n* * * * *\n47. The defendant\u2019s letter was a fair statement of true facts referring to a matter of public interest and was a fair and bond fide comment, not only with respect to matters which, the defendant had a right and an interest to make public, but a fair and bon\u00e2 fide comment on matters of public interest.\nOn the issues so joined the respondent as plaintiff was entitled to have the jury pass.\nIt is claimed, and I think with reason, that the learned trial judge so misdirected the jury that the verdict obtained ought not to stand.\nThe court of appeal has set aside the verdict and directed a new trial. From that judgment this appeal is taken.\nI am, with great respect, afraid that there was much misconception of law involved in the charge of the learned trial judge on the trial of this simple issue and hence that the complaint of misdirection which has been pressed is well founded.\nI do not propose to enter in detail upon the manifold issues presented and the various misdirections of the learned trial judge.\nSpeaking generally thereof, however, he seems to me, I submit with great respect, to have confused the issues which ought to have been presented to the jury and has thus been led into error.\nIf any doubt existed as to the defamatory character of these statements a further question should have been submitted to the jury whose province it is to pass thereon.\nThen if the issues presented by the pleadings justifying as true the parts which I have quoted of the letter complained of, and assumed to be defamatory, had been well and truly tried out and the truth or falsity thereof, or of material statements therein, first ascertained, matters would have been very much simplified.\nThe action was launched some ten years ago and the pleadings I quote from filed shortly thereafter.\nThe appellant instituted, as threatened in said letter, proceedings to establish his title and followed same to the Privy Council and in these proceedings he failed entirely to establish the title he asserted. The trial of this action seems to have stood over awaiting the result of that litigation.\nIt surprises one to find, in face of such a result (unless something new turned up afterwards which does not appear), the pleading of the defence of justification which I quote, still adhered to, instead of that assertion of title being withdrawn. A defence of justification involving the truth in substance and in fact of an alleged libel is often a perilous sort of proceeding.\nThe appellant no where in his long pleading sets up specifically a claim of privilege but in law contends that what he does set up constitutes a privilege of some kind.\nSo far as reporting what actually transpired in the legislature or before its committees is concerned that clearly is privileged. And so far as a fair and reasonable comment thereon is concerned that also was permissible; for to speak the thought we will is the very life blood of our freedom and free institutions. In doing so, however, no one has the right to invent statement of fact and present it for truth. Nor has he the right in his comment to put forward what others may have invented, and publish that or aught else as fact which is false. No belief, on the part of one publishing any such comment, in such falsehood can justify its publication as part of his comment.\nThe reasoning used may be grossly fallacious and thus, in effect, a falsehood in itself, but of that the law will take no notice. In thus appealing to mankind they are supposed to be able to discriminate the true from the false if only the fundamental facts upon which the comment proceeds are shewn to be true.\nIt has been said by high authority that this right to comment should not be called a privilege. And as a matter of expediency it may be as well when we see how confused people get over the meaning of the term \u201cprivileged\u201d to bear that observation in mind.\nThe comment must be fair, but much latitude has in practice been permitted, for wise men treat with silent contempt that which fair minded men can, when nothing but facts are presented, adjust and correct for themselves. And thus the appellant, in dealing with the matter he had in hand, might have gone very far in his strictures upon private legislation of the character of that he was assailing. But he was bound in doing so to adhere to the truth so that such fair minded men as he was appealing to might not be led astray.\nHe could have presented to the public just exactly the nature of the claim he put before the legislative committee with the answer made thereto and asked his readers to decide relative to his appeal.\nSuch, as I have tried to set forth, I conceive was the law that ought to have been observed. Instead of that it seems to have been thought and, indeed, is urged before us that it mattered not in such circumstances whether what was stated was true or not, so long as it was honestly believed by appellant, and published by him in good faith.\nI am unable to hold that view of the law.\nThere are many situations in the commerce of mankind when it becomes the legal, social, or moral, duty to speak, and in doing so to give honest utterance to that which when it comes to be investigated may prove absolutely false, and in many cases he so speaking is privileged and protected unless he can be shewn to have been actuated by malice.\nBut this is not such a case. And to confuse it with that class of cases in their various shades of absolute and qualified privilege is to mislead, and, when doing so in charging a jury, is to misdirect them.\nThe law is so well expounded by Lord Blackburn and others in the case of Campbell v. Spottiswoode[10], and many cases following it, that I may refer those concerned to said exposition, and to other cases collected in Fraser on Libel and Slander, pp. 90-95.\nFor the purpose, therefore, of furnishing a bar to the action the investigation of the belief or good faith of appellant is of no avail.\nAs, however, in many other libel actions, there is in this an aspect of it which gives rise to the consideration of the question of the appellant\u2019s good faith and his reason for believing that he had a right to assert that he had a title to the lands he claimed as his. And that, if he thinks it worth while, he has a right to insist on the court and jury hearing him in mitigation of damages. It cannot form in itself in such a case as this a defence barring the action.\nI can imagine a man, wishing to justify himself before the public, using this right as means thereof even if only nominal damages asked at the opening of the trial, though I should doubt its expediency in a ten year old case.\nIn dealing with such investigation as was made on the trial relative to this question of the good faith and belief of the appellant there seems also to have been much confusion of thought. And that was carried into the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury. He seems to have treated the matter as if it were necessary to prove a contract in writing and to have held that, as there was no commencement of proof in writing, what was adduced of an oral character must fall to the ground. I submit, with deference, that it was the conduct of the appellant for years preceding his letter in relation to these matters alleged against him so far as shewn to be inconsistent with an honest belief in his assertions of a title possessed by him that bore upon the issues relative to such belief and good faith.\nFrom that course of conduct inducing, as it was alleged, reciprocal conduct on the part of those he assails, even an agreement or understanding might have been inferred or submitted as a fair ground for an inference which forbade his honestly asserting such title as he set up.\nI am by no means to be taken as asserting that such is the fair inference or conclusion to be reached. That was and is for the jury to consider. And it was for the learned judge trying the case to have directed their minds to a fair consideration of such evidence of any kind shewing his conduct in its bearing upon this subsidiary question of the good faith of the appellant.\nAgain I may point out that the last paragraph of the defence, being also the last of the three which I have quoted, couples together two or three matters which ought to be kept for consideration in the first place, quite independent of each other. The first part of the paragraph is apparently a repetition of paragraph fifteen, which must stand or fall by itself; and if it fall, then in my view of the law which governs the case, that defence fails; and if that fails there cannot be maintained the further proposition of a defence of fair comment.\nThere has in such a case been a failure to maintain what the law recognizes as fair comment and imposes as a fundamental part of what constitutes fair comment.\nCounsel for appellant submitted that no case had been made out and that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury and the action dismissed. In my view of the law I need hardly say that I cannot assent to such a proposition.\nHe also took the objection, which is not set up in the statement of defence, that the respondent being a corporation cannot maintain such an action as this, under the existing circumstances attendant thereon, and resting upon such a basis as the appellant\u2019s letter furnishes.\nI do not think there is anything in any of the decisions in the cases to which he has referred which can be held to maintain the objection. And I may frankly say that some obiter dicta I have observed therein do not seem to me maintainable.\nIt would be short-sighted policy to try and so mould the law as needlessly to restrict the right of corporations to bring an action for libel.\nIn these days when corporations engage so much of the business activities of mankind and are daily assailed in the press, I think any one of them so attacked ought to have the power to assure the public on whom it relies for business that its conduct has not been that imputed in any such attack as this, for example.\nBringing an action for libel and putting him defaming any such entity to the proof is its only means of defence. To deprive any one of them of such right would be sure to tend to make their conduct worse instead of better. It is the public\u2019s highest interest to have as much publicity given to corporate dealings with the public as possibly can be brought about.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal I think to allow it, even if good ground of complaint, which I do not find, would be to infringe on the settled jurisprudence of this court relative to mere questions of costs.\nThe cross-appeal should also be dismissed with costs to be set off against the other costs of the appeal herein.\nDuff J.\u2014In this case I regret to say that I see no escape from the conclusion that there must be a new trial. I regret it because all the facts were before the jury to enable them to pass upon the issues raised by the action and the mistrial arises only because in certain vital matters they were not properly instructed by the learned trial judge. The defences were justification, privilege and fair comment. It was not disputed on the argument that in an action for libel where, as here, the publication complained of deals with matters admittedly of public interest the rules of law applicable in the Province of Quebec do not sensibly differ from the rules of the law of England except in so far as they may be affected by statute, and there is no question of the application of any statute in this case. In effect, the learned trial judge directed the jury that the defence of justification would be established if they were satisfied that the defamatory statements of fact were made with an honest belief in their truth, even though in fact untrue. He further directed them that if the publication was an honest comment that, in itself, would be sufficient to establish the defence of fair comment. As the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench have pointed out in their judgments these directions were erroneous. The defence of justification fails unless the defendant justifies every injurious imputation which the jury find to be conveyed by the publication. The defence of fair comment fails unless the jury find that the imputation, although defamatory and not proved to be true, was made fairly and bon\u00e2 fide as the honest expression of the opinion held by the defendant and is in the opinion of the jury warranted by the facts in the sense that a fair-minded man might, on those facts, hold that opinion. It is also essential to this defence (as regards imputations which the defendant fails to prove to be warranted in fact) that he must have stated them not as facts but as inferences from other facts.\nAs there is to be a new trial I think it is undesirable to enter upon any discussion of the facts. But I think it is important to say this: The plaintiff is only entitled to succeed if the publication in question could convey to the mind of a reasonable person imputations calculated to damage the plaintiffs in their business. I think the publication is capable of such a meaning, that is to say, I think it is capable of being read as charging the plaintiffs with making use of their political influence in the legislature to procure the passing of legislation with the object of depriving the appellant of rights which they either knew to be vested in him, or believed might be vested in him, in respect of property which they desired to get for themselves; in other words, that they were unscrupulous enough to make use of their political influence to benefit themselves at the expense of the appellant\u2019s rights, or what, if his recourse to the courts were not taken from him, might prove to be his rights. I think that would be an imputation calculated to damage them in their business. But it is a question for the jury whether or not the publication in fact bears that interpretation in the sense that that is the meaning which a reasonable person would attribute to it.\nThere is one further observation arising out of the course of the argument in this court which it seems right to make and that is that the defendant is only bound to justify the publication (as regards his defence of justification) or support the publication as fair comment (as regards his defence of fair comment) in the sense in which the publication would be actionable; that is to say, in the sense in which it would convey an imputation prejudicially affecting the plaintiffs in their business. Failure to prove, for example, as a fact that the defendant was the owner of the property, while relevant, no doubt, could not be conclusive as regards either defence. Even assuming the jury should construe the publication as declaring absolutely that the appellant was the owner of the property, the gist of the imputation in the only sense in which it is actionable is that the plaintiffs oppressively or dishonestly made use of their political influence with the legislature to deprive the appellant of rights which they knew to be his, or his title to which, at all events, they did not think it safe to leave to the judgment of the courts. If the appellant fails to justify that imputation in fart there is still open the defence of fair comment, the co\u00ebfficients of which I have indicated above. But first of all, it is a condition of the plaintiffs\u2019 success that it should appear that the publication contains actionable imputations, that is, I repeat, imputations calculated to prejudice the plaintiffs in their business.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014Upon the verdict of the jury judgment was entered dismissing this action. On appeal that judgment was set aside on the ground of misdirection by the learned trial judge in instructing the jury that what matters is not the truth of the facts but that they should be reported without malice, or wicked intent, and that, if the defendant believed what he had written to be true and published it without malice or evil intent, they should find that what he had said was substantially true.\nThe defences were justification, privilege and fair comment.\nNo doubt, as applied to the plea of justification, the passages of the charge above referred to would be indefensible under English law. They are at least equally so under Quebec law, whether the truth of the alleged libel should be regarded as in itself a complete defence (Leduc v. Graham[11]), or, as would seem to be the better opinion, should be deemed a defence only if the publication is also alleged and proved to have been made in the public interest and concerning matters of public moment (Trudel v. La Compagnie d\u2019Imprimerie et de Publication du Canada[12]), and may even then be shewn only in mitigation of damages. (Gazette Printing Co. v. Shallow[13], at page 343; Trudel v. Beemer[14].) In its bearing on the defence of fair comment the direction condemned by the court of appeal is equally erroneous. The learned judge indicated that it bore on this defence when he said:\u2014\nIf he (the defendant) has reported without malice what he thought to be true and if he has expressed reasonable opinions jus-tiled by the facts as reported, he must be exonerated.\nI understand that in the Province of Quebec English law governs defences to actions for libel in newspapers founded on privilege or fair comment. Marcotte v. Bolduc[15].\nAs I read his charge the learned judge did not intend to submit to the jury the defence of qualified privilege in the strict sense as understood by English lawyers, but rather the defence of fair comment in the public interest upon a report of proceedings in the legislature\u2014sometimes called privilege in a broader sense. The duty of communication to or an interest in the persons to whom the alleged libel was published necessary to support a plea of qualified privilege in the strict sense was probably lacking. Upon the defence of fair comment the attention of the jury was scarcely sufficiently directed to the all-important distinction between statements or accusations of fact, the truth of which must be proven, and statements by way of inference or expressions of opinion, upon which the issue is their reasonableness and fairness. The only direction given as to the burden of proof in regard to malice was that it lay with the plaintiff \u2014 a proper direction when the judge has ruled that the occasion is one of qualified privilege in the strict sense, but incorrect where the defence is fair comment. The eighth question (whether the article dealt with matters of public interest) was improperly left to the jury. That is a question of law for the judge. But this error was probably innocuous as the learned judge distinctly charged that the question was one of public order and properly a subject of fair public discussion and criticism within reasonable limits.\nAlthough in most respects an able presentment of a difficult and complicated case, the charge contains several errors so vital in their character that I fear the order for a new trial could not properly be set aside, if to do so it were necessary to find that there had been no misdirection or that the case falls within the saving grace of article 500 C.P.Q.\nBut I have reached the conclusion that a commercial corporation, such as the plaintiff company is, cannot maintain an action for libel, without proof of special damage, for the publication of a letter such as that before us, which, as I read it, reflects rather upon members or officers of the corporation than upon the corporate body itself, and, in so far as it may impute misconduct, charges something of which the corporation itself could not be guilty. Metropolitan Saloon and Omnibus Co. v. Hawkins[16]; South Hetton Coal Co. v. North Eastern News Association[17]; Mayor of Manchester v. Williams[18]; 18 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 612.\nIt was suggested to us that the rights of a corporation under Quebec law differ in this respect from those which it would have under English law, and we were referred to articles 352 and 358 of the Civil Code. I find nothing in these articles warranting the suggestion made, and I can conceive of no sound reason in support of it. The only authority to which we were referred was L\u2019Institut Canadien v. Le Nouveau Monde[19], in which the plaintiff was not a commercial corporation. Whatever may be thought of the judgment in that case, the libel there before the court directly affected the carrying on of an important part of the work of the institute.\nI think a judge could not properly rule or a jury reasonably find that the defendant\u2019s letter was calculated to injure the property of the plaintiff, or its business reputation or character, as distinguished from the personal reputations or characters of its officers or members. In the absence of proof of special damage such a finding was essential to the plaintiff. The questions submitted did not cover this issue, nor did the charge present it to the jury. No objection was taken on this ground nor was any request made that a question should be put to elicit such a finding. Under these circumstances article 499 C.P.Q. appears to disentitle the plaintiff to a new trial.\nOn the whole I think it is in the interests of justice that this litigation, regrettable from every point of view, should be brought to an end, especially in view of the obvious fact that the plaintiff company has sustained no substantial injury.\nI would allow this appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer dans cette cause-ci si la bonne foi du d\u00e9fendeur appelant peut justifier les propos diffamatoires qu\u2019il a tenus sur le compte de la demanderesse intim\u00e9e.\nLa l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 sa session de 1904, avait, \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un certain terrain, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re par la Couronne \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 indiscutable de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appellant, Price, avait combattu ce projet de loi, en all\u00e9guant que ce terrain lui appartenait: mais la l\u00e9gislature confirma le titre donn\u00e9 par la Couronne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelant jugea \u00e0 propos alors d\u2019\u00e9crire dans les journaux une lettre o\u00f9 non-seulement il critiquait la demande de la compagnie \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature mais il all\u00e9guait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019avait spoli\u00e9 de son terrain et qu\u2019il allait instituer des proc\u00e9dures devant les tribunaux pour arriver \u00e0 se faire remitter en possession de ce terrain vol\u00e9 (return the property stolen).\nPoursuivi pour libelle, le defendeur appelant a voulu se justifier en disant que de fait il avait, depuis la publication de sa lettre, pris une poursuite devant les tribunaux pour revendiquer ses droits au terrain en litige et il plaida la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des accusations qu\u2019il avait port\u00e9es et la justesse des commentaires qu\u2019il avait fait.\nVoici d\u2019ailleurs le texte m\u00eame des paragraphes 15 et 47 de la d\u00e9fense o\u00f9 il affirme ces deux moyens de d\u00e9fense:\u2014\n15. The statements of fact contained in the said letter are true in substance and in fact.\n47. The defendant\u2019s letter was a fair statement of true facts referring to a matter of public interest and was a fair and bon\u00e2 fide comment, not only with respect to matters which the defendant had a right and an interest to make public, but a fair and bon\u00e2 fide comment oh matters of public interest.\nLa pr\u00e9sente cause est rest\u00e9e en suspens pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es afin de permettre \u00e9videmment au demandeur de faire d\u00e9cider l\u2019action p\u00e9titoire qu\u2019il avait institu\u00e9e et \u00e0 laquelle il r\u00e9f\u00e9rait dans sa d\u00e9fense. Cette action p\u00e9titoire est all\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au Conseil Priv\u00e9 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le demandeur n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du terrain en litige.\nOn a ensuite proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9sente poursuite et un proc\u00e8s par jury eut lieu. L\u2019honorable juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes reprises au cours de son adresse aux jur\u00e9s que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de prouver la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des accusation qu\u2019il avait port\u00e9es, niais d\u2019\u00e9tablir simplement qu\u2019il croyait bien fond\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il avait dit.\nEn d\u2019autres termes, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la bonne foi du d\u00e9fendeur pouvait l\u2019exempter de toute responsabilit\u00e9 civile pour toutes les injures que contenait sa lettre.\nLe verdict du jur\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019appelant; mais la cour d\u2019appel, saisie de la cause, a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nJ\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le jugement a quo doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion que la d\u00e9fendeur devait prouver la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de son accusation et que la critique qu\u2019il a faite de la conduite de la demanderesse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas judicieuse (unfair comment).\nJe suis d\u2019opinion \u00e9galement que les paroles injurieuses dont il s\u2019est servi ne pourraient lui permettre de r\u00e9clamer l\u2019immunit\u00e9 reconnue en faveur des communications privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es (qualified privilege).\nLa preuve de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des propos diffamatoires est permise dans le droit anglais quelque soit la condition des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, soit qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de particuliers ou d\u2019hommes publics, soit qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9s au sujet d\u2019une affaire priv\u00e9e ou d\u2019une affaire publique.\nDans notre droit au contraire la calomnie et la m\u00e9disance donnent lieu dans la rapports ordinaires de la vie a des recours en dommages.\nQue les propros diffamatoires soient vrais ou faux, celui qui les a tenus engage sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nSous le droit romain on disait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait ni juste ni \u00e9quitable que celui qui a diffam\u00e9 un coupable fut condamn\u00e9 pour ce fait, car il est utile et n\u00e9cessaire que les fautes des coupables soient connues.\nEum qui nocentem infamavit non esse bonum et \u00e6quum ob eam rem condemnari; peccata enim nocentium nota esse et oportere et expedire.\nCette l\u00e9gislation fut implant\u00e9e en France dans les pays de droit \u00e9crit. Mais dans les pays de coutume on adopta la jurisprudence canonique qui avait pour r\u00e8gle: \u201cVeritas convicii non excusat\u201d (Grellet Demazeau, vol. 1er, p. 340 et 345).\nDareau, qui est le guide le plus s\u00fbr que nous puissions suivre quant aux injures entre particuliers, nous dit (vol. 1er, p. 60), qu\u2019il y a un surcro\u00eet d\u2019injure d\u2019offrir la preuve de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du mal que l\u2019on dit, parce que\nsi cette v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pouvait servir d\u2019excuse, tous les jours ce pretexte donnerait ouverture \u00e0 de nouvelles injures qu\u2019il est toujours prudent d\u2019\u00e9viter.\nCette doctrine de l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais a pass\u00e9 dans le droit moderne fran\u00e7ais (Fuzier Herman, Vo. Diffamation, No. 59) et a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par notre jurisprudence dans Qu\u00e9bec. Trudel v. Beemer, cour d\u2019appel[20]; Moquin v. Brassard[21].\nCette derni\u00e8re cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la cour d\u2019appel compos\u00e9e de jurisconsultes de grande distinction, comme Sir Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion et les honorables juges Monk, Taschereau, Ramsay et Sanborn et le jug\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9:\u2014\nQue le d\u00e9fendur dans une action en dommages pour injures verbales ne peut plaider la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des imputations contenues dans ces injures.\nCette jurisprudence fait loi dans la province. On faisait exception dans l\u2019ancien droit au cas ou des accusations \u00e9taient consign\u00e9es dans les requ\u00eates envoy\u00e9es aux ministres pour faire cesser des d\u00e9sordres, ou aux procureurs-g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pour faire punir des d\u00e9lits. Dans ces cas, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l\u2019imputation pouvait excuser. (Dareau, vol. 2, pp. 402-403.)\nIl est donc bien important en discutant la responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant des injures de ne pas oublier cette diff\u00e9rence entre notre droit et le droit anglais sur ce point.\nLa question en la pr\u00e9sente cause n\u2019offrirait donc pas de difficult\u00e9 si nous nous trouvions en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un particulier qui en aurait diffam\u00e9 un autre. Mais les paroles injurieuses prof\u00e9r\u00e9es contre la compagnie intim\u00e9e l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation qu\u2019elle a sollicit\u00e9e et alors ses actes perdent de leur caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 et sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre critiqu\u00e9s et comment\u00e9s.\nL\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9tendu devant cette cour que les circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au libelle constituent une occasion o\u00f9 le privil\u00e8ge, connu dans le droit anglais sous le nom de \u201cqualified privilege,\u201d peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour les fins de cette cause que je d\u00e9cide si le \u201cqualified privilege\u201d existe dans notre province ou non, car j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le d\u00e9fendeur ne peut l\u2019invoquer.\nSa d\u00e9fense, en effet, repose sur la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des faits (justification) et sur son droit de critique (fair comment). Il est trop tard, maintenant que le proc\u00e8s a eu lieu sur ces deux moyens de d\u00e9fense d\u2019en soulever un nouveau.\nD\u2019ailleurs, les faits qui sont prouv\u00e9s dans la cause ne d\u00e9montrent pas que le d\u00e9fendeur appellant f\u00fbt oblig\u00e9 de publier la lettre dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e se plaint, ou qu\u2019il eut int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 diffamer cette derni\u00e8re. Il pouvait y avoir une obligation ou un int\u00e9r\u00eat de sa part de faire conna\u00eetre \u00e0 ses concitoyens la conduite de leurs mandataires; mais quel int\u00e9r\u00eat public avait-il de voir la d\u00e9fenderesse-intini\u00e9e diffam\u00e9e?\nOr, pour que le privil\u00e8ge qualifi\u00e9 soit invoqu\u00e9, il faut que ces conditions soient r\u00e9unies, obligation ou int\u00e9r\u00eat du d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019un cot\u00e9 et devoir et int\u00e9r\u00eat de la part de la personne ou du public a qui la communication est faite de recevoir cette information.\nHalsbury, Laws of England, No, 1263, vo. Libel.\nIl faut de plus qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas d\u2019abus de ce privil\u00e8ge et il y aurait abus dans le cas ou l\u2019\u00e9crit est inutilement diffamatoire du demandeur et contiendrait des d\u00e9clarations fausses et mensong\u00e8res et des motifs inavouables. Cyc., vo. Libel and Slander, p. 402.\nLa cour de revision en confirmant unanimement un jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 tout r\u00e9cemment dans une cause de Fontaine v. Potvin[22], que:\u2014\nDans une action de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour libelle le privil\u00e8ge, m\u00eame lorsque l\u2019occasion est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e n\u2019existe pas si des actes malhonn\u00eates sont reproch\u00e9s au demandeur sans utilit\u00e9 pour les fins que veut atteindre le d\u00e9fendeur.\nLa jurisprudence anglaise nous enseigne aussi que l\u2019occasion ne serait pas privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e parce que le d\u00e9fendeur agirait de bonne foi. (Halsbury, loc. cit. No. 1262). Benner v. Edmonds[23].\nOdgers, Libel (5th \u00e9d.), pp. 250-251, dit:\u2014\nThe defendant\u2019s bona fides is never an element in the question whether a particular occasion is or is not privileged.\nDans la cause de Campbell v. Spottiswoode[24], Cockburn C.J. dit:\u2014 Mr. Bovil is obliged to say that because the writer of this article had a bon\u00e2 fide belief that the statement he made were true he is privileged. I cannot assent to that doctrine.\nQuant \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des faits, il ne peut pas y avoir de doute. Le jury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son verdict qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient substantiellement vrais, mais ce verdict est en tout contraire \u00e0 la preuve.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident que les jur\u00e9s en sont venus \u00e0 cette conclusion parce que l\u2019honorable juge, en leur adressant la parole, leur aurait dit:\u2014\nSi vous arrivez \u00e0 la conclusion que la d\u00e9fendeur a rapport\u00e9 les faites tels qu\u2019il les connaissait, tels qu\u2019il les croyait vrais, vous devez d\u00e9clarer que ce qu\u2019il a dit \u00e9tait substantiellement vrai; car en disant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire il ne faisait qu\u2019affirmer sa croyance et son droit.\nJe ne puis adopter une telle doctrine. D\u2019ailleurs, non-seulement le d\u00e9fendeur a affirm\u00e9 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mais il a m\u00eame jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019on lui avait vol\u00e9 son bien, qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 spoli\u00e9. Or, bien loin d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que son action p\u00e9titoire \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le propri\u00e9taire du terrain en litige.\nIl avait donc affirm\u00e9 en termes diffamatoires une chose fausee et alors il doit en subir la responsabilit\u00e9.\nQuant aux commentaires qu\u2019il a faits sur la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ils sont absolument injustes et bas\u00e9s de plus sur une assertion fausse.\nA l\u2019origine, sous l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, sous l\u2019empire de l\u2019ordonnance de janvier, 1629, d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait faite aux sujets du royaume de publier des libelles contre le roi, ses conseillers, magistrats et officiers ou contre les affaires publiques et le gouvernement. Dareau, vol. 1er, p. 108. Cette ordonnance \u00e9tait la loi du Canada lors de la cession du pays. Elle n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e, que je sache, ici. Mais l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des institutions repr\u00e9sentatives et d\u00e9mocratiques comme partie de notre droit public a implicitement eu pour effet de mettre \u00e0 n\u00e9ant ce vestige d\u2019une monarchie absolue. Les hommes public, en acceptant d\u2019\u00eatre mandataires du peuple, se soummettent \u00e0 la critique du public et les questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public doivent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9battues pour quelle peuple, qui est maintenant le ma\u00eetre de ces destin\u00e9es, puisse juger en connaissance de cause.\nJe crois alors que nous n\u00e9 pouvons sur ce sujet trouver de guide plus s\u00fbr que le droit anglais. Or, il est le principe incontestable en droit anglais que la critique doit \u00eatre juste et raisonnable et qu\u2019elle ne soit pas bas\u00e9e sur un fait faux et mensonger. Halsbury, loco citato, No. 1288, dit:\u2014\nThe comment must not misstate facts because a comment cannot be fair which is built upon facts not truly stated and if a defendant cannot shew that his comments contain no misstatements of fact he cannot prove a defence of fair comment.\nAux Etats-Unis le m\u00eame principe est suivi. Cyc, sous le mot \u201ccomment\u201d (Libel and Slander, p. 402) dit:\u2014\nBut the privilege is limited strictly to comment and criticize and does not intend to protect false statements, unjust inferences, imputations of evil motives or criminal conduct, and attacks upon private character, the publisher being responsible for the truth of what he alleges to be facts.\nEn France, sous la loi de 1881, il est pourvu que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait diffamatoire pourra \u00eatre \u00e9tablie dans le cas d\u2019imputations contre les administrations publiques, les d\u00e9put\u00e9s, les s\u00e9nateurs, les fonctionnaires publics, les jur\u00e9s et les t\u00e9moins.\nFuzier Herman, au mot \u201cDiffamation,\u201d No. 261, nous dit:\u2014\nLes hommes politiques peuvent \u00e9videmment en raison de leur r\u00f4le et du caract\u00e8re de la mission qu\u2019ils s\u2019attribuent \u00eatre librement discut\u00e9s. Mais ce droit de discussion et de censure n\u2019est pas absolu. D\u2019abord, il ne saurait permettre de s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 l\u2019honneur de l\u2019homme. Ensuite, toute imputation calomnieuse, toute all\u00e9gation d\u2019un fait que l\u2019on sait faux et de nature \u00e0 atteindre la consid\u00e9ration est \u00e9videmment prohib\u00e9.\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, la jurisprudence est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la conduite d\u2019un homme public, d\u2019un candidat, d\u2019un d\u00e9put\u00e9, ou d\u2019un employ\u00e9 public puisse \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 une critique d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, mais des accusations fausses pourront donner lieu \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration civile.\nBeauchamp v. Champagne[25]; Wickham v. Hunt[26]; Marchand v. Molleur[27]; Marcotte v. Bolduc[28]; Voir Mignault, vol. 5, p. 359.\nComme les commentaires faits par l\u2019appelant contenaient l\u2019assertion qu\u2019il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du terrain en question et comme ce fait etait faux, il a engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 et le juge n\u2019avait pas le droit de dire aux jur\u00e9s que sa bonne foi pouvait le soustraire \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9. Avec la cour d\u2019appel je suis d\u2019opinion qu\u2019il doit y avoir un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nL\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9tendu devant cette cour que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, comme compagnie, n\u2019avait pas droit de poursuite pour le libelle en question.\nCe point n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par les plaidoiries, ni devant les cours inf\u00e9rieures, et je n\u2019en suis pas \u00e9tonn\u00e9, car si cette pr\u00e9tention peut avoir quelque consistance sous les dispositions du droit anglais elle ne saurait\n\u00eatre maintenue sous l\u2019empire du Code Civil.\nLes corporations sont des personnes morales qui ont les m\u00eames droit que les individus. Tout propos diffamatoire est susceptible d\u2019engager la responsabilit\u00e9 de celui qui l\u00e9 prof\u00e8re et a la m\u00eame cons\u00e9quence que la personne diffam\u00e9e soit une personne r\u00e9elle ou une corporation.

[1886] c. 43, ss. 54 and 55\u2014License for twelve months\u2014Regulations\u2014Renewal of license.\nSection 54 of R.S.C. [1886] ch. 43 (now R.S.C. [1906] ch. 81) enacted that licences might be issued to cut timber on Indian lands and sec. 55 that \u201cno licence shall be so granted for a longer period than twelve months from the date thereof.\u201d By a regulation made by the Governor-General in Council and sanctioned by Parliament it was provided that licence holders who had complied with all existing regulations should be entitled to renewal on application.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court (14 Ex. C.R. 115) that a licence holder who has complied with the regulations has no absolute right to a renewal as a regulation making perpetual renewal obligatory would be inconsistent with the statutory limitation of twelve months and, therefore, non-operative.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the suppliant\u2019s petition of right with costs.\nThe suppliant has for many years past carried on and continues to carry on the business of a lumberman in the City of Ottawa in the County of Carleton and on the 5th day of October, A.D. 1891, a licence to cut timber on Indian lands was issued to him by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The said licence purports to have been issued by authority of the 43rd chapter of the Revised Statutes of Canada and amendments thereto and bears the date aforesaid, and gives full power and licence to cut pine timber and saw logs from trees of not less than nine inches diameter at the stump upon Indian Reserve No. 10 on the northerly side of Lake Nipissing containing 108 square miles, exempting, however, from the operation of the licence an Indian village and certain Indian improvements in said licence mentioned. The said Act under the authority of which the licence was issued, authorized the said Superintendent General to grant licences to cut trees on reserves and ungranted Indian lands at such rates and subject to such conditions, regulations and restrictions as from time to time might be established by the Governor-in-Council.\nOn the recommendation of the Superintendent General, to whom was given by the said Act the control and management of the said Indian lands, an order in council was passed on the 15th day of September, 1888, making regulations for the sale of timber on Indian lands in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The said regulations were in force at and prior to the date when said licence was issued, and the suppliant acquired the said licence under the authority of said Act and subject to and upon the terms contained in said regulations.\nSection 11 of said regulations provides that \u201call timber licences are to expire on the 30th of April next after the date thereof, and all renewals are to be applied for before the 1st of July following the expiration of the last preceding licence; in default whereof the berth or berths may be treated as de facto forfeited.\u201d Section 5 provides \u201cthat licence holders, who shall have complied with all existing regulations, shall he entitled to have their licences renewed on application to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\u201d\nThe said licence has since that date thereof been renewed from year to year, the last renewal expiring on the 30th day of April, 1909. The suppliant has made due application for a renewal of said licence for the year ending on the 30th day of April, 1910, and has duly complied with the said regulations, which has been refused by the Superintendent General and the said limits and the timber aforesaid, have been advertised for sale by his authority.\nShepley K.C. and Lafleur K.C. fox the appellant cited Bulmer v. The Queen[2]; Lake-field Lumber and Mfg. Co. v. Shairp[3]; McPherson v. Temiskaming Lumber Co.[4].\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent referred to Smylie v. The Queen[5].\nDavies. J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant obtained in 1891 from the Superintendent of Indian Affairs a licence to cut timber on certain Indian lands.\nThis licence was granted under the \u201cIndian Act,\u201d chapter 43 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, section 54 of which is as follows:\u2014\n54. The Superintendent General or any officer or agent authorized by him to that effect, may grant licences to cut trees on reserves and ungranted Indian lands, at such rates, and subject to such conditions, regulations and restrictions, as are, from time to time, established by the Governor-in-Council, and such conditions, regulations and restrictions shall be adapted to the locality in which such reserves or lands are situated.\nSection 55 provides, amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\nNo licence shall be so granted for a longer period than twelve months from the date thereof.\nSection 56 provides that:\u2014\n56. Every licence shall describe the lands upon which the trees may be cut, and the kind of trees which may be cut, and shall confer, for the time being, on the licensee the right to take and keep exclusive possession of the land so described, subject to such regulations as are made: * * *\nand proceeds to declare that every licence shall vest in the holder thereof the property in all trees of the kind specified\ncut within the limits of the licence during the term thereof\nand to give a right of action against any trespassers and to recover damages, if any, and\nall proceedings pending at the expiration of any licence may be continued to final termination, as if the licence had not expired.\nThe licence in question was in conformity with these provisions and upon a number of conditions expressed therein and further upon condition that the said licensee or his representatives must comply with all regulations that are or may be established by order in council, etc., on pain of forfeiture of the licence.\nThere is not a word express or implied therein looking to a renewal thereof, much less expressive of any obligation to renew.\nIn fact from year to year there was indorsed on this licence for many years a renewal of said licence and each renewal as such accepted by appellant. It is certainly difficult to understand how under such a statute and such an instrument there can be claimed a right of another renewal; yet that is what is insisted upon herein, though the term \u201crenewal\u201d used throughout by the department and the regulations to be referred to hereafter, is in argument disclaimed.\nIt is conceded that the respondent at the expiration of any single year could insist upon raising the amount of stumpage dues to become payable in future.\nOne might suppose that this alone should ends all argument.\nYet it does not, for the appellant relies upon the fact that amongst the regulations made, which the Governor in Council is alleged to have been acting under the powers in the said statutes to make, are the following:\u2014\nSec. 5. Licence holders who shall have complied with all existing regulations, shall be entitled to have their licences renewed on application to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nSec. 11. All timber licences are to expire on the 30th of April next after the date thereof, and all renewals are to be applied for before the 1st of July following the expiration of the last preceding licence; in default whereof the berth or berths may be treated as de facto forfeited.\nIt seems almost too clear for argument that in face of the absolute restriction in the statute limiting the duration of a licence to twelve months, that the Governor in Council could make any regulation which would in fact nullify the statute.\nAnd if the said regulation, section 5, means what appellant urges, then it exceeds the power given in the statute.\nThis is not a regulation which by publication as in some cases is provided by statute shall after the lapse of a certain period of time within the next ensuing session of Parliament become law unless revoked by Parliament.\nIts publication is simply for the enlightenment of those concerned, including members of Parliament. If ultra vires it goes for nothing. Its frame may be misleading, but in no sense can it create any legal right. If it did mislead in fact, and thereby do the appellant any damage that might form ground for an appeal to the proper consideration of Parliament, but no such case is made here, nor if attempted could the court, without Parliamentary sanction, entertain such a claim.\nIt cannot rest on contract, for it is not within the terms of the contract.\nIt cannot rest upon statute, for the regulation is not a statute in itself or to be deemed as having statutory force and so far as exceeding the statutory power is non-operative.\nThe only regulations pointed to in the contract are of an entirely different character and for an entirely different purpose. Indeed the word \u201cregulation\u201d as used in the statute is of an entirely different meaning and for an entirely different purpose from what is sought herein to be imparted to it.\nIn short it seems to me that to give any legal effect to this section 5 of the regulations in the way the appellant claims would be to give him a licence in perpetuity which certainly would be quite inadmissible, even for Parliament to attempt if regard is had to the trust reposed in it by the transactions leading to Canadian control over the subject-matter of these Indians and their lands so called.\nCounsel tried to disclaim this by suggesting a general regulation could be passed annulling the section. The annulling regulation then could be passed the day before the expiration of any renewal of the license.\nIt is idle to say that it could not be made so as to apply to the territory over which the licence prevails, for the very terms of the section 54 looking to such regulations expressly preserves the right to deal with that which shall be adapted to the locality.\nThat is almost exactly what did happen. An order in council was passed dealing with the tract of Indian lands over which the licence in whole or chief part prevailed.\nInstead of taking the form of a regulation it took the form of an order in council.\nIf the argument is good it would seem that all that is to be complained of is matter of form, having no substance.\nIt is not necessary that I should try and give the section 5 relied upon either the meaning and purpose counsel for the Grown suggested, or any meaning.\nBut I do not think it would be very difficult to make a reasonable surmise of its purpose which would shew it never necessarily conveyed to the minds of those concerned the idea of its containing either a contractual or statutory obligation upon which they had a right to seek a remedy at law.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The licence in question in this case was issued on the 5th day of October, 1891, under the authority of sections 54, 55, 56 and 57 of R.S.C., 1886, ch. 43. The legislation is still in force, being now contained in chapter 81, R.S.C., 1906, secs. 73-76. These sections are as follows:\u2014\n54. The Superintendent General or any officer or agent authorized by him to that effect, may grant licences to cut trees on reserves and ungranted Indian lands, at such rates, and subject to such conditions, regulations and restrictions, as are, from time to time, established by the Governor in Council, and such conditions, regulations and restrictions shall be adapted to the locality in which such reserves or lands are situated.\n55. No licence shall be so granted for a longer period than twelve months from the date thereof: and if, in consequence of any incorrectness of survey or other error, or cause whatsoever, a licence is found to comprise land included in a licence of a prior date, not being reserve, or ungranted Indian lands, the licence granted shall be void in so far as it comprises such land, and the holder or proprietor of the licence so rendered void shall have no claim upon the Crown for indemnity or compensation by reason of such avoidance.\n56. Every licence shall describe the lands upon which the trees may be cut, and the kind of trees which may be cut, and shall confer, for the time being, on the licensee the right to take and keep exclusive possession of the land so described subject to such regulations as are made; and every licence shall vest in the holder thereof all rights of property whatsoever in all trees of the kind specified, cut within the limits of the licence, during the term thereof, whether such trees are cut by the authority of the holder of such licence or by any other person, with or without his consent; and every licence shall entitle the holder thereof to seize in revendication or otherwise, such trees and the logs, timber or other product thereof, if the same are found in the possession of any unauthorized person, and also to institute any action or suit against any wrongful possessor or trespasser, and to prosecute all trespassers and other offenders to punishment, and to recover damages, if any, and all proceedings pending at the expiration of any licence may be continued to final termination, as if the licence had not expired.\n57. Every person who obtains a licence shall, at the expiration thereof, make to the officer or agent granting the same, or to the Superintendent General, a return of the number and kinds of trees cut, and of the quantity and description of saw-logs, or of the number and description of sticks or square or other timber, manufactured and carried away under such licence; and such statement shall be sworn to by the holder of the licence, or his agent, or by his foreman; and every person who refuses or neglects to furnish such statement, or who evades or attempts to evade any regulation made by the Governor in Council, shall be held to have cut without authority, and the timber or other product made shall be dealt with accordingly. The appellant alleges that by virtue of certain regulations dated the 15th September, 1888, and professedly made in pursuance of section 54, chapter 43, R.S.C., 1886, now section 73, chapter 81, R.S.C., 1906, and reproduced above, which regulations are still in force he became entitled and is still entitled to have his licence annually renewed at the expiration of the term thereof on the condition that during each term he should have complied with all the existing regulations affecting his licence. This contention is based upon sections 5, 11, and 12 of the regulation. Sections 5 and 11 are as follows:\u2014\n5. Licence holders who shall have complied with all existing regulations, shall be entitled to have their licenses renewed on application to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n11. All timber licences are to expire on the 30th day of April next after the date thereof, and all renewals are to be applied for before the 1st day of July, following the expiration of the last preceding licence; in default whereof the berth or berths may be treated as forfeited.\nThe original licence granted to the appellant in October, 1891, expired on the 30th of April, 1892. But the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the time being granted renewals down to the year 1909, the last expiring on the 30th of April, 1909, the grant of the renewal in each case being recorded in a simple memorandum declaring that the licence was renewed. At the expiration of the last mentioned licence the Government refused to grant any further renewals. Interpreting the regulations in accordance with the natural meaning of the words there could hardly be a serious answer to the appellant\u2019s contention in the absence of any dispute touching their legal validity when construed in that sense. The only question in debate, as I understand the controversy between the parties, is whether the regulations so read were beyond the competence of the Governor in Council exercising the powers conferred by section 54, or, to put the question in another way, whether assuming the regulations to have been validly made, we are not constrained by the provisions of the statute from which they derive their force to construe them in a way which necessarily defeats the appellant\u2019s claim. This question must be considered under two heads. First, what is the true construction of the Act of 1886, reading it as it stands, without reference to the course of legislation or judicial or administrative interpretation before and since the statute was passed; secondly, if, as I am constrained to hold that the view of the regulations upon which the appellant\u2019s claim necessarily rests is incompatible with the statute when effect is given to its language construed apart from the course of legislation and interpretation just referred to, does this course of legislation and interpretation justify another construction and one which will support the appellant\u2019s claim? As to the first point. The enactment of section 55, \u201cNo licence shall be so granted for a longer period than twelve months from the date thereof\u201d appears to me to import a prohibition which disables the Governor in Council when exercising authority conferred by section 54 from validly passing any regulations having for their effect, (1) the constituting of a contract for renewal such as that alleged between the Crown and the licensee as one of the incidents of a licence granted under section 54, or (2) the vesting in a licensee as such of a right whether contractual or not to have a fresh licence issued to him on the expiration of the term of the licence upon the sole condition that the stipulations of the original licence have been fulfilled. It may be assumed that if the word \u201clicence\u201d in the enactment of section 55 quoted ought to be read as merely descriptive of the instrument there would be no necessary incompatibility between that section and such a regulation. But if it were the instrument as such that was contemplated by that section one would naturally expect to find some other form of expression than the words \u201cshall be so granted\u201d which words seem more appropriate as making provision for the duration of the right than as merely dictating the form of the instrument; and, I think, reading these sections as a whole, that it is the duration of the right which is being provided for. If that is the true construction it would follow that the Governor in Council is powerless to attach to the grant of a licence any incident by regulation or otherwise having the effect of entitling the grantee as such to exercise the rights of a licensee for a longer term than a single year.\nAs to the second point. Regulations in the form in question were, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Osier and Mr. Justice Maclennan in the passages quoted from their judgments in Smylie v. The Queen[6], promulgated under the Ontario Act of 1868, and these regulations had been in force for more than twenty years when the regulations now in question were framed in professed exercise of authority conferred in terms identical in effect with those of the Act of 1868.\nThe statute of 1886 was re-enacted in 1906 and if one had to consider the statute and the regulations alone one would, I think, be driven to the conclusion that there had been an administrative interpretation of the statute in accordance with the view contended for by the appellant, and it would have been necessary then to consider whether there had not been a legislative adoption of that interpretation. I am disposed to think, however, in view of the course of judicial opinion, that this administrative interpretation is not entitled to very much weight. Questions as to the proper effect of these or identical enactments and regulations have many times come before the courts during the last forty years and have been the subject of many expressions of judicial opinion, and these expressions have been overwhelmingly against the appellant\u2019s view; it is unnecessary to specify the decisions, which are referred to in the judgments in Smylie v. The Queen[7]. In these circumstances, we are, I think, compelled to give effect to the statute in accordance with what appears to us to be the proper reading of the language of the sections themselves.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of this case are sufficiently set forth in the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court. By his petition the suppliant prays that he may be declared entitled to the renewal of a timber licence held by him over Indian lands, which the Crown refuses to grant, and he asks consequential relief.\nThe material parts of the relevant sections of the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1886, ch. 43, are as follows:\u2014\n54. The Superintendent General or any officer or agent authorized by him to that effect may grant licences to cut trees on reserves and ungranted Indian lands * * * subject to such * * * regulations * * * as are from time to time established by the Governor-in-Council. * * *\n55. No licence shall be so granted for a longer period than twelve months from the date thereof. * * *\nSections 73 and 74 of chapter 81, R.S.C, 1906, are in terms similar to sections 54 and 55 of the Act of 1886.\nThe original provisions, which these sections reproduce, were consolidated as sections 1 and 2 of the \u201cPublic Lands Timber Licences Act,\u201d chapter 23 in the C.S.C., 1859, which were made applicable to Indian lands by 31 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 35.\nPursuant to the provisions of section 54 of the Revised Statutes of 1886 the following regulations inter alia were duly enacted and promulgated on Sept. 5th, 1888:\u2014\n5. Licence holders who shall have complied with all existing regulations, shall be entitled to have their licences renewed on application to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n11. All timber licences are to expire on the 30th day of April next after the date thereof and all renewals are to be applied for before the first day of July following the expiration of the last preceding licence, in default whereof the berth or berths may be treated as forfeited.\nA number of other provisions in the regulations contain references to the renewal of licences.\nThe suppliant, appealing from an adverse judgment of the Exchequer Court, contends that the statute, properly construed, does not prohibit the issue of a renewable licence; that the regulations expressly authorize the issue of such licences and that, having been laid before Parliament, they must be taken to have received its sanction; and that, having paid a large sum of money for his licence on the faith of obtaining a right to a renewal under the statute and regulations, he is either contractually or equitably entitled to such renewal as of right.\nOn the construction of the statute the appellant\u2019s contention is, in my opinion, hopeless. The language of section 55 is too plain to admit of any doubt. To interpret it as authorizing the issue of a licence renewable as of right after the lapse of the year for which it was granted, and so on from year to year, would defeat its obvious intent. There is no real distinction between a perpetual licence and a licence perpetually renewable. Both are equally obnoxious to a provision which forbids the granting of a licence for a longer period than twelve months.\nNor is the appellant\u2019s position improved by invoking regulation No. 5. The early history of that regulation is given by Maclennan J.A., in Smylie v. The Queen[8], at pp. 183-4, as follows:\u2014\nRegulation 5 provides that licence holders who have complied with all existing regulations shall be entitled to have their licences renewed on application, and regulation 11, that all licences shall expire on the 30th of April next after the date thereof, and that renewals are to be applied for and issued before the 1st of July following the expiration, on default whereof the right to renewal shall cease, and the berth shall be treated as forfeited. The original regulations of the 5th of September, 1849, Canada Gazette, vol. 8, p. 6999, are expressed differently. Regulation 8 declares that licensees who have complied, etc., will be considered as having a claim to the renewal of their licences in preference to all others on application, etc., failing which the limits are to be considered vacant, etc. A change was made on the 23rd of June, 1866, since which the regulation relating to renewal has continued to be in the form approved of on the 16th of April, 1869.\nThe learned judge continues in language which I respectfully adopt:\u2014\nThe question is whether these two regulations were intended or can be held to weaken or qualify the clear terms of the statute, and to confer a right not expressed in the licence itself, and I think it impossible so to hold. In the first place it was not so intended. The second clause of the order in council expressly refers to the requirements of the statute, as matters which were to govern licences and renewals thereof, as well as the regulations, conditions and restrictions, which were then being ordained. Again by regulation 24, the exact form of the licence is prescribed, and in the form the term is expressed to be from its date to the 30th of April and no longer; and there is not a word in it about renewal. I think, therefore, the intention of the regulations is to comply with, and not to qualify, the statute. But if the regulation is not in accordance with the statute, if it assumes to confer a right of renewal, it must give way to the statute, and can confer no right beyond what the statute authorized the Land Commissioner to grant, and that is a licence for a term not exceeding twelve months. The regulations which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was authorized to establish were in respect of licences which were not to exceed twelve months in duration. So far as they go beyond that they cannot bind the Crown.\nThat the holder of a licence, subject to a regulation identical with that now relied upon, was not entitled to a renewal as of right had been held in a series of Ontario cases. Contois v. Bonfield, in 1875-6[9]; McArthur v. Northern and Pacific Junction Railway Co., in 1890[10]; Shairp v. Lakefield Lumber Company, in 1890-1[11]; and Muskoka Mill and Lumber Co. v. McDermott, in 1894[12].\nAs put by Moss J.A. in Smylie v. The Queen, in 1900[13], at pp. 190-191:\u2014\nIt is enough to say that an agreement for a renewal is something which the law has not empowered the Commissioner of Crown Lands or the Department of Crown Lands to enter into. It is not within the statute, which authorizes no more than the giving of a right to cut timber, and even that for a period not longer than twelve months.\nThe regulations must be construed as not intending to enlarge the rights of persons dealing in respect of timber beyond such as the statute authorizes, and no greater effect has been attributed to them by the courts of the province whenever it has become necessary to consider them.\nThe term \u201crenewal\u201d seems to be applied to licences issued after the first. But in reality this is not an accurate description. They are not in the nature of a restoration or revival of a right. Each is a new grant. It bears no necessary relation to the preceding licence It may or not be couched in the same language and subject to the same conditions, regulations and restrictions, as the former. It is not the continuance of an old or existing right, but the creation of a new original right.\nIt is probably now quite too late to contend that regulation No. 5 should be given a construction which, assuming its validity, would confer on timber licensees, complying with the regulations, an absolute right to renewal; but, if the 5th regulation should be so construed, it is still more hopeless to contend for its validity in the face of the explicit language of section 55 of the statute.\nIt was conceded at bar that regulation No. 5 might be revoked or altered at any time by the Governor-in-Council and that the suppliant\u2019s rights as licensee would be subject to such revocation or alteration. But it is maintained that, in the absence of such revocation or alteration, the regulation is binding upon the Crown. In so far as it is authorized and subject to proper construction, this is no doubt the case. But the fact that it may be so revoked or altered does not warrant a construction of an existing regulation in conflict with the prohibition of the statute. Nor does it render it valid while it stands unrepealed or unchanged, if only such a construction can be put upon it.\nAlthough the statute requiring regulations passed under the \u201cIndian Act\u201d to be laid before Parliament appears to have been enacted only in the year 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. (D.), ch. 32, sec. 12), if it may be assumed in favour of the appellant that the regulation in question was duly laid before both Houses of Parliament that would not materially affect his case. Parliament may be taken to have known the construction which the courts had put upon this regulation and to have allowed it to remain unchallenged in the expectation that that construction would be adhered to. Moreover, although the fact that a regulation which has been laid before Parliament remains in force unchanged is, no doubt, a circumstance entitled to weight as raising a probability of its being valid and in conformity with the intention of Parliament, it does not suffice to render the regulation effectual and unimpeachable, if, on the only construction of which it is susceptible, it contravenes an express statutory provision. On the other hand, it affords a very strong ground for giving to the regulation a construction not obnoxious to the statute.\nNor has the suppliant any such right as he asserts to the favourable consideration of a Court of Equity.\nHis original licence in 1891 was expressly limited to the term \u201cfrom 5th October, 1891, to 30th April, 1892, and no longer.\u201d It contained no provision for renewal. Each of the so-called renewals in like manner extends only to the ensuing 30th April and contains no allusion to further renewal. There is no evidence of any contract for renewal, and, if there were, no such contract which its officers might purport to make could bind the Crown in the face of the statutory prohibition. But whether the suppliant bases his claim upon contract or upon the effect of the regulation, he must be assumed to have known the law applicable to the licence which he sought and obtained, and to have taken it subject to that law.\nThere is no evidence before us as to the value of the timber limits in question when the appellant became licensee or of their subsequent appreciation. But it is common knowledge, which we cannot disregard, that this appreciation has been very great of recent years. Whether the sum paid by the suppliant for his licence, by way of bonus, premium or otherwise, should be deemed large or small would necessarily depend upon these considerations. Whatever sum he paid to obtain the licence was, no doubt, paid in the expectation that it would probably be renewed from year to year, as is ordinarily the case with Crown timber licences, but always subject to the right of the Crown, in its discretion, to refuse such renewal. Of an adverse exercise of that discretion at any time he took the risk and he cannot be heard to complain. Under such circumstances there can be no ground for curial intervention in his behalf.\nA construction of the regulations which would give to licensees who have complied with them an absolute right to renewals not only directly conflicts with the prohibition of the 55th section of the statute, but would also do grave injustice to the bands of Indians for whom the Crown holds the Indian lands in trust.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The appellant claims that he was entitled to have a renewal of his licence to cut timber on Indian lands. The licence itself, which embodies the rights and obligations of the department, on one side, and of the licensee on the other, does not contain any such right on the part of the licensee.\nHe relies on certain regulations passed by the Governor in Council.\nIt would not be necessary for me to examine if those regulations could hear such a construction, because, then, they would be in violation of the statute, which declares that no licences should be granted for a longer period than twelve months, and the Governor in Council could not make any regulations that would be in contravention with a statutory enactment so explicit.\nIt could be stated also that the Indians are the wards of the state and no policy should be adopted that would deprive the Indians of the fruits that their reserves could procure for them. It may be that at one time their lands could he more advantageously exploited as timber lands but at some other time they should be converted into farm lands in the interest of the Indians. Then it would be a pity that through some previous concessions to timber licence holders that beneficial change could not take place.\nFor those reasons the appeal should he dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Christie, Greene & Hill.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Chrysler, Bethune & Larmonth.\n[1] 14 Ex.

A signal was given, on starting the crane, at some distance from the workmen; shortly afterwards it came to a momentary stop and moved on again towards the workmen without any further signal and plaintiff was injured. In his action for damages, the plaintiff charged want of proper system and guards. The Court of Appeal set aside a judgment in favour of plaintiff, upon a general verdict by the jury, and ordered a new trial for the purpose of assessing damages under the British Columbia \"Employers' Liability Act,\" on the ground that it had been admitted that there was a system in existence which, if properly carried out, would have been sufficient for the protection of the workmen.\nHeld, that, on a proper appreciation of the evidence, having regard to the course of the trial, the directions of the trial judge had presented the issues fully to the jury, and, there being evidence to support it, their verdict ought not to have been disturbed. Davies and Anglin JJ. dissented.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Where exception to the directions of the judge has not been taken at the trial or in the first court of appeal, it is, in the absence of special circumstances, too late to urge such objections upon a subsequent appeal to a higher court. White v. Victoria Lumber and Manufacturing Co. ((1910) A.C. 606) followed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia by which the judgment entered at the trial, on a general verdict by the jury in favour of the plaintiff, was set aside and a new trial ordered.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the issues raised on the present appeal are set out in the judgments now reported.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014It appears to me quite obvious, after reading the pleadings and evidence, that both parties to this litigation assumed at the outset that the accident to the plaintiff was mainly attributable to the absence of a guard on the traveller and that little, if any, fault was chargeable to the system under which that traveller was operated. There is no suggestion in plaintiff's evidence on discovery or in his examination in chief at the trial that his injury was caused as the result of a failure on the part of those in charge of the traveller to give the proper signals to notify the workmen of its approach. His whole evidence is directed to prove that the construction of the traveller was defective in that there was no guard on the wheels. He says that when he was coming up from under the platform of the bridge he saw the traveller stop at a short distance, two or three feet, from the the place where he put his hand on the rail to steady himself, and he does not suggest, as he would naturally have done had the thought been present to his mind, that the traveller then moved forward and crushed his hand without giving him warning. His only griev- ance is that there was nothing in front of the wheels to attract his attention by physical contact with his hand to the danger to which he was exposed. It is only after the engineer, who controlled in part the working of the traveller, had testified to the practice of omitting signals after the momentary stop and the subsequent setting in motion of the traveller without sounding a whistle, and the divided control over the movements of the traveller which moved forward as much under the direction of the man under the lower platform at the spool as of the engineer above came out in the evidence that it occurred, if at all, to counsel to suggest this ground of negligence or defect in the system under which the traveller was operated. I am much impressed by what the judge said in his charge, in the extract quoted by Mr. Justice Anglin, and no attempt was then made to correct him. But, on the whole record, it appears that there was no proper system of signals such as it was the duty of the employers to provide for the due protection of their employees, and, in the alternative, if there was a proper system originally adopted it was negligently departed from to the knowledge of those in charge of the work. It is apparent on the whole evidence, as the case stood when it went to the jury, that the system of signals was, by reason of the divided control of the traveller, imperfect. All the engineer can say is that his engine did not stop at the time when the plaintiff says it was at a standstill, but under the system under which the traveller was operated the engine may have been revolving and the wheels of the traveller at a standstill if the clutch was off the rope or if the rope was not tight on the drum.\nIt is, therefore, apparent that there may have been and probably was a misunderstanding between the man at the engine and the man on the platform below, who co-operated in the control of the movements of the traveller, and to this the accident may be attributable. There also seems to have been a complete misunderstanding as to the system adopted for the proper warning of employees of approaching danger. The engineer, over and over again, affirms that the system did not require a signal to be given for what he calls \"momentary stops,\" whereas all the workmen examined agree that each time the traveller started after having been at rest they expected to receive a signal and this undoubtedly seems to be a very reasonable view to take if the system was really intended to be effective.\nHow, indeed, could a workman, in the circumstances in which the plaintiff was placed, seeing the traveller at a standstill, decide whether it was stopped for a moment or for a lengthened period of time? If to this we add the divided control over the movements of the traveller, the conclusion that the system was defective would appear to be irresistible.\nIt is now argued, however, that this ground of liability was not properly put to the jury. I certainly am of opinion that it was put in issue by the pleadings. In plaintiff's statement of particulars it is alleged that his personal injuries were sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendants in respect to paragraph F 1. It is quite true, as forcibly urged by my brother Anglin, that the judge's charge was not as full or as complete on this ground of liability as it should have been. After full consideration I adopt the view of Mr. Justice Duff as to the duty of counsel and the powers of this court in such a case as we have now under consideration. We have the whole record before us. The issues may not have been very logically put to the court, the evidence may not have been skillfully marshalled, and the jury may not have been very clearly or fully directed, but, if on the pleading and evidence we are satisfied that substantial justice has been done, that both parties have had their day in court, it is not only our right but our duty to say so and avoid further costly litigation and no less ruinous delay. The old Latin maxim still has its place in our system, \"interest reipublicce ut sit finis litium.\"\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal but would direct a new trial alike on the common law claim and the statutory claim under \"Employers' Liability Act\" with costs to abide the event.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant's hand was crushed by a machine, called a traveller, used in bridge building whilst he was necessarily holding on to the rail over which the traveller ran.\nHe tells what he was doing. Before putting his hand on the rail for support he says:\u2014\nQ. Were you giving any directions to the workmen?\nA. I turned around and saw the traveller was standing still, and I told the bucker up to straighten the needle beam.\n*****\nQ. And how long were you up in that position before your hand was cut?\nA. I should judge about three seconds, probably a little more than that, five or six seconds; long enough to look down and tell him to go ahead and straighten it.\nQ. Before you put your hand on the rail did you see where the traveller was?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Where was it? A. Standing right back of me, about two feet from me, standing still.\nQ. Standing still?\nA. Standing still.\nQ. What was it doing \u2014 what was the traveller doing?\nA. It was standing still.\n*****\nQ. Was there any signal given with respect to the\u2014immediately before the car moved on your hand?\nA. When I stepped on the chord I could see the traveller standing there; there was no whistle blown when I got up there.\nQ. How long before that had there been any signal?\nA. How long before that?\nA. Yes?\nA. I could not say.\nQ. Then up to the time of your being injured, and whilst you were on the bridge you know of no signal?\nA. No signal; no whistle blown.\nQ. No whistle blown. Had a whistle blown what would you have done?\nA. Got back on the staging.\nAnother witness corroborates this as follows:\u2014\nQ. What attracted your attention when Creveling was injured?\nA. I heard him holler, and then I came up to see what had happened.\nQ. Was he injured?\nA. He was injured.\nQ. Before he was injured, right at the time he was injured, and before within a reasonable length of time, was there any signal given by the engineer?\nA. No.\nQ. Have you any doubt about it at all?\nA. No.\nThe man operating the engine alleges he gave two blasts when the traveller started from a point a hundred feet or more to the rear of where appellant and his mate were working, but does not pretend to have given any later.\nWe have no proof of any rules laid down by the respondent for the protection in this regard of the men who were engaged in the dangerous work in question. All, including appellant, who speak on the sub- ject, say the men depended on the warning of the whistle at the starting of the traveller in motion. If that had been rightly observed appellant admits its protection would have sufficed for him though he and others say besides that a guard projecting ahead of the traveller is in common use in many places. No such guard was used by respondent. No statutory provision relative thereto seems to exist except what indirectly bearing thereon exists in the \"Employers' Liability Act.\"\nThe man in charge of the engine indicates that the only system he had observed was to give a blast or two blasts when he started the engine to propel the traveller on its way, and that if through any cause the traveller had to be stopped, neither he nor any one else had any duty imposed by the respondent to take steps to give further warning when starting up again to proceed further forward.\nI cannot think that was such an adequate system as would discharge the respondent from its common law liability. A trap seems to have been set instead of an effectively protective system.\nThere seems to have been an absence of such protective measures as indicated to be necessary by the principle applied in Smith v. Baker & Sons[1], and many other cases since.\nThree charges of neglect of that kind were set out in the statement of claim, and a good deal more attention was paid at the trial to the want of a guard than to that involved in the said system or want of system, but that does not, when all were plainly before the court, help respondent, yet its counsel urges for that reason the verdict should not stand. A plaintiff is entitled to hold the judgment awarded him as result of a general verdict when there is evidence upon which the jury could properly find such verdict; and that even though the learned trial judge had overlooked the evidence and its possible application in law and the counsel had been warring about something else, possibly having only a remote relation to the common sense view of the case; always provided, however, that the judge has not misdirected the jury.\nThe evidence quoted above was such and I see no misdirection.\nIf there had been a proper guard then the question might have arisen if that should not be held sufficient in itself.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014In his statement of claim the plaintiff charges negligence as follows:\u2014\n3. The said personal injuries, which the plaintiff sustained as aforesaid, were caused by reason of the negligence of the defendant, particulars of which are as follows:\u2014\n(a) In not having any system, or in the alternative any proper and sufficient system of signals to carry on the work of construction in safety to the plaintiff.\n(d) In not having guards or other protection on or in front of the wheels of the said traveller.\nThe jury found a general verdict in favour of the plaintiff on his claim for damages in respect of the respondents' alleged liability at common law. The Court of Appeal set aside this verdict and ordered a new trial for the purpose of assessing damages under the \"Employers' Liability Act.\" This judgment of the Court of Appeal was based on the view taken by all the members of the court that the plaintiff had ad- mitted the existence of a \"system\" of signals which, if properly carried out, would afford sufficient protection.\nWith respect, I think the Court of Appeal misapprehended the effect of the evidence. There was evidence no doubt given on behalf of the plaintiff and the plaintiff himself stated in his own testimony in so many words, that there was a \"system\" of signals which, if carried out, would have been satisfactory. But it is quite obvious that all the witnesses while using the word \"system\" were speaking of the practice of signalling as they had observed it. From this practice, as they saw it, they naturally enough inferred that it was the duty of the engineer to see that a signal was given by a blast of his whistle whenever (the travelling derrick having stopped) it was about to be set in motion again. But the engineer himself was called as a witness. He was the only witness who was competent to give evidence at first hand of anything which could properly be described as a \"system\" in any relevant sense, that is to say, of a practice which under his instructions, express or implied, it was obligatory upon him to observe in the execution of the duties of his service. He explicitly denies that there was any such obligatory practice requiring him to give any signal after what he described as \"a momentary stop.\" And he gives evidence which is intended to convey the impression, and may very well have convinced the jury that (owing to the manner of construction of the travelling derrick and the fact that the control of the locomotive apparatus was not in the hands of the engineer himself, but in the hands of others who were not within his view while working the apparatus) it was quite possible for the derrick to be brought to a stand still and set in motion very shortly afterwards without any signal being given; and that in the circumstances it was not practicable to provide, and the \"system\" such as there was, did not in fact provide for the giving of a signal in such cases.\nThis evidence appears to have been overlooked in the court below; and having regard to it, it seems impossible to sustain the judgment setting aside the verdict on the ground on which that judgment was placed by the learned judges who took part in it. Mr. Tilley now argues, however, that the negligence charged in paragraph 3 (d), namely, the absence of a guard, is a charge which cannot be sustained on the evidence. And he contends that as the charge put forward in paragraph 3 (d) was the only charge the plaintiff attempted to establish in his own case in chief and the only ground of negligence submitted to the jury, the action must be dismissed, unless it should be thought just that as an indulgence to the plaintiff there should be a new trial for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to establish a case reposing on the ground of negligence charged in paragraph 3 (a) \u2014absence of a sufficient system of signals. I think this ingenious analysis quite fails to do justice to the significance of the evidence in its bearing upon the case advanced by the appellant at the trial. The plaintiff offered evidence to shew that the dangers arising from the operation of such machines were commonly avoided by mechanical protection consisting of a guard which (sweeping the rails upon which the derrick moves) automatically gives warning (by physical contact with his person) to any workman exposed to the peril of such mishaps as that from which the appellant suffered. It was not denied by the plaintiff's witnesses, as I have already indicated, that the giving of signals by blasts after all stops, would, if faithfully observed, be a practice affording sufficient protection; but it was contended that the faithful carrying out of any such practice could not be, in the circumstances, implicitly relied upon and that it ought to be supplemented by the mechanical warning suggested. That was the case put forward by the plaintiff, and it may be that it ought to fail if it rested solely upon the testimony offered on his behalf in his case in chief. But the answers of the engineer to which I have referred, brought out in cross-examination on behalf of the plaintiff, affords evidence to the benefit of which the plaintiff is as much entitled as of the evidence given by his own witnesses called by himself. Those answers afford ample grounds, as I have already pointed out, for a finding by the jury that the so-called \"system\" or the practice in operation was, for the reasons I have above mentioned, as the plaintiff contended it must be, quite valueless as a protection in such circumstances as those which led to the mishap from which the plaintiff suffered. It was, therefore, open to the jury to find that the failure to provide some such additional safeguard as the mechanical provision suggested constituted in the circumstances a default in performance of the obligation of the defendant company to take reasonable measures for the protection of its employees in a situation which in the absence of such precautions constantly exposed them to the risk of injury; the evidence of the respondents' foreman indeed is quite sufficient to support a finding that a mechanical guard effective for the purpose suggested could be provided without difficulty.\nI see no reason whatever to suppose that this issue was not placed before the jury. The evidence upon which the respondents rely and which prevailed with the Court of Appeal as shewing the existence of a satisfactory and sufficient system of warning was brought out by the respondents' counsel in cross-examination of the plaintiff himself deliberately and beyond all doubt with the object of presenting an answer to the complaint of insufficient provision for warning. We are asked by the respondents' counsel now to assume that, as bearing upon the issue whether or not sufficient provision was afforded for warning the workmen of the movement of the crane, counsel for the respondents at the trial failed to bring before the jury this evidence obtained from the plaintiff and his witnesses for that very purpose and to ask the jury to consider whether or not the complaint made by the plaintiff of insufficient means of warning was answered by it.\nIt is incredible that any such course was in fact pursued. It is incredible indeed, in view of the evidence given on the cross-examination by the engineer, that the question of the adequacy of the alleged \"system\" should not have been put before the jury as one of the elements governing the determination of the question upon which the learned trial judge specifically asked them to pass, namely, whether in the circumstances the failure to provide a mechanical \"guard\" constituted in contemplation of law a neglect of the respondents' duty to the appellant. Since there was, as I have said, evidence sufficient to sustain the finding of the jury on the issue just mentioned upon which they admittedly did pass, it is unnecessary to say more upon the points argued by counsel in support of the judgment in the court below.\nIt is suggested, however, from the Bench, that the proper judgment here was not to restore the judgment of the learned trial judge but to direct a new trial. For several reasons, I think such a judgment by this court would be unjust. But it should be sufficient to observe that the suggestion is not based upon any alleged misdirection or want of direction, calculated to mislead the jury, of which any complaint whatever has been made by the defendant company at any stage of the proceedings. Indeed, it is manifest that at no stage of the proceedings has the defendant company suggested the propriety of a new trial. From the beginning the verdict has been attacked by it on the ground, and only on the ground, that the finding on the issue submitted specifically by the learned trial judge is not reasonably supported by the evidence. That contention rejected, the whole attack on the verdict \u2014 the question of damages and the question of volens apart \u2014 entirely fails.\nThat being the case even if the learned trial judge's charge were open to serious objection, and I think it is not, it is now too late for the defendant company to ask for a new trial in this court.\nIn White v. Victoria Lumber and Manufacturing Co.[2], at page 612, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\u2014\nFor in their judgment it is not open to a party who has not used the opportunity at. the trial, nor, either in writing or in argument, used the opportunity in the Court of Appeal, to state for the first time at their Lordships' Bar an objection to the verdict of a jury on the ground of misdirection. It is, of course, possible that some highly exceptional case might arise, but in general it may be laid down that neither party to proceedings before the Privy Council should be permitted to start fresh points of objection which have been open to him and have been neglected at opportune and convenient stages of the litigation in the Colonial Courts. It is not in accordance with justice to the parties that, after an appeal has been made to the Privy Council, they should for the first time learn what the true nature of the case to be made against them is.\nI think this states the rule by which this court has been and ought to be guided.\nAs to the defence of volens it appears to me that it would be a hopeless contention that the jury were bound to find in face of the engineer's evidence that the plaintiff fully understood the danger to which he was exposed by reason of the defects admittedly unknown to the plaintiff in the alleged system of signals. As to damages I do not think any sufficient case has been made out for interfering with the verdict of the jury.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion there was evidence on which a jury might (I do not say it should) have found the defendants liable at common law either because the system of warning signals provided by them was defective or because, though as perfect as it could reasonably be made, it left the workmen so unnecessarily exposed to danger that it was negligence in the defendants as employers not to have equipped the \"traveller\" with some guard or mechanical contrivance to give warning, which was said to be practicable and in common use. Although there were some admissions made by the plaintiff that if the system of signals had been properly carried out by the engineer it would have afforded adequate protection, the evidence of the engineer himself scarcely pointed to that conclusion. But as the case was left to the jury there was no issue submitted to them as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the signalling system. The whole direction as to the common law liability of the defendants is contained in this single paragraph of the charge:\u2014\nI will deal with common law first. When a plaintiff comes in court in an action of this kind the onus is on him, in the first place, to prove the negligence of his employer; that means that he must put his finger on something and say to you that the employer failed to live up to the standard which the law imposed upon him, which standard is that the employer must not subject his men to unnecessary risk, or, in other words, that he must give his men a safe place to work under all the circumstances of the occupation that he is employed in. You, gentlemen of the jury, are to use your common sense in determining whether in this particular accident this man was given a safe place to work, and whether subjected to unnecessary risks, remembering it is the duty of the employer not to subject his employees to such risk, or, to put it the other way, he must give his employee a safe place to work; and you will remember also, that the plaintiff must bring before you affirmative evidence that convinces you that the probabilities are, at any rate, on his side that he was not given a safe place to work, or he was subjected to unnecessary risk. This case has been put to you very clearly; more clearly I may say than cases of this nature often are. Here the plaintiff fixed on one thing to found his common law action upon. He says that the machine should have been guarded and he says that in consequence of its not being guarded he was not given a safe place to work under all the circumstances. As I say, it is for you to say whether that is so, or not; if that is so, and if you find affirmatively that he has proven that, then he has made out a case affirmatively and at common law the employer is liable unless he can meet that case with some defence.\nUnder this direction the jury may have found the defendants liable for not having provided a mechanical warning device, although their signalling system was perfect in itself and adequate as a means of warning, if carried out, and the defendants very fairly argue that it is a reasonable inference that that was in fact their finding. It is true the plaintiff now contends that the evidence shews that the signalling system was defective in not providing for momentary stops and that it was inadequate because the engineer, who was charged with the duty of signalling, had not complete or immediate control of the movements of the traveller and his particulars of negligence covered these points. But the plaintiff allowed the jury to be instructed that \"he fixed on one thing to found his common law action upon,\" namely, the absence of a guard. In effect the jury were told that there was no case before them of a defective or inadequate signalling system as a ground of action, either because the evidence did not make it, or because the plaintiff did not base his claim upon it. Were they not also, in effect, told that the question as to the necessity for a guard or mechanical warning device did not depend on these considerations?\nThey were not told that the duty of the employer did not require him to provide every conceivable protection for the workmen or to take every precaution that could be suggested, but was limited to furnishing such safeguards as were reasonably sufficient to ensure them against injury. They were not instructed that if the system of signals provided was adequate for that purpose the defendants could not properly be found negligent for having failed to do something more. It is true that they were told that it was for them to say whether it was negligent on the part of the defendants not to have guarded the machine \"under all the circumstances.\" But these circumstances included the engineer's failure to give signals, and the jury were not told that if this failure was due merely to the personal fault of the engineer and not to a defect in the system of signalling as prescribed by the defendants, that was something which they should not take into account in considering the necessity for a mechanical guarding device or whether the defendants were negligent in not having supplied it. They were not told that the defendants were not answerable at common law if, but for the personal fault of the engineer, the plaintiff would have received sufficient warning.\nOn the whole I think the charge was inadequate and that the verdict at common law cannot be sustained because of non-direction upon points on which the jury should have been instructed.\nI have not overlooked such well-known cases as Nevill v. Fine Art and General Ins. Co.[3], and White v. Victoria Lumber and Manufacturing Co.[4], where the necessity of taking with precision and in detail at the trial and in the first Court of Appeal objections to a verdict on grounds of misdirection or non-direction is insisted upon. But I think this is one of those exceptional cases, referred to by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in the last cited case, in which the omission to take the objection should not prevent the court ordering a new trial. Upon the general verdict rendered, it is, in view of the defective and inadequate charge, quite impossible to know whether the jury based their conclusion on considerations which would justify a finding of liability at common law. For this both parties are to blame \u2014 the plaintiff quite as much as the defendants \u2014 though the defendants are, of course, alone responsible for the failure to make specific objections to the charge a ground of appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. This case affords a striking illustration of the mistake of allowing juries by returning a general verdict to evade answering direct questions put to them in order to make their findings of fact certain and definite. Where, as in this case, the charge is meagre and there are several issues presented a general verdict is far from satisfactory and must often result in uncertainty as to the ground on which the jury has proceeded.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Martin, Craig, Parkes & Anderson.\n[1] [1891] A.C. 325.\n[2] [1910] A.C. 606.\n[3] [1897] A.C. 68, at p. 76.\n[4] [1910] A.C. 606, at p. 612.\n",

C. travelled by the train in charge of the stock upon a \u201cLive-Stock Transportation Pass\u201d and signed conditions indorsed in English thereon by which he assumed all risks of injury and released the company from liability for damages to person or property while travelling on the pass, whether caused by negligence or otherwise. While the train was passing through the Province of Ontario, an accident happened through the negligence of the company\u2019s employees and C. was killed. In an action by his dependents, instituted in the Province of Quebec, it was shewn that C. could neither read nor write, except to sign his name, and that he only understood enough English to comprehend orders in respect of his occupation as a stock-man; there was no evidence that the nature of the conditions was explained to him.\nHeld (Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting), that the railway company was liable for damages in the action by the dependents. Per Davies, Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ. (Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. contra), that, as C. could not have known the nature of the conditions or that they released the company from liability, and the company had not done what was reasonably sufficient to give him notice of the conditions on which he was being carried, the company was liable in damages either under the law of Ontario or that of Quebec.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Although no action would lie in Ontario unless the deceased would have had a right of action, had he survived, and such an action would have been barred there by the contract signed by him, nevertheless, in Quebec, where there is no such rule of law, the action would lie, though the wrongful act had been committed in Ontario, as it was of a class actionable in Ontario. Machado v. Fontes ((1897) 2 Q.B. 231) applied.\nSection 340 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, provides that \u201cno contract, condition, * * * or notice made or given by the company impairing restricting or limiting its liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic shall * * * relieve the company from such liability unless such class of contract * * * shall have been first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board. (2) The Board may, in any case or by regulation, determine the extent to which the liability of the company may be so impaired, restricted or limited.\u201d The Board of Railway Commissioners made an interim order permitting the use by the company, until otherwise determined, of the shipping form used, but did not expressly authorize the form containing the conditions signed by deceased.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies and Anglin JJ. (Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra), that the contract signed by deceased was one of a class of contracts authorized by the Board.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The contract signed by deceased could not have the effect of limiting the liability of the company in respect of death because it was not in a form authorized or approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners and there had been no order or regulation made by the Board expressly determining the extent to which the company\u2019s liability should be impaired, restricted or limited as provided by sub-section 2 of section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nJudgment appealed from, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court (Q.R. 46 S.C. 319) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec[1], by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was maintained with costs.\nIn the circumstances stated in the head-note, one Joseph Chalifour was killed while travelling as a stock-man, in charge of live stock, on a train of the company, defendants, in a railway accident which happened at Chapleau, in the Province of Ontario, and the action was brought by his dependents in the Province of Quebec to recover damages as compensation for the injury. The case was tried by a judge, without a jury, and judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiffs for $5,000 damages. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants. The judgment appealed from is erroneous because (1) there was no evidence to justify disregard of the release contained in the pass signed by deceased on which he was travelling; (2) the law of Quebec cannot apply to a right of action resulting from tort committed in Ontario; (3) respondents\u2019 rights, if any, were statutory rights accruing under the law of Ontario; (4) the release was equally effective to bar respondents\u2019 right of action, whether construed according to the law of Quebec or that of Manitoba, where the contract was signed by deceased; (5) the deceased could not have maintained an action, had he survived, and, consequently, the respondents cannot recover; (6) the contract signed by deceased was a release of all claims whether arising from death or injuries.

Gillett[18]; Clark v. London General Omnibus Co.[19]; Jackson v. Watson & Sons[20]. R. C. Smith K.C. and Savard for the respondents. The form of the contract indorsed on the pass in question was never authorized or approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners pursuant to section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The form of the shipping bill, which had been so approved, was a separate and distinct contract from that which was signed by deceased, the parties were not the same and there was no consideration for the agreement between deceased and the company; it was nullum pactum, according to the law of Quebec; arts. 982 to 989 C.C.; the reduction in the fare benefited only the shippers; Robinson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[21], per Latchford J., upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada[22]. Deceased was an illiterate man and signed the conditions on the pass in circumstances in which he did not give a full and valid consent to the release; the effect of the conditions was not explained to him. The shipping bill was never seen or signed by him nor was it read to him. The case of \u201cdeath\u201d is not mentioned in the conditions of the pass, it merely refers to accident or damage to person or property.

Doutre[25].\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and Savard for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the widow and children of one Jos. Chalifour recovered $5,000 from the railway company for his death. The accident occurred at Chapleau, in the Province of Ontario. The deceased was travelling on a pass issued by the defendant company to the plaintiff\u2019s employer, the Gordon Ironsides Co. He was engaged in the shipment of cattle; the train upon which he was being carried met with an accident through the negligence of the company\u2019s servants which resulted in his death. The defence turns in large measure upon the effect of the contract between the Gordon Ironsides Co. and the railway company which provided that, where a pass was issued, the company should be freed from all liability whether caused by the negligence of its servants or otherwise.\nThe contract was made in Manitoba and the court below held that as no evidence was given respecting the law in Manitoba, it must be assumed to be the same as in the Province of Quebec and the case was, therefore, governed by the Quebec law.\nIn Quebec the wife and children have an independent cause of action (art. 1055 C.C.). But the death of the husband and father must be caused by an \u201coffence or quasi-offence\u201d committed by the party proceeded against. In other words, delict is the foundation of the right of action.\nIt has been recently said that negligence, to be negligence, must be a breach of duty and unless there was a breach of duty to take care, there was no negligence. Here the deceased was, at the time of the accident, travelling on the railway on a pass issued by the company respondent under statutory authority, and a condition of that pass was, that the deceased assumed\nall risk of accident or damage to person or property and that the company should be free from all liability in respect of any damage, injury or loss caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nThis pass was issued by the company in connection with a \u201cspecial live stock\u201d contract approved of by the Board of Railway Commissioners and entered into by the employers of the deceased, containing this clause:\u2014\nIn case of the company granting to the shipper or any nominee or nominees of the shipper, a pass or privilege less than full fare, to ride on the train in which the property is being carried, for the purpose of taking care of the same while in transit, and at the owner\u2019s risk as aforesaid, then as to every person so travelling on such pass, or privilege less than full fare, the company is to be entirely free from liability in respect of his death, injury or damage, and whether it be caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nThe legislation giving the Board of Railway Commissioners power to order and approve of such a contract was fully referred to and discussed in the case of Robinson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[26], disposed of by this court a short time ago and in which I had the misfortune to differ from the majority of my colleagues (vide secs. 26, 30, 31, 284, 340, R.S.C. ch. 37). The following sections of the same chapter should also be considered: 55, 322, 327, 339.\nThe order of the Board authorizing the railway companies to use the form of \u201clive stock contract\u201d above referred to was duly published as required by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (sec. 339), and thereafter had a like effect as if enacted in that Act (sec. 31). The terms of the pass on which the deceased was travelling were binding on all the parties who presumed to avail themselves of the privileges which that pass conferred.\nThis case is, in my opinion, distinguishable on other grounds from such cases as Henderson v. Stevenson[27], and Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[28], to which we were referred by respondent at the argument. In those cases the conditions relied upon were contained in an ordinary transportation ticket in common form, and it did not appear that the party receiving the ticket knew or had any reason to suspect that there were any special or exceptional conditions attached to it.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Anglin that the deceased had notice of the conditions subject to which the pass was issued to him, or at least had reasonable notice and opportunity to have these conditions explained to him, and he did not choose to take advantage of that opportunity. It should not be lightly assumed that any man in this country is so ignorant as to believe that he may travel on a railway without a contract of some sort.\nIt is quite true, as Lord Watson pointed out in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[29], that the provision as to duelling in article 1056 shews, that cases were intended to be comprised in which there could be no right of action in the deceased. But the death must have been caused by the commission of an offence or quasi-offence, and if there was no duty owing to the deceased by the company there could be no breach of duty and, therefore, no negligence which could give rise to this action.\nI am of opinion this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) of Quebec, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court holding the appellant liable in damages for the death of one Joseph Chalifour, the husband and father of the widow and children bringing the action.\nChalifour\u2019s death occurred in the Province of Ontario in a collision between a locomotive of appellants\u2019 railway and a car of appellants in which deceased was travelling in charge of cattle belonging to his employers, the shippers of the cattle.\nThe contract to carry the cattle from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Montreal, Quebec, was made in the former city, and the accident occurred in the Province of Ontario.\nBoth courts below held that the rights of the parties under the contract were to be determined by the law of Quebec, where the carriage of the cattle ended, and that the rights of the widow and children to recover damages for the death of the deceased caused by the admitted fault of the company was under that law an independent right and could not be barred or destroyed by a contract or covenant made with the company by Chalifour before his death.\nAs establishing such a covenant, the appellant relied upon a contract between itself and the shippers of the cattle, the form of which had the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners and also upon a condition printed upon the back of what was called a pass, under which the deceased, as one of the men in charge of the cattle, was travelling.\nThese conditions were signed by one Addshead, who appeared to be the principal man in charge of the cattle, and also by Chalifour, the deceased.\nThe contentions of the company were first that the law of Ontario, where the accident occurred and of Manitoba where the contract was made were the same and that the rights of the plaintiffs and the company\u2019s liabilities were to be determined by that law and not by the law of Quebec; and, secondly, that the conditions of the contract or pass absolved them from all liability for damages arising out of the accident causing Chalifour\u2019s death, whether in the words of the condition,\nsuch accident, injury, damage or loss is caused by the negligence of the company or of its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nIn other words, the company contended that it had with the sanction of the Railway Board, contracted itself out of any liability whatever, even if caused by gross negligence or otherwise arising out of the carriage of Chalifour as man in charge of the cattle from Winnipeg to Montreal.\nIn the view I take of the proved facts and the liability of the company under them, it is not necessary that I should express any opinion upon the important question as to whether the law of Quebec or that of Ontario or Manitoba is to be the governing law in this case.\nMr. Smith contended for the respondents that while the Railway Board had sanctioned the form of contract between the shippers of the cattle and the company exempting the latter from liability in respect of the death, injury or damage of the men in charge of the cattle whether caused by negligence or otherwise, it had not expressly sanctioned the form of pass or contract which the company had made or contended it had made with the man himself and that such latter contract was still within the provisions of section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d prohibiting contracts impairing carriers\u2019 liabilities unless authorized or approved of by the Board.\nI am of opinion that the class of contract to be made between the railway company and its shippers approved of by the Board is quite sufficient to cover the pass or contract made with Chalifour, if that is binding, and the omission of the word \u201cdeath\u201d in this latter contract or pass does not affect its real meaning or limit that meaning.\nThe question, however, remains to be determined whether any binding contract with conditions as those contended for, was made between Chalifour and the company, and that must be determined upon a consideration of all the facts and circumstances.\nChalifour was a French Canadian who resided with his family in the Province of Quebec. He could neither read nor write French or English, but he could write his name. He was quite an illiterate man and as proved could not even read the newspapers in his own language. He spoke and understood a little English, enough to enable him to understand orders or instructions respecting his duties or employment as a cattle drover or caretaker. He is one of a large class in Quebec well known in Canada.\nBefore the train started from Winnipeg he and his co-employee, Addshead, signed a paper or rather certain \u201cconditions\u201d on the back of a paper on the front of which headed in large capitals were the words \u201cLive Stock Transportation Pass.\u201d\nIt was signed in the presence of two employees of the company, one Devillers, who witnessed it and was an interpreter of foreign languages and understood French, and one Anderson, another employee, who did not understand or speak French.\nThe evidence they gave is somewhat meagre. Anderson says he does not understand French, but stood beside Devillers while he filled in the pass, that there was some conversation between Devillers and Chalifour in French, but he did not understand it. All he seemed to be clear about was that if any questions were asked with respect to the conditions they were explained. Devillers does not remember what the circumstances were or if he had any conversation with Chalifour or whether he explained the conditions.\nIt seems quite certain that the live stock contract itself was not shewn to Addshead or Chalifour and that the only paper they saw at all was one on which was printed on the front in large type, \u201cLive Stock Transportation Pass,\u201d and on the back \u201cconditions\u201d which they signed. My conclusion is that all they saw was the back of this paper headed \u201cconditions\u201d and that they asked no questions, received no explanations and really did not have any idea what the paper was, except that it had something to do with the cattle which they were in charge of and their carriage, and that they as men in charge had to sign it.\nTo draw an inference that this illiterate French Canadian, who only spoke or knew enough English to take and carry out orders connected with his work in taking care of cattle and tending them; who could not read in either language nor write anything beyond his own name, knew or could have known the nature of the document he was signing, is something I must decline to do.\nWhether he did so know or must be held to have known is more an inference of fact to be drawn from all the circumstances than a presumption of law.\nChalifour\u2019s signature under the facts and circumstances proved, if it carries us as far certainly does not carry us any further than his acceptance of the pass if handed to him would have done without his signature.\nAll he knew was that he was one of the men in charge of the cattle to take care of them and tend them to Montreal: If the heading of the pass itself \u201cLive Stock Transportation Pass,\u201d had been read to him it would not have conveyed the slightest idea to his mind, in my humble judgment, that he was agreeing with the company to take all the chances of the trip and that in case he was injured the company were not to be liable to him even for the grossest negligence.\nI think the cases clearly establish that there is no rule or presumption of law that a person is necessarily bound by the conditions contained in a document delivered to him as a transportation ticket, and I do not think that the mere signature itself under the circumstances and facts proved in this case changes the law with respect to such rule or presumption. Henderson v. Stevenson[30]; VanToll v. South Eastern Railway Co.[31].\nMy position is that Chalifour did not know it was a ticket or pass at all he was signing. It was not handed to him, but to Addshead, his co-worker, and, after the accident, was produced by Addshead, who evidently had retained possession of it all along. It does not appear ever to have been in the hands or possession of Chalifour.\nIn the case of Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[32], Mellish L.J., after reviewing several of the cases, at page 422, says:\u2014\nNow, I am of opinion that we cannot lay down, as a matter of law, either that the plaintiff was bound or that he was not bound by the conditions printed on the ticket, from the mere fact that he knew there was writing on the ticket, but did not know that the writing contained conditions.\nAnd at page 423:\u2014\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the proper direction to leave to the jury in these cases is, that if the person receiving the ticket did not see or know that there was any writing on the ticket, he is not bound by the conditions; that if he knew there was writing, and knew or believed that the writing contained conditions, then he is bound by the conditions; that if he knew there was writing on the ticket, but did not know or believe that the writing contained conditions, nevertheless he would be bound, if the delivering of the ticket to him in such a manner that he could see there was writing upon it, was, in the opinion of the jury, reasonable notice that the writing contained conditions.\nThe real and proper question seems to be whether the, company did that which was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the condition under which they seek to be released from liability.\nThe well known case of Watkins v. Rymill[33], in 1883, may seem somewhat at variance with that statement. It was there held that\nif a document in a common form is delivered by one of two contracting parties to and accepted without objection by the other, it is binding upon him, whether he informs himself of its contents or not.\nThis decision made no allowance for the special circumstances under which the document was delivered or the capacities or experience and knowledge of the parties.\nThe later decision of the House of Lords, however, in Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[34], is that the question is one of fact and whether the carrier did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the condition under which they claimed exemption from liability.\nThe jury in that case found in answer to the question put to them that the company did not do so and, as the Lord Chancellor says, at page 220:\u2014\nThe only facts proved were that the plaintiff paid the money for the voyage in question, and that she received the ticket handed to her folded up by the ticket clerk so that no writing was visible unless she opened and read it. There are no facts beyond those. Nothing was said to draw her attention to the fact that this ticket contained any conditions and the argument is that where there are no facts beyond these the defendants are entitled, as a matter of law, to say that the plaintiff is bound by those conditions. That, my Lords, seems to me to be absolutely in the teeth of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Parker v. South Eastern Railway Company[35], with which I entirely agree.\nLord Ashbourne in concurring with the Lord Chancellor, remarked:\u2014\nThe ticket in question in this case was for a steerage passenger \u2014 a class of people of the humblest description, many of whom have little education and some of them none.\nLord Watson and Lord Morris concurred.\nIn a still later case, Marriott v. Yeoward Bros.[36], Pickford J., in delivering a judgment as to the effect of conditions on the ticket of a passenger said at page 992:\u2014\nFor the purpose of the judgment I am about to deliver I assume that the loss was occasioned by the felonious act of the defendants\u2019 servants. Under those circumstances the first point that I have to determine is whether the conditions on the ticket did or did not form part of the contract. That question is one of fact. I was, indeed, invited by the defendants\u2019 counsel to hold as matter of law, upon the authority of the well-known case of Watkins v. Rymill[37], that the mere delivery and acceptance of the ticket with the conditions upon it was sufficient to make the conditions part of the contract. But that I am not at liberty to do. The case of Richardson v. Rowntree[38], in the House of Lords, clearly decided that the acceptance of the ticket does not of itself necessarily make all the conditions upon that ticket a part of the contract. It decided that the proper questions to be left to the jury were those which were formulated by the majority of the Court of Appeal in Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[39], namely, (1) whether the plaintiff knew that there was writing or printing on the ticket; (2) whether the plaintiff knew that the writing or printing on the ticket contained conditions relating to the terms of the contract of carriage; and (3) whether the defendants did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions. For the purpose of determining the answer to the third of those questions I think that the cases of Richardson v. Rowntree38, and Acton v. Castle Mail Packets Co.[40], shew that the jury must take into consideration the class of persons with whom the contract is made. In Richardson\u2019s Case38 stress was laid upon the fact that the ticket was for a steerage passenger, a class of persons of whom many, as Lord Ashbourne observed, have little or no education. In Acton\u2019s Case40 stress was equally laid by Lord Russell of Killowen in his judgment on the fact that the plaintiff was a business man.\nIn a late case of Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Co. v. Bragg[41], Buckley L.J. in speaking of the effect which ought to be given to documents signed by a party whose signature was really obtained by fraud and who ought not, therefore, to be bound, says, at page 496:\u2014\nI do not think myself that cases of this kind are to be confined to the blind and illiterate. Blindness and illiteracy constitute a state of things of which the equivalent for this purpose may under certain circumstances be predicated of persons who are neither blind nor illiterate. If a document were presented to me written in Hebrew or Syriac, I should for the purposes of that document be both blind and illiterate \u2014 blind in the sense that, although I saw some marks on the paper, they conveyed no meaning to my mind, and illiterate as regards the particular document, because I could not read it. It seems to me that the same doctrine applies to every person who is so placed as that he is incapable by the use of such means as are open to him of ascertaining, or is by false information deceived in a material respect as to the contents of the document which he is asked to sign.\nMy conclusion is that Chalifour\u2019s signature to the conditions indorsed upon the \u201cLive Stock Transportation Pass\u201d on which the company rely to relieve themselves from liability was obtained under conditions and circumstances which do not permit of any inference or presumption of fact that he knew or could have known what he was signing or that they were conditions of his transportation as man in charge of the cattle and that the company did not do what was reasonably sufficient to give him notice and knowledge of those conditions.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The late Joseph Chalifour, travelling as a servant in the employment of a firm of cattle dealers, shipping cattle from the west over appellant\u2019s railway, was killed near Chapleau in Ontario in an accident due to the negligence of appellant. This action was brought by his widow for herself and family to recover damages arising therefrom. She has since died and the action is continued by the surviving members of the family.\nThe defence is that he was travelling upon a pass issued to him as said servant engaged in taking care of the cattle shipped by said firm and that the conditions of said pass contained a limitation that the deceased assumed all risk of damage to person and properly and hence there can exist no claim on part of the respondents.\nBy section 544 of the Criminal Code, the appellant is prohibited from carrying cattle, under such circumstances as existed in this case, unless in charge of men engaged to see that the cattle are properly cared for.\nThe section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d prohibiting appellant from limiting its liability is as follows:\u2014\nNo contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice made or given by the company, impairing, restricting or limiting its liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic, shall, except as hereinafter provided, relieve the company from such liability, unless such class of contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice shall have been first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board.\n2. The Board may, in any case, or by regulation, determine the extent to which the liability of the company may be so impaired, restricted or limited.\nThis is substantially the same as section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1903 under which the Railway Commissioners, in 1904, ordered as follows:\u2014\nThat the above mentioned applicants do severally have power to use the forms submitted, and they are hereby legally authorized so to do until this Board shall hereafter otherwise order and determine.\nThe shipping firm, in whose employment the deceased was, admittedly shipped their said cattle under a form of contract thus approved.\nThe questions raised herein are thus far the same as raised in the case of Robinson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[42], where this court held that the servant of the shipper who had signed a similar form of contract for the shipment of a horse and given the duplicate thereof to said servant, put in charge of the horse there in question, was entitled to damages arising from the negligence of the company. But in this case the matter of contract was carried a step further by the appellantes officers at Winnipeg issuing a pass worded, so far as bearing upon this case, as follows:\u2014\nTo conductors: Winnipeg, 18th Sept., 1911.\nThe two men whose signatures are subscribed on back hereof are the only persons entitled to pass in charge of thirteen cars of live stock (here follow the numbers of the cars, etc.).\nOn the back of this there was printed in smaller type than appears in the case herein, the following:\u2014\nConditions.\nEach of us, the undersigned, having charge of live stock mentioned on face hereof, in consideration of the conditions of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s Live Stock Transportation Contract, agree with the company, while travelling on this pass to assume all risk of accident or damage to person or property, and that the company shall be entirely free from all liability in respect of any damage, injury or loss to any of us or the property of any of us whether such accident, injury, damage or loss is caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nSignatures: Witness:\nF. Addshead. H. Devillers.\nJoseph Chalifour.\nCountersigned:\nH. W. Dickson.\nLocal Freight Agent.\nIt is contended by appellant this is a contract by virtue of which the respondents are debarred from maintaining this action.\nThe respondents first deny the right of the company to impose such limitation of liability and next shew by evidence justifying the finding of the learned trial judge that deceased could read neither English nor French and understood but little English \u2014 only enough to understand the orders of his superior, relative to his usual duties as a cattle man, if I understand what she speaking is testifying to.\nThe attesting witness Devillers does not help much by what he says. At the utmost it seems to be that if deceased asked for any explanation it was given him, but he has no recollection of the man or circumstances. Dickson seems to remember that Devillers said something to the deceased in French, but what passed he cannot tell for he understands no French.\nThe other cattleman, Addshead, who seems to have signed first and to have escaped from the accident uninjured, was not called. It seems to be fairly demonstrated from the circumstances put in evidence and relied upon by respondents that he was the bearer of this pass. We are not enlightened in any way unless by the name and the fact that he was first to sign and carried the pass, whether he could speak English or not. If I were pressed to answer I should say he was of English stock and likely knew as little French as Dickson.\nAll such minor details are usually of little consequence, but as bearing upon the probability of deceased understanding what he was about in signing his name to this alleged contract, I should have liked to have known all such details and have been the better able to realize whether or not the deceased knew and understood what he was doing when he signed his name to the said paper.\nIn some of the cases elucidating the law we have to deal with, it is suggested in England a man signing or even accepting a like conditional pass might be presumed to know how to read English. But if we would do justice here in Canada we cannot proceed upon any such hypothesis. Men of the race of the deceased may by nature be as bright and intelligent as any Englishman yet be so handicapped by their want of knowledge of either English or (for that matter as the evidence here discloses) French when it has to be read, that we must be careful to observe that not unusual condition of things in coming to a conclusion in a matter of this kind.\nAnd I may add that in Canada they are not the only persons to whom the like considerations must be extended if justice is to be done.\nTo my mind the question above all others to be determined herein is whether or not the appellant has produced evidence, upon which we can safely rely, enabling it to claim that deceased contracted himself and thereby respondents out of all right to complain of the grossest kind of negligence on appellant\u2019s part.\nNo one who has that general knowledge of the world, and this little part of it, and of the class and kind the deceased belonged to, and the usual mode in which such transactions as involved herein are gone about, but must feel loath to hold that deceased knowingly and understanding what he was about intended to contract as appellant contends he did contract. The onus rested on appellant to shew that he did.\nI cannot hold on the evidence before us that it satisfies me.\nAnd as to any implication from the service in which deceased was engaged, we are bound for the present at all events by our decision in the Robinson Case[43]. There is, moreover, in this case a feature that has impressed me very much and renders the position of appellant weaker than in the Robinson Case[44].\nIt is this:\u2014That in that case the entire contract of the shipper, if read, was before the plaintiff and for a time in his possession and it contained the following clause:\u2014\nIn case of the company granting to the shipper or any nominee or nominees of the shipper a pass or privilege less than full fare, to ride on the train in which the property is being carried, for the purpose of taking care of the same while in transit, and at the owner\u2019s risk as aforesaid, then as to every person so travelling on such such a pass or privilege less than full fare the company is to be entirely free from liability in respect of his death, injury or damage, and whether it be caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nWhat right had appellant to convert the clear explicit language of this clause\nfree from liability in respect of his death, injury or damage, and whether it be caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever,\ninto the dubious sort of terms contained and used in the above quoted conditions? It seems to me it had none. Such contract as it has any right to impose in such a case must fall within the order of the Board or be null. The word \u201ctraffic\u201d in said section 275 is by the interpretation clause made to cover passengers as well as freight. In the first place there is a great deal to be said for the argument that this limitation was never in law applicable to the case of the servant himself for his loss, but only to the interest of the master in his servant And such right of action as he might have for injury to him and hence never in law intended to extend to the rights of the servant himself. It is clear to my mind the order is capable of such a construction. And unless the order must be construed as covering and enabling such a limitation of liability there is nothing upon which the appellant can rest, unless upon the said conditions being construed as a clear contract on part of deceased whereby his widow and children would be deprived of any right to complain herein.\nAnd applying such a test to this ambiguous thing called \u201cconditions\u201d we are face to face with the interpretation put thereupon by Mr. Justice Cross in the Court of Appeal holding it did not cover the case of death resulting from the injury.\nThat is not my own interpretation of the terms used in the conditions, but clearly they can be so read.\nAnd yet in face of that view held by a careful and able judge we are asked to impute to the poor deceased \u2014 ignorant of the language \u2014 a clear understanding that the condition applied to his death and that in such event though caused by the grossest negligence on the part of appellant, his family could have no claim.\nI cannot think such a result would be either law or justice.\nI, therefore, need not enter upon the very wide field of international law and other law into which the argument so well and ably invites us.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. The action is brought in the Province of Quebec by the respondent as the widow of one Joseph Chalifour, who was killed in a railway accident while on one of the appellant company\u2019s trains in the Province of Ontario, due to the negligence of the appellant company\u2019s servants. The respondent bases her claim on article 1056, Civil Code of the Province of Quebec, and on the \u201cFatal Accidents Act,\u201d 1 Geo. V., ch. 33, sec. 33, in force in Ontario. The appellant company sets up in defence, first, a contract with the employers of the deceased Joseph Chalifour, and secondly, a contract alleged to have been entered into with Chalifour himself relieving it from responsibility for the negligence of its servants.\nIt is not, as I understand it, disputed that if these alleged contracts would be no answer to the respondent\u2019s action in Ontario she is entitled to recover in these proceedings; and as in my opinion the defence based on these contracts fails, it will not be necessary to consider the possible rights of the respondents on the opposite hypothesis. I will only observe that to me it is not obvious that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Machado v. Fontes[45] furnishes the rule of decision governing the courts of Quebec in similar cases; or that article 1056 C.C. has any application where the wrong from which death results as well as the death itself occur outside the Province of Quebec.\nUnder the \u201cFatal Accidents Act\u201d it is now settled that it is a condition of the respondents\u2019 right to recover that the victim of the accident would have had a right of action arising out of the wrong complained of if he had lived. The appellant company alleges that the right of action which otherwise would have arisen in favour of Chalifour, would in fact, have been defeated by force of one or both of the agreements above mentioned. I think this defence of the appellant company fails for these reasons: first, the agreement between the appellant company and the employers of Chalifour could not nullify the prim\u00e2 facie obligation of the appellant company to use due care to carry him safely arising out of their acceptance of him in fact, as a passenger on their railway unless it were shewn that he expressly or impliedly assented to the terms of that agreement as modifying the obligation. No such assent is in fact proved; and in any event section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d applies and, not having been complied with, would deprive any such assent of any effect it might otherwise have had. Secondly, as to the alleged agreement with Chalifour:\u2014Chalifour\u2019s assent to the terms of the alleged agreement has not been established in fact; and, assuming the alleged agreement to be established in fact, the section referred to, section 340, deprives it also of any force as a defence. It will be convenient to deal first with the effect of section 340.\nThe appellant company relies upon first an agreement entered into between the Gordon Ironsides Company, the shipper (Chalifour\u2019s employer), and the appellant company, providing for the carriage and delivery of certain cattle shipped at Winnipeg for Hochelaga. And the contract contained certain restrictions of the company\u2019s liability, not material to the present discussion. There is also the following paragraph upon which the appellant company relies:\nIn case of the company granting to the shipper or any nominee or nominees of the shipper a pass of privilege less than full fare, to ride on the train in which the property is being carried, for the purpose of taking care of the same while in transit, and at the owner\u2019s risk as aforesaid, then as to every person so travelling on such a pass or privilege less than full fare the company is to be entirely free from liability in respect of his death, injury or damage, and whether it be caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nThe alleged contract with Chalifour is contained in certain conditions printed on the back of a document described as a \u201cLive Stock Transportation Pass\u201d of the same date. Section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is as follows:\u2014\n340. No contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice made or given by the company, impairing, restricting or limiting its liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic, shall, except as hereinafter provided, relieve the company from such liability, unless such class of contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice shall have been first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board.\n2. The Board may, in any case, or by regulation, determine the extent to which the liability of the company may be so impaired, restricted or limited.\n3. The Board may by regulation prescribe the terms and conditions under which any traffic may be carried by the company.\nThis enactment deprives the agreement just referred to, and any notice of the terms of the agreements, of any effect in restricting or modifying the prim\u00e2 facie obligation of the company except in so far as the agreements and notice have been authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board of Railway Commissioners or in so far as they come within and are made effective by some order or regulation made under sub-section 2.\nThe appellant company produces an order of the Board, bearing date the 17th of October, 1904, which is in the following terms:\u2014\nIn the Matter of\nThe application of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the Canadian Northern Railway, and the Pere Marquette Railway Company, for approval by the Board of Railway Commissioners of their forms of bills of lading and other traffic forms, in compliance with section 275, sub-sections 1 and 2 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nThe above named companies are the only railway companies in Canada which have, up to the present moment, complied with the requirements of section 275; and in respect of these so far received it may be remarked that there is much diversity in the forms of the several railways. The whole subject is of very great importance and will require that much circumspection should be exercised in examing into the contracts and forms which the Board hereafter has to approve; and also into the question of limitation of liability on the part of carriers.\nIn view of these facts, and that the railways generally have not submitted their forms for approval, the Board does not deem it advisable to make any final or definite order upon the subject at present, but is of opinion that an interim order might properly be made permitting such railways as have made application therefor to continue the use of their present forms until the Board shall otherwise prescribe and order.\nIt is Therefore Ordered\nThat the above mentioned applicants do severally have power to use the forms submitted, and they are hereby legally authorized so to do until this Board hereafter otherwise order and determine.\nAnd the Board further requires that a select committee be formed of the legal and traffic officers of the several railway companies named, and others who may hereafter submit their applications, to meet the Board at Ottawa, on a date to be hereafter announced, for the discussion of the said forms and contracts, both freight and passenger, at a session of the Board to be called for such purpose.\n(Sgd.) Andrew G. Blair,\nChief Commissioner, Board of Railway\nCommissioners for Canada.\nThis is the order upon which the appellant company relies as giving force to the two agreements now under consideration.\nIt appears from the certificate of the Secretary of the Board that the only \u201cform\u201d having any relevancy to the present case coming within the operation of this order is a form of \u201cContract for Carriage of Live Stock\u201d which seems to be identical in its terms with that between the appellant company and the shippers above referred to.\nThe form of contract thus approved is a contract between the railway company and the shipper; and it contains the paragraph, upon which the railway company relies, above set out. No form of notice to the shipper\u2019s nominee or form of contract between the railway company and the shipper\u2019s nominee is approved in express terms. And after very full consideration I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Smith\u2019s contention is sound and that the order does not imply any approval or authorization of any contract between the railway company and the shipper\u2019s nominee or of notice to the shipper\u2019s nominee within the meaning of the first sub-section of section 340.\nI think that is so for these reasons. The order itself shews that it was passed as a temporary provision only pending a fuller examination of important questions touching the approval of contracts and notices affected by section 340; and I think that the operation of the order must be confined strictly by the effect of the language used which appears to me to be simply this; that the \u201cforms\u201d specified (which were understood to be the forms then in use) were approved for what they were worth. The company is authorized to enter into a contract in the form produced. That is the whole effect of the order.\nThis interpretation of the order is, no doubt, open to the observation that in view of the decision of this court in Robinson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[46], the paragraph quoted above, would afford no protection to the railway company in the case of action by nominees. But it is to be observed that the Court of Appeal for Ontario\nand the Chief Justice of this court took the view that this same clause was (even in the absence of notice of it to the shipper\u2019s nominee) sufficient to preclude action against the company by the nominee, on the ground that the nominee being on the railway by a consent which was expressed in the contract, and only in the contract, was bound by the conditions of that consent. It is quite possible that this was the view of the law upon which the contract was framed. However that may be the order expressly approves the contract with the shipper and nothing else. I see no ground for implying an approval of a contract with the nominee of the shipper or notice to the nominee. The order is a general approval of a large number of forms containing no doubt many clauses and it would be going altogether too far to read it as an approval not only of the \u201cforms\u201d produced, but any other forms which might be necessary to accomplish the object of the companies.\nA similar reason compels the conclusion, I think, that there is nothing in the order \u201cdetermining\u201d the extent to which the \u201cliability of the company\u201d to the shipper\u2019s nominee \u201cmay be impaired, restricted or limited\u201d within the meaning of sub-section 2.\nThis is a complete answer to the appeal. But I think the appeal fails on the ground also that the evidence does not sufficiently shew an assent by Chalifour to the conditions by which he is alleged to have been bound or any notice to him that he was being carried under a contract with his employers absolving the appellant company from responsibility from injuries caused by the negligence of its servants. The paper on which the company relies is a document called a. \u201cLive Stock Transportation Pass.\u201d On its face, partly in print and partly in handwriting, is the following words:\u2014\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.\nWestern Division.\nLive Stock Transportation Pass.\nTo Conductors:\u2014 Winnipeg, 18th Sept., 1911.\nThe two men whose signatures are subscribed on back hereof are the only persons entitled to pass in charge of thirteen cars live stock 170922, 167196, 166252, 165346, 169796, 168794, 167934, 166496, 167128, 135054, 350130, 164574, 165058.\nBilled from Cardston * * * to Montreal.\nAs men in charge of live stock are now only passed to Winnipeg on stock contracts Conductors east of Winnipeg will not honour stock contracts for passage.\nConductors in charge of train making last run will take up this pass and turn it to agent at destination of live stock.\nValid only when countersigned by\nR. E. Larmour,\nGeneral Freight Agent.\nNo. 7512.\nCountersigned:\nH. W. Dickson.\nIt is endorsed as follows:\u2014\nConditions.\nEach of us, the undersigned, having charge of live stock mentioned on face hereof in consideration of the conditions of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s Live Stock Transportation Contract, agree with the company, while travelling on this pass to assume all risk of accident or damage to person or property, and that the company shall be entirely free from all liability in respect to any damage, injury or loss to any of us or the property of any of us whether such accident, injury, damage, or loss is caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nSignatures: Witness:\nF. Addshead. H. Devillers.\nJoseph Chalifour.\nCountersigned:\nH. W. Dickson,\nLocal Freight Agent.\nThe evidence of Devillers, whose name appears as witness, shews that the signature professing to be that of Chalifour was in fact his, although he does not actually recall the circumstances. Chalifour was a stable hand, a French Canadian, living in Beauport, unable, as the evidence of his wife shews, to read a word of either French or English (testimony undisputed and, according to common experience, not at all incompatible with the fact that he was able to sign his name) and speaking and understanding spoken English, very little \u2014 enough only, as his wife explained, to apprehend the directions of his superiors in his work of cattlehand.\nThe evidence of Devillers and of Dickson shews \u2014 the evidence of Dickson indeed was quite explicit upon the point \u2014 that no explanations of the nature of the document would be given to the signatories unless an explanation were asked for. Devillers is unable to recollect, as I have mentioned, the actual signing of the document or the circumstances of it.\nWhat then is the significance of Chalifour\u2019s attaching his name to the pass in these circumstances? Does it shew or create any presumption of assent on his part to the conditions? Did the fact that he was asked to sign amount in the circumstances to reasonable notice to him that the company was proposing some modification of their prim\u00e2 facie legal obligation as carriers? Did the fact of signing amount to a representation to the company, either that he understood the nature of the document or that he was willing to be bound by anything it might contain?\nIt is not open to dispute that, if Chalifour, although unable to read the conditions on the back of the pass, had understood that in presenting the paper for his signature the officials of the company were proposing conditions affecting the terms upon which he was to be received as a passenger on the railway \u2014 then having given his signature and having acted on the assent of the company given in consequence he would be bound by what he had signed in the absence of fraud or some other equitable ground of relief. But as Chalifour could not read the conditions then unless in fact he knew that the paper contained conditions or the fact of signing amounted in the circumstances to a representation by him that he was prepared to be bound by anything the paper might contain, or in other words, as I think the two questions are in substance identical, unless the fact of being required to place his signature on the pass was reasonable notice to him that it did contain conditions, his signature cannot affect his rights.\nThe burden of the affirmative of the issue raised by the company\u2019s allegation that Chalifour assented to a modification of the prim\u00e2 facie obligation of the company rests, I think, upon the company throughout, unless some presumption of law arises shifting that burden by the fact of the signing alone. I pass for the moment the question as to whether any presumption of law does arise, and I consider the questions first, of Chalifour\u2019s knowledge, and, secondly, of the significance to him of the fact that his signature was required and the significance to the company of the fact that he gave his signature in the circumstances as questions of fact.\nFirst, then, as to Chalifour\u2019s knowledge. The evidence of Dickson is explicit, as I have mentioned, that no explanation would be given unless asked. Dickson says that Chalifour had a conversation with Devillers which Devillers does not remember. The purport of the conversation is not given. Whether Chalifour asked for an explanation, and if so, what answer was given, are matters of speculation merely. I have no difficulty in holding that the company has failed to shew knowledge in fact or facts from which knowledge can be judicially inferred.\nSecondly, as to the significance of Chalifour being required to sign and the act of signing. The question to be considered is whether in the circumstances, assuming him to have exercised the normal judgment of a person of his class and circumstances as known to the company through Dickson and Devillers he ought to have understood that the paper he was asked to sign contained conditions affecting his rights; or correlatively whether the company, having regard to all the circumstances, was entitled to assume from Chalifour\u2019s conduct that he did know that there were conditions to which he was assenting.\nThe question is one upon which people will naturally differ, but I have come to the conclusion that giving their proper weight to all the facts they do not justify a conclusion that Chalifour would or that Dickson, who was the agent of the company for delivering the pass, would or would be entitled to regard Chalifour\u2019s act of signing as meaning anything more than the giving a signature for the purpose of identification. The evidence sufficiently shews that in September, 1911, when the pass in question was issued, the practice of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. with regard to cattle shipments over its lines west of Winnipeg provided for the passing of attendants by having them place their names on the back of the transportation contract itself for the purpose of identification, the possession of the contract being the conductor\u2019s warrant for passing attendants whose names were so indorsed. Down to some time prior to September, 1911, this practice seems to have been general. The indorsement on the transportation contracts in evidence is as follows:\u2014\nForm 18.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.\nLive Stock.\nTransportation Contract.\nFrom ......................................................................\nTo ..........................................................................\nDate................................, 19..................................\nShipper...................................................................\nNames of persons entitled to a free pass in charge of this consignment.\n............................ Agent.\nNote.\u2014Agents must require those entitled to free passage, in charge of live stock under this contract, to write their own names on the lines above.\nConductors may, in cases where they have reason to believe contracts have been transferred, require the holders to write their names hereon to compare signatures. This contract must be punched by the conductors of each division.\nThe same indorsement is to be found upon the form of contract approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, in 1904, now in evidence. The direction on the pass in question shews that for shipments east of Winnipeg a change took place some time before the date of the pass, and the system of issuing passes was substituted. We do not know when this change took place. But we do know that under the earlier system which apparently at the time in question still continued to obtain on the Canadian Pacific Railway west of Winnipeg the cattle men were obliged to sign their names on the back of the transportation contract for the purpose of identification, and that under that system each signed his name for identification only and not as evidencing assent to any agreement with the company. That is very obvious from an inspection of the contracts in evidence. If the signatures are evidencing assent, then it must be that indorsement is an essential part of the form as approved and the attaching of his signature to the indorsement, in accordance with the direction, is a condition of the valid assent of the bearer of a pass to the contract as affecting him.\nAs I have said we do not know when the change was made. We are not told that the agents were instructed when that took place to inform cattle-men who were unable to read of the fact that the pass to which they were asked to attach their signatures contained conditions affecting their rights as against the company which these signatures, once affixed, would purport to evidence. The only evidence we have touching the point is the evidence which I have already mentioned of Devillers and Dickson, which makes it plain that the duty and practice of the agent were limited to giving explanations where explanations were asked. When one looks at the direction to the conductors on the face of the pass itself it is made clear that one purpose of the signatures on the back of the pass was the purpose of identification, and Dickson expressly admits in his evidence, that the signatures were required for that purpose. A cattle man accustomed under the other system to sign his name on the back of the transportation contract along with the other attendants would be most unlikely, especially if he was unable to read, to attach any significance to the act of signing except that he was complying with the usual rule and for the usual purpose. As I have said, we have no evidence when this system of passes was adopted. It may have been in operation no longer than a week. We are left to speculate on that point.\nIn these circumstances I think it is impossible to affirm that Chalifour\u2019s act of signing had either for himself or for the company any significance as affecting their mutual rights unless it can be said that by signing he affirmed that he was sufficiently capable of comprehending the document to understand that there were conditions.\nI think this cannot be affirmed. In the first place, it must be remembered that the pass was delivered to Addshead, who was the employee in charge. It is quite evident that it never came into Chalifour\u2019s possession. Addshead signed first, Chalifour afterwards. As the original pass shews, the conditions are printed in small type, not likely to attract the attention of a man of Chalifour\u2019s class. But to my mind the most weighty consideration applying to this point is that Devillers, Chalifour being the utterly ignorant man that he was, according to the evidence of the respondent, must in the short conversation he had with him have had his attention attracted to the fact that it was most unlikely in the first place that Chalifour could read English at all, and in the second place that he would be capable of comprehending even in the most general way the significance of the printing below which his signature was placed.\nI conclude that treating the questions above stated as questions of fact simply, respecting which the onus is on the appellant company, the company has failed to acquit itself of that onus.\nIt is argued, however, that the presence of Chalifour\u2019s name there creates a presumption of law that he understood the contents of the document to which he attached it. I think there is no such presumption of law. In In re Cooper[47], it is said by Sir George Jessel, that when a man signs a deed\nthere is a presumption of law that he knows its contents.\nBut I have just pointed out that there is here no evidence of anything amounting to the execution of a legal instrument or intentional taking part in a juridical act a condition implied in Sir George Jessel\u2019s language when reading the context. I repeat that if it had been shewn, that Chalifour had placed his name on this document in circumstances which amounted to an affirmation on his part that he was entering into a contract with the railway company respecting the terms on which the company was to carry him then in the absence of fraud or some other special ground of relief his knowledge or his ignorance of the contents of the document would have been quite immaterial. Such principles have no application whatever in the state of the evidence in this case; the evidence does not bring us to the point at which they come into operation. All observations, therefore, in decided cases and in text books as to the effect of signing a document which is understood or represented to contain some disposition of property or to form some part of a business transaction are quite beside the point.\nI have seen no case either in the English or American courts holding that a presumption of knowledge of the contents of a document signed arises in which it did not appear by direct evidence or manifestly from the circumstances of the case that the signer knew, at least in a general way, the nature of the document. Nor have I seen any case which affirms as a broad principle that every person signing a document purporting to be of a character to have legal effect, if operative, is deemed by a presumption of law to have a knowledge of its contents. On the contrary it is not so in the case of wills in respect of which the rule is, I think, correctly stated in Taylor on Evidence, paragraph 160. The testator is presumed to know and approve the contents of a will which he is proved to have signed, but the presumption is not a presumption of law, that is to say, it is not a presumption which acquits the proponent of the will of the burden of the issue resting on him as to the deceased\u2019s knowledge and approval of the contents of the document. If it is shewn that the deceased was unable to read or if doubts are cast upon his capacity or if there are suggestions of undue influence in the circumstances, the proponent must remove these. The burden of establishing the affirmative of the issue remains to the end.\nI think there is no rule or law that requires us to hold that the attaching of Chalifour\u2019s signature in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence had the effect of shifting the burden which rested upon the appellant company of establishing the affirmative of the issue raised by their allegation that Chalifour was received by them as a passenger on the condition that they should be relieved of their prim\u00e2 facie obligation to exercise due care in carrying him.\nThat the presence of Chalifour\u2019s signature is in itself without evidentiary value or is itself of inconsiderable weight nobody would affirm. But when the circumstances are all considered the force of that fact seems to me to be entirely neutralized. For these reasons this appeal should he dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Joseph Chalifour, the husband of the plaintiff (by original action) lost his life in consequence of a collision, at Chapleau, Ontario, between a locomotive on the defendants\u2019 railway and a car in which he was travelling in charge of cattle, on a pass issued to him pursuant to an agreement made by the defendants with his employers, the shippers of the cattle. Before leaving Winnipeg, Manitoba, Chalifour, on the demand of the defendants\u2019 agent, placed his signature on the pass, issued to himself and another servant of the shippers, who accompanied him, beneath the following condition, which was printed upon it:\u2014\nEach of us, the undersigned, having charge of live stock mentioned on face hereof in consideration of the conditions of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s Live Stock Transportation Contract, agree with the company, while travelling on this pass to assume all risk of accident or damage to person or property, and that the company shall be entirely free from all liability in respect of any damage, injury or loss to any of us or the property of any of us whether such accident, injury, damage or loss is caused by the negligence of the company, or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nThe collision was found at the trial to have been attributable to the fault of the defendants and against that finding no appeal has been taken. Indeed, the negligence which caused the accident appears to have been gross and inexcusable.\nThe defence relied upon is that by the law of Ontario, to the benefit of which the defendant company claims to be entitled, it is not liable to the plaintiff because the conditions of the pass on which her husband travelled exempted it from liability to him for any personal injuries he might sustain in transit. In answer to this plea the plaintiff alleges:\u2014\n(1) That the relieving condition signed by Chalifour had not been approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, as is required by section 340 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\n(2) That it should be held that Chalifour himself was not bound by the condition which he signed because it was not established by the defendants that he knew what it was or that they had taken reasonably sufficient means to bring its nature and purport to his knowledge.\n(3) That the plaintiff has a right of action in the courts of the Province of Quebec, although she should be unable to maintain a similar action in the Province of Ontario, where the accident happened.\n(1) The condition on the pass exempting the railway company from liability, which Chalifour signed, is couched in terms not materially dissimilar to those of a clause in a form of shipping contract approved by the Railway Board. The difference, if any, would tell rather against the company than in its favour. If the clause of the shipping contract bears the construction which the defendants maintain it should receive, the condition upon the pass is, I think, of the class authorized by the approval of the form of shipping contract.\nIt is perhaps open to question whether the clause in the shipping contract is not susceptible of a construction which would make it inapplicable to the liability of the railway company towards the man in charge of the live stock, and would restrict its operation to exempting the company from liability towards the shipper for such damages, if any, as might be occasioned to him through injury to his servant. The form authorized is of a contract which purports to be between the shipper and the company. Provision is made for requiring the signatures of the men to be carried in charge of the live stock to be placed on the back of the contract. But these signatures, when so placed, are not preceded by any words purporting to make the signatories parties to the instrument or to bind them by its terms. On the contrary, it is consistent with the form of the document that the signatures are to be obtained merely for purposes of identification.\nOn the other hand, the clause providing for exemption is scarcely such as we would expect to find it were it only against liability for the possible loss to the master occasioned by injury to his servant that provision was being made. Nor is it likely that this somewhat illusory right of the master was the subject of such careful attention at the hands of the railway company and of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nChalifour was not asked to place his signature on the shipping contract, which contained a blank for that purpose, but on the pass issued to him and his fellow drover. This circumstance, however, I regard as immaterial, because section 340 does not require that the specific contract or condition under which the traffic is carried should be itself authorized, but only that it should be of a class which has been authorized. As at present advised I would not be prepared to hold against the defendants on this answer to their plea. (2) On the second ground of reply I also entertain an opinion favourable to them. Such authorities as Robinson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[48]; Richardson v. Rowntree[49]; Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[50], and Henderson v. Stevenson[51], relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff, seem to me to differ widely from the case now before us. In none of them had a contract exempting from, or limiting, liability been signed by the passenger or bailor. Conditions printed more or less obscurely on the tickets or contracts issued by the defendants were relied upon as relieving them from their ordinary liability as carriers or bailees. In the Robinson and Richardson cases the plaintiffs, who were themselves the injured persons, deposed that they had been ignorant of the conditions relied upon and there was no evidence that they were aware of them. Apparently had they been aware that the printing on the tickets which they bought contained conditions relating to the terms of carriage they would have been bound by them, although ignorant of their nature and effect. Harris v. Great Western Railway Co.[52]. Indeed, they would probably have been so bound, although unaware that the printed matter contained such conditions, if the defendants had done what, under the circumstances apparent to them when they sold the tickets, was reasonably sufficient to bring the conditions to the passengers\u2019 notice. Marriott v. Yeoward Bros.[53], at pages 993-4. In Parker\u2019s Case50, and in Henderson\u2019s Case51, where limitations of liability in respect of loss of luggage deposited at parcel rooms in railway stations were set up in defence, the plaintiffs gave similar evidence of their ignorance of the limiting conditions. In the present case there is no such evidence of ignorance. In each of the cases cited by Mr. Smith admitted or proven ignorance of the conditions relied upon by the defendants negatived actual consent to them by the plaintiff, and the question was whether the defendants had taken such reasonably sufficient steps to bring those conditions to the notice of the plaintiff that the latter was precluded from setting up such ignorance in reply to the defence based upon them. In the present case the question is whether the presumption of his knowledge of the tenor of the conditions on the pass raised by Chalifour\u2019s signature to them has been rebutted\u2014whether presumed knowledge has been disproved. There is no evidence in the record that Chalifour was ignorant of the nature of the conditions on the pass and certainly nothing to warrant an inference that he was unaware that the printing upon it, to which he affixed his signature, contained conditions relating to the terms of the contract of carriage. There is no evidence that the defendants\u2019 agent had knowledge of his inability to read English or had any reason to suppose that he did not understand the printed matter, which he appears to have signed without any hesitation upon being asked to do so. Under such circumstances I am not prepared to hold that the agent was not justified in assuming that Chalifour knew what the printed conditions were. He was not bound to inquire into the idiosyncrasies of the particular passenger. Marriott v. Yeoward Bros.[54], at page 993. In the absence of evidence of special circumstances which should have been apparent to the agent, indicating that Chalifour, notwithstanding his readiness to sign the condition on the pass, needed explanation of its nature and effect, I know of no ground upon which it should be held that the agent was under an obligation to proffer such explanations.\nThe production of the pass with the admitted signature of Chalifour upon it raises a presumption of law that he knew and intended to be bound by the conditions which he had subscribed. Re Cooper[55], at pages 628-9. The facts that he was illiterate \u2014 being able merely to sign his name \u2014 and that his knowledge of the English language, in which the pass was printed, was imperfect, do not, in my opinion, suffice to rebut this presumption. McDonald v. Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co.[56]; Harris v. Story[57]; Doran v. Mullen[58].\nThe presumption arising from the signature is not that Chalifour had read the condition \u2014 the evidence perhaps sufficiently disproves that \u2014 but that he knew what it was \u2014 and that the evidence does not disprove. It is quite uncertain that he was not told the contents of the pass when he signed it. But, assuming that the defendants\u2019 agent did not then give him this information, that does not suffice to warrant the conclusion that he did not possess it. He may have acquired it from other sources. He had been in the cattle business for two years, and, although this was his first trip to Winnipeg, he had been to Liverpool in charge of cattle and had probably travelled on railways in this country in the same capacity. At all events he was thrown into the company of men whose business it was to make such trips and who were presumably familiar with the conditions of carriage. His companion on the trip in question, who also signed the pass, was English speaking and probably knew its terms. It is not shewn that he did not communicate them to Chalifour, as, indeed, he may well have done. There is not a tittle of evidence to indicate that Chalifour was in any way misled or imposed upon, and there is nothing whatever to warrant the assumption \u2014 for such it would certainly be \u2014 that he signed the condition on the pass without knowing or ascertaining what it was, or under the belief that it was something other than it was in fact. I think it would be quite too dangerous upon such evidence as we have before us to hold that Chalifour was unaware of the nature and effect of the condition on the pass which he signed and on which he travelled.\nNor would that suffice to relieve him from the provisions of the contract if he was aware that the printed matter which he signed contained conditions relating to the terms on which the pass was issued to him. Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[59]; Harris v. Great Western Railway Co.[60]. His signature imports such knowledge, and it would, be a pure assumption that he did not have it. Indeed, the only evidence in the record is that he had a conversation on the subject of the condition with Devillers, who issued the pass. Devillers says of his interview with Chalifour:\u2014\nQ. Maintenant, pouvez-vous vous souvenir si vous avez eu aucune conversation avec lui au sujet des conditions?\nR. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute que j\u2019ai eu une conversation avec lui et que j\u2019ai d\u00fb lui donner les renseignements qu\u2019il a d\u00fb avoir besion.\nQ. Pouvez-vous vous souvenir si oui ou non il vous a demand\u00e9 ce que voulaient dire les conditions et dans ce cas qu\u2019est ce que vous lui avez r\u00e9pondu?\nR. Je ne peux pas dire qu\u2019il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 les conditions de ce contrat-l\u00e0, de la passe, mais s\u2019il me les a demand\u00e9es, je les lui ai donn\u00e9es avec les autres renseignements.\nQ. Etait-ce la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que vous suiviez?\nR. C\u2019\u00e9tait une pratique qu\u2019on avait chez nous de donner les renseignements.\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019usage?\nR. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019usage du bureau de donner les renseignements autant pour les passes que pour ce qui regarde le live stock sur le chemin.\n* * * * *\nQ. Vous \u00eates certain que s\u2019il vous a demand\u00e9 quelques renseignements, vous lui avez donn\u00e9 des renseignements complets?\nR. Oui, et bien explicites aussi.\nThe witness was not cross-examined in regard to this evidence. It at least indicates that Chalifour\u2019s attention was directed to the condition he was asked to sign, if, indeed, he was not explictly told its nature and contents, I am not prepared to relieve the plaintiff from whatever consequences may ensue upon Chalifour\u2019s having taken the pass on which he travelled with knowledge of the condition to which he affixed his signature. The case must, I think, be dealt with on the footing that, had Chalifour survived his injuries, he would not have had a cause of action against the defendants.\n(3) But on the third point raised by the plaintiff I think we are bound by the decision in Machado v. Fontes[61]; see, too, Carr v. Fracis Times & Co.[62]; to hold that the defendants are liable in this action instituted in the Province of Quebec, although no action could have been maintained by her in the Province of Ontario because of the condition subject to which her husband had accepted carriage by the defendants.\nI am, however, with respect, of the opinion, that Mr. Justice Cross has misconceived the ground upon which the liability of the defendants should be placed. He appears to have dealt with the case as if the crucial question were whether, on its proper construction, the contract signed by Chalifour purported to bar any claim that his dependents might have to recover damages sustained by them as a result of his death. That is not the contention of the defendants. Their position is that, in order to succeed, the plaintiff must shew that she has a claim actionable in the Province of Ontario as well as in the Province of Quebec, and that if suing in the Province of Ontario, she would fail, not because her husband had undertaken to contract away her right of action, but because, had his injuries not been fatal, he would have been unable, in view of his contract with the defendants, himself to maintain an action against them for damages, and his having that right is by the \u201cFatal Accidents Act,\u201d 1 Geo. V., ch. 33, sec. 3, made a condition of the statutory right of action thereby given to his dependents. Conrod v. The King[63]. The right of action in the Province of Quebec given in similar circumstances by article 1056 C.C. is not subject to this condition. Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[64]. If, therefore, the wrong upon which the plaintiff founds her action had occurred in Quebec she would have had a claim actionable there. Although the wrong committed in Ontario does not give her a right of action in that province, because, had her husband survived his injuries, he would not have had a right of action against the defendants, the negligent act or omission which caused his death was not \u201cauthorized, or innocent, or excusable\u201d in Ontario any more than it would have been in the Province of Quebec had it occurred there. There is under the circumstances no civil remedy for that negligence in Ontario, yet even there it entailed responsibility of another character, not, it is true, upon the present defendants, but upon the individual who was guilty of it. Criminal Code, sec. 283. While by no means satisfied that the view expressed by Mr. Westlake in his work on Private International Law (5 ed.), at page 286, that\nit is probably the better opinion that no such independent action would lie where damages were not granted by the lex loci delicti commissi,\nis not more logical; Evans & Sons v. Stein & Co.[65]; Foote\u2019s Private International Jurisprudence (4 ed.), 451, 453, 457-8; in deference to the view expressed by the Judicial Committee in Trimble v. Hill[66], at page 344, I bow to the authority of Machado v. Fontes[67], which in principle clearly covers the case at bar. Dicey on Conflict of Laws (2 ed.), 645. Indeed, if it be distinguishable at all, the distinction makes in the plaintiff\u2019s favour. In the Machado Case67 the alleged wrongful act on which the suit was based was of a class not actionable in Brazil where it occurred. In the case at bar the wrongful act on which the plaintiff bases her claim was of a class actionable in Ontario, where it occurred, but the document executed by her deceased husband affords a defence to the defendants.\nI understand that the conditions of the right to maintain an action in the Province of Quebec for a wrong committed outside the jurisdiction do not differ materially from those which obtain in territories where English law prevails. Dupont v. Quebec Steamship Co.[68]; Glasgow and London Ins. Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[69]; Lafleur on Conflict of Laws, page 199 et seq. But see Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Marleau[70].\nI would on this ground affirm the judgment against the defendants and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thomson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morand & Savard.\n[1] Q.R. 46 S.C. 319.\n[2] [1892] A.C. 481.\n[3] L.R. 3 Q.B. 555.\n[4] 9 Q.B.D. 357.\n[5] 34 L.C.

The agreement was signed \u201cThe Grand Valley Ry. Co., A.J. Pattison, Pres\u2019t.\u201d Some work was done on the extension of the line to St. George, but it was never completed. The purchasers paid for $10,000 worth of bonds on which dividends were paid for five years when payments ceased. The purchasers brought action against the company and P. claiming the return of the money paid or damages for breach of contract. The trial judge held (26 Ont. L.R. 441) that each of the purchasers was entitled to substantial damages and gave them judgment for $10,000 and directed return of the bonds on payment. The Divisional Court (27 Ont. L.R. 556) held that the individual purchasers were only entitled to nominal damages and gave judgment for the corporate pur- chasers for the amount they paid for the bonds. The Appellate Division (30 Ont. L.R. 44) held that all were entitled to substantial damages, but ordered a reference as the evidence was not sufficient to determine the amount. All held P. personally liable as well as the company. The purchasers appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking that the judgment at the trial be restored. The defendants by cross-appeal claimed dismissal of the action.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the judgment of the Appellate Division be affirmed.\nPer Davies J., while not formally dissenting from the conclusion to affirm, that the damages might be assessed at $10,000 as at the trial.\nPer Idington J.\u2014That the individual purchasers are only entitled to nominal damages; that the maximum to be allowed the corporate purchasers is the amount they subscribed for the bonds; and that the order of reference should be modified accordingly.\nHeld, per Anglin J.\u2014The substantive right in controversy on the appeal is the quantum of damages; that was not determined adversely to the appellants by the judgment appealed against; they were, therefore, not deprived of a \u201csubstantive right in controversy in the action\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in clause (e) of 4 & 5 Geo. V. ch. 51, sec. 1, and the appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction which would dispose of the cross-appeal as well.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], setting aside the judgment of the Divisional Court[2], and that of the trial Judge[3], and ordering judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs with a reference to a Master to assess the damages.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the above head-note. The text of the agreement therein mentioned and on which the action was based is as follows:\u2014\nIn consideration of the purchase of the bonds of the Grand Valley Railway Co. by certain manufacturers and other citizens of St. George, Ont., and the sum of one dollar ($1) now in hand paid, Mr. A.J. Pattison, president of the Grand Valley Co., hereby undertakes and agrees on his own behalf and on the behalf of the said Grand Valley Railway Co., that he will make or cause to be made a through traffic arrangement with the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. making direct connection with the C.P.R. at Galt, in terms of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of Canada in such a way that the current competitive freight rates will apply continuously from St. George on precisely the same basis as from Galt and other points in this railway district, to all points east and west in Canada.\nWhile not undertaking anything on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. it is distinctly provided by this agreement that the said A.J. Pattison will do all things lawful to secure the agreement above mentioned, and further that should it be necessary to do so he will bring the matter before the Railway Commission of Canada with a view to the creation and enforcement of the through traffic arrangement herein mentioned.\nIt is further agreed that the extension of the Grand Valley Railway to St. George and the securing of the above mentioned agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. will proceed with at once and with the greatest possible dispatch.\nIt is further agreed that the Grand Valley Railway Co. will build and construct in a substantial way for the handling of heavy freight, the necessary switches and sidings connecting their system with the various mills and factories of St. George upon such terms as may be agreed upon between the respective parties.\nProvided always that the terms, conditions and covenants of this agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, executors and assigns of the said A.J. Pattison and the said Grand Valley Railway Co.\nDated at St. George, Ont., June 29, 1906.\n(Sgd.) THE GRAND VALLEY RY Co.,\nA.J. Pattison, Pres\u2019t.\nWitness: (Sgd.) S.G. KITCHEN.\nShepley K.C. and Sweet, for the appellants, relied on Chaplin v. Hicks[4].\nHolman K.C. for the respondent Pattison. The onus on plaintiffs to establish damages is not satisfied. The amount awarded by the trial judge was a mere guess. The damages must be certain in their nature and in respect of the causes from which they proceed. Corbet v. Johnston[5]. See also Village of Brighton v. Auston[6].\nChaplin v. Hicks4 turned on its peculiar facts and is of no assistance in this case.\nGrayson Smith for the respondent, The Grand Valley Railway Company.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The substantial questions to be determined in this appeal, beyond Pattison\u2019s personal liability, are what damages the plaintiffs are entitled to recover by reason of the failure of the defendant to continue the construction of the Grand Valley Railway from a point on the line called Blue Lake to the Village of St. George, as contracted for; and, secondly, whether the evidence put in at the trial of the cause was ample enough and supplied sufficient data to enable the court to fix upon and determine the measure of these damages.\nThe learned trial judge thought sufficient evidence had been given and assessed the damages at $10,000.\nThe Divisional Court reduced these damages to $3,880, which they divided between the two plaintiff companies, allowing to the individual plaintiffs only nominal damages.\nThe Appellate Division being of the opinion that there was an\nentire absence of evidence to supply the data upon which the amount of loss sustained by the breach of the agreement could be ascertained,\nvacated both judgments and directed a reference to ascertain the amount of the damages.\nI understand a majority of my colleagues are of the opinion that this was, under the circumstances, the judgment which should have been given and have agreed to dismiss the appeal and confirm that judgment. While I do not formally dissent from this judgment, I think it fair, however, to say, specially in view of the appeal made to us by counsel at bar, that if we reached a conclusion adverse to the objections against the maintenance of the action altogether we would, if possible, finally dispose of the question of damages, I was personally prepared, after considering the evidence submitted, to have now and on the evidence before us disposed of this question of damages.\nThe conclusion I finally reached was that the judg- ment of the learned trial judge was under all the circumstances and evidence a fair and reasonable one.\nThe reasoning of the learned judge in the following quotation which I make from his judgment commends itself to my mind not only as fair and reasonable, but as coming quite within the reasoning and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Chaplin v. Hicks[7].\nThe learned trial judge says:\u2014\nIn this case the plaintiffs expected to receive great benefit if they could secure the construction of the railway and competition between the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific. In addition they expected great convenience in the carrying on of their business by the ready access to a railway by which incoming and outgoing freight could be handled. They expected additional profit by the increased prosperity of the municipality in which they were interested. All these considerations were present to the minds of both parties at the time of the making of the agreement.\nThere were many elements of uncertainty. These could not be eliminated. If all that was hoped for came to pass, the advantage to the plaintiffs would far exceed the $10,000 paid. The price was not given for a thing certain, but was given for the chance of obtaining the great advantage hoped for. If I were to attempt to assess damages on the basis of the plaintiffs receiving all that they contemplated, then the damages would be many times the price paid. But, endeavouring to assess in the light of all the uncertainties and contingencies pointed out by counsel, and which were, no doubt, equally present to the minds of both parties at the time the agreement was made, I think I shall not go far wrong if I place the damages at the same sum as that which Pattison and his railway company induced the plaintiffs to give for this chance.\nHad it not been for the decision of the above case of Chaplin v. Hicks[8] and the cogent reasonings of the able judges who constituted the Court of Appeal in explaining the grounds on which they reached their conclusion I would have felt inclined to agree with the judgment appealed from on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence. An attempt was made to minimize the extent and meaning of that judgment of Chaplin v. Hicks[9], but the weight to be attached to it not only consists in the exact point there decided, but also in the personnel of the court and the reasoning by which they supported their conclusion.\nThe head-note or summary of the report reads as follows:\u2014\nWhere by contract a man has a right to belong to a limited class of competitors for a prize, a breach of that contract by reason of which he is prevented from continuing a member of the class and is thereby deprived of all chance of obtaining the prize is a breach in respect of which he may be entitled to recover substantial, and not merely nominal, damages.\nThe existence of a contingency which is dependent on the volition of a third person does not necessarily render the damages for a breach of contract incapable of assessment.\nIt was clearly impossible under the facts of that case to estimate with anything approaching to mathematical accuracy the damages sustained by the plaintiffs, but it seems to me to be clearly laid down there by the learned judges that such an impossibility cannot \u201crelieve the wrongdoer of the necessity of paying damages for his breach of contract\u201d and that on the other hand the tribunal to estimate them whether jury or judge must under such circumstances do \u201cthe best it can\u201d and its conclusion will not be set aside even if the amount of the verdict is a matter of guess work.\nSee last paragraph of judgment of Vaughan-Williams L.J., pages 792-3.\nFletcher Moulton L.J., at page 795, says, and I quote it because of Mr. Holman\u2019s argument in this appeal as to the remoteness of the damages claimed here:\u2014 It has been contended in the present case that the damages are too remote; that they are not the natural consequences of a breach with regard to which the parties intended to contract. To my mind the contention that they are too remote is unsustainable. The very object and scope of the contract were to give the plaintiff the chance of being selected as a prize-winner, and the refusal of that chance is the breach of contract complained of and in respect of which damages are claimed as compensation for the exclusion of the plaintiff from the limited class of competitors. In my judgment nothing more directly flowing from the contract and the intention of the parties can well be found.\nAgain on the same page the same learned judge says, speaking of the difficulties of establishing and fixing the damages:\u2014\nBut it is said that the damages cannot be arrived at because it is impossible to estimate the quantum of the reasonable probability of the plaintiff\u2019s being a prize-winner. I think that, where it is clear that there has been actual loss resulting from the breach of contract, which it is difficult to estimate in money, it is for the jury to do their best to estimate; it is not necessary that there should be an absolute measure of damages in each case. There are no doubt well settled rules as to the measure of damages in certain cases, but such accepted rules are only applicable where the breach is one that frequently occurs.\nAnd again at page 796, speaking of the case he was then dealing with, he says:\u2014\nI cannot lay down any rule as to the measure of damages in such a case; this must be left to the good sense of the jury.\nFarwell L.J., at page 798, says:\u2014\nThe two words \u201cchance\u201d and \u201cprobability\u201d may be treated as being practically interchangeable, though it may be that the one is somewhat less definite than the other. The necessary ingredients of such an action are all present; the defendant has committed a breach of his contract, the damages claimed are a reasonable and probable consequence of that breach, the loss has accrued to the plaintiff at the time of action. It is obvious, of course, that the chance or probability may in a given case be so slender that a jury could not properly give more than nominal damages, say one shilling; if they had done so in the present case, it would have been entirely a question for them, and this court could not have interfered. Applying this reasoning and these principles to the case before us and our own common sense acting as jurymen I would not have felt much difficulty on the evidence given in accepting the conclusion reached by the trial judge as to the amount of the damages. But as I have said I will not formally dissent from the conclusion reached by my colleagues supporting the judgment of the Appellate Division referring the case back for further evidence.\nOne word in conclusion as to the personal liability of the defendant. I fully concur with all my colleagues and with all the courts below in maintaining that liability. I think it is hardly open to argument.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Each of the appellants subscribed various sums amounting in all to $10,000 to buy bonds issued by the respondent company and raised by a joint note the money to pay therefor.\nThe respondents induced them to do this by assuring them that the railway they were promoting and had built in part would by a branch thereof form a connection within a few months with the village of St. George, which was the home or had been the home or place of origin of the individual appellants and of many of those interested in the corporate appellants carrying on their respective business there. This was in June, 1906. The branch line was partly built, but never reached St. George. The company promised by these bonds interest thereon half yearly at the rate of 6% per annum and paid it till defaulting in June, 1911.\nThe assurance I have referred to as inducing the appellants to subscribe was sued upon in July, 1911. Some of appellants would have us believe they never thought half so much of the reliance to be placed upon the bonds as they did upon this assurance. It is, however, to be observed that this action was brought immediately the respondent company had defaulted in paying the interest.\nNo doubt the main purpose of subscribing for bonds was to become assured of the branch line being extended to St. George, yet what I have just observed must not be lost sight of in estimating damages for breach of the contract of assurance that the main purpose would be realized.\nThis assurance took a novel form. The frame of the instrument drawn up to evidence it, the mode of its execution and the need for invoking a parol agreement by Pattison, are all of such a character as to render it difficult, first, to be sure we have a contract proven and then to feel quite sure of what damages for breach thereof, in the language used in Hadley v. Baxendale[10],\nmay fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.\nI am not prepared to dissent from the view taken by the learned trial judge that there is a contract proven as against both respondents, and in this court whatever objection has been made as to the parties or want of parties which is mere matter of procedure we must hold to be covered by our uniform practice of refusing to interfere with what the courts below have unanimously acted upon, unless in the case where that might lead to a denial of natural justice. The Statute of Frauds, relied upon by Pattison, can be of no avail unless we find, contrary to the view of the learned trial judge, as a fact, that he was bound only as a surety or guarantor. It is to avoid any such implication I have advisedly referred to the contract relied upon as an assurance given jointly by respondents. We are thus left with nothing to consider but the measure of damages.\nThe statement of claim does not make out or specifically ask for a rescission of the contract or contracts involved and the relief properly incidental to such a mode of proceeding, yet curiously enough it tenders a return of the bonds, I assume without the coupons redeemed by the company, and asks repayment of the amount paid for said bonds. This latter relief was granted by the learned trial judge though proceeding, as I understand him, on the ground that there was not a total failure of consideration and that he is only assessing damages in allowing the sum of $10,000. If so, I fail to understand why or how he could depart from the terms of the order for particulars without amending same or amending the pleadings. Neither was suggested or at all events directed.\nThe order for particulars is most imperative and covers all claims for damages and is not explainable away in any such way as put forward by Mr. Shepley.\nI, therefore, assume the individual appellants bound thereby and I see no ground on the facts presented in the case for so amending as to permit of the consideration of any claim by any of them beyond the nominal sum of ten dollars for each. They do not seem to have had any business relation with St. George or any property in St. George which would be so materially affected by the finishing of the branch line as to form in law a proper ground for making any tangible claim for more substantial damages. The individual subscriptions of those stock holders in corporate companies stand in such a position in law that the indirect damages they suffer as shareholders are too remote. The truth would seem to be that they were in some cases wholly and in others partly moved by sentimental rather than practical financial results to be got by the promised railway connection with St. George.\nVillage patriotism is one of the finest traits of mankind. And the man that plays upon it to extract money from the pockets of men moved by such impulses, and fails to give what he has promised in return therefor, may deserve to be reached in an effectual manner.\nBut after all I am afraid such a substantial exhibition of home affection is but a poor asset in a lawsuit resting upon the principles of our hard hearted common law when dealing with cash and its returns as the only basis for damages.\nIt seems to me, therefore, that there are only two of appellants who can put their claims on a more substantial basis. If there are others, such as Mr. Kitchen, it is not apparent except in way I have referred to as shareholders, where each can have no claim.\nThose who do appear as entitled are the corporate companies of which each had an established business that might have been afforded well recognized facilities enuring to its advantage in the conduct of such business. That advantage seems to me a thing capable of some appreciable estimation within the principles of law governing the assessment of damages.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that evidence which might easily have been supplied and I may add which the particulars delivered enabled to have been given is not in the record.\nThese particulars are perhaps not so accurately drawn in relation to the law applicable to the assessment of damages as they might have been. It is the general result, based upon such facts as these particulars outline, that must be appreciated, in the way a business man might estimate such advantage if he had, for example, to buy as a going concern either of said properties and the good will thereof.\nI do not think the respondents are liable for all time to make good the difference between the cost of freight without this connection and its facilities and cost thereof with same. Such a method would invoke entirely too remote possibilities.\nThe advantage must be estimated or appreciated by what a capable business man would honestly arrive at if presented with the commercial situation as a possible purchaser at the time the contract was broken.\nThe possibilities of the connection being got at an early date would enter into his calculations on the one hand and the disadvantages of doing business in such a place on the other. Then there are possible local advantages in the way of local trade which must not be lost sight of. These there are by reason of there being no connection and thus the business freed from outside competition. The place is small though in a good district. The advantage I thus refer to may, therefore, be small.\nAgain, I think that the whole scope of the agreement and what led up to it must be borne in mind. Clearly some of the parties never designed that any more should be obtained than the return of their money if the project failed. The great misfortune is that the agreement was not drawn up or verbally so framed as to embody this idea which would have saved all this litigation. Yet I think this was so evidently the purpose of what in the language I have quoted from Hadley v. Baxendale[11], was within\nthe contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract\nthat I think the damages should not exceed the amount subscribed.\nIt is quite possible that if the respective capacity of the mill and factory had been given in evidence as outlined in the particulars and some general evidence as to cost and extent of teaming and freight as compared with the expenses involved in the use of sidings and all implied therein (regarding which the interest on outlay and such like charges are to be considered) and the advantages of freighting over a choice of lines, a judgment might have been reached without a reference.\nI suggest this because the general reference provided may involve much more than is desirable, I think it might be possible to modify it so as to avoid a needlessly expensive inquiry.\nThe respondent Pattison has cross-appealed, and under such cross-appeal the reference, if my view should prevail, will have to be modified so as to limit the reference as indicated above to the claim of the two corporate appellants.\nI may add that in my view the surrender of the bonds cannot be made a term of any judgment herein. Any such consideration or that of the value of the bonds at any stage ought to be discarded. Moreover, what I have said as to the limitation of the damages not exceeding the amount of the subscription is not to be taken as indicating that to be the measure of damages which ought to be reached.\nI think the appeal cannot be allowed, but the cross-appeal must be, to the extent of modifying the judgment in the way indicated. It is not a case of costs to either party as against the other. All that is got by either probably would have been got without either appeal. And both may benefit by the intimated limitation of the inquiry instead of wasting costs on a needlessly expensive inquiry.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Under section 36 and clause (e) of section 2 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d (as enacted by 3 and 4 Geo. V. ch. 51, sec. 1), only those judgments of the highest provincial courts of final resort (rendered in the provinces other than Quebec and in proceedings other than equitable) are appealable to this court which determine adversely to the appellant, in whole or in part, a substantive right in controversy in the action or other judicial proceeding. Such determination must be effected by the judgment appealed from\u2014not by some former or other judgment\u2014and the right must be a substantive right in controversy in the action.\nBy the judgment now in appeal the question of the liability of the defendants is determined in the appellants\u2019 favour. A reference is directed to ascertain the quantum of damages to which they are entitled. Of that direction the appellants complain, asserting that on the evidence in the record, they were entitled to a determination of the amount of their damages by the trial court and that the judgment of that court which fixed them at $10,000 should be restored. They insist that the variation of that judgment, by substituting, for the adjudication that they should recover $10,000, a declaration of liability and a reference to ascertain the amount of their damages, deprived them of a \u201csubstantive right in controversy in the action\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in clause (e). With deference I am unable to accept that view. I cannot see that it makes the slightest difference what disposition of the case was made in the court of first instance. The question as to our jurisdiction would be precisely the same if that court had directed a reference as to damages and its judgment had been affirmed on appeal. By the judgment in appeal the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they had a right to damages is decided in their favour; the quantum of those damages is left to be ascertained in further proceedings. The position would be precisely the same if that had been the judgment at the trial. Can it be said that the quantum of damages to which the plaintiffs are entitled\u2014which is the substantive right in controversy in the action now being dealt with\u2014is determined adversely to the appellants by the judgment now appealed from? I think not. That right now remains undetermined and it is immaterial what disposition of it had been made by the judgment of first instance. I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that this appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction; and, if that course were adopted, the cross\u2011appeals would meet a similar fate. Lindemark v. Picard[12].\nBut, in deference to the views of my colleagues, who, I understand, are of the opinion that the court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, I proceed to consider it on the merits.\nDealing first with cross-appeals by both defendants against the finding of their liability, I entertain no doubt that both were properly held to be parties to the contract in question and liable for damages for its breach. As to the company there can be no question that it was intended that it should be bound. Its president, Pattison, executed the instrument on its behalf, and he gives explicit evidence of his authorization to do so by the directors and of ratification of his action by the shareholders, which is uncontradicted. Moreover, it received the moneys paid by the plaintiffs and it acted on the agreement which it would now repudiate. As to Pattison\u2019s personal liability the terms of the contract make it clear that that also was intended; and I think the proper inference from the evidence is that his signature to the document, accompanied by the descriptive word \u201cpresident,\u201d which is similarly used in the body of the instrument, was intended to witness his personal obligation as well as that of the company.\nNeither can I accede to the contention that the plaintiffs, other than the Jackson Wagon Company and the Brant Milling Company, are restricted to nominal damages by the particulars delivered by them and the terms of the order under which they were delivered. All the plaintiffs claimed the return of the moneys paid by them. The damages of which particulars were ordered and given were claimed in addition to and over and above the refund of the moneys demanded. At the trial it became obvious that the claim to recover the moneys paid as on a total failure of consideration could not be maintained; and the trial judge\u2014as he had the power to do\u2014apparently allowed the plaintiffs to substitute for that claim a demand to recover the same amount by way of damages for breach of the agreement; and the further claims for damages, of which particulars had been given, were abandoned. No formal amendment to the statement of claim was made; but the judgment of the learned trial judge proceeds upon the assumption that the case should be dealt with as if that had been done. It cannot be otherwise intelligently explained.\nOn the main appeal, the case of Chaplin v. Hicks[13] is chiefly relied upon by the appellants. But all that that case decides is that\nthe existence of a contingency which is dependent on the volition of a third person does not necessarily render the damages for a breach of contract incapable of assessment.\nIn such a case the plaintiff\nmay be entitled to recover substantial, and not merely nominal, damages.\nIn that case the plaintiff had given in evidence all the material facts relative to the assessment of damages which were susceptible of proof. She had furnished to the jury all the data which it was in her power to supply. Having done that she was not required to render certain that which was contingent, or to furnish the means of measuring with exactness and precision something essentially indefinite. Simpson v. London and North Western Railway Co.[14]; Kennedy v. American Express Co.[15], and Jameson v. Midland Railway Co.[16], are other decisions similar in principle. But Chaplin v. Hicks[17] is not authority for the proposition\u2014for which an analysis of his argument makes it clear that counsel for the appellants really cited it\u2014that, because the realization of the plaintiff\u2019s expectations under a contract is subject to contingency, he is not bound to put the jury in possession of information in his power to enable them to appreciate what would have been the advantages to be derived by him from his expectations if realized, as a basis on which to assess the value of the chance of realization of which the breach has deprived him. It is the failure to give such information\u2014to supply such data as were given in Chaplin v. Hicks[18]\u2014that renders the reference ordered by the Appellate Division necessary, since that court, in the exercise of its discretion, instead of dismissing the action, as it might have done, has seen fit as a matter of grace and indulgence, to allow the appellants another opportunity to adduce the evidence which they should have given at the trial as to relevant and material facts susceptible of proof, knowledge of which is necessary to enable the assessing tribunal to estimate what would have been the value to them of the performance by the defendants of their contract as a long step towards realization of their expectations. The plaintiffs are claiming special damages. No doubt the particularity of proof required varies with the circumstances. (Arnold on Damages, pp. 3, 4, and 12.) The assessing tribunal is, however, entitled to such assistance by proof of material relevant facts as the claimant may under the circumstances reasonably be expected to afford it.\nBut it is said that such evidence is in the present case unnecessary because we have in the consideration given and accepted prim\u00e2 facie proof of the value placed by the parties themselves on the contractual rights acquired by the plaintiffs. That such a measure of damages must, in the circumstances of the case at bar, be illusory seems manifest. For divers reasons a man may be prepared to pay for a thing much more than any real pecuniary value it may have, not only to persons in general, but even to himself. Actuated by patriotic of philanthropic motives he may be willing to expend money for which he expects no return in the way of pecuniary or other material advantage. As to some of the plaintiffs there are circumstances in evidence that rather suggest that they were not pecuniarily interested. Unless in the case of a purely commercial contract, where the circumstances indicate with reasonable certainty that the price paid represents the fair value to the purchaser of the thing he bargained for, that price cannot afford a reliable basis for assessing damages for failure to deliver.\nBut in the present case, in addition to the contractual rights for the breach of which this action is brought, the plaintiffs for the $9,700 paid by them obtained bonds having a face value of $10,000, on which they were subsequently paid interest for five years. The actual value of these bonds at the time they were so acquired is not shewn, although it is sufficiently apparent that they had some substantial value. It is impossible on the evidence in the record to say how much of the $9,700 was in fact given for them, and what part of it the plaintiffs paid for the advantages likely to accrue to them from the fulfilment of the contract to construct the projected line of railway and to establish through connections. The value to them of the advantages to be anticipated from the fulfilment of these undertakings may have far exceeded the amount which they paid, or, on the other hand, it may have been materially less. Of that value the payment of $9,700 made to secure such advantages plus the bonds for $10,000 does not afford any criterion.\nOn the evidence in the record I feel that I should find myself quite incapable of fairly estimating the damages to which the plaintiffs are entitled. The value of the chance they have lost is, without further material, not susceptible of assessment. Unless the action should be dismissed, the reference to enable the plaintiffs to supplement their evidence is necessary. I think we should not interfere with the exercise of discretion by the Appellate Division. In conclusion I cannot do better than quote a well-known passage from the judgment of Bowen L.J., in Ratcliffe v. Evans[19], at pages 532 and 533:\u2014\nThe character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on, both in pleading and proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done. To insist upon less would be to relax old and intelligible principles. To insist upon more would be the vainest pedantry.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeals with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I would be of opinion that the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario should be confirmed. The action was for the recovery by the appellants of a sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for breach of contract.\nThe appellants were all interested in the welfare of a place called St. George and were anxious that that place should be connected with the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Grand Valley Railway and agreed to take over $10,000 of bonds of the latter company if the respondent Pattison and the company itself would undertake to extend the Grand Valley Railway to St. George and to secure a competitive freight rate from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\nThe bonds were taken over by the appellants and the company started the construction of the branch in question; but, though they had promised that by the fall of 1906 the extension of the railway would have reached St. George, the company failed to carry out their agreement.\nIn 1911 they instituted the present action against respondent Pattison and the Grand Valley Railway Company for the repayment of their money and for damages for breach of contract.\nPattison denied his personal liability in connection with that agreement. The three courts below, however, have decided against him on that point; and, as it was mostly a question of fact, it is not necessary for me to deal with that phase of the situation.\nI think myself that Pattison should be held personally liable under the agreement which was made on the 29th of June, 1906.\nThe only difficulty remaining is with regard to damages. Particulars had been asked before the trial from the plaintiffs as to those damages. Some of them stated in answer to the order that was then given that they would claim only nominal damages. The others, namely, the Jackson Wagon Company and the Brant Milling Company gave particulars.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice Middleton, in view of the opinion that was then expressed by the judge, no evidence was adduced as to these specific damages claimed.\nThe plaintiff relied upon the case of Chaplin v. Hicks[20], and the trial judge proceeded to assess the damages at the same sum as Pattison and the railway company induced the plaintiffs to subscribe.\nThe judgment was varied by the Divisional Court and nominal damages only were given to all the plaintiffs, with the exception of the Jackson Wagon Company and the Brant Milling Company, in whose favour judgment was entered for $3,880.\nAn appeal was taken from that judgment to the Appellate Division. The court maintained that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the damages sustained by them by reason of the breach of the agreement and they ordered that the case be referred to the master to ascertain the amount of such damages.\nIn view of the expression of opinion at the trial, it is pretty evident that the claim for damages was not gone into as it should have been without that. It is very much to be regretted that the parties, after having gone before four courts will have to go again into this question of evidence as to the extent of those damages, but we have not got sufficient material before us to deal exhaustively with the subject.\nI think the judgment of the Appellate Division which ordered a reference should be maintained and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harley & Sweet.\nSolicitors for the respondent Pattison: Holman, Bissett & Peine.\nSolicitors for the respondents, The Grand Valley Railway Co.: Watson, Smoke, Smith & Sinclair.\n[1] 30 Ont.

There was a special provision that out of the last instalment the mortgagor could retain $1,000 until he received a conveyance of the interest of an infant who, with the mortgagee, executed an agreement to convey when he became of age. There was also the acceleration clause making the whole amount due on default in paying any part. In an action to foreclose default having been made in payment of the first annual instalment.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Appellate Division (31 Ont. L.R. 471), which maintained the judgment at the trial (30 Ont. L.R. 502), that the postponement of the time for payment of the $1,000, part of the last instalment, did not disentitle the mortgagee to his remedy of foreclosing; but\nHeld, varying the judgment below, that the acceleration clause in the mortgage did not apply to the $1,000, payment of which was postponed; that the personal recovery against the mortgagor should not include this sum; and that the judgment below should be amended by providing that the proceedings should be stayed by payment into court of the balance.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head- note. The only question in dispute was the effect of the provision postponing payment of the $1,000 on the mortgagee\u2019s right to foreclose.\nHislop for the appellant referred to Cameron v. McRae[3], and Bonham v. Newcomb[4], as authorities for his contention that the mortgagee could not foreclose while any portion of the principal monies was not due.\nChoppin, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The judgment should be varied by protecting the mortgagor in regard to the deferred payment of $1,000, the whole in accordance with the note made when judgment was delivered. I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am to allow this appeal, but only to the extent and for the purpose of varying and reducing the judgment appealed from in regard to the one thousand dollars payable on the coming of age of the minor; costs of mortgagor to be allowed except as they have been increased on grounds on which he has failed.\nI agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is a forclosure suit of a mortgage given for part of the purchase money of the land covered by the mortgage. It seems from the mortgage and affidavit verifying the statement of defence that in order to make a complete title as intended by the parties to the sale and purchase it was necessary that an interest of a minor should be conveyed when he attained the age of twenty-one years or an order be got from the court.\nTo avoid the expense of such an order the parties hereto agreed that the appellant should be indemnified against the contingency of failure to procure such infant\u2019s conveyance on his attaining his majority.\nThis was provided for in two ways. A bond was given appellant that said infant would, on attaining his majority, execute the necessary conveyance, and it was further provided by inserting in the mortgage in question immediately after the proviso fixing the terms of payment of the mortgage moneys, the following:\u2014\nProvided always and it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto that notwithstanding the times, dates and manner herein fixed for payment of the principal money hereby secured the said mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns may retain to his or their use the sum of one thousand dollars out of the last instalment of two thousand five hundred dollars payable on the first day of October, 1815, until such time as the said mortgagee, her heirs, executors and administrators shall have performed the terms and conditions of a certain agreement between the parties hereto, which agreement bears date the 30th day of January, 1913, entitling her or them to the due payment of the said sum of one thousand dollars under such agreement.\nInstead of protecting the mortgagor in regard thereto, the formal judgment includes the said sum of $1,000 in the sum found due upon the said mortgage and fixes as usual the time for payment thereof and provides for foreclosure unless such sum paid on said date.\nThat date would seem to be about a year and three months before said infant, if surviving, would attain his majority.\nThe judgment might by the terms become so oppressive as to work a forfeiture of appellant\u2019s rights. He might find it impossible to raise on the security of such a defective title the money needed to redeem. He could only offer security on that to which he had got a title. That security might not enable him to raise more thereon than the judgment debt less the $1,000, whereas if he could offer the security he had and the chance of a complete title he might provide, by a mortgage conditional on getting the complete title, for the $1,000 also.\nIn the court of appeal upholding the said judgment reliance is placed upon the acceleration clause which in an ordinary case might be held to so bind a mortgagor that he must either pay up in full or be foreclosed if making default in a single payment and thus lose the advantage of the terms originally stipulated for unless, as I think, the court could relieve him. It habitually did so.\nI cannot think that the parties ever intended to deprive by virtue of the use of the acceleration clause in that way the benefit of the above proviso. And if the respondent mortgagee or any one else ever so intended I think there are several answers thereto. It is not the correct construction of the document, especially when read in light of the collateral agreements. Besides it is not infrequently the case that the consideration for the mortgage fails to be advanced and in such cases no matter what the terms of the mortgage may read the amount spoken of therein is duly cut down to the actual sum advanced. Such seems to me the nature of this interest estimated by those concerned to be worth a thousand dollars for the purpose of this mortgage and to become payable at a date when the infant would have attained his majority and as a charge on the land to be dependent upon his executing a release or other necessary conveyance, or said inter- est being otherwise, in possible contingencies, conveyed to the mortgagor or his assigns.\nIn the meantime for convenience sake the agreed upon price of $1,000 is included in the mortgage.\nIf the mortgagee is determined to foreclose it must for the purpose of this suit meantime be treated as money not advanced and deducted from the main consideration.\nThen again, if the general principles upon which courts of equity proceed in foreclosure are involved and the cases relied upon by appellant are reasonably applied, there would be no difficulty in the matter. If the mortgagor fails to pay the sum found due less this $1,000, the mortgagee gets the property that she conveyed and so ends the matter so far as this mortgage is concerned.\nIf, on the other hand, the mortgagor redeems it can be provided in such case that it shall stand as security for the $1,000 (till such time as she has had the opportunity contemplated by the parties of procuring the conveyance contracted for) with interest in the meantime thereupon.\nThen again to do otherwise seems to me to contravene the policy or jurisprudence of the courts of equity relative to the relief to be given against penalties and forfeitures.\nI think it is quite possible that the extremely unreasonable contention set up by appellant that no proceedings could be had herein till said interest was got in, caused the courts below to overlook the need for giving the relief indicated above by modifying the judgment accordingly.\nThe authorities relied upon do not justify the pretension set up by the appellant. The principle some of them proceed upon I repeat does justify the application thereof to this sum of $1,000.\nIf the judgment is amended by the deduction of $1,000 from the sum found due it will be necessary to name a new day for payment.\nThat need not be the original length of time given, but say a month after the formal judgment issue herein.\nIf the security is ample, or a payment made so to reduce the amount as to make it ample, the parties would be well advised I imagine to fix the new date at a time that would enable the conveyance to be got and agree to add a term to the judgment anticipating such conveyance and making the whole sum as it now stands be payable in such event on the new date.\nIn any event the appeal should be allowed and the judgment varied.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs but without costs to either party of the appeal to the court of appeal and the original judgment be varied by deducting $1,000 from the amount found due and also by providing as already suggested for the contingency of redemption and the security standing to secure the $1,000 and interest thereon to abide the result of the title being completed within a reasonable time to be agreed upon or, in default thereof, fixed by the registrar, and failing that, the discharge or reassignment to appellant of the mortgage.\nI had an impression on the opening of the argument herein that all this might have been easily obtained by an application to the Supreme Court of Ontario, but the judgment of the Appellate Division rather indicates otherwise. Hence I would allow costs of appeal here, because I still think by some such reasonable course as I suggest the present relief might have been sought for and possibly obtained without coming here if the claim to deprive the respondent of all relief had not been so unreasonably persisted in.\nSince writing the foregoing a reading of the full text (from copy since handed in) of the statutory meaning to be given said acceleration clause as it stands in the mortgage, confirms the impression I had relative to the power of the Ontario courts in the premises. An explanation of that by counsel or in the judgment appealed from might have saved some labour. I still prefer that the parties should be left to work out an amendment protecting them both in the way indicated above and in other opinions delivered herein, and possibly save needless expense rather than forcing them to accept the amendment proposed; should they fail, of course, the registrar would have to settle the minutes relative to amendment, etc. The $1,000 in question forms such an unusual part of the consideration and is subject to so many contingencies that it seems to me the usual form of judgment in foreclosure is not quite appropriate. That form by no means bounds the equitable jurisdiction of the court.\nThe appellant is told he can have a sale if he so elect and I presume pay for. But what a tangle would ensue unless exceptional provision made for such an event. And I do not know whether or not desired and if it is worth while to provide therefor. Leaving it to the parties first to try and frame what would suit is for that as well as many other reasons desirable.\nIn argument here it was quite clear to my mind neither counsel had anticipated the view we have taken and hence we are without their aid in this regard. The case is not one to call for re-argument. It is not desirable to have the whole $1,000 eaten up in costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s contention that his default in payment of interest and of certain principal moneys due upon his mortgage to the respondent did not entitle the latter to the remedy of foreclosure, because, as to $1,000 of the final instalment of $2,500 of principal, the mortgagee had agreed that it should not be payable until a deed of a supposedly outstanding interest in the property in question held by an infant had been furnished to the mortgagor, seems to me to be most unreasonable. Burrowes v. Molloy[5], on which the appellant relies, was not at all such a case. There the mortgagor had covenanted that the whole principal should not be called in before a certain time, and that time had not arrived. In Cameron v. McRae[6] there is, no doubt, a passage in the judgment of the Chancellor, at page 314, quoted in Parker v. Vinegrowers\u2019 Association[7], at page 186, which lends some support to the proposition for which Mr. Hislop cites it, that is to say, that when a mortgagee has disabled himself from calling in any part of the principal he is not entitled to the relief of foreclosure in respect of the balance. But the passage relied upon is merely a dictum, and I cannot regard these cases as authorities which require an extension of the rule stated in Burrowes v. Molloy5 to a case where part only of the principal is postponed, as it is here. Indeed, in Parker\u2019s Case[8], at page 182, Blake, V.C., says:\u2014\nThere is no doubt that the right to redeem implies the right to foreclosure and vice vers\u00e2, but because these rights are reciprocal it does not follow that the identical conditions attached to the one right are to be attached to the other. * * * Holding as I do that all the terms on which the alternative right of foreclosing or redeeming may be exercised, need not be identical, it is not necessary to consider on what exact conditions under this instrument the defendants could redeem. It is only incumbent on me to decide whether there has been such default on the part of the defendants, as that, in invitum, they can be compelled through a foreclosure suit to pay any, and if so what, portion of the money secured by the mortgage.\nBy the default in payment of interest and of an instalment of principal the mortgagor broke the condition on which the mortgage was to become void and at law forfeited all his rights in the land, thus entitling the mortgagee to bring foreclosure proceedings to extinguish the equity of redemption which the mortgagor still retained. Except as to the $1,000 there was no agreement to defer payment or to postpone the right to foreclosure for default. As put by Meredith, C.J.C.P.:\u2014\nSo the case is a simple one of default in payment of the first instalment due on the mortgage, a default which, at law, forfeited all the mortgagor\u2019s rights in the land, but in equity left in him a right to redeem.\n* * * * *\nNor does foreclosure create any difficulty or work unjustly against any one. If foreclosure takes place, the mortgagee merely gets back that which she conveyed and the mortgagor loses only that which she has paid\u2014the usual case.\nThe mortgagee by foreclosure will not obtain and cannot make title to the outstanding interest which was not vested in her mortgagor and was not mort- gaged to her. She forecloses only on the mortgagor\u2019s equity to redeem that which he conveyed as security, i.e., the interest which he had in the lands.\nBut I am, with respect, unable to accept the view which prevailed in the Appellate Division that the acceleration clause in the mortgage overrides the special provision by which the payment of the final $1,000 of principal moneys was deferred, or that, reading the mortgage as a whole with the incorporated agreement, the right to the postponement of the payment of that sum was \u201cconditional on there being no default in payment of interest.\u201d In the first place the agreement to postpone the payment of the $1,000 is not made subject to any such condition. It is an absolute undertaking that the mortgagor may retain this part of the principal until delivery to him of a conveyance of the infant\u2019s outstanding interest. Although it will usually be implied without express stipulation that postponement of the payment of principal is conditional on punctual payment of interest; Seaton v. Twyford[9]; Edwards v. Martin[10]; the form in which the stipulation in the present case is couched, I think, prevents any such implication arising as to the $1,000 in question upon default either in payment of interest or in payment of instalments of principal as they fall due. We cannot ignore the fact evidenced by the agreement incorporated in the mortgage that the $1,000, of which payment is deferred, was a part of the purchase money for which the purchaser-mortgagor has not yet received the consideration, and which it was clearly intended should not become payable until the infant\u2019s interest in the lands, which it represents, should be vested in him. Having regard to all the circumstances and to the intent of the parties as manifested by the terms of the mortgage and agreement it seems reasonably clear that the acceleration clause in the mortgage cannot have been intended to apply to this $1,000, of which payment was thus specially postponed, but only to other portions of the principal moneys which might not be overdue when default occurred.\nIt follows that, without affecting any right of the mortgagor under the provisions of Rule No. 485 of the Ontario Supreme Court Rules of 1913, the judgment pronounced in this action should be modified by excluding from the amount for which the mortgagee is given the right of immediate personal recovery against the mortgagor the postponed $1,000. While redemption can only be awarded on payment of the whole sum secured by the mortgage, which includes the $1,000 deferred, the mortgagor is entitled to have this action stayed on payment of the sum secured less that $1,000. This can be accomplished by inserting in the decree, as paragraph 2a, the following:\u2014\nAnd upon the defendants paying into the said head office of the Canadian Bank of Commerce to the joint credit aforesaid and at the time aforesaid the sum of $6,287.15 this court doth order and adjudge that all further proceedings in this action, except an application for payment of said moneys over to the plaintiff, be stayed;\nby inserting in clause 3 after the word \u201cpayment\u201d the words,\neither under paragraph 2 or under paragraph 2a hereof,\nand by substituting in clause 4 for the figures \u201c$7,080.90\u201d the figures $6,080.90\u201d\u2014all this, of course, as of the date of the judgment as originally pronounced. In view of the delay occasioned by the ap- peals to the Appellate Division and to this court the figures and dates in that judgment will require to be altered. That can be done by the registrar in settling the minutes of judgment.\nThe appellant having succeeded, though only on a minor point, should have his costs in this court, except in so far as they have been increased by his having taken grounds on which he has failed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Thomas Hislop.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.E.

The usual index-card specifying the lots to be offered and the price and terms he was willing to accept was signed by him. On the said 19th of March appellant (formerly in the real estate business) called at respondents\u2019 office and offered a listing of other properties for which he wanted a purchaser and, whilst so there, was offered the Carrothers properties and verbally accepted the proposal and made a deposit of $100 on account of the purchase.\nNext day respondent Tinck waited upon the appellant at his office to procure his signature to the agreement for the purchase by him of the said Carrothers properties and he signed same in duplicate and gave his cheque for the balance of the cash payment.\nThat agreement was not signed by any one for Carrothers as respondents never pretended to have authority to sign such an agreement and had only been retained to find a purchaser. They sent this agreement to Carrothers, in care of King Edward Hotel, Toronto, Ont., where he had said he was going, to be executed by him and returned.\nThe agreement was returned about a month later as uncalled-for. Thereupon the agreement was forwarded by respondents to Carrothers, at Edmonton, Alta., where he lived, but it never came back and, presumably, never was executed by him.\nSome correspondence is alleged to have taken place later between him and respondents but that, though tendered in evidence by them, was rejected.\nAll we have of it is a copy of the letter from respondents enclosing the agreement from which it appears they asked him to sign and return one copy so duly executed attached to a bank sight-draft for the sum of $450, being the cash payment less respondents\u2019 commission.\nOn the 1st of June appellant says he called upon the respondents for a receipt for the money he had paid and got the following:\u2014\nMarch 20th, 1912.\nReceived of George S. Peacock $500, first payment on lots 1 and 2, block 108, Old City, bought from us at $1,000; one-half cash and the balance 6 and 12 months at 8 per cent, and listed by A. F. Carrothers.\n(Sgd.) Dad Land Company,\nR. Tinck.\nThe appellant meantime, on the 28th March, resold the property to Wright and Boyle, real estate agents, and, pursuant thereto, he and they signed an agreement for the sale and purchase thereof at the price of $2,000, of which $767 was to be paid in cash and balance spread over two years bearing interest at eight per cent per annum.\nThey re-sold to one Seller at the price of $2,500 and assigned the said contract to him by an assignment which is not amongst the documents before this court. A recital in the later agreement of August, hereafter referred to, indicates the assignment was executed on the 1st of April.\nOn the 3rd of June appellant concluded he could not get title to the property and \u201cimmediately took steps to re-purchase the property\u201d from William Seller and succeeded in doing so at the price of $3,100. The exact date of that purchase is not given in evidence. And Seller was not called as a witness.\nOn the 4th of June respondents wrote appellant explaining that they had failed to get delivery of the lots and, to repay the cash payment, enclosed a cheque for $500, which was returned by appellant on the 30th of July.\nMeantime some meetings of the parties hereto were held relative to the matter and, on one occasion, Boyle and Seller were both present to state what they had done, but the respondents on every occasion repudiated liability for damages appellant was then and there claiming from them. On one of these occasions respondents offered to give the cash if any doubt existed about the cheque being, as such, satisfactory, but appellant refused and seems to have insisted on these occasions on damages for the loss of profits and those differences in price which he said he had paid these sub-purchasers which seemed, in his view, to be his measure of damages.\nOn one or more of these occasions the appellant stated his grievances in the matter, omitting, however, the one most essential part of his story to which I am about to refer.\nOn the 5th of August an agreement was made in writing between Wright and Boyle of the first part, Seller of the second part and appellant of the third part, for rescinding and releasing said sub-sale and amongst other recitals therein was the following:\u2014\nAnd whereas it has been discovered by all the parties hereto that the party of the third part did not have the right to call for a title to the said lots nor any contract with the registered owner thereof and is unable to furnish any title nor will he be able to furnish any title to said lots, and it has been deemed expedient by all the parties hereto that, instead of the said respective purchasers under the said agreement and assignment insisting upon title being given according to the terms of said agreement and assignment, that the said agreement and assignment should be abandoned, and the moneys paid thereunder returned and the parties thereto compensated for their loss as hereinafter set forth.\nThe appellant says that when Tinck came to him with the agreement of sale by Carrothers and before he (the appellant) signed as above set forth the following conversation took place:\u2014\nQ. Now just state slowly what the conversation was?\nA. As soon as I saw the name of the vendor was A. F. Carrothers, I asked the defendant Tinck if he was sure that these lots could be delivered by Carrothers. He assured me that they could. I asked him if he had searched the title of these lots. He told me that the defendant Wilkinson had searched the title and that Carrothers was registered owner. I then referred to the matter that I knew that Carrothers had been in business here, and I wanted to know if there had been any execution against him. I understood that he had been in business difficulties. And he stated positively that there were no executions against him; the title was clear. He also said, \u201cIf you want any further protection in the matter we will have a caveat put on these lots for you.\u201d\nIn regard to this statement he is corroborated by his bookkeeper, Blenkhorn, to whose remarkable memory I may advert to later. Meantime I assume, for argument\u2019s sake, the truth of appellant\u2019s story and will therefore consider in light first thereof, standing alone, what (if any) claim appellant can found thereupon and next how in light of his own conduct he can make any claim. Counsel for appellant puts his claim in a variety of ways. One of these is put in a two-fold sort of way of an assurance that the respondents undertook to sell the property or that it would be sold and delivered to the appellant so that he would have the title conveyed to him.\nIn either of these ways of presenting the matter it simply, when stripped of needless verbiage, means a contract of sale by respondents and the facts do not bear out any such contention. The respondents never professed to sell the property in any other capacity than as agents. The documentary evidence seems conclusive in this regard.\nThen it seems to have been presented below as, in fact, an agent professing to sell and selling property he had no authority to sell. Again the facts are against appellant for the agents had authority to procure a purchaser and never signed any contract of sale. Their principal never signed any either. There cannot be found anything upon which an action for breach of warranty as agents can lie.\nIndeed, it is difficult to grasp any of these elusive theories put forward and apply them in light of the evidence to any principle of law that would found an action for breach of contract. The suggestion is also made of a collateral warranty, but that must fail also as there was no contract to which it could be collateral.\nThe fifth and only ground which can be made to wear a plausible appearance in law is stated in the factum as follows:\u2014\n5. Alternatively to all the foregoing grounds because, by reason of the false and fraudulent statements of defendants, the plaintiff was led into and suffered damage. The general statements as to producing title are of no material consequence for they are nothing more than any real estate agent might properly use affirming his belief in his client being ready to perform that which he had authorized to be done on his behalf.\nNo action can lie for any such thing so long as the agent confines himself to what he has been authorized to carry out and has no reason to believe the principal is acting dishonestly.\nThe only serious matter, in what appellant states he was told by Tinck, is that relative to Wilkinson having searched the title and found Carrothers to be the registered owner and that there were no executions against him.\nTinck positively denies these allegations and Wilkinson says he had never till August searched the title. And it puzzles me to understand how or why any sane man should tell such a senseless falsehood liable to be discovered at any moment at an expense of twenty-five cents for a search.\nBut appellant says more; that the man telling him offered to protect him further by filing a caveat. And apparently that very every-day proposal in such cases led to the discovery, as it was sure to do, that Carrothers never was registered owner.\nHe did not file any caveat, but appellant did at an expense, he says, of five dollars, on 10th of April. The caveat is produced and therewith the affidavit of appellant sworn on the 4th of April just fifteen days after he had been told, if a word of truth in his story, that Wilkinson, the respondent, had searched and found Carrothers to be the registered owner.\nThe caveat consists of a notice to the registrar of which the part essential to our present inquiry is as follows:\u2014\nTake notice, that I, George S. Peacock, of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, claiming an equitable interest under and by virtue of an agreement of sale between A. F. Carrothers, of the City of Edmonton, as vendor, and myself, George S. Peacock, of the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, as purchaser, and dated on or about the 20th day of March 1912, the said Carrothers holding the said land under and by virtue of an agreement of sale therefor made with Arthur Tyzack, the registered owner, in all that certain piece or parcel of land being lots numbers one, * * * etc.\ndescribing the lands in question.\nThe appellant as such caveator, verifying said statement, swears amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\n1. That the allegations in the above named caveat are true in substance, and, in fact, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.\nAnd this man, thus swearing, is asking damages from a court of justice for having been fraudulently induced by the statement that the said registered owner was Carrothers. Need I say that in law, unless in fact a false statement induces a man to act upon it to his damage, he has no right of action; and that unless he has taken the means a prudent man would be expected to take when so acting upon a false statement, he has no action of deceit?\nCan any one, in face of such an unfounded affidavit by appellant, so inconsistent with the story of a belief in Carrothers being registered owner, believe he, appellant, was so induced by the alleged fraudulent statement?\nBut that is not all, for Wilkinson was called as a witness and testified as to what transpired at one of the meetings I have referred to above as follows:\u2014\nQ. Then do you remember any other important conversations that you had with him? A. I remember him coming to the office on Cornwall street and bringing two gentlemen with him, Mr. Boyle and another gentleman.\nQ. Your office was on Cornwall street?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you had a conversation at that time?\nA. Yes.\nQ. There was Mr. Peacock and Mr. Boyle, and this other gentleman, and yourself?\nA. Mr. Tinck was there also.\nQ. And what took place at that time?\nA. Mr. Peacock made a demand for compensation for some loss that he alleged he had sustained.\nQ. And did you agree to give him compensation?\nA. We did not.\nQ. Did he at that time charge that you had told him that you would search the title to this property?\nA. He did not.\nQ. Did be say in the presence of Mr. Boyle or Mr. Tinck or anybody else that you had guaranteed to deliver this property to him?\nA. He did not.\nAppellant nowhere states that he had ever made it a matter of reproach to these respondents, or either of them, when claiming damages that he had been told such a palpable falsehood as he now charges against Tinck, and founds this action upon. If he had been told what he says and trusted it, then was the time respondents and others should and doubtless would have heard of it.\nWilkinson swears he never searched till August, (and he could easily have been contradicted if he had or could have been proven to have known or been told of this discovery,) yet no one appears to; say so except what appellant says, and then only inferentially.\nAppellant was recalled after Wilkinson had testified as above, but did not venture to contradict his very material statement.\nHow could a man misled by such a story as he now puts forward forbear from charging him or his partner or both with the alleged deception he now relies upon? No one ever seems to have heard of it except Blenkhorn.\nWhen, on cross-examination, appellant was brought face to face with the said caveat, he speaks thus:\u2014\nQ. Mr. Peacock, at the time you signed the caveat did you know whether Carrothers had bought this property under any agreement of sale from anybody? At the time you signed the caveat you knew that the property was not registered in the name of Carrothers?\nA. I did.\nQ. Did you have any information that Carrothers had bought from any particular person?\nA. After I signed that caveat I called up the defendant Wilkinson\u2014\nQ. Never mind after you signed the caveat. At the time you signed the caveat did you know whether Carrothers had bought from anybody \u2014 how he held the title?\nA. No; I did not.\nLater he tries an explanation that does not in the least degree ameliorate his position, but seems to indicate that his solicitors had some telephone conversation with Wilkinson, after their discovery that Carrothers was not the registered owner, in which he alleges Wilkinson had remarked \u201cwell he must have it under agreement for sale,\u201d all of which is hearsay.\nBut Wilkinson was recalled and testified thus:\u2014\nQ. Did you ever tell Mr. Peacock over the telephone or in any other way that Carrothers held this property under agreement of sale from Arthur Tyzack, the registered owner?\nA. No, sir. I wasn\u2019t aware that Mr. Tyzack owned the property or was the registered owner,\nand was allowed to go without cross-examination or any contradiction from those in the solicitor\u2019s office.\nBlenkhorn, the corroborator of the appellant, in-cross-examination, testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. Have you discussed your evidence with anybody?\nA. I have mentioned the matter.\nQ. Have you talked it over with Mr. Peacock?\nA. Well, very little. Q. Have you not gone over your story together?\nA. Never gone over my story.\nA. And never gone over it with my learned friend?\nA. No.\nThe improbability of this adds nothing to the strength of his story or to inspire confidence in his corroboration.\nIndeed, in one of appellant\u2019s answers he says, after being positive, as follows:\u2014\nA. When he stated the title was clear of incumbrance and in the name of A. F. Carrothers, I understood him to say that Wilkinson had searched the title.\nOn the foregoing no court should allow any damages for fraud, even if suffered, when so clearly not relied on, and reliance thereon only supported by the oath of a man who could deliberately take the oath above set forth so inconsistent with his having relied upon the pretended assurance.\nEven if the case had been something better than it is there never was, in law, any ground for damages by reason of the re-sale and that being re-assigned.\nAppellant could not have been called upon for damages flowing from the failure to make title to Boyle and Wright unless he was deliberately trying to defraud these other gentlemen. Nor in that case could he look to any one else to reimburse him. And the recital above quoted from the agreement of August with said sub-purchasers indicates no such ground was ever taken.\nThe case of Bain v. Fothergill[3], within which all such like claims as herein involved fall, is yet good English law as introduced into the North-West. I respectfully submit the case of O\u2019Neill v. Drinkle[4] cannot be considered as governing such claims. There are many conceivable cases arising out of land sales in which damages may be recovered, but wherein they fall within Bain v. Fothergill[5] the claim must fail. Because of simplifying or simplicity of tenure a change in the law governing such cases cannot be presumed to have taken place. On such a ground the various provinces might have different laws, and, in Ontario, for example, one law for the lands held under the old registry system and another for titles under the new system.\nWithin the said case, short of fraud, respondents if assumed in the position of vendors, as in one way the ease is presented, would not be liable, as no fraud is found. And there is no case on which appellant under the circumstances can succeed in treating the action as one of deceit.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The learned trial judge took one view of the facts and the court of appeal took another view. And it appears to me that the crucial question on the appeal is whether or not the full court was right in rejecting the conclusion upon the facts that the trial judge had arrived at.\nIt is important in appreciating the conduct of the parties to keep in mind the fact that at the time when the transactions and events occurred which have to be considered there was great activity in the buying and selling of real estate in Regina, or in other words, that a \u201cland boom\u201d was in progress.\nThe respondents were real estate agents in Regina; and some time prior to the 19th of March, 1912, they had listed with them, by one Carrothers, certain lots which were the subjects of the transactions about to be discussed. On the date mentioned the appellant, who was a man of long experience in business, and who had had previous dealings with the respondents, while in their office in Regina, on business connected with the sale of some property owned by him, had his attention called to the lots in question by the respondent Tinck, and, having been informed of the terms on which they were listed, said that he would take them at $1,000 and pay $100 as deposit. On the following day the appellant executed as purchaser a document intended to be a formal agreement for sale between himself and Carrothers as vendor. The agreement was signed in duplicate, and the duplicates handed to the respondents with a cheque for $400, the residue of the half of the purchase price, which, according to the terms mentioned on the previous day, was to be paid in cash. These documents, together with the cheque, were forwarded by the defendants to Carrothers, at Toronto. They were never executed by Carrothers, and on the 4th of June, 1912, the respondents wrote to the appellant informing him that they had been unable to induce Mr. Carrothers to complete the sale and enclosed a cheque for the sum of $500 paid by the appellant. In the meantime the appellant had entered into an agreement for the sale of these lots at a largely increased price, $2,000, the 28th of March, 1912, being the date of the agreement, by which he covenanted to give a good title to the purchaser. Later finding that the lots were rising in price and that he was unable to obtain a title from Carrothers, he made a composition with his vendee paying him all the sum of $1,000 as compensation for the loss of the bargain. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the pleadings was based alternatively, first, upon an allegation that the defendants had undertaken to procure the transfer of a good title to the lots in question to the appellant; and, upon an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation that Carrothers was the registered owner of the lots. The trial judge decided in favour of the appellant upon the first of these two alternative grounds. The full court reversed the judgment of the trial judge holding that what was done by the defendants was in the ordinary course of their business of finding a purchaser for Carrothers, and that they entered into no agreement either to procure a sale from Carrothers to the appellant or as agent on behalf of Carrothers to sell.\nThe claim based upon deceit was not, as I think, either in substance or in form passed upon by the learned trial judge. The full court appears to have rejected this claim upon the ground that certain misrepresentations of fact were not shewn to be fraudulent, and that the plaintiff\u2019s loss was not due to the respondents\u2019 misrepresentations, but to his own recklessness in entering into a binding agreement for the sale of the lots before he had procured a concluded agreement with Carrothers for the purchase of them.\nThe points in dispute are questions of fact, but the right determination of these questions depends almost entirely upon the proper inference to be drawn from facts which, in themselves, can hardly be said to be the subject of controversy. My opinion, after a full examination of the evidence is that the judgment of the full court was right.\nOne point ought to be noted at the outset and that is that the mere listing of property, as it is called, with a real estate agent does not itself involve the grant of any authority to him to enter into a binding contract of sale on behalf of the vendor. Where sales are made in the course of a \u201cland boom\u201d it perhaps most frequently happens that the seller who lists his property with the real estate agent has a title resting upon one or more, sometimes upon a long series, of executory agreements and it is of the greatest importance that the conditions of any contract of sale should be so drawn as to protect him fully, and this, without special instructions, the agent is, of course, not competent to do. Some confusion, no doubt, has arisen from the use of the term \u201creal estate agent\u201d which describes, of course, not the legal relation between the two parties, but merely the nature of the so-called agent\u2019s occupation. The mere listing of property with such an agent implies nothing more than a representation that the proprietor is prepared to do business upon those terms and is not in itself an offer to sell which may be accepted and converted into a binding agreement by any purchaser saying to the agent that he will take the property on those terms. The agent\u2019s business is to procure a purchaser, that is to say, to bring into contact with the vendor a person willing to purchase on the terms mentioned. Having done that he has performed his function and earned his commission, provided his authority is not in the meantime revoked by the sale of the property by the proprietor. The listing alone gives him no authority to bind the proprietor by a contract of sale. The fact which seems to me to be sufficiently established that the defendants did not profess to sell the lots is, in my judgment, the decisive fact in the case. I think that fact is established as a necessary inference, from other facts which are not seriously in dispute. I have already mentioned that the contract signed by the appellant professing to record the transaction formally into which they intended to enter was a proposed contract between himself and Carrothers which he quite well understood was to be executed by Carrothers and not by the defendants as Carrothers\u2019s agent. That document must be taken as conclusive evidence of the character of the transaction in respect of which the sum of $400 was paid on that day to the respondents. The contemplated transaction was a contract of sale which was to be completed only when executed by both parties to it. It seems idle, in face of that, to suggest that on the day before an oral agreement of sale had been entered into between the appellant as vendee and the respondents representing Carrothers as the vendor. Any such suggestion, moreover, comes to shipwreck on the hard fact that the terms of listing made known to the appellant required the payment of $500 in cash, that is to say, contemporaneously with the constituting of the relation of vendor and purchaser between the proposed parties to the agreement.\nThe fact was known to both parties that the agent had no authority to conclude a contract of sale upon any such terms, that is to say, in the absence of such a payment. As no contract of sale was ever entered into professedly by the respondents on behalf of Carrothers it follows that the representations of authority to enter into such an agreement upon the terms mentioned, assuming there were such representations, the authority not having been acted upon, could not give rise to any right of action. It follows also that any right of action ex contract\u00fb against the respondents must rest upon some contractual undertaking on their part that Carrothers would execute the agreement signed by the appellant.\nThe most important evidence in support of this branch of the appellant\u2019s case is in his statement made on cross-examination that he was told by the defendant Tinck that he could \u201crely on getting delivery of the property.\u201d It is necessary, however, to read this testimony with the plaintiff\u2019s statement that at the same time he was assured that Carrothers had the title and with the statement in his examination-in-chief to the effect that the assurance given by the defendant was a positive assurance that Carrothers could deliver the property. I do not think this evidence is sufficient to establish the existence of an agreement to procure the execution of a contract of sale by Carrothers. The point about which the appellant was concerned, as I think the evidence sufficiently shews, was the question of Carrothers\u2019s title. It was to this point that the appellant\u2019s questions and respondents\u2019 assurances were addressed.\nThe appellant admits that he is unable to assert that he at any time believed the respondents to be selling the property on their own behalf. Read as a whole the evidence appears to be too doubtful and equivocal to justify a conclusion in the sense contended for by Mr. Frame. It is not a matter in which the conclusion of the trial judge is entitled to that weight which attaches to his opinion on any point of credibility.\nI think the conclusion of the full court is to be preferred. There remains the question of fraud. This ground of action also obviously fails, I should have thought, once it is plain that the appellant had not a concluded contract with Carrothers for the sale and purchase of the lots; and for this short reason, that, having no contract with Carrothers, the question as to whether Carrothers had or had not a title to the land, whether he was or was not the registered owner, must necessarily have been a matter of no moment. If every representation of fact made by the respondents had been perfectly true the appellant would, in the absence of such a contract, have been in precisely the same position as he found himself in in June, unable to make a title, so far as it appears from the evidence.\nIt seems to have been assumed that the respondents\u2019 failure to procure Carrothers to transfer the property to the appellant was due to Carrothers\u2019 want of title, or rather to his lack of any right to call for such transfer. All that is mere speculation. If anything the probabilities are against it. Carrothers admittedly was not the registered owner; but that is entirely consistent with the existence in him of a right to call for a transfer of the property to his nominee.\nOn the other hand there is the fact that the property was unquestionably listed by Carrothers with the respondents, who, as it appears from the correspondence, entertained no doubt whatever as to Carrothers\u2019 power to deal with it. The simple explanation as to Carrothers\u2019s refusal to sign the agreement most probably lies in the fact that when the documents reached him he had learned that the property in the meantime had doubled in value. Knowledge of this sudden rise may also explain the haste of the appellant to enter into a contract of sale without having first ascertained that he was in a position safely to enter into such a contract.\nLooking at the transaction broadly, one sees no reason to doubt that it was simply a case of an owner, having listed property, refusing to stand by the terms he had given to his agent, and an intending purchaser acting upon the agent\u2019s assurances that the principal would stand by them without satisfying himself by proper inquiries whether, in point of fact, he had any contract at all with the owner of the property and suffering loss in consequence of his rashness. That in this case the assurances of the agents were understood to be contractual in their nature is not asserted in his evidence by the appellant himelf; and as such assurances \u2014 that the principal would accept and execute the proposed contract of sale \u2014 being assurances as to something which necessarily was a matter of opinion only, the appellant can only found an action upon them by obtaining a finding that they were fraudulent. The learned trial judge has not found as regards these assurances that they were fraudulent. The full court has found that they were not. An independent examination of the record satisfies me that there is no evidence upon which any finding that they were could be properly based.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Frame, Secord, Turnbull & Goetz.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Embury, Scott & Mc-Kinnon.\n[1] 7 West.

[1906] c. 37, ss. 297, 306).\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., that when worn-out ties are burned by a railway company on its right-of-way in performance of the duty imposed by section 297 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to keep the right-of-way free from unnecessary combustible matter any damage or injury resulting therefrom is caused by reason of the \u201coperation of the railway\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in section 306, and the right of action for such damage or injury is prescribed by one year.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The injury in such case may be caused by reason of the \u201coperation of the railway\u201d though the company, in burning the ties, was not performing the duty imposed by section 297.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting.\u2014By sub-section 2 of section 306 the application of the section is limited to cases in which the injury was caused \u201cin pursuance of and by authority of this Act or of the special Act\u201d and as the burning of the ties was not so authorized the prescription could not be relied on.\nHeld, also, Idington J. dissenting, that sub-section 4 of section 306 did not prevent the application of the provision in sub-section 1 for limiting the time in which action could be brought.\nThe decision of the Appellate Division (32 Ont. L.R. 104) maintaining the judgment at the trial (31 Ont. L.R. 419) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the defendant company. The company\u2019s servants burned a number of worn-out ties on the right-of-way and the fire ran over on plaintiff\u2019s land and destroyed his property. In his action for damages the negligence of the defendants was admitted and the only question in dispute was whether or not they were entitled to plead that the action should have been brought within one year from the commission of the injurious act as provided in section 306, sub-section 1, of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d This question was decided in favour of the defendants in both courts below.\nLaidlaw K.C. for the appellant. Section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d does not apply to the case of a breach of a common law duty. Prendergast v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3]; Ryckman v.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Both courts below have found on the admissions of the parties that this claim is for damages arising out of an injury sustained by the plaintiff by reason of something negligently done in the operation of the railway and that the limitation of section 306, sub-section 1, R.S.C., [1906] ch. 37, applies.\nFor the reasons assigned by the Chief Justice in the court below I am of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be confirmed with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014This action is one which again directly raises the question of the proper construction of the limitation section 306, chapter 37, of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906. Does that section cover and extend to cases where the damages sought to be recovered were admittedly caused by or proved to have been caused by the negligence of the railway company and its servants?\nIn this appeal it is admitted that the fire which was started by the defendants\u2019 servants on the defendant company\u2019s right-of-way, to consume worn-out or discarded sleepers, escaped from that right-of-way to the plaintiff\u2019s property and destroyed it through the negligence of the company\u2019s servants. Unless, therefore, section 306 can be invoked by the company as a defence to this action, the appeal should be allowed.\nIn a late case heard in this court and not yet reported, of London Street Railway Co. v. Kilgour (not reported), I had occasion to consider the proper construction of a section of the private Act of the street railway company practically the same as the one now before us, and the conclusion I reached in that case was that the limitation section there in question did not extend to or cover damages caused by the \u201cillegal or negligent running\u201d of the street railway.\nBefore reaching the conclusion I did in that London Street Railway Case (not reported), it became necessary for me carefully to read and consider all the cases decided in Ontario upon the true meaning of similar limitation sections in the public or private Acts of that province relating to railway companies.\nThese cases and the reasoning of the different judges who from time to time decided them were most conflicting and impossible to reconcile, so much so that in the late case of Ryckman v. Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Electric Co.[12], in 1905, Osler J., when delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, said:\u2014\nIn the present state of the authorities it is to be desired that a clear ruling should be given upon the subject by the Supreme Court.\nI agreed in my construction of the section in question with the conclusion of Gwynne J., in North Shore Railway Co. v. McWillie[13].\nIt seems to me that sub-section 2 of section 306 in its latter part contains the key to determine the meaning of the words in the first part of the section,\ndamages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway,\nand limits the application of the section to cases where the company can prove that the injury or damage sued for was done or caused\nin pursuance of and by authority of this Act or of the special Act\nor bon\u00e2 fide assumed by the company to be so. It did seem to me that this sub-section 2 was inconsistent with the contention that the section extended to cases of damages caused by the illegal construction or operation of the railway and equally so with respect to damages caused by the negligent construction or operation of the railway.\nIn neither case could it be said that the damages were caused\nin pursuance of and by the authority of the Act,\nand in my judgment it was only to cases which could fairly be said to come within those words that the section could be construed to extend. Many acts and things might be fairly and bon\u00e2 fide assumed by the company and its servants to be within the powers conferred on them and to be in pursuance of and by the authority of the Act, and such cases might well be held to be within the protection of the section.\nBut wilful illegal acts or negligence admitted or proved causing damage were outside of the protection the section was intended to give the company.\nI have seen no reason to change my opinion that\nthe section applies and was only intended to apply to cases in which the damage arises from the execution or neglect in the execution of the powers given to or bon\u00e2 fide assumed by the company for enabling them to construct and maintain their railway, and does not and was not intended to apply to cases where damages have been caused by reason of the default or negligence of the company or its servants in the construction or operation of the road.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014One of the questions raised herein is whether or not respondent when, in violation of the \u201cForest Fires Prevention Act of Ontario,\u201d setting out a fire on its right-of-way and thereby causing damage to another is entitled to set up in defence the statutory limitation given by section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d If not so entitled then it will be unnecessary to consider the defence in light of the obligation resting upon respondent by virtue of the common law whereby the possessor of land was practically liable for the spreading of fire originating on his land as to be in effect an insurer against loss caused thereby.\nI incline to think the result should be held the same in either case, but the frame of section 306 is such that due regard must be had to each and all of its four sub-sections in applying the section to see that in any given case it is not misapplied.\nIn the first place there is an obvious limitation implied in the words\nsustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway\nused in the first sub-section. With regard thereto I shall presently have something to say and authorities to cite.\nBut meantime let it be observed that by sub-section 2 what the company may prove and rely upon is that the\ndamages or injury alleged were done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act.\nCan setting out a fire ever be said to be done in pursuance of the Act? For the construction of the railway in a country such as ours I can understand the necessity to be such as to bring the act of setting out fire as within the meaning of some things to be\ndone in pursuance of * * * this Act.\nBut this railway had been so long constructed that the ties, or some of them, had got so worn and decayed as to need replacement. There was need for repair which is not mentioned in the provision in question. Hence respondent is driven to place reliance upon the word \u201coperation\u201d and by a strained construction thereof to claim that the work in question which was needed to enable the railway to be safely operated is part of the operation.\nThis does not appear to me to be the plain ordinary meaning of the language, but to be directly in conflict with the interpretation put thereon by this court in the case of Robinson v. The Canadian Northern Railway Co.[14], and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[15].\nThat was a case where a siding laid down for the use of the plaintiff in shipping over defendant\u2019s railway was torn up and taken away and defendant refused to so operate its railway as to give plaintiff his accustomed facilities.\nIt seemed to me then as a fairly arguable proposition that in a sense it might fall within the term \u201coperation of the railway.\u201d But it did not seem to me then that giving due weight thereto the limitation in question was ever intended to reach and cover such an indirect incident relative to operation as would protect the company if regard was had to the proper application of the Statute of Limitations. Such statutes are never to be read as furnishing protection against anything but what the plain ordinary meaning of the words used will clearly cover.\nIf there is a doubt in regard thereto it must be resolved in favour of him whose right is sought to be taken away.\nThis case falls well within the. decision in the Robinson Case[16].\nThen there is the case of the Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[17], not referred to in argu- ment or in the courts below, where the railway company sought unsuccessfully to have a similar indirect application made of the section. Leave to appeal was refused by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The work carried on there in question was that of procuring, out of a sand pit the company was possessed of, material for ballasting their railway and which ballast was carried by the gravel trains of the company engaged in executing the work.\nIt was forcibly argued there that the operation in the sand pit was in fact either for construction of the railway or its repair and hence within the extended meaning of the word \u201coperation.\u201d I submit it was quite as much within either term as the illegal conduct of the respondent in setting out a fire in a prohibited district at the time in question.\nThe setting fire there was entirely unnecessary as a means of clearing the right of way. There is no statutory authority within the meaning of sub-section 2 for doing such an unnecessary act.\nThat brings us to a consideration of sub-section 4 which in very comprehensive language prevents the company from claiming relief\nfrom or in any wise diminish or affect any liability or responsibility resting upon it under the laws in force in the province in which such liability or responsibility arises, either towards His Majesty or towards any person, or the wife or husband, parent or child, executor or administrator, tutor or curator, heir or personal representative, of any person, for anything done or admitted to be done by such company, or for any wrongful act, neglect or default, misfeasance, malfeasance, or non-feasance, of such company.\nThe \u201crelief\u201d referred to surely must include that which is the very subject-matter of the section as a whole.\nIt seems expressly designed to withdraw from the operation of sub-section 1 of the section anything falling within the meaning of local laws giving a right of action to those suffering from unjustifiable violation by the company of such local laws.\nIf it does not apply to such a case as this it would be hard to find application for it. The fundamental law constituting the company and endowing it with the rights and privileges it has, cannot be interfered with by any local legislation. Hence I use the phrase \u201cunjustifiable violation\u2019\u2019 for I can conceive of the case of a legislature enacting that over which it has no power to meddle with.\nI read this sub-section as subject to such limitation.\nI can find no conflict, however, between that which the Dominion Parliament has enacted and empowered the respondent to do, and that which the legislature has by the Act above referred to expressly rendered illegal.\nIn other words the plain purpose of this sub-section 4 is to limit the powers conferred by excluding therefrom the possibility of being held to authorize that which a provincial law may in the ordinary course of things have enacted to govern the conduct of all, including railway companies.\nAgain the fundamental principle upon which this legislation proceeds is that what the law authorizes to be done needs no other defence, but that there are cases in doing that which it has been expressly authorized to do a railway company may act negligently and to meet the incidents of such negligence this statutory limitation is given and to that only.\nThis is not a case falling within the principle and hence not within the scope or purpose of the enact- ment. It is a clear case of doing that which was wholly illegal and is by sub-section 4 recognized as such.\nBefore parting with this I may observe that the case of Hoddinott v. Newton, Chambers & Co.[18], cited in respondent\u2019s factum has deeply impressed me. Unfortunately that impression got from a reading thereof is entirely adverse to the pretensions of the respondent herein.\nThe language used in the statute there in question and which had to he construed was the phrase,\nis either being constructed or repaired by means of a scaffolding.\nThe scope of the whole was the liability arising out of the use of or need for the use of a scaffolding.\nYet there where the only question was whether a supplementary work could fall within such phraseology there was a remarkable difference of opinion between very able judges.\nSeeing what the purpose of the legislation there in question was I can assent to every line of the late Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment and yet be permitted to surmise what quick work he would have made of such pretensions as set up here by respondent. And evidently the dissenting judges would have been astonished at such a proposition as there put forward and herein.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment be entered for the damages agreed on with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur with the Court of Appeal in the conclusion that the direct and effective cause of the damages in respect of which the action is brought was the conduct of the company\u2019s servants in the \u201coperation of the railway.\u201d I do not think it is wise to attempt to lay down any criterion other than that supplied in the clause itself for determining what cases are within the words \u201cconstruction or operation of the railway.\u201d The present case I think is near the line but within it. I think counsel for the railway company was right in the opinion he expressed that nothing in section 297 or in the accompanying sections does in any way modify the common law responsibility of the company in making use of fire for the purpose of clearing its right-of-way.\nAnd I am far from satisfied that there is any evidence in the record which would justify the conclusion that what was done by the company\u2019s servants was done in the intended exercise of any power impliedly conferred by that section. I do not think, however, that this necessarily excludes the application of sub-section 1 of section 306.\nAs to sub-section 4 of this section, this sub-section read literally would deprive sub-section 1 of all effect except in those cases in which the cause of action is not given under provincial law. That result would follow because it is obvious that the obligation (ex delicto) created by the company\u2019s wrong whether you look at it from the point of view of the person of incidence or of the person of inherence is \u201caffected\u201d by limiting the time within which the accessory right of action vested in the person of inherence may be exercised even in Canada alone. It is therefore impossible to deny that if you are to give the words of sub-section 4 their full value, when literally read, you must limit the operation of sub-section 1 to causes of action which do not arise under the provincial law. But sub-section 4 is one of those sweeping general sections that one finds in the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which must be applied cautiously and with reasonable regard to the broad canon of construction that such sweeping provisions are not generally to be read as displacing particular provisions with regard to particular subjects to which when literally read they are repugnant. That is the view of the earlier enactment (which for all relevant purposes was the equivalent of sub-section 4) that was taken in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[19]. Sub-section 4 and sub-section 1 must be read together, and sub-section 4 given such effect as leaves it open to us to give a reasonable construction to sub-section 1. I may add that it does not appear to me to help us very much to say that sub-section 1 only affects the remedy and not the right. It seems indeed improbable that Parliament should have contemplated limiting the exercise of the plaintiff\u2019s right of action in Canadian courts while leaving subsisting the obligation\u2014capable of enforcement, of course, in other courts; yet such would be the effect of holding that sub-section 1 is a provision relating only to the procedure. An injured passenger, who by lapse of time had lost his right to sue in the Canadian courts, might sue in New York or in Chicago, and in the case of Dominion railways that course might present very little inconvenience.\nMoreover, as regards causes of action given by provincial law only, it appears to me that it would be arguable that a Dominion enactment relating only to procedure would be ultra vires. ANGLIN J.\u2014The only question which arises on this appeal is whether the defendant company is entitled to the benefit of the limitation afforded by sub-section 1 of section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., [1906] ch. 37. The plaintiff\u2019s property was damaged by fire which escaped from the defendants\u2019 right-of-way. The fire was started by the defendants\u2019 servants to consume worn out and discarded ties or sleepers and it is admitted that its escape to the plaintiff\u2019s property was attributable to their negligence. Subject to what is to be said as to the effect of sub-section 4, I am of the opinion, for the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario and Middleton J., that sub-section 1 of section 306 affords a defence to the plaintiff\u2019s action. It should, I think, be presumed that the purpose in view in burning the ties was to discharge the duty of freeing the right-of-way from combustible material imposed on the company by section 297 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d No evidence was given at the trial, the facts being admitted. The learned trial judge proceeded without objection on the assumption that the burning of the ties was in intended fulfilment of the statutory duty of the defendants\u2014with\nan intention to carry on the railway in good faith.\nIn the Appellate Division the judgment proceeds on the same basis of fact and it should not now be departed from. The resultant damages sued for were, therefore, in my opinion, sustained\nby reason of the construction or operation of the railway.\nAlthough the use of fire for the destruction of inflammable material on the right-of-way is not expressly authorized by the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d it is common knowledge that it is a means which is most effici- ent and which it is customary to employ, and I cannot think that its use for that purpose entails liability unless accompanied by negligence which causes injury. No doubt there are other methods of fulfilling the duty imposed by section 297; and it may be that, under some circumstances, the use of fire would be so highly and so obviously dangerous that it would in itself afford prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence. But I am unable to accede to the view that for that reason a railway company in burning old ties on its right-of-way is not discharging a duty imposed by section 297, or that it thereby assumes responsibility of the kind and degree to which the defendant in Rylands v. Fletcher[20] was held to be subject.\nNor does sub-section 4 exclude the application of sub-section 1, of section 306 to the present case as the plaintiff contends. First enacted by 20 Vict. ch. 12, sec. 17, as part of\nAn Act for the Better Prevention of Accidents on Railways.\nthe prototype of sub-section 4 was, of course, confined in its application to the several sections of that statute. They provided for the inspection of railways and reports thereupon to the then Board of Railway Commissioners. The words \u201cunder this Act\u201d and \u201canything in this Act contained\u201d in section 17 had thus a restricted reference. It is scarcely necessary to state that the limitation provision now found in sub-section 1 of section 306 was not a part of chapter 12 of 20 Vict. When the \u201cRailway Act\u201d was consolidated in 1859, as chapter 69 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, section 17 of chapter 12 of 20 Vict. was brought into it as section 190, the words \u201cunder this Act\u201d and \u201cin this Act\u201d being retained, perhaps inadvertently, with the result, if they should be given full effect, that the scope and application of the section was enormously extended. But it still remained one of a group of sections relating to inspections and reports of accidents, and it was so continued through 31 Vict. ch. 68, sec. 40; 42 Vict. ch. 9, sec. 52, and R.S.C., [1886] ch. 109, sec. 80, until the revision of 1888, when it first appears, in chapter 29 of 51 Vict., in proximity to the limitation section, No. 287, yet as a separate section, No. 288, and under the heading,\nCompany not relieved from legal liability by inspection or anything done hereunder.\nAs originally enacted and (substantially) as it stood until 1906 the language of the section was:\u2014\nNo inspection had under this Act nor anything in this Act contained or done or ordered or omitted to be done or ordered under or by virtue of the provisions of this Act shall relieve or be construed to relieve any railway company of or from any liability or responsibility resting upon it by law * * * for anything done or omitted to be done by such company, or for any wrongful act, neglect or default, misfeasance, malfeasance or non-feasance of such company, or in any manner or way to lessen such liability or responsibility or in any way to weaken or diminish the liability or responsibilty of any such company under the existing laws of the province.\nWhen so worded it was still reasonably clear, notwithstanding its presence in the general \u201cRailway Act,\u201d that the section had no reference to the limitation provision, which neither relieved from, lessened, weakened, or diminished any liability or responsibility of the railway company. While it stood as a separate section in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888, this provision was relied upon before the Judicial Committee in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[21], for the proposition that, although Parliament had authorized the use of steam locomotives by railway companies, this section expressly maintained the liability of the company, which it was claimed existed under provincial law, for damages caused by employing such locomotives\nin the ordinary and normal use of the railway\nand without negligence.\nDealing with this argument the Lord Chancellor said (at p. 231):\u2014\nSection 288 is more plausibly argued to have maintained the liability of the company, notwithstanding the statutory permission to use the railway; but if one looks at the heading under which that section is placed, and the great variety of provisions which give ample materials for the operation of that section, it would be straining the words unduly to give it a construction which would make it repugnant, and authorize in one part of the statute what it made an actionable wrong in another. It would reduce the legislation to an absurdity, and their Lordships are of opinion that it cannot be so construed.\nIt was not until 1903 that what is now sub-section 4 was appended to the limitation section as sub-section 3 (3 Edw. VII., ch. 58, sec. 2). It, however, still substantially retained its original form. It was only in the revision of 1906 that it assumed the form in which we now find it:\u2014\nNo inspection had under this Act, and nothing in this Act contained, and nothing done or ordered or omitted to be done or ordered, under or by virtue of the provisions of this Act shall relieve or be construed to relieve, any company of or from, or in anywise diminish or affect any liability resting upon it under the laws in force in the province in which such liability or responsibility arises, etc.\nThe substitution of the word \u201caffect\u201d for the former words \u201clessen or in any way weaken\u201d in my opinion does not alter the applicability or effect of the sub-section. It remains a provision dealing with lia- bility or responsibility. Sub-section 1, on the other hand, does not deal with, or in any way \u201cdiminish or affect\u201d liability or responsibility. Unlike the \u201cReal Property Limitation Act,\u201d but like the \u201cLimitation Act\u201d of King James I. it only bars the remedy by action or suit. The liability remains intact and unaffected and may be made available by the person having a right to indemnity for any damages or injuries sustained if he should have an opportunity to set it up without resort to an action or suit. Wainford v. Barker, 1697[22]; Curwen v. Milburn[23]. With due respect for the draftsmen of 1903 and 1906, sub-section 4 should not be found in the same section with sub-section 1 of section 306. Historically there is no connection between the two; they have no bearing one upon the other; and there collocation is misleading.\nMoreover, having regard to its history and to the view taken of it in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[24], I think sub-section 4 cannot be construed as maintaining or re-establishing a responsibility or liability against which the authorization conferred by section 297, in respect of acts done in the bon\u00e2 fide discharge of the duty which it imposes, affords immunity. Of course the liability for negligence remains; but to that the limitation of sub-section 1 of section 306 must apply unless we should treat sub-section 4 as rendering it nugatory and thus \u201creduce the legislation to an absurdity.\u201d\nThe plaintiff also invoked section 4 of the Ontario \u201cForest Fires\u2019 Prevention Act\u201d (R.S.O., [1897] ch. 267). It was admitted that the fire which caused the damage was set out on or about the 15th of July and that a proclamation had been issued under sub-section 1 declaring the district to be a fire district under the statute. Assuming, in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, that in the burning of ties in the discharge of their duty under section 297 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d the defendant company was subject to this provincial legislation (Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[25], and Grant v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[26]), it does not help him. Section 15 of the \u201cForest Fires\u2019 Prevention Act\u201d was as follows:\u2014\nNothing in this Act shall be held to limit or interfere with the right of a person to bring and maintain a civil action for damages occasioned by fire, and such right shall remain and exist as though this Act had not been passed.\nThe only effect which this legislation could have would be to render it unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove negligence, breach of statutory duty causing damage being his cause of action. But, although the starting of the fire contrary to the provisions of section 4 of the \u201cForest Fires\u2019 Prevention Act\u201d should entail civil responsibility for any injurious consequences, notwithstanding that the defendants were acting in the discharge of their duty under section 297 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d the damages suffered by the plaintiff were nevertheless sustained\nby reason of the construction or operation of the railway,\nand would, therefore, come within sub-section 1 of section 306, which, as already pointed out, does not \u201cin any wise diminish or affect any liability or responsibility under\u201d the provincial statute.\nI am, for these reasons of the opinion that this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action where we have to construe section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which provides that an action or suit for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of a railway shall be commenced within one year next after the time such supposed damage is sustained.\nSome old ties had been removed from respondents\u2019 railway and had been piled to be burned. When they were so burned the fire started over the land of the appellant and he has taken an action for damages more than a year after the damage had been sustained.\nThe respondents claim that this destruction of the ties was, under section 297 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d the fulfilment of a duty imposed by that section.\nThat section 297 provides that the company shall maintain its right-of-way free of dead dried grass, weeds and other unnecessary combustible matter.\nThere is no doubt that those old ties were combustible matter and that they had to be removed from the right-of-way. Was it necessary, however, to burn them, or should they not have been removed in some other way?\nOn that point the evidence is not given, as to the way the track should be kept clear, but the trial judge stated that it was found that it was a custom of the railway company that decayed ties were burned upon the right-of-way. Then if the company was fulfilling a duty which was imposed on it by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d it might be stated that the burning of those ties was part of the operation of the railway and the damage which might be caused as a consequence of the carrying out of that duty should be claimed within one year after the damage had been sustained. It is not, after all, a very serious hardship for those who might claim those damages. The liability of the company under the common law is not restricted because in one case as in the other they are bound to pay the damages which their negligence might cause. The only difference is that in one case it is provided that those damages should be claimed within one year after the damage had been sustained.\nFor these reasons, the judgments of the courts below which applied the Statute of Limitations as enacted by section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d should be confirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William Laidlaw.\nSolicitors for the respondents: MacMurchy & Spence.\n[1] 32 Ont.

Each lease provided that if, on its expiration, the lessor refused to renew he should give notice thereof to the lessee and that valuators should be appointed to value the buildings on the land. Notice was given under each lease and valuators were appointed who, without objection by the lessor\u2019s counsel valued the buildings on the two lots as a whole and fixed $35,000 as the value of them all. In an action by the lessee to recover this amount,\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (32 Ont.

W.N. Tilley for the appellant.\nRowell K.C. and George Kerr for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting) concurred with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an action brought upon two covenants in two separate leases of which respondent is the assignee. The covenant in each was as follows:\nAnd the lessor shall pay or cause to be paid to the lessee the amount so found to be proper to be paid for the said buildings not less than two months before the end of the then expiring term, and in the event of the said value of the said buildings not being paid as aforesaid within the time limited as aforesaid, or in the event of the lessor not having given six months\u2019 notice in writing as aforesaid of his desire that no further term should be granted, and of the lessee having given, five months\u2019 previous to the end of the term hereby granted, notice in writing of his desire that such further term should be granted, it is hereby agreed that the lessee shall be entitled to a renewal of the lease of the said premises for a further term of twenty-one years to be computed from the expiry of the previous term, at the annual rent which shall have been ascertained by the valuators as aforesaid as the proper sum to be paid as the ground rent of the said premises for the following term of twenty-one years, if such term should be granted.\nEach lease had provided by what preceded said covenant that the lessor might give notice of his desire instead of renewal of lease to terminate at the end of the term the relationship of landlord and tenant and then the value of the buildings on the property leased should be valued by a board of valuators.\nIt is in respect of such value of buildings to be so determined that the foregoing covenant was entered into.\nDue notice was given under each of said leases by appellant, the representative of the estate of the orig- inal lessor, and a board was duly constituted under each lease. That board was composed of the same men in each case but the proceedings to constitute the board had of necessity to be separate and independent.\nThe lessor held each parcel covered by said leases under leases from two different estates and his leases had similar though not identical provisions relative to the termination thereof and of repayment for buildings.\nEvery consideration, therefore, bearing upon the questions involved herein, required that though the board might be composed of the same men yet the proceedings under each lease here in question should have been carefully preserved independent of each other.\nBy some remarkable oversight this was not done by the board of valuators, but an award was made by them that treated these separate properties, independent in origin and the personalities concerned therein, as if they had always been one whole. And one sum of $35,000 was found by said award.\nIt so happened that at the time when it became necessary to proceed the persons interested as lessor and lessee respectively of each were the same. But that was not any justification for departing from the frame of the separate notices and other proceedings separating what the board (or rather boards composed of same men) were constituted to determine.\nHad they found separate values and sums due in respect of the buildings upon each parcel and then added them together there might, seeing the party to pay and the party to receive were same, have been no insurmountable objection to the award.\nBut as it stands there clearly was on the face of it no separate valuation upon which the covenant could operate and an action thereon be founded. And the evidence adduced at the trial of this action puts beyond doubt not only the fact that there was none, but also that the valuators entirely misconceived their duty in the premises.\nIt seems they had from the beginning so misconceived the purpose of their appointment that they opened their proceedings on the assumption that they were arbitrators and as such had to hear evidence and determine accordingly. They were, after a remonstrance by appellant\u2019s counsel and discussion of an hour or two, persuaded that such was not the case and that they must act as valuators only.\nOne if not more of them frankly admitted he was not qualified by personal knowledge to discharge such duty. Explanations were given them that they had a right to become informed in such a way as they deemed best.\nIn the course of this discussion they and others concerned allege that the counsel who had appeared for appellant to explain that they must act as valuators and not as arbitrators, led them to believe they could award a lump sum including both the buildings held under each lease. Even if that were so it cannot bind appellant. He denies this so alleged and adds he had no authority to do any such thing. And in this latter regard he stands uncontradicted.\nNo attempt is made to prove such authority, but it is argued he was counsel for the appellant and hence must be held to have had implied authority.\nInasmuch as there was no trial, no judicial proceedings, in which counsel could act as such, the argument seems idle. And even if there had been such a judicial proceeding, counsel could have no implied authority to do any such thing. If it were a mere matter of procedure in such a case counsel might have been held to have implied authority relative to the scope thereof. But it is not matter of procedure. It is a most material substantive right appellant had to be dealt with upon the lines laid down in each of the separate notices under and pursuant to which the valuators were bound to act. They had no power beyond. Nor could they have acquired it except by some binding agreement between the parties fixing or blending into a new consolidated covenant the two independent covenants and the rights arising thereunder.\nAll this seems so clear as matter of law that I do not think the board correctly understood what counsel said and what they were about or they would at once have insisted upon his filing with them a consent by appellant to such a departure from the terms of their two respective appointments.\nThe advantages for the appellant in keeping the two things separate were so obvious that I cannot impute to any lawyer acting for the appellant his intentionally surrendering such advantage.\nThe buildings had been erected under a system of leasing such as adopted and were the separate results of different leases and rights in relation thereto. The buildings had not, as I understand it, been all built at the same time. But by reason of being on adjoining lands they were made in fact to form and to be used as a whole. That was a mere accident which so long as held by same party might secure a more profitable use than if kept separate. That advantage the occupying tenant could rightfully enjoy during the concurrence of the terms and do no injury to the lessor. But at or within a few days of the end of each of the terms, which were approximately but not identically the same, the appellant\u2019s right in one of these parcels ceased. All she could ask from her landlord was to be compensated for the buildings thereon without any such advantage or augmented value incidentally flowing from such antecedent concurrence.\nIf, as suggested or hinted at in argument, she by some one else\u2019s stupidity, escaped the observation of this, and gained thereby, we have nothing to do therewith.\nAgain there was an agreement come to during the proceedings and reduced to writing whereby the valuators were fully relieved from the burden of the other part of the inquiry for which they were appointed and by which they were to determine what would be a proper rental in case of renewal.\nIf there had as alleged been in fact any further waiver or limitation of the duties to be discharged by the board it in all probability would have formed part of that writing. But it did not.\nAnd the insurmountable reply of the appellant to the respondent and to the members of the board is that the written award does not in its recitals pretend to allege any such thing as now set up but proceeds on the original notices; if that is what it means.\nBut does it mean that? Indeed it reads or may be read as if founded only upon one notice. If that was what was present to the valuators\u2019 minds and they in truth had forgotten that there were two different sets of notices and appointments then the whole business has miscarried. In that event clearly there have not been any such valuations as the appointing notices required. In any way one can look at it there seems no escape from the conclusion that there never was such a valuation and finding within the requirements of either covenant as to entitle a recovery thereon.\nSuch a finding and valuation is a condition precedent to the covenant having any operative effect herein unless alternatively in the way I am about to point out as applicable to such a failure of purpose as is apparent.\nI need not therefore enter upon the undesirable features of the case as presented and argued at length. I may be permitted, however, to point out that this is the third or fourth case where we have recently had to consider the duties of valuators, and this is not the first in which suspicions were cast, in argument, upon the manner of conducting the proceedings arising from indiscretion on the part of some of those concerned therein.\nIt is unpleasant to have to deal with such features. To palliate or excuse them tends to lead others to go and do likewise and to needlessly fix blame upon any one by pointing out wherein he has been indiscreet is not desirable. I, therefore, abstain from saying more than is prompted by what the experience of what has transpired in other cases as well as herein and that is that valuators should not listen to one party, or any one acting on his behalf or under him, unless the other is present or is consenting thereto, and it would be safer to keep away from having anything to do with either of such parties pending the inquiry and until the award is signed or otherwise openly declared to both parties.\nAnd when valuators are sworn as they were here I submit, with great respect, none of them can properly be treated as managing or acting for him who has appointed him or them.\nThis appeal should be allowed without costs to either party throughout except the costs of the proceedings up to trial so far as same usefully served the purpose of presenting plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nBut instead of dismissing the action the judgment should be so framed, in accordance with the principle proceeded upon by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Cameron v. Cuddy[2], as to have the value of the buildings in question under each lease determined by a referee to be named by this court or by the court below, unless the parties desire that the same board as originally constituted should proceed to do so.\nIt seems to me having regard to the facts in said case the paragraph therein, at page 656, covers this, as follows:\u2014\nWhen an arbitration for any reason becomes abortive it is the duty of a court of law, in working out a contract of which such an arbitration is part of the practical machinery, to supply the defect which has occurred. It is the privilege of a court in such circumstances and it is its duty to come to the assistance of parties by the removal of the impasse and the extrication of their rights. This rule is in truth founded upon the soundest principle, it is practical in its character, and it furnishes by an appeal to a court of justice the means of working out and of preventing the defeat of bargains between parties. It is unnecessary to cite authority on the subject, but the judgment of Lord Watson in Hamlyn & Co. v. Talisker Distillery[3], might be referred to.\nThat case in which this language is used is alleged to have involved an arbitration and conceivably a distinction may be drawn between a valuation by arbitrators and by valuators. But the language quoted seems applicable in principle, especially when regard is had to the very involved contract before them in that case and to the fact that it was a case of valuation that was in question therein though those to value were designated arbitrators.\nIn that case apparently their Lordships assumed the party concerned might have had another remedy under the contract, and so it seemed to some of us. In this case the very \u201cimpasse\u201d from which the parties\u2019 rights have \u201cto be extricated\u201d seems to render it impossible within the words preceding and forming the foundation of the covenants in the leases to find therein any remedy and hence renders it more imperative than there that the court must act in order that justice be done.\nThe case cited in the above paragraph and much therein suggests there was nothing more therein than the court doing what is done every day in our law unless the arbitration is made a condition precedent to the right of recovery. As I read their Lordships\u2019 language which I quote, in light of the contract they were dealing with, it means much more. It is, to repeat, the very \u201cimpasse\u201d from which the parties\u2019 rights have \u201cto be extricated\u201d that is the pith of the judgment.\nThe agreement filed reduces the question involved, in order that justice may be done, to one of ascertaining in a proper manner the respective values of the buildings in question in each lease.\nThat being obtained the judgment finally should be for the respondent for the aggregate value thereof with all the costs of the reference if directed as I suggest and of entering judgment on the result.\nAfter writing foregoing I modified my opinion as to the disposition of costs. I agreed to the judgment delivered. DUFF J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed. It is necessary in may view to consider only one point.\nThe action is brought upon two distinct covenants in two separate leases. Each provides for the payment of the value of the buildings on the land demised to be ascertained in a certain way. In neither case has that value been ascertained. In fact there is one building, i.e., a building which is a physical unit situated partly on the land demised by one lease and partly on that demised by the other, and it is the value of this building as a whole that has been ascertained. That sum cannot be recovered under either or both of the covenants for the simple reason that both the obligations and the accessory rights of action are distinct and independent. The obligation in each case is to pay a sum \u201cproper to be paid\u201d in respect of the buildings on the land demised by the lease in which the covenant appears which sum is to be ascertained by a valuation to be made in the prescribed manner. There is no such valuation in respect of buildings upon either parcel demised, and the condition the essential term that there shall be such a valuation is not purged by the production of a valuation of such buildings plus something else.\nThe judgment at the trial was not really based upon these covenants at all.\nIn substance the learned trial judge proceeded on the view that the appellant was \u201cestopped\u201d from taking this objection that the covenants were separate.\nI think probably by this the learned trial judge means that the appellants are estopped by Millar\u2019s conduct from denying the existence of an agreement to pay the amount of the valuation. I think the learned judge himself holds that Millar never intended to enter into such an agreement; and I think it does not appear that Millar understood that the other parties thought he was entering into such an agreement or that they in fact thought so. If they had thought so and intended to rely upon it is difficult to suppose that they would not have put the agreement in writing. My strong impression is, and indeed I think it is the proper conclusion, that Mr. Kerr thought the course taken was strictly regular and the Appellate Division has upheld his view. I think he was wrong and that this action as framed fails.\nI say nothing of the charge of misconduct except this: Assuming Mr. Garland\u2019s honesty to be unimpeachable he has himself to thank for the suspicions which his conduct aroused.\nIt does not follow that the respondent should be dismissed empty handed. I agree with my brother Idington in thinking that the principle of Cameron v. Cuddy[4] applies, and I concur in his proposal as to the disposition of the appeal.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014Except in regard to the objection that, as the respondent\u2019s building occupied two parcels of land held under separate leases and notice was given for a distinct valuation under each lease, the valuators should have made two distinct valuations and should not have fixed one sum to be paid for the building as a whole, which seems to require further consideration, I fully concur in the disposition made of this case in the provincial courts. That the leases provided for a valuation and not for an arbitration is res judicata between the parties, Re Irwin and Campbell[5].\nNotwithstanding Mr. Tilley\u2019s ingenious and plausible argument, it is quite clear that there was no ground for his attack on the valuator Garland (nominated by his own client) as a person illegally biased for the respondent and interested in his success. There was no connection of any kind between Garland and the respondent until after the valuators had determined upon, and communicated to the parties, the amount of their valuation; Re Underwood and Bedford and Cambridge Railway Co.[6]; and, while it is to be regretted that relations between them arose before the valuation was formerly completed, they were probably of such a character as would not have affected the validity of the valuation had they arisen earlier. Drew v. Drew[7]. There is nothing whatever to suggest that Garland was subject to any improper influence in making the valuation.\nThe obtaining from the respondent, probably in the absence of any representative of the appellant, of a statement of the lowest value which he would place on his building, though indiscreet, would appear to have been within the right of the valuators if, indeed, it was not something which was warranted by the views that had been expressed to them by the appellant\u2019s solicitor as to the scope of their duties and the methods by which they should be discharged. At all events it is quite clear upon the evidence of all three valuators that, as the direct result of their having re- ceived the respondent\u2019s statement, the figure at which they made their valuation was lower by several thousand dollars than it otherwise would have been. Of that the appellant cannot very well complain.\nI am also satisfied that the appellant had every reasonable opportunity to furnish the valuators with such information as her solicitor thought it was in her interest that they should have. If he omitted to call an expert witness to answer the statements made by Waggett and Pickard as to the value of the building it was because the opinion of the expert Smith whom he consulted, if communicated to the valuators, would have confirmed the estimates of Waggett and Pickard.\nSmith\u2019s opinion was communicated to Garland, the valuator chosen by the appellant, but not to the other valuators, and it goes far to establish that the valuation in appeal was not excessive.\nIn fine, no case has been made for impeaching the valuation on any ground of bias, interest, unfairness or misconduct. There is perhaps a little more difficulty in the question whether the valuation of the building as a whole can be sustained.\nIt cannot, in my opinion, be supported on the consent given by counsel for the appellant. Without at all suggesting wilful falsehood on the part of Mr. Millar, I feel bound to accept the finding of fact in that portion of the judgment of the learned trial judge in which he says:\u2014\nThe witnesses who testified upon this question are all men of unassailable integrity, men in whom I would place implicit credit. But, unfortunately, there is a clear conflict of testimony upon this one point, and I only conclude that there is an unintentional mistake somewhere. There is a strong preponderance of testimony to the effect that it was distinctly understood and agreed by all parties that this building should be valued as one building\u2014\u201cas a whole,\u201d as it is expressed. The defendant must abide by this. Moreover, Mr. Millar was present when the valuation was formally executed by the valuators. He knew that it was a single valuation of the building as a whole and he took no exception to this course being followed. He had apparently instructed his own expert, Smith, to value the building as a whole. Indeed his conduct throughout the proceedings is consistent only with his knowledge of, and assent to, what the valuators were doing.\nBut while I think, with respect, that this conclusion of fact should not have been disturbed on appeal, I incline to think the view that neither as counsel in this non-litigious and extracurial matter; 2 Hals. L. of E., 241; nor as solicitor, Chinnock v. Marchioness of Ely[8], could Mr. Millar, without express authority, of which there is no evidence, by his consent bind his client to forego any substantial advantage which she might derive from the making of separate valuations under the two leases. In the view I take, however, it is unnecessary to determine this question.\nIt was, no doubt, the right of the appellant, but for the circumstances to which I shall presently allude, to have had a separate valuation under each of the leases. If the result of making separate valuations of the two parts of the building would have been substantially more advantageous to her than that reached by valuing the building as a whole, she would, in my opinion, be entitled to have the valuation which has been made treated as invalid and ineffectual. But I think in the present case there would have been no material difference between the result of the two methods of valuation such as would render that course necessary. In delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division Mr. Justice Hodgins says:\u2014\nI am not impressed with the idea, only faintly developed in the evidence, that this severance really destroys the usefulness of the building. It is admitted that the store can be reconstructed at a reasonable cost, and an examination of the plans filed shews that 14 feet is sufficient to provide for a store and an independent entrance as well.\nIf this view be sound the difference in the net result between the valuation of the building as a whole and separate valuations of its two component parts would be the cost of the alterations necessary to permit of each part being used as a separate building.\nBut there is another aspect of this case which indicates that even this difference did not in fact exist. The appellant was acquiring both parts of the building and she was obtaining it intact and as a whole. The possibility of her being able to arrange with her immediate landlords to obtain the benefit of holding or disposing of the building as a whole was something which the valuators would properly take into account. Although they are expropriation cases, I see no good reason why the principle underlying the decisions in Re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[9], and Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[10], should not be applicable to a valuation between a tenant and his landlord who is taking over the tenant\u2019s building on the expiry of a lease, subject, however, to this important difference that, in the case of the expired lease, it is not, as in expropriation proceedings (as the cases cited shew), the value of the property to the person relinquishing it which is to be fixed, but its value to the landlord, who is the party taking it over, or to his incoming tenant. Of course that value must include the potentialities of the property in the landlord\u2019s hands and where he has already made the realization of a potentiality a certainty for himself I can see no reason why the valuation should not proceed on the basis of such potentiality having been realized, since it is the value of the building to him that is to be fixed\u2014\u201cthe amount proper to be paid by the lessor to the lessee for the building.\u201d There is some evidence\u2014slight, no doubt, but I think sufficient\u2014that the appellant had succeeded in advantageously disposing of the building as a whole before the valuation proceedings now under review took place. This fact, asserted and not seriously disputed at bar, appears to have been known to all parties and it probably accounts for Mr. Millar\u2019s readiness\u2014otherwise, as Mr. Justice Hodgins points out, difficult to understand\u2014to consent to a single valuation of the building as a whole, which he seems afterwards to have forgotten so completely. The value of each part of the building to the appellant was not that of a portion which might have to be severed and dealt with independently, but that of a part destined to continue to be used, so far as she was concerned, as a portion of the building as a whole. The sum of the value to the appellant of the two component parts of the building erected respectively on the two parcels of leasehold land must under these circumstances have equalled the value of the building as a whole.\nI would, for these reasons, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kerr, Bull, Shaw, Montgomery & Edge.\n[1] 32 Ont.

In this case it was not proved that the officer signing the contract was empowered to do so, and as the company was not authorized to deal in real estate the transaction was not one within the apparent scope of his authority. The contract was, therefore, not binding on the company.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (31 Ont.

The action was for specific performance of a contract by which the appellants had agreed to sell to respondents their business premises which were not large enough for their requirements. Two main questions raised on the appeal were\u2014Was the contract void because the seal of the company was not affixed thereto? Had Douglas, who signed the contract for the company as secretary-treasurer, authority to do so? Both questions were decided against the company in the courts below.\nHellmuth K.C. and R.S.

(dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario maintaining a judgment against appellant company for specific performance.\nThe appellant is a company incorporated under the \u201cOntario Companies\u2019 Act\u201d \u201cfor building sewers and so on,\u201d and in February, 1913, owned a piece of land used as a storage yard for the purpose of carrying on that business for which the company was incorporated.\nDouglas, one of the appellants, was secretary-treasurer of the company. The respondents made in writing an offer of purchase of said land, addressed to said company and signed by the respondents.\nThat was accepted by the following writing at foot of said offer:\u2014\nI hereby accept the above offer and its terms, and covenant, promise and agree to and with the said to duly carry out the same on the terms and conditions above mentioned.\nDated A.D. 19\nJ.H. MCKNIGHT CONSTRUCTION CO., LIMITED.\nWitness:\n................................... W.E. Douglas, Sec. Treas.\nThis offer apparently had been prepared by Douglas and enclosed to one of respondents in a letter to him of the 21st February and was signed apparently by Douglas, per M. J. It read as follows:\u2014\nI am enclosing herewith an offer to purchase made out on the terms we discussed. You will notice that we are not required to give up possession until April 16th.\nAs I told you, Mr. McKnight is out of town and will not be back till late in April, so that we will not be able to get his signature until then, but that need not make any difference in the transfer as far as you are concerned, it can go ahead and he can sign the necessary papers when he returns.\nIf you will sign this offer and return it with a cheque for $100 I will sign a copy for you. At foot of this letter one of respondents signed his name and following that is a receipt of cheque for 100 signed \u201cW.E.D.\u201d\nIn the body of the offer appears the following:\u2014\nThis offer is to be accepted by February 22nd, 1913, otherwise void; and sale to be completed on or before the 10th day of March, 1913. Possession of the said premises is to be given me, April 16th, 1913.\nThis letter with its footing and the offer and apparent acceptance thereof might, I think, be read together, as the signing thereof toy J.A. Vansickler could have been done for no other purpose than that they should be so read.\nThe above words,\nsale to be completed on or before the 10th day of March, 1913,\nin light of such reading and the surrounding facts and circumstances certainly never were intended by the parties to mean what is usually meant thereby, but so far as was possible of completion consistent with the absence of McKnight.\nI should, therefor (but for what I am about to refer to) have no difficulty in treating the contract as ended when appellants refused to complete it so far as it could be in such absence, and I have no doubt, would have been, but for the unfortunate absence of one of respondents\u2019 solicitors who knew the parties.\nIn my view of the case, however, it is needless to go through all that transpired relative to that phase of the business. I am inclined to think the appellant Douglas, if he had any authority, waived, by what happened later, the right to maintain this answer to the suit.\nNor do I think that the mere absence of the corporate seal is in itself fatal to the validity of the con- tract by a corporate company either to sell or buy land. It might well be that some officer of the company duly authorized to sign such a contract could bind it without affixing the corporate seal. Or, indeed, it might well be that the officer of the company duly entrusted with the power to affix the seal might, in conceivable cases, bind the company to some one else by using the seal, though exceeding his actual authority, yet using it in a way he had been held out as entitled to use it.\nBut there is a sense in which, as mere matter of argument illustrative of the question of authority to form a contract, the cases of the need for a seal may be serviceable. The ordinary every\u2011day contract in which of necessity as it were a corporate seal is dispensed with has some analogy to the law applicable to measure the authority of an agent contracting on behalf of the company he represents himself to be acting for.\nBeyond that I cannot see that the mere absence of the corporate seal is of any consequence. The contract may be of such an unusual character for the company to enter into that he dealing with the company may in law by the absence of a seal be put upon his guard to inquire why the transaction has not been sanctioned by use of the seal which at common law was the usual method by which a company had to speak in order to bind itself.\nIt is not, however, upon such subleties that the case for appellant must needs rest or the decision thereof turn.\nThe issues to be determined are whether or not the contract in question was within the scope of the actual or ostensible or apparent authority of Douglas as the secretary-treasurer of the appellant company. It was in his capacity of secretary-treasurer he professed to act. As such he had no authority to sell the company\u2019s land.\nThe Act under which the company was incorporated directs that the affairs of the company shall be managed by a board of directors; that, except as therein provided, no business of a company shall be transacted by its directors unless at a meeting of directors at which a quorum is present; that the directors may pass by-laws not contrary to law or the letters patent to regulate many specified things, and generally the conduct in all other particulars of the affairs of the company and, that such by-laws must be confirmed by the shareholders at or prior to next annual meeting or become thereafter null.\nThese general provisions any one dealing with a company is supposed to know and observe at his peril. If dealing with a minor officer of the company he is also supposed to know what powers that officer has by by-law passed as aforesaid to enter upon any unusual transaction.\nThe respondents have failed to point out anything in such by-laws enabling the secretary-treasurer to execute the contract in question, or anything duly and regularly done by the directors relative to such contract which would warrant the secretary-treasurer, as such, signing on their behalf.\nIn any way I can look at the matter it seems clear there was no actual authority duly conferred upon any one to make the said contract.\nThe by-laws provided that the directors from time to time might appoint one of their body to be managing director of the company, but I cannot find any by-law defining his duties. And when the directors made an appointment they did not observe this, but appointed McKnight \u201cgeneral manager of the company at a salary of $416.66 per month\u201d and ante-dated the appointment by nearly three months.\nAt the same time W.E. Douglas was appointed by a motion seconded by himself, assistant general manager of the company at a salary of $208.33 per month. I cannot find any by-law or anything else indicating what his duties were to be as such. Now, do these nominations supply the authority, and how?\nI repeat it was as secretary-treasurer Douglas professed to act and I fail to see how his being something else, undefined, and unauthorized to do anything specifically within the legal powers of that something else, or what might be presumed such, can help.\nBut it is said McKnight was president and general manager and he authorized the contract to be entered into. But what authority had he, to begin with? I cannot find he had any. And it seems quite clear he could not delegate even such powers as he possessed.\nThe board might have substituted some one else for him in his absence to act and the board might have acted directly in the matter. It did neither. Hence in all these suggestions I can find no actual authority in law for Douglas acting as secretary-treasurer and thereby binding the said company by signing said contract as he did.\nThen did he act within the ostensible or apparent scope of his authority in making the contract? I submit he clearly did not. If this company had been formed with one of its objects to be the dealing in real estate, then the matter would have been very simple. Either his position as secretary-treasurer or assistant manager of such a corporation might well have implied authority to sell real estate, for that would be its business. Or had he entered into a contract for constructing a sewer involving ten times as much as involved herein, his company might have been held so bound if he had been, to the knowledge of the company, accustomed to have so acted in contracting on its behalf. But there is not the shadow of pretence for saying that either the president or the secretary-treasurer of the appellant company had ever sold or been expected to sell the real estate of the company. So far as we are informed this is the only piece of real estate the company ever had and that was in use by the company for the due execution of the purposes of the company as a builder of sewers, etc.\nThe analogous case presented in argument of a bank agent selling the business stand where his bank is carrying on business seemed to me much in point.\nThe proposal to do so would so shock one\u2019s sense of propriety that any one seriously making such a proposal would be treated as a fool or a madman. Yet wherein is the difference? There is none in the law governing the bank agent any more than the manager of a sewer construction company who is apparently the agent for the purpose of executing the contracts within and necessary to transact the ordinary business of the company, just as the bank agent or manager is such, but by no means apparently authorized to sell out its business stand.\nThe cases cited by counsel for respondents are all distinguishable from this by applying the true test of the apparent scope of authority of the agent. When as here he goes beyond that, his express authority must be shewn and in that regard as already pointed out the respondent fails.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the action dismissed.\nNor do I think the claim against Douglas personally is maintainable. The mistake is one of law for which respondents are quite as much to blame as he.\nAn agent is not bound for a mistake in law as to the scope of his authority: see Beattie v. Lord Ebury[9]. And still less if possible for mutual mistake of law. See Eaglesfield v. Marquis of Londonderry[10].\nThe cross-appeal should also be, therefore, dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Appellate Division delivered by Mr. Justice Clute. It is not necessary to add anything whatever to the very complete discussion of the points raised which is to be found in that judgment. Contentions were advanced, however, on part of the appellant which raised two questions of general importance in respect of which it is perhaps desirable to express one\u2019s views of the principle involved.\nThe first point is as to the authority of the secretary-treasurer. This point, although apparently taken in the court of appeal, was not taken in the appellant\u2019s factum and was I think advanced during the oral argument here on the invitation of the Bench. I am not surprised at this because on examining the record, there appears to be ample evidence that the secretary-treasurer was the apparent agent of the company for the transaction of the kind of business he undertook to do. That being so, the case is within the principle very satisfactorily stated in Palmer\u2019s Company Law, 9th ed., 1911, p. 44, in the following words:\u2014\nThis rule is that where a company is regulated by an Act of Parliament, general or special, or by a deed of settlement or memorandum and articles registered in some public office, persons dealing with the company are bound to read the Act and registered documents, and to see that the proposed dealing is not inconsistent therewith; but they are not bound to do more; they need not inquire into the regularity of the internal proceedings\u2014what Lord Hatherley called \u201cthe indoor management.\u201d They are entitled to assume that all is being-done regularly. See also Mahony v. East Holyford Mining Co.[11]; Bargate v. Shortridge[12]; In re Land Credit Co. of Ireland[13]; In re County Life Assurance Co.[14]; Premier Industrial Bank v. Carlton Manufacturing Co.[15], is not easily reconcileable with the rule.\nThis rule is based on the principle of convenience, for business could not be carried on if a person dealing with the apparent agents of a company was compelled to call for evidence that all internal regulations had been duly observed.\nThe next point turns upon the absence of the company\u2019s seal. This question may be disposed of by a reference to the decisions of the Court of Exchequer and the Exchequer Chamber in South of Ireland Colliery Co. v. Waddell[16]. The following passage from the judgment of Bovill C.J., at page 469, is cited by Sir Frederick Pollock (Contracts, 8th ed., p. 156), as stating the law upon the point. And it may be observed that the judgment of Bovill C.J. had the express approval of the Exchequer Chamber in the same case (at page 618) where Cockburn C.J., said, speaking for the court (of which Willes J. was a member):\u2014\nIt is unnecessary to say more than that we entirely concur in the reasoning and the authority of the cases referred to in the judgment of Bovill C.J. which seems to exhaust the subject. The passage in the judgment of Bovill C.J. which seems to me to conclude argument upon this point is as follows:\u2014\nThese exceptions apply to all contracts by trading corporations entered into for the purposes for which they are incorporated. A company can only carry on business by agents, managers and others; and if the contracts made by these persons are contracts which relate to objects and purposes of the company, and are not inconsistent with the rules and regulations which govern their acts (n), they are valid and binding upon the company, though not under seal. It has been urged, that the exceptions to the general rule are still limited to matters of frequent occurrence and small importance. The authorities, however, do not sustain the argument.\nI may add that the decision in Waddle\u2019s Case[17] is over fifty years old and it is, of course, perfectly well known that the business of trading companies has now for many years been conducted on the assumption (based upon the observations of the learned judges who decided that case) that such corporations may express their consent in a binding manner to contracts within the scope of their business in the same way as an individual may do, provided that no statutory provision or regulation affecting them is infringed or departed from.\nTo break in upon this rule at this date by accepting the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant, would be as Cockburn C.J. says, to give life to a relic of barbarity and so far as I can see with no other effect than to put unnecessary obstacles in the way of the transacting of ordinary business.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With Riddell J., who tried this action,\nI do not find anything * * * in the documents which necessitates the payment by the plaintiffs of the amount ($1,400) until such time as the sale was completed. I have no doubt that by the completion of the sale was meant the delivery of a conveyance and transfer of possession of the property. The evidence establishes that the defendants made default both as the conveyance and as to possession. They acknowledged their inability to give possession when the plaintiffs, shortly after the date fixed by the agreement for completion, offered to pay the $1,400 if given possession and to accept a solicitor\u2019s undertaking for the subsequent delivery of a deed. The evidence lends some support to the view that the plaintiffs knew before they made the agreement that there would probably be delay in the execution of the conveyance, and they, therefore, may have contemplated payment of the $1,400 on the date named for completion of the sale, although the vendors might not then be able to deliver a deed of the property. But there is not a tittle of evidence to warrant a suggestion that they had agreed to pay the $1,400, although the vendors should be unable to deliver possession of the premises.\nWhile I think the defendants have failed, on the admissible evidence, to prove an agreement by the plaintiffs to pay the $1,400 before receiving a deed, the evidence of Mr. Dods makes it quite clear that the real cause of the delay in the completion of the sale was not that the plaintiffs were insisting on delivery of a deed contemporaneously with their payment of the $1,400, but that the defendants were not ready to transfer possession of the property. That certainly was the situation from the 20th of March until the 20th of May, when for the first time the defendants sought to escape from their contract on the pretext of delay on the part of the plaintiffs in the payment of the $1,400, although, as Mr. Dods\u2019s uncontradicted evidence shews, he had informed the defendants of his client\u2019s readiness to pay this money on the 20th of March and the subsequent delay had been at the instance of the defendants\u2019 own solicitor. Assuming a contract binding on the defendants, I have no hesitation in affirming the holding that the default in carrying it out was entirely theirs and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of specific performance.\nThe defendants, however, maintain that there was not a contract binding upon them\u2014(a) because the assistant general manager, Douglas, who, on their behalf, signed the acceptance of the plaintiffs\u2019 offer to purchase, did so without authority; and (b), because the seal of the company was not affixed to the document.\n(a) There can be no question of the company\u2019s right to hold and to dispose of this real estate (2 Geo. V. ch. 31, sec. 23, and sec. 24(b)), nor is there room for doubt as to the power of the directors to make a contract such as that in question. (Ibid., sec. 82.) The property had been acquired for and used as the business premises of the company. It had become too small for their needs and it had been decided to dispose of it in order to permit of more suitable premises being purchased. The sale was, therefore, arranged for in the course of the management of the company\u2019s affairs. By section 87 (e) of the statute directors are empowered to pass by-laws providing for the conduct of the affairs of the company, and, by section 86 to elect a president and vice-president and to appoint all officers of the company. Under these statutory provisions by-laws were passed by this company as follows:\u2014 20. The directors may from time to time appoint one of their body to be managing director of the company.\n22. The directors may from time to time entrust to and confer upon the managing director such of the powers exercisable under these by-laws by the directors as they may think fit.\n34. In case of the absence of any officer of the company the Board of Directors or President may delegate his powers or duties to any other officer or to any director for the time being.\nThe election of Mr. McKnight as president and his appointment as general manager and that of Mr. Douglas as assistant general manager are duly proven. I attach no importance to the fact that in the resolution for the appointment of Mr. McKnight he is styled general manager instead of managing director. The appointment was undoubtedly intended to be made under by-law No. 20.\nOn the evidence it is quite clear that the sale to the plaintiffs was arranged by them with Mr. McKnight and was discussed by him with his co-directors, who approved of it at least informally. Being obliged to leave the city Mr. McKnight, as president, delegated to Mr. Douglas authority to carry out the transaction and to prepare and execute a contract of sale with the plaintiffs. With the learned trial judge, I think,\nthat Douglas did draw up a document which was precisely what had been arranged by the parties and that document was one, therefore, which he had the right and the power to draw and afterwards to sign.\nFor any lack of formality in the steps leading to the authorization of Douglas the plaintiffs should not suffer. They were not called upon to ascertain that proper steps had been taken to clothe him with authority to execute the contract with them on behalf of the company. They acted with perfect good faith. The power which Douglas purported to exercise was such as, under the constitution of the company, he might possess, and\nthat is enough for a person dealing with him bon\u00f4 fide.\nBiggerstaff v. Rowatt\u2019s Wharf[18]; Premier Industrial Bank v. Carlton Manufacturing Co.[19] On the evidence I incline to think that the proper inference is that Douglas was in fact clothed with authority to bind the company by an agreement such as he made: but, if not, it is clear that under the statutory powers of the directors and the by-laws of the company provision was made for vesting such authority in an officer holding his position, and, as against third parties dealing with such an officer in good faith in regard to a matter in respect of which authority could be so conferred upon him, the company cannot be heard to deny his power to bind it. Totterdell v. Fareham Blue Brick and Tile Co.[20]\n(b) Nor does the absence of its corporate seal afford a defence to the company.\nI am, with respect, unable to accept the view which prevailed in the Appellate Division that section 139 of the \u201cOntario Companies\u2019 Act\u201d (2 Geo. V. ch. 31) applies to the execution of contracts or other instruments. It deals only with the \u201cauthentication\u201d of documents, not with formalities of execution. The substitution in revision of the more compendious word \u201cdocument\u201d for the particular words \u201cwrit, notice, order\u201d formerly used did not change the character of that for which the section provides, namely, authentication as distinguished from execution. The word \u201cauthentication\u201d has the same meaning in the revised Act which it bore in the former \u201cCompanies\u2019 Act\u201d\u2014the same meaning which it has in the corresponding section of the English \u201cCompanies\u2019 Consolidation Act of 1908\u201d\u20148 Edw. VII. ch. 69, sec. 117.\nBut the defendant company is a trading company.\n\u201cThe general result of those cases,\u201d says Wightman J., in Henderson v. Australian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Co.[21],\nseems to me to be that, whenever a contract is made with reference to the purposes of the incorporation, it may, if the corporation be a trading one, be enforced, though not under seal.\nAs put by Bovill C.J. in South of Ireland Colliery Co. v. Waddle[22]:\u2014\nOriginally all contracts by corporations were required to be under seal. From time to time certain exceptions were introduced, but these for a long time had reference only to matters of trifling importance and frequent occurrence, such as the hiring of servants, and the like. But, in progress of time as new descriptions of corporations came into existence, the courts came to consider whether these exceptions ought not to be extended in the case of corporations created for trading and other purposes. At first, there was considerable conflict; and it is impossible to reconcile all the decisions on the subject. But it seems to me that the exceptions created by the recent cases are now too firmly established to be questioned by the earlier decisions which, if inconsistent with them, must I think be held not to be law. These exceptions apply to all contracts by trading corporations entered into for the purposes for which they are incorporated. A company can only carry on business by agents\u2014managers and others; and if the contracts made by these persons are contracts which relate to objects and purposes of the company, and are not inconsistent with the rules and regulations which govern their acts, they are valid and binding upon the company, though not under seal. It has been urged that the exceptions to the general rule are still limited to matters of frequent occurrence and small importance. The authorities, however, do not sustain that argument.\nThe contract there in question was for the purchase of machinery required for the company\u2019s under- taking. Here the contract is for the sale of unsuitable business premises in order to enable the company to acquire premises more commodious and better adapted for its purposes. Adopting the language of Erle J. in the Henderson Case[23],\nthe contract was made for a purpose directly connected with the object of the incorporation.\nThat able judge added:\u2014\nI think myself that it is most inexpedient that corporations should be able to hold out to persons dealing with them the semblance of a contract, and then repudiate it because not under seal.\nThe decision of the Court of Common Pleas in the South of Ireland Colliery Co. v. Waddle was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber[24], where Cockburn C.J. said that the court had been\ninvited to re-introduce a relic of barbarous antiquity,\nand the reasoning of Bovill C.J. was unqualifiedly approved. An observation of Chatterton V.C., in Holmes v. Trench[25], cited by Mr. Justice Clute:\u2014\nIt is true that a corporation may contract without seal for the purchase or sale of property necessary for carrying on the business for which the corporation was created,\nis directly in point, and, although merely a dictum, is in accord with the tendency of modern decisions relating to the contracts of trading corporations and within the principle on which those decisions rest.\nThe defences set up in this action are purely technical and devoid of merit. It is gratifying to find that the law warrants our sustaining a conclusion which is in accord with the demands of substantial justice.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: R.F.

L. Smith\u201d was ascending the River St. Clair having in tow the barge \u201cChinook,\u201d the two being engaged in the business of their common owner. The \u201cChinook\u201d having no propelling power nor steering apparatus the navigation was controlled by the officers and crew of the tug, the tow being attached by a line fifteen feet long. They kept on the American side and the \u201cSmith\u201d sheered and collided with a barge being towed down, causing it to sink.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court (15 Ex C.R. 111), Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the tug and tow must be regarded as one ship and each was liable for the consequences of the collision. The \u201cAmerican\u201d and the \u201cSyria\u201d (L.R. 6 P.C. 127) discussed and distinguished.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that as the \u201cChinook\u201d took no part in the navigation, and there being no master and servant relationship between her and the \u201cSmith,\u201d she should not be held liable.\nShortly after the collision the owner brought action in a United States court to limit the liability of the \u201cSmith\u201d and the extent of her liability was fixed at $1,500. Later the two ships were seized in Canadian waters, taken into a Canadian port and released on receipt of a bond by a guarantee company conditioned to pay any amount awarded against either or both. The action in rem was then proceeded with, resulting in both ships being condemned. Held, that the proceedings in the United States did not oust the Canadian court of jurisdiction.\nHeld, per Idington J.\u2014The defendants are not entitled to limitation of the damages under United States or Canadian statutes, the same not having been pleaded nor any evidence of it produced.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014As the collision occurred in the domestic waters of the foreign ship held at fault the extent of her liability must be determined by the lex loci commissi delicti, and the damages should be limited to the value of the \u201cSmith\u201d immediately after the collision.\nHeld per Duff J. following the \u201cDictator\u201d ([1892] P. 304) and the \u201cGemma\u201d ([1899] P. 285), that as the owners appeared and contested the liability of the ships they became parties to the action and subject to have personal judgment pronounced against them for the amount of damages properly recoverable for the negligence of their servants. The trial judge having held, on the sole issue of fact raised at the trial, that the \u201cSmith,\u201d as between her and the \u201cMoyles,\u201d was solely to blame, the appellant owners were prim\u00e2 facie liable for the full amount of damages suffered. Assuming, however, that if the \u201cChinook\u201d was free from blame, they were entitled to the benefit of the United States laws limiting their liability to the value of the offending res, then, as this issue was not raised or tried in the Exchequer Court, they could only succeed if the facts in evidence conclusively demonstrated the innocence of the \u201cChinook\u201d or, in other words, that the \u201cSmith\u201d and \u201cChinook\u201d were not identified for the purpose of assigning liability, the question of identification being a question of fact depending upon the particular circumstances.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Toronto Admiralty District[1], in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe questions raised for decision on the appeal were\u2014Whether or not the Exchequer Court was competent to try the case in view of proceedings previously taken in the United States where the defendant ships were registered; if there was jurisdiction whether or not the defendants were entitled to limitation of liability under the Canadian or British \u201cShipping Act\u201d; and, the liability of the \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d not being disputed whether or not the \u201cChinook\u201d was also liable. The facts on which the decision of these several questions depend are stated in the head-note.\nA. R. Bartlett for the appellants.\nRodd for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Mr. Justice Anglin in his judgment deals so fully and learnedly with the facts and the law of this case that I shall be content to say briefly why, much to my regret, it is impossible for me to agree in his conclusions.\nAll the cases will be found conveniently collected in Halsbury, vol. 26, page 527, and following.\nIt seems now to be accepted as settled law that for all purposes of their joint navigation a tug and tow are one ship in contemplation of law (Vide The \u201cNiobe\u201d[2]) and that in an ordinary contract of towage a tug is under the control of the tow and must usually obey the direction given her by those in charge of the tow (The \u201cRobert Dixon,\u201d 1879[3]), but no general rule can be laid down on the subject. Each case must be decided upon its own facts (The \u201cQuickstep,\u201d 1890[4], at page 200). It would appear, however, that where the governing power and the navigation are wholly in the vessel towing, the tow is not responsible for the tug\u2019s negligence. Compare Steamer \u201cDevonshire\u201d v. Barge Leslie[5]; The W. H. No. 1 and the \u201cKnight Errant\u201d[6].\nThere can be no doubt that the circumstances of this case are quite exceptional. This is not a case of towage for hire nor is it a salvage case. Both the defendant ships belong to the same owners and were at the time of the collision being jointly navigated for their benefit by the same crew. The servants of the owners on board the tug had possession and control of\nthe tow by their authority. It is true that the governing power and the navigation were in the hands of the tug, but the carrying capacity upon which the profit of their joint exploitation depended was in the tow.\nFor the purpose of economy or expediency the tow was fastened to the tug in such a way as to constitute both a danger to other vessels navigating the same waters. Upon what principle of law or reason can the owner of the tow escape liability in the case of a collision attributable immediately to the tug and mediately to the tow? The tug came directly into contact with the barge \u201cHustler\u201d and caused the damage. And we are all agreed that she is liable. But I think it is very satisfactorily established on the evidence that the collision is attributable to the defective steering of the \u201cSmith\u201d due (a) to the condition in which the barge was by reason of the absence of proper ballast; (b) the absence of a bridle and the short tow line used to keep the boats together. There was a steering gear on board the tow, but it was not in use and her movements were directed by the tug, hence the necessity for the short tow line, which latter embarrassed the movements of the tug and caused the sheering which in part at least contributed to the collision. In those facts we have the defective steering of the tug\u2014due to the tow\u2014and the collision in the relation of cause and effect. Captain Allen, of the \u201cSmith,\u201d explains that the steering apparatus of the \u201cChinook\u201d was not in use and that the short tow line was preferable to a bridle for steering purposes. He also admits that the tow would affect the steering of the tug, not to the extent proved by the witnesses on the other side, but sufficiently to cause her to sheer four or five feet. On the other hand the libellant\u2019s witnesses say (Heddrich) the sheer might be about twenty feet. Hunter says\nthat the tug was tripped with the scow, that the bow of the scow was holding the stern of the tug,\nand he also says at other places in his examination and cross-examination that this was the result of using the short line, and in that condition may be found the explanation, in part at least, of the collision. I cannot on the facts come to any other conclusion than that the tug must be considered as being in the service of the tow and identified with her for many purposes. It is quite true that the trial judge finds the \u201cSmith\u201d solely to blame, but that finding must be read in connection with his previous statement, as to the way in which the sheering of the \u201cSmith\u201d was affected by the \u201cChinook.\u201d\nI have not, of course, overlooked the observation made in The \u201cAmerican\u201d and, The \u201cSyria\u201d[7], that the question of liability is not affected because the tug and tow are the property of the same owners. But that case is on the facts so clearly distinguishable from this that I do not think undue importance should be attached to what their Lordships said in that connection. To create in a case of collision a maritime lien enforceable by a proceeding in rem the damage must be done mediately or immediately by the ship proceeded against; Currie v. M\u2019Knight[8]; otherwise the fact of mere physical connection or of joint ownership does not create or affect liability and that is all that is decided in The \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d[9]. In that case the master of the \u201cAmerican\u201d appears to have undertaken to tow the \u201cSyria\u201d under circum-stances quite exceptional which are fully explained in the report at page 133. Here we have two vessels necessarily connected for the purpose of the particular business in which both were engaged for the benefit of their common owner and both in the possession and under the control of the same crew for all the purposes of their navigation. As a result of the way in which that navigation was carried on, a collision occurred to which both vessels contributed. I fail to see how we can distinguish between the vessels.\nA question arises out of the proceedings taken in the courts of the United States to limit liability which, in view of the conclusion to which I have come, I am relieved from the necessity of deciding. I may, however, observe that the proceeding instituted in the foreign court was not a bar to the jurisdiction of the courts of this country, nor did it operate as a stay of the proceedings unless based on an admission of liability. It is not necessary, of course, in this country, that the owner should admit liability before beginning the limitation proceedings, but liability must be admitted before a decree can be obtained (26 Halsbury, page 616, No. 971, and cases there cited). Those who are interested in this branch of the case will find Jenkins v. Great Central Railway Co.[10] instructive (26 Halsbury, 614, note). See also Albany Law Journal. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the opinion stated by Anglin J. which I have had an opportunity of carefully reading and with his proposed disposition of this appeal.\nI cannot, however, concur with him in his understanding of the decision of this court in the case of The \u201cWandrian\u201d v. Hatfleld[11]. That case was decided on its own special facts and the tow was held liable for the damage caused by the negligence of the tug because the evidence shewed the control to have been in the tow and failure on the part of its captain to exercise such control.\nThe Chief Justice, whose judgment was concurred in by Girouard and Duff JJ., said, at p. 440:\u2014\nThere is no evidence to shew that the man\u0153uvre which resulted in the collision was adopted without the concurrence of the tow. The contrary would appear to be the case.\nI was one of the court at the time and rested my opinion, in which Mr. Justice Maclennan concurred, upon the special circumstances of the case. At p. 446, I said that the rule to be deduced from the authorities was\nthat under an ordinary contract of towage, the tow has control over the tug and the latter is bound to accept the directions and orders of the former. There are exceptions to this rule, notably in the cases of dumb barges and canal boats having little or no control over their own movements and where by custom, contract or necessity the control of the tow is in the tug.\nI then stated (p. 449) that the circumstances of the case before us shewed the case not to be within the exceptions to the ordinary rule, but, on the contrary, shewed\nthe exercise of the control by the tow to have been both practical and possible and to some extent, at least, to have been exercised,\nand so held the tow liable. I am not able to see that this decision is at variance with the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of S.S. \u201cDevonshire\u201d (Owners) v. Barge \u201cLeslie\u201d (Owners)[12].\nAs to the question whether the fact of the tow and the tug being owned by the same person makes in actions in rem any difference in the liability of the tow in cases where the sole control or the \u201cgoverning power\u201d was in the tug and her negligence alone caused the damages complained of I feel myself bound by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of The \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d[13].\nThe two ships in that case belonged to the same owner and the \u201cAmerican,\u201d which was towing the \u201cSyria\u201d home, was held to blame for the collision. The \u201cgoverning power\u201d was wholly with the \u201cAmerican\u201d and their Lordships held that\nthe \u201cSyria\u201d could not be deemed in intendment of law one vessel with the \u201cAmerican\u201d or liable for her negligence. Nor do they think that the fact of the \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cSyria\u201d belonging to the same owners affects the question whether or not the \u201cSyria\u201d was to blame.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant tug \u201cSmith\u201d and tow \u201cChinook\u201d both belonged to the same owners and by the fault of the \u201cSmith\u201d damage was done to the respondent. Both were arrested at Windsor and released upon a bond to answer for one or either to the amount of $12,000, which if not paid by the owners would be paid by the guarantor.\nThe defence set up in the pleadings does not seem to have contemplated raising any other question than, first, that of the fact as to which of the two parties in litigation was to blame for the accident, and secondly, that the court by reason of the proceedings which had been taken in the American court (and are still pending) was ousted of its jurisdiction.\nThe latter contention seems in law quite untenable. And the former and only other question raised seems rightly disposed of by the judgment unless there is room for discriminating between the tug and tow.\nBut again, is that discrimination now open to the appellant? As already pointed out no such question was raised at the trial. So little attention was paid to it that the mate of the tug in giving evidence said he did not know whether they had any steering apparatus on the \u201cChinook\u201d or not.\nAnother witness, the chief engineer, refers to his having passed from the tug to the tow a few minutes before the collision, to do some work in the engine room of the \u201cChinook\u201d where there evidently were a number of others.\nThe effect of the manner in which the tug and tow were connected and the possible bearing thereof on the navigation of either was referred to by more than one witness.\nBut as to the actual relations at the time in question of the crew on the tow or part of the crew on either vessel to the other or to the management (if there was any) of the navigation of the tug and tow the evidence presented gives us nothing tangible upon which to form any judgment whereby to discriminate in law between the vessels in relation to the liability for the collision. We find the mate of the tug seems to have been in charge till he called the captain from his bed just five seconds before the collision.\nThe truth would seem to be that the parties concerned for the defence, seemed to have made up their minds that unless the excuses furnished by the mate or blame sought to be imputed to the plaintiff relieved defendant from all liability, the inevitable consequences of meeting the damages must be faced.\nIn such a case does the doctrine as expounded in The \u201cDevonian\u201d[14], for example, that tug and tow must be considered as one ship, apply?\nThe principle that the tow has charge of the governing power would (prim\u00e2 facie as it were) in the absence of countervailing facts or circumstances seem to render that doctrine applicable and both liable as found by the learned trial judge.\nThere are numerous oases where the facts and circumstances have enabled the courts to see their way to set aside the operation of this principle or that doctrine and treat either vessel as solely to blame.\nI can, however, find no case where the tug and tow belonged to same parties and as here no facts or circumstances countervailing the operation of the said principles where a collision took place with a third vessel. The case of the \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d[15] relied upon is clearly distinguishable.\nThe case of The \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d15 was a case of salvage and rested upon the principle that must govern such a case, and besides the question of the salvage of the cargo so bore thereon as to prevent the identification. In The \u201cQuickstep\u201d[16] the tug and tow were each respectively owned by different owners and otherwise distinguishable.\nThe mere act or neglect of duty which was primarily the cause of the collision no doubt was as clearly traceable here to the man in charge of the tug as it was in the case of the tug towing the \u201cSinquisi,\u201d which was held merely because a tow liable for the mistake made by the tug.\nThat case seems a stronger application of the doctrine than this because the tow was in fact in that case in charge of a pilot.\nThen in the case of The \u201cEnglishman\u201d and The \u201cAustralia\u201d[17], the sole fault of the tow was negative in its neglect to assert its authority and insist on a reduction of the rate of speed in a fog which led to the accident.\nThat and other cases shew how on the trial, when tug or tow desire to sever the presumed joint responsibility, it is done by issues in the way of pleading, or otherwise raising the question, and evidence being directed thereby to enable the court to distinguish on the facts that which is thus presented from that which in principle must, at least prim\u00e2 facie, be presumed to render tug and tow identical.\nThe \u201cNiobe\u201d[18] is another illustration of how this is brought about and shews that the want of a lookout on the tow was held a fault.\nThe case of the tow being an absolutely dead barge without men or machinery on board, or possibility thereof, any more than on a dead log, might be distinguishable from the general rule of presumed liability of the tow.\nEven that must depend upon evidence if not pleading and evidence. Here we have mere accidental glimpses of the condition of things which shew this tow was very far from being that sort of thing whatever she was.\nThe absence of the operative facts of hirer and hired upon which the principles I have adverted to were originally founded and acted upon may make the doctrine look here like a fiction of law. Yet I think it has so much more of common sense to support it than many such useful fictions of law that I must abide by it.\nAnd as to the measure of damages being limited by statute either of the United States or in force in this country I do not see how that question can be raised here without pleading or evidence to let it in and without having been raised in the court below.\nIt certainly seems a remarkably bold attempt.\nThe evidence of the foreign law is all that was presented to the court which gives the slightest indication of such a question being raised, and that does not, for it was very properly directed and confined to what would enable the question of jurisdiction raised in the pleadings to be tried out and disposed of.\nAnd curiously enough in light of present argument no evidence was directed as to what the foreign law is as to the relation between tug and tow in reference to joint responsibility.\nWhen it came to a question of what was to be the measure of damages or limitation thereof there was no evidence offered.\nAnd as I conceive the situation that was quite proper.\nWhen it comes to be a question under the formal judgment directing a reference of how much damages are to be assessed the rule of law, whatever it is, will possibly have to be observed. It may be confined to the value of the res or it may be found that the form of ball bond, which is not to return the vessels, but to answer for damages which the owners are responsible for and the appearance of the owners thus ensured may have to be considered as enlarging the scope of the inquiry by engrafting upon the suit in rem the possible liability of the owners at common law. In the latter case the view taken in The \u201cDictator\u201d[19], where all the authorities are reviewed, may have to be considered.\nAs to all this I express no opinion beyond this that neither the course of the proceedings below nor the form of judgment of record permits of our interfering therewith.\nI have looked into a great many cases besides these I refer to and others that the counsel cited, but I am unable to find anything that would maintain a reversal of the judgment below, under the facts and said course of proceedings and record.\nI, therefore, think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed. In order to explain the reasons which have led me to that conclusion it is necessary to discuss the course of the proceedings in the court below. The collision took place in American territorial waters, that is to say, in the St. Clair River within American territory. The \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d and the \u201cChinook,\u201d the appellant ships, are both American ships. The action out of which this appeal arises was commenced on the 14th day of April, 1913, in the Exchequer Court of Canada (Toronto Admiralty District) by writ of summons, the Ontario Gravel Freighting Company, Limited, being plaintiffs, and the ships \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d and \u201cChinook\u201d being defendants. On the 12th of May the ships were arrested in Canadian waters, and on the 13th of May, 1913, by order of the court the ships were released, on bail by the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, the company in its bond submitting itself to the jurisdiction of the court, and consenting\nthat if Jacques and Son, owners of the vessels \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d and \u201cChinook,\u201d seized by the sheriff in the County of Essex, in this action, and for whom bail is to be given, shall not pay what may be adjudged against them or said vessels or either of said vessels in the above named action with costs, execution may issue against us, the said United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company its goods and chattels, for a sum not exceeding $12,000.\nThe owners of the appellant ships appeared and defended the action denying liability and setting up the following special defence (in paragraph 9):\u2014\nIt is submitted that the defendant vessels being American vessels and the accident having occurred wholly in American waters and proper steps having been taken to appraise defendant vessels and fix the amount of liability attaching to them in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division in Admiralty, this honourable court has no jurisdiction to entertain or try this action.\nAt the trial the parties directed their evidence to a single issue of fact, that namely, whether the collision was due to the fault of the officers of the \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d wholly or in part, who admittedly were also the officers in charge of the \u201cChinook\u201d and admittedly were the servants of their owners for whose negligence, if any, the owners were responsible personally. That issue of fact was decided by the learned trial judge against the appellants, the collision having been found to have been wholly due to the fault of the officers in question. It is important to note that the defendants did not by their pleadings allege that they were entitled by law to have their liability limited under any English or Canadian statute. Nor was any suggestion to such effect made at the trial. Neither was it suggested at the trial (and there is no suggestion of this on the pleadings either), that they were entitled in this action to have their liability limited by the putting into effect in these proceedings of certain provisions on the subject of limitation of liability in certain statutes of the United States of which evidence was given, and to which it will be necessary hereafter to refer. The defendants did, however, at the trial rely upon the defence set up in paragraph 9 of the statement of defence above quoted. At the opening of the trial counsel for the appellants addressed the court as follows:\u2014\nMr. Ellis: You will notice we raise the question of jurisdiction. The accident is alleged by us to have happened entirely in American waters, and would undoubtedly be wholly in the jurisdiction of the American courts. They have, as a matter of fact, taken it up over there, and the liability has been limited. Two deaths occurred as a result of this accident. Now, the amount may be limited, and it has been fixed, I believe, at $1,500, and that is available for all American creditors, and it seems to me it is in direct contravention of the rights of the American courts for these parties to come in here, and seize these boats and claim complete jurisdiction. It means these plaintiffs are claiming that these boats are liable here for a greater amount perhaps than has been fixed by the American courts. Bonds were filed in the American courts holding the boat liable for $1,500 to answer for these deaths, and all damages, which would of course be an insufficient amount to meet the damages. Now, under the comity of nations can these creditors step in and take away the assets which are insufficient for the American creditors, and say the boats may be sold and disposed, of to answer this damage to these Canadian boats, which when the accident happened were foreign boats? Later counsel for the appellants put the point more specifically:\u2014\nMr. Ellis: I submit that it does, for this reason, that if the law is administered over there it will be administered according to the limitation of the vessels in that action. The accident occurred in American waters, and they were American boats, and if they have jurisdiction to limit the amount and divide the funds that are available either by the sale of the vessels or otherwise, then I submit that this court cannot deal with it, that it would interfere with the administration over there. Now, in order to shew it does interefere with the administration over there and that is a law that should not be disregarded by this friendly nation\u2014if, as I say, the law over there would give these people only a limited sum then they cannot take the very assets that are available to those people under the laws of that friendly nation, take that vessel away and distribute the funds amongst the foreign creditors. Now, that is a reason why the question of jurisdiction should be decided, and why we should not attempt, to take out of the other jurisdiction such an action as this.\nI reproduce these extracts from the record to make it clear beyond dispute that not only in the statement of defence (see paragraph 9 quoted above), hut orally at the trial the appellants put forward the proceedings in United States courts for the sole purpose of supporting an exception to the jurisdiction. To establish the plea to the jurisdiction evidence was given by a gentleman who is a proctor in Admiralty in the United States. In substance his testimony is to the effect that the owners of vessels involved in a collision may limit their liability or prospective liability for the fault of those in charge of the navigation by surrendering the vessels in fault or by having the value of it ascertained in accordance with the proper procedure and paying the amount so ascertained into court or giving security for the payment of it as the court may order. At the trial no evidence was offered of any such proceedings in the American courts. But some time after the trial an exemplification was filed by leave of the learned trial judge which shews that certain proceedings had been taken. I will discuss those proceedings in a moment. It will be sufficient now to say that in my judgment an inspection of the record of them is enough in itself to dispose of the plea to the jurisdiction in support of which it was put forward.\nAs to the proceedings at the trial it should further be noted that on behalf of the appellants it does not seem to have been disputed that assuming the plea to jurisdiction to fail and the appellants\u2019 servants to be held to have been wholly in fault, full reparation for the damages suffered by reason of the collision was recoverable by the respondents. Having come to the conclusion as I have just mentioned that the plea to jurisdiction fails upon grounds which it would be more convenient to specify later and that the learned judge\u2019s conclusion that the collision is solely attributable to the fault of the officers in charge of the navigation of the appellant ships is the right conclusion (the learned judge stating in his judgment that the \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d was solely in fault means that, as between that ship and the tug \u201cMoyles,\u201d the fault was solely that of the \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d), it follows that the case must, in my opinion, as regards all the issues and contentions presented at the trial, be decided against the appellants.\nMr. Bartlett, however, who appeared as counsel for the appellants, took up entirely fresh ground. And it is necessary to consider the questions which arise when the case is looked at from the point of view of his able and helpful argument. First, he argues, the action being an action in rem and the owners having appeared solely for the purpose of contesting the liability of the vessels arrested the court could only pronounce judgment against the blame worthy ship, if one only was blame-worthy. Secondly, since as he contends, it results from the facts appearing upon the record that the \u201cChinook\u201d cannot be held to be in fault, he argues that the proceeding being a proceeding in rem to enforce against the \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d a lien arising out of the negligence of her officers and the consequent harm suffered by the respondents\u2019 vessel the proceedings in the American courts are a complete answer to the action on the ground that according to the law of the United States those proceedings had the effect of entirely discharging any such lien and substituting for the \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d the fund (or security) deposited by the owners.\nAs applicable to these contentions I observe first, that, in my opinion, the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in The \u201cGemma\u201d[20], and of Sir Francis Jeune in The \u201cDictator\u201d[21], is that the owners of the appellant ships, by appearing and contesting the liability of the vessels, became parties to the action and subject to have personal judgment pronounced against them in the action for the full amount of damages for which according to the principles of law appropriate for the decision of the case they are personally liable. I have read the comments upon these decisions in the introduction to Williams and Bruce, Admiralty Practice, but whatever view may be taken by a court competent to reconsider the principles laid down by the Admiralty Courts of England as to Admiralty practice I think a proper deference to the opinions upon the points in question expressed by the eminent judges who were responsible for the decisions mentioned requires me to follow them. Prim\u00e2 facie, therefore, the appellants are responsible.\n2ndly. \u201cAs to the American proceedings; the contentions of the appellant rest upon the hypothesis that on the facts before us the \u201cChinook\u201d is free from fault. I do not think this contention is open to the appellants for the purpose of sustaining the contentions put forward, or rather it is only open in the form of the proposition that the facts proved are so conclusive in favour of the innocence of the \u201cChinook\u201d that no further available evidence could rebut that conclusion. The \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d admittedly had one set of officers, that is to say, the navigation of the \u201cChinook\u201d was entirely in charge of the officers of the \u201cA. L. Smith.\u201d In the pleadings they are referred to as \u201cthe officers of the \u2018Chinook.\u2019\u201d (Paragraphs 1, 6, and 7 of the statement of defence.) The question of the identity of the \u201cSmith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d for the purpose of assigning fault is primarily a question of fact (see the authorities discussed below), and if the defendants had intended to rely upon the contention now advanced that the \u201cSmith\u201d was alone to blame, that contention ought to have been put forward at the trial when all the facts bearing upon the question of identity could have been threshed out. Not having done so the burden, on appeal, is that just indicated.\nInspection of the proceedings in the United States courts shews that the petition for limitation of liability does not refer to the fact that the \u201cChinook\u201d was in tow of the \u201cSmith\u201d, at the time of the collision; and that none of the special facts bearing distinctively upon the culpability of the \u201cChinook\u201d was disclosed. It is a petition to limit the liabilities of the owners of the \u201cSmith\u201d to the value of the \u201cSmith\u201d upon the hypothesis that the \u201cSmith\u201d alone was delinquent. It seems too clear for argument that such proceedings could be no answer to proceedings in the Exchequer Court against the \u201cChinook,\u201d or against the owners personally either as supporting a plea to the jurisdiction or otherwise, unless it now appeared that in fact the \u201cChinook\u201d was not at fault. In point of fact in the paragraph quoted above from the statement of defence (paragraph 9), it is alleged that the proceedings in the American courts were proceedings taken to appraise both vessels, and the attention of the court below does not appear to have been called during the trial to the fact that this was an error. When some weeks after the trial the exemplification was filed the real facts were for the first time placed upon the record.\nBut in substance this contention now advanced by Mr. Bartlett for the first time fails in my view for the reason that the facts as disclosed at the trial favour the conclusion of \u201cidentity\u201d rather than non-identity of the \u201cSmith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d for the purpose now in hand. This view is fatal not only to Mr. Bartlett\u2019s contention which was that the American proceedings in themselves afford a defence, but it is also a conclusive answer to suggestions not advanced by him as, for instance, that in this court the damages should be limited to the value of the \u201cSmith\u201d or that there should be a stay of proceedings in the Exchequer Court pending the determination of the proceedings in the United States courts or that the case should be referred back to the trial judge to give the appellant an opportunity to offer further evidence as to the effect of the American law.\nI assume in favour of the appellants (without expressing an opinion as to the correctness of the assumptions);\n1. That the personal obligation ex delicto of the owner of a ship held responsible for a collision is discharged according to the United States law by the surrender of the ship or payment of or deposit of security for the amount of her value in limitation of liability proceedings, and that the inchoate lien on the offending ship is thereby extinguished;\n2. That such surrender or payment or deposit in such proceedings in the United States courts would be an answer to this action on the ground that such a discharge would according to the doctrine of Phillips v. Eyre[22] destroy the obligation springing from the delict under the lex loci delicti commissi, as well as the lien based upon that obligation; and\n3. If the proceedings in the United States courts had not the effect of discharging the personal obligation\u2014that the obligation ex delicto being in substance limited by the law of the locus delicti commissi to the payment of the value of the offending res the amount of damages recoverable in the Exchequer Court is also limited by that value.\nThese assumptions made\u2014the respondents being for reasons already given entitled to judgment on the issues and contentions presented and investigated at the trial\u2014the appellant (now suggesting for the first time a defence based upon the allegation of fact that the \u201cChinook\u201d is not implicated in the fault of the officers in charge) must fail unless it necessarily results that the evidence given at the trial is to exculpate the \u201cChinook\u201d; and that question I proceed to consider.\nI emphasize the special nature of the burden upon the appellants in this issue for the reason that if the issue had been raised at the proper time some circumstances not without relevancy to it would probably have been proved by explicit evidence which, in the actual state of the record, are matter of inference only.\nFirst, as to the relevant facts. The \u201cA. L. Smith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d were owned by the same owners and by them were employed in their business, the transport of gravel and sand as carriers on the St. Clair River and its tributary waters. The tug having no storage space and the barge neither means of propulsion nor apparatus for steering, each was the necessary complement of the other for performing the function of transport. On the occasion of the collision as usual the barge, which was then light, was attached by a short line, ten or fifteen feet long, to the tug. The men employed on both tug and barge were under the control of the captain of the tug, who, with his crew, had charge of the navigation of both. They were in fact navigated as a single craft by one crew, who were the servants of the owners of both and expressly employed for that purpose.\nThe \u201cSmith\u201d appears to have been employed in navigating the \u201cChinook\u201d for several seasons; and there seems no reason to doubt that while loading and unloading, as well as when she was in transit, the \u201cChinook\u201d and her crew (she was equipped with a derrick and crew for loading and unloading) were, as is usual in such cases under the control of the officers who also were in charge of the \u201cSmith.\u201d In a word, in the freight-earning service of this composite body both component parts tug and tow were for all the purposes of their service under the control and management of the same set of servants acting in the execution of their duties as servants of the common master.\nAs to the law. In these circumstances I think the tug and barge were according to the principles of law administered in the Court of Admiralty a single vessel in intendment of law for the purpose of assigning responsibility for negligent navigation.\nThe question of the test to be applied in determining whether in such circumstances there is constructive identity of tug and tow was discussed in the House of Lords in The \u201cDevonshire\u201d[23]. Lord Ashbourne, at p. 648, and Lord Atkinson, at p. 656, stated that the question is a question of fact not of law to be determined in each case on its own circumstances. Lord Halsbury concurred with Lord Atkinson. The Lord Chancellor adopted the rule which had been laid down by Mr. Justice Butt, in delivering the judgment of himself and Sir Jas, Hannan in The \u201cQuickstep\u201d[24], in which the principle was accepted that had been enunciated by Mr. Justice Clifford in the judgment of the Supreme Court of United States; Sturgis v. Boyer[25], at p. 122. The rule is thus stated by Butt J. at pp. 199 and 200:\u2014\nIn all such cases, however, the real question is whether or not the relation of master, and servant exists between the defendants, the owners of the vessel towed, and the persons in charge of the navigation of the steam tug.* * * The question whether the crew of the tug are to be regarded as the servants of the owner of the vessel in tow must depend upon the circumstances of each case.\nIf this could properly be regarded as a quite complete account of the effect of the authorities upon the subject there would be no difficulty in reaching a conclusion on the facts above stated that (to consider the matter from the point of view of Lord Halsbury, Lord Ashbourne and Lord Atkinson) the \u201cSmith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d were in fact one ship for the purpose of assigning responsibility; and there was indisputably the relationship of master and servant which in the view of the Lord Chancellor appears to be the decisive factor.\nIt is necessary, however, to consider the decision of the Privy Council in The \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d[26], a decision which was made the foundation of an argument that the liability of the tow only arises where the navigation in the course of which the negligence occurs is under the exclusive control of the tow. I do not think that is the effect of their Lordships\u2019 decision. At page 133 Sir Robt. Collier, in delivering their Lordships\u2019 judgment, mentions the circumstances in which the master of the \u201cAmerican\u201d undertook to tow the \u201cSyria,\u201d both ships having the same owners.\nTheir Lordships collect (he says) that he determined to take home the \u201cSyria\u201d partly because he thought it his duty to his employers, who owned both vessels, partly with a view to obtain salvage from the owners of the \u201cSyria\u2019s\u201d cargo (which he succeeded in doing). There is no evidence of his having been hired by the captain of the \u201cSyria,\u201d or having acted in any way under the captain of the \u201cSyria\u2019s\u201d control.\nHis Lordship adds that their Lordships did not think that the fact of the \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cSyria\u201d belonging to the same owners affects the question whether or not the \u201cSyria\u201d was to blame.\nTheir Lordships do seem to decide that the fact of common ownership alone is not sufficient to establish identity by construction of law. But, on the other hand, their Lordships expressly leave outside of the scope of their ruling the case in which there being a common owner the actual control is in the towing vessel, and the master of the latter has been hired by the master of the tow for a service which is not a salvage but a towage service. Their Lordships appear to have treated the \u201cAmerican\u2019s\u201d service as a salvage rather than as a towage service. No opinion is expressed as to the responsibility of the tow where\u2014as in the case before us\u2014the master of the tug and his crew have entire and exclusive control of both vessels for all purposes and are, as regards the whole operation, acting exclusively in execution of their legal obligations as servants of the common owners, and I think no principle can be deduced from the judgment governing such a case.\nThe service undertaken by the master of the \u201cAmerican\u201d was a casual service which he was under no legal duty to perform; the captain of the \u201cSmith\u201d was charged with the duty of managing the \u201cSmith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d for all the purposes of transport; both, I repeat, being under his control as the essential parts of what was in fact a single composite freight-earning body. These circumstances seem to distinguish this case from The \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cSyria\u201d[27].\nTo summarize these reasons for the sake of clearness. The appellants by appearing and defending the action became parties, and as such subject to have judgment pronounced against them personally for such damages as the respondent should be entitled to recover for the negligence of the appellants\u2019 servants, the officers in charge of both the \u201cSmith\u201d and \u201cChinook.\u201d The sole issue of fact to which the evidence at the trial was directed was whether the collision was ascribable to the fault in whole or in part of these officers. The defence was not raised at the trial that the damages should be limited to the value of the \u201cSmith\u201d on the ground that she alone was in fault and that under the lex loci delicti commissi the obligation ex delicto could be discharged by paying the value of the ship in fault. The question whether or not the \u201cChinook\u201d was involved in the fault of the officers in charge of both vessels is a question of fact and could only be decided now adversely to respondents if it appeared that all the facts necessary to a decision of it were before us, or, in other words, that from the facts proved the necessary conclusion is that the vessels are not identified for the purposes of legal liability. In my opinion that is not the proper conclusion from the facts brought out at the trial.\nThe plea to the jurisdiction based upon the limitation of liability proceedings in the United States Courts necessarily fails if for no other reason on the ground that in those proceedings none of the facts bearing on the question of the culpability of the \u201cChinook\u201d was disclosed and the whole proceedings are on the assumption that the \u201cSmith\u201d was admittedly alone to blame, on which ground also must be rejected the argument that those proceedings in themselves constitute an answer to the action.\nAs to a stay of proceedings or reference back for further evidence that has never been suggested by any of the parties; and it is self-evident that in the view above expressed neither of those courses is now admissible.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The evidence fully supports the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge, and the facts so found warranted his conclusion\nthat the fault lay with the \u201cSmith\u201d and that she alone was to blame for the collision.\nHer tow, the \u201cChinook,\u201d and the down-going tug and tow were acquitted of blame. The actual collision was between the \u201cSmith\u201d and the down-going tug, which was sunk. There was nobody steering the \u201cChinook,\u201d the entire control of her navigation being in the hands of the men navigating the \u201cSmith.\u201d These facts are not in dispute, and the finding, that the negligent navigation of the \u201cSmith\u201d was the sole cause of the collision, was not seriously contested.\nHut the appellants maintain that, upon the facts found, the \u201cChinook\u201d should not have been condemned; that judgment should not have been given against the \u201cSmith,\u201d because the collision occurred in American waters and the \u201cSmith\u201d is an American ship and had already been the subject of proceedings in an American court in respect of it; and that, if she is answerable in the present proceedings, her liability should be limited under the Canadian \u201cMerchant Shipping Act.\u201d\nIn determining these questions it must, of course, be borne in mind that the present action is in rem\u2014 not in personam. It should also be stated that counsel for the appellants conceded that if the \u201cChinook\u201d should be held liable, her value being sufficient to answer the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, it would be unnecessary to deal with the question raised as to recovery against the \u201cSmith.\u201d\nIt has been suggested that under the bond given for the release of the \u201cSmith\u201d and the \u201cChinook,\u201d which were both arrested at Walkerville, the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the amount of their loss up to $12,000 (which will fully cover it) if either ship, or its owners, should be held liable, and that it is, therefore, unnecessary to determine the liability of the \u201cChinook.\u201d The form of the bond is relied upon to support this position. By it the sureties became responsible for payment by the owners of the \u201cSmith\u201d and the \u201cChinook\u201d of\nwhat may be adjudged against them or said vessels or either of said vessels.\nI am unable to accede to this view.\nWe are not for the moment concerned with the question whether in this proceeding in rem the plaintiffs may have judgment in personam against the owners for such part of their loss as cannot be recovered out of the defendant ships, as was held in The \u201cDictator\u201d[28]. (But see the discussion of this question in the introduction to the third edition of Williams and Bruce on Admiralty Jurisdiction, at p. 18 et seq.) It may he that if the plaintiffs have that right and if the owners are not entitled to the benefit of any of the provisions of British, Canadian or American law invoked by them to limit their liability, their sureties may be responsible for the entire loss of the plaintiffs up to $12,000. But only to the extent to which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this action against the vessels under arrest, or their owners, can they hold the sureties. This is the true intent and substance of the security, of which the sole object was to procure the release of the ships from seizure. We are not now concerned with ascertaining the extent of the responsibility of the sureties. That may have to be considered further should it be determined that the owners are liable in this action for an amount beyond the value of both or either of the vessels which may be held to be responsible. The question under immediate consideration is the liability of the defendant ships, and that the form of the bond taken for their release from arrest cannot affect.\nAs between tug and tow, where a collision with a third vessel is due to the fault of those in charge of the tug and the tow is herself free from blame, according to the modern authorities the tow is jointly liable with the tug for the resulting damage only where the relation of master and servant exists between them and the principle of the decision in Quarman v. Burnett[29], applies. As put by Butt J. in The \u201cQuickstep\u201d[30], at p. 199:\u2014\nIn all such cases, however, the real question is whether or not the relation of master and servant exists between the defendants, the owners of the vessel towed, and the persons in charge of the navigation of the steam-tug. Unless that relation exist, considerations of expediency, cannot avail to impose liability on the owners of the vessel in tow.\nThis decision has been approved of by the House of Lords in S.S. \u201cDevonshire\u201d v. Barge \u201cLeslie\u201d[31], where Lord Chancellor Haldane, at p. 645, restates the proposition of Butt J. in these words:\u2014\nWhere the tug and its tow come into collision with an innocent ship the question whether the owners of the latter can recover damages against the owners of the tow depends on whether the relation of master and servant obtains between the owners of the tow and those of the tug. Unless this relation is established, he said, that there was no liability on the part of the tow.\nThe Lord Chancellor continued:\u2014\nI think that, as the doctrine of identification, as enunciated in Thorogood v. Bryan[32] has now been swept away, the principle so laid down was right, and that it is a simple application of the rule established in the well-known case of Quarman v. Burnett[33].\nLord Ashbourne said:\u2014\nThere is nothing in the facts of this case to make the tow responsible for the navigation of the tug. This is not a question of law, but a question of fact, to be determined in each case on its own circumstances.\nIn his judgment, concurred in by Lord Halsbury, Lord Atkinson reviews the authorities, and, accepting the proposition formulated in The \u201cQuickstep\u201d[34], concludes at p. 656, that it must\nnow be taken as conclusively established that the question of the identity of the tow with the tug that tows her is one of fact, not law, to be determined upon the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\nThe contrary view, enunciated in some earlier cases, \u2014see The \u201cTiconderoga\u201d[35]\u2014that whenever a tug is hired by the master of a vessel for the purpose of towing it, the tug is, as a matter of law, to be deemed to be in the service of the tow, cannot now be regarded as law. In many of the cases in which that proposition is supposed to have been laid down, however, it will be found upon examination that the governing or controlling power was as a matter of fact in the tow. Counsel for the respondent very properly cited The Ship \u201cWandrian\u201d v. Hatfield[36], where this court would appear to have accepted the proposition that\nthe master and crew of the tug are the agents of the owners of the ship and for damage done to a stranger solely through the fault or incapacity of the crew of the tug both parties are liable (pp. 439-40),\nalthough Mr. Justice Davies points out (p. 449) that the ship in tow in fact exercised at least some control of the navigation. Upon examination it will be found, however, that in The \u201cEnergy\u201d[37], on which the decision of the case of the \u201cWandrian\u201d is rested, the ship in tow was in charge of a licensed pilot, and the head-note states that the tug was bound to obey his orders, and it was his duty to give the tug proper directions and to superintend her navigation. Observations somewhat similar may be made as to the facts in The \u201cCleadon\u201d[38]; The \u201cNiobe\u201d[39]; and The \u201cDevonian\u201d[40], which are cited in the judgments in The Ship \u201cWandrian\u201d v. Hatfield36.\nWith respect, so far as it was there laid down that the tow is as a matter of law and of course responsible for the consequences of negligence of the crew of her tug, and that such responsibility does not depend upon whether or not the particular facts and circumstances establish the existence of the relation of master and servant, the Ship \u201cWandrian\u201d v. Hatfield36 cannot, in my opinion, be supported since the decision of the House of Lords in the S.S. \u201cDevonshire\u201d v. The Barge \u201cLeslie\u201d[41].\nIt most frequently occurs that the owner of the tug and the owner of the tow are not the same persons. Where they are identical the master of the tug, if he is not the owner himself, is, of course, the servant of the owner of the tow, but it does not follow that in such a case the tow is liable in a proceeding in rem for the result of the negligence of those in charge of the tow. Holding that because the \u201cgoverning power\u201d lay wholly with the \u201cAmerican,\u201d the \u201cSyria,\u201d her tow, was not liable for a collision with a third vessel caused by the negligent navigation of the \u201cAmerican,\u201d Sir R. P. Collier, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said:\u2014\nNor do they (their Lordships) think that the fact of the \u201cAmerican\u201d and the \u201cSyria\u201d belonging to the same owners affects the question whether the \u201cSyria\u201d was to blame. L.R. 6 P.C. 127, 133.\nIn such a case the question of the responsibility of the tow must apparently be dealt with as if she and the tug were owned by different persons. It was perhaps to meet such a situation that in re-stating the proposition formulated by Butt J., in The \u201cQuickstep\u201d[42], the Lord Chancellor enunciated it in the \u201cDevonshire\u201d Case[43] in the slightly modified terms above quoted.\nIn determining when the relation of master and servant exists between tug and tow, as put by Butt J.:\nThe truth is no general rule can be laid down. The question whether the crew of the tug are to be regarded as the servants of the owners of the vessel in tow must depend upon the circumstances of each case. (The \u201cQuickstep\u201d42, at p. 200.)\nThird parties are not affected by the mere contractual relation between the tug and the tow. The \u201cW. H. No. 1\u201d and The \u201cKnight Errant\u201d[44].\nThe consensus of modern opinion seems to establish that where, as here, those in charge of a suitable tug, properly manned and equipped, have the entire control, she must be held responsible for the proper navigation of her tow as well as herself, and the tow is not liable. Sturgis v. Boyer[45], adopted in The \u201cQuickstep\u201d[46], at p. 201. The facts of the present case are more favourable to the tow than were those in the \u201cW. H. No. 1\u201d and The \u201cKnight Errant\u201d[47], the dumb barge in tow being there held not liable, although she had a man at the rudder. There was nobody steering the \u201cChinook.\u201d There was nothing in the present case to suggest the existence of the relation of master and servant except the fact that the tow and tug had the same owners and that circumstance has been held by the Judicial Committee to be devoid of significance in considering the question of the responsibility of the tow for the negligent navigation of the tug.\nI am, for these reasons, with respect, of the opinion that the judgment condemning the \u201cChinook\u201d cannot be sustained.\nIt, therefore, becomes necessary to consider to what limitation of liability, if any, the \u201cSmith\u201d is entitled, and what effect should be given in this suit to the proceedings taken in the American courts so far as they have been produced in evidence.\nThe \u201cSmith\u201d being an American ship and the collision having occurred in territorial waters of the United States, secs. 920 et seq. of the Canadian \u201cShipping Act\u201d (E.S.C. 1906, ch. 113) cannot be invoked, their application being confined to \u201cthe navigation of Canadian waters\u201d (see the heading of Part XIV.). Although the \u201cMerchant Shipping Act\u201d (57 & 58 Vict. (Imp.), ch. 60, sec. 503) applies to foreign vessels when before British courts in respect of collisions which occur either in British territorial waters or on the high seas, it does not determine the liability of a foreign vessel for a wrong committed by her within the territorial limits of the country to which she belongs. The presence of a foreign ship within Canadian waters undoubtedly confers jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court of Canada to arrest and hold her answerable for such claims against her by the owner of an injured British vessel (\u201cMerchant Shipping Act,\u201d supra, sec. 688; The \u201cFranconia\u201d[48]; The Ship \u201cD. C. Whitney\u201d v. St. Clair Navigation Co.[49]), and the submission to the jurisdiction in the bond filed in the present case puts that question out of consideration. But it does not follow that the provisions of our law are alone to be taken account of in considering the existence or the extent of the defendant\u2019s liability. On the contrary, an act done in a foreign country is not actionable as a tort in our courts unless it is a wrong by the law of the country where it occurred. Machado v. Fontes[50]; Phillips v. Eyre[51]; Dobree v. Napier[52]. The statutory limitation of a shipowner\u2019s liability is not lex fori. Cope v. Doherty[53]; Westlake\u2019s International Law, 5th ed., sec. 202; and, where the collision occurs in the domestic waters of the foreign ship held to he at fault, the lex loci commissi delicti determines the extent of her liability. Marsden on Collisions (6 ed.), pp. 203-4, and cases there cited; Foote\u2019s Private International Jurisprudence (4 ed.), pp. 459, 461; Consequa v. Willings, in 1816[54]; Story on Conflict of Laws, sec. 307; Wharton on Conflict of Laws (2 ed.), sec. 512. In dealing with either the ship or her owners, when subject to their jurisdiction, the courts of this country, while they will not condemn for a cause not actionable here, will not, on the other hand, subject her or them to a greater liability than is imposed by the law of the ship\u2019s own flag as proved. (Sed vide Machado v. Fontes[55].) Of course, it would be quite otherwise if the collision had occurred on the high seas. The \u201cWild Ranger\u201d[56].\nIf, therefore, the defendant is content that the reference directed by the judgment a quo should proceed on the basis which I have indicated, namely, that the recovery should be limited to the value of the \u201cSmith\u201d immediately after the collision and her then pending freight, proved by Mr. Harvey to be her right under United States law, that course may be taken, unless, indeed, in the light of this judgment, the parties interested should see the advisability of a settlement of their differences. On that reference, however, unless by consent, the plaintiffs should not be bound by the appraisal of the value of the \u201cSmith\u201d and her pending freight which appears to have been made ex parte in the American court; and it should be open to them to shew, if they can, that she is not entitled to the benefit of the United States statute because the collision occurred with the privity or knowledge of her owners. No evidence, however, to that effect has been given, nor has any such suggestion been made. Should the defendant now elect to proceed under the judgment, the costs of the reference should be reserved to be disposed of by the learned local judge of the Exchequer Court after it is concluded.\nBut if the defendant, the \u201cSmith,\u201d still insists upon being given in this suit whatever benefit she may be entitled to from the proceedings in the American courts, the extent of any such right that she may have must be further considered.\nThe exemplification of those proceedings produced shews nothing after the 13th March, 1913, although it was put in some time after the trial of this action, which began on the 14th of April, 1914. The last order of the United States court which is before us was pronounced on the 16th December, 1912. The proceedings are obviously incomplete and it would almost appear that they had been suspended awaiting the outcome of this action. If that be the case, however, it has not been shewn. So far as they are in evidence these proceedings appear to consist of a petition, presented under an American statute, praying for the limitation of the liability of the owners of the \u201cSmith\u201d for damages arising out of the collision in question. An ex parte appraisal of the value of the ship was directed and made and a bond for the amount thereof filed. The order directing the giving of this security, or stipulation, as it is called, contains this passage:\u2014\nIt is ordered that the several petitioners may and are hereby allowed and directed (sic) to give a single bond for the sum of $1,500 with one security for the whole, the individual liability of the several petitioners therein to be only for that proportionate interest of the whole which their interest as hereinbefore shewn bears to the whole and for the amount herein shewn.\nBy an order of the same date approving the bond the issue of a monition citing all persons to appear and make claims is directed, service to be made by publication in a Detroit newspaper\nand through the post office upon the owners of the barge \u201cHustler\u201d at Detroit, Michigan.\nThe petition merely alleged that the petitioners were \u201cnot informed as to the ownership of the said barge Hustler.\u2019\u201d This was the sole material on which the order for substitutional service was based. Although the present plaintiffs received no formal notice of them, they would appear to have had some knowledge, gleaned from newspapers, that the limitation proceedings were pending in Detroit. (Robinson v. Fenner[57], at pp. 842-3-4; Pemberton v. Hughes[58].) Neither an order staying any proceedings in other American courts (although the petition asked for it), nor an order extinguishing the maritime liens upon the \u201cSmith\u201d of persons who had sustained damages by the collision, or declaring such liens to be thereafter unenforceable except against the moneys secured by the stipulation filed in court, appears to have been made. Nor is there anything before us to shew that the proceedings had reached a stage at which such an order would properly be made in the United States District Court. The only evidence as to the American law or as to the effect of the proceedings, given by Mr. Harvey, a proctor in Admiralty practising at Detroit, is very meagre and unsatisfactory. He states the extent of the limitation under the American law (presumably United States Compiled Statutes, 1901, sec. 4283), and that the owners petitioning for limitation may give a bond for the appraised value of the ship (presumably under Admiralty rule, No. 54), in lieu of conveying her to a trustee (presumably under section 4285 of the same statute) and he adds that \u201cthe bond then stands in place of the ship and her freight pending.\u201d\nBeyond this he says nothing as to the effect of the proceedings which the exemplication produced shews to have been actually taken. He adds that persons having claims may appear before a Commissioner within a fixed time and prove them; the question of the liability of the ship may be determined; and, if she is found to be at fault, a decree may be entered that the amount of the bond be distributed amongst the claimants who have proved claims.\nThe only formal plea in this action based on these foreign proceedings is in denial of the jurisdiction of the Canadian Exchequer Court. As already stated there is no ground for that contention. There is no plea of res judicata and at the stage to which the proceedings had advanced it seems highly probable that they would not have warranted such a plea. Nor is it alleged that the present action is vexatious or contrary to good faith and it is perhaps questionable whether such an allegation, if made, could be sustained. The \u201cReinbeck\u201d[59]. It may be that if lis alibi pendens had been formally pleaded that defence too could have been met. The \u201cCity of Norwich\u201d[60]; The \u201cBold Buccleuch\u201d[61]; but see Re Morrison[62]; The \u201cMali Ivo\u201d[63]; Law v. Hansen\u201d[64].\nAt the outset of the trial, however, counsel called attention to what had taken place in the American court and suggested that the Exchequer Court should not proceed further in this action. But the learned trial judge said that he would \u201ctake evidence and consider that as raised in the pleadings.\u201d At the conclusion of his judgment disposing of the action, after stating the substance of the proceedings as shewn by the exemplification, he treats the question first as one of jurisdiction and holds that it is concluded against the defendant by her arrest in Canadian waters and by her submission to the jurisdiction contained in the bond given to secure her release. He adds:\u2014\nI have found no case and none was cited to me where the person or ship damaged was restrained from proceeding in the domestic forum because the foreign vessel had instituted proceedings in a foreign court to which the person or ship damaged was not a party. The rule invoked rests upon inconvenience and fair dealing and the plaintiff must be in some way responsible for, or a party to the foreign proceedings before it is applied.\nBut, with respect, it is at least questionable how far the plaintiffs can set up want of formal notice of proceedings of the pendency of which they had some actual knowledge. See cases noted in Piggott on Foreign Judgments, 3rd ed., pp. 407-411; Re Morrison[65], and see Williams & Bruce Admiralty Jur. (1902) p. 86. I am far from being satisfied that, if applied for at an earlier stage of the proceedings and upon proper material shewing that the plaintiffs\u2019 interest could be fairly dealt with in the foreign proceedings, a stay of this action, pending the outcome of such proceedings, would not have been granted by the Exchequer Court on grounds analogous to those on which a British court in which a similar proceeding is instituted is empowered by section 504 of the \u201cMerchant Shipping Act\u201d to stay any proceedings in any other court. The \u201cChristiansborg\u201d[66]; The \u201cLanarkshire\u201d [67]; The \u201cGriefswald\u201d[68]; The \u201cCatterina Chiazzare\u201d[69]; The \u201cPeshawur\u201d[70].\nIn these cases the foreign proceedings had been instituted by the same plaintiffs who subsequently invoked the jurisdiction of the English courts. I do not, however, understand the decisions to rest on that fact, but upon the undesirability of entertaining a second litigation while proceedings are pending in a competent tribunal in which the plaintiffs have the right and opportunity to have their claim adjudicated, although, where that tribunal is a court of a foreign country, concurrent proceedings in this country may not be prima facie vexatious. McHenry v. Lewis[71], at pages 408-9; Cox v. Mitchell[72]. But the reasons for withholding the exercise of jurisdiction are very formidable where the foreign proceeding partakes of the nature of a proceeding in rem in which all parties interested are cited to prefer their claims and the res is at home in the foreign jurisdiction and the cause of action is a wrong which was committed there. The giving of a stipulation in proceedings for limitation of liability under the United States statute seems to be deemed the equivalent of conveying the ship to a trustee under section 4285 (The \u201cCity of Norwich\u201d[73]), and where such a surrender is made the proceedings appear to be regarded as in rem. Re Morrison[74], at pages 34; The \u201cMali Ivo\u201d[75], at pages 358-9.\nTo grant such a stay now, however, would involve serious considerations which would not have been a source of anxiety and trouble had the application been made earlier. Heavy costs have been incurred and the defendant has had a full trial of the question of her liability, which it would still be open to her to contest in the United States court. We do not know what has transpired in that court since the 13th March, 1913; we are unaware whether it is still open to the plaintiffs to present their claim there and to have it duly considered; we do not even know that the security put in is still available or whether the amount of the appraisal of the ship\u2019s value or the sufficiency of the stipulation may be questioned and further security ordered on cause being shewn, or whether it is open to the present plaintiffs to contest the right of the owners of the \u201cSmith\u201d to limitation of liability. These and other questions as to the nature and effect of proceedings under the United States statute have been considered by the Supreme Court of the United States in Re Morrison[76], but as to the effect of the proceedings in an American court and as to American law we are, of course, dependent upon the evidence before us. These questions must be dealt with by us as questions of fact. We may not ourselves examine American statutes and authorities to determine them. In short, the necessary material is not before us to enable us to decide whether it would be equitable now to order a stay of proceedings in this action. For that the defendant is chiefly to blame. It is due to her failure to put in proper evidence that we find ourselves in this manifestly unsatisfactory position. Under these circumstances, I am of the opinion that if a settlement cannot be reached and if the defendant is unwilling to proceed with the reference under the judgment of the Exchequer Court, qualified as above suggested, and should elect to take an order for a further hearing before that court as to the exact nature of the foreign proceedings and the stage which they have reached, and as to what effect, if any, should be given to them in this action, such an order may issue. Of course it should be open to the plaintiffs to resist the defence based on the American proceedings on any ground that they may be advised to raise.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Ellis & Ellis.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Rodd, Wigle & McHugh.\n[1] 15 Ex.

Rex v. Lai Ping (11 B.C. Rep. 102) ; The Queen's Case (2 Brod. & Bing. 284); Ofnychund v. Barker (1 Atk. 21); Attorney\u2014General v. Bradlaugh (14 Q.B.D. 667), and Curry v. The King (48 Can. S.C.R. 532), referred to.\nJudgment appealed from (19 D.L.R: 313; 30 West. L.R. 65) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant upon an indictment for perjury.\nThe judgment appealed from was rendered upon a case reserved at the trial by His Lordship Mr. Justice Gregory, which was as follows:\u2014\n\"1. The prisoner was tried before me at the Vancouver Spring Assizes, on June 26th, 1914.\n\"2. The charge was that the said Shajoo Ram on the 15th day of January, 1914, whilst appearing as a witness, and after having been duly sworn before Charles John South, Esq., then sitting as Deputy Police Magistrate in and for the City of Vancouver, in a judicial proceeding wherein one Baboo Singh was charged with having unlawfully broken a shop window, which magistrate had competent power and authority to administer the oath to the said accused, as a witness in that behalf, did then and there falsely, knowingly and corruptly swear and depose to the effect following, that is to say, that he the said Shajoo Ram was not present at a meeting at the Sikh Temple, Second Avenue, West, in the City of Vancouver, on the night of Saturday, the 10th day of January, 1914, whereas in truth and in fact the said Shajoo Ram was present at a meeting at the Sikh Temple aforesaid, on the Saturday night aforesaid, as he the said Shajoo Ram well knew when he so falsely and corruptly deposed as aforesaid, and the said Shajoo Ram did thereby then and there commit wilful and corrupt perjury.\n\"3. There was no evidence before me of the words (if any) that the magistrate put to the interpreter, L.J. Ricketts, to be interpreted to the accused by way of administering an oath. The magistrate was not called to give evidence.\n\"4. Counsel for the accused consented to the admission of the transcript of the proceedings in the Police Court as evidence that it was in the course a judicial proceeding that the alleged perjury had been committed, but not as evidence that the accused had been sworn.\n\"5. At the trial before me Henry William Gwyther, a Hindu interpreter who was present in the proceedings before Magistrate South, and L.J. Ricketts, who acted as interpreter in the proceedings in question, were the only witnesses called to prove that the accused had been properly sworn in the Police Court proceedings. The evidence of these two witnesses is made part of this case.\n\"6. The accused was called on his own behalf at the trial before me and the following is the stenographic report of what occurred when he was called upon to give evidence on his owen behalf.\n\"Shajoo Ram, the accused, called:\u2014\n\"Interpreter: He is a Guthric. He will affirm.\n\"Court: What is the custom? How do you people swear ?\n\"Interpreter: He swears by putting his hand up. It is like affirming.\n\"Court: All right.\n\"Accused sworn.\n\"7. At the close of the case for the Crown counsel for the accused asked to have the case taken from the jury on the ground that there was no evidence that the accused had been duly sworn in the Police Court proceedings.\n\"8. I gave leave that an application be made later for a stated case.\n\"9. I instructed the jury that there was evidence that the accused had been duly sworn.\n\"10. The accused was found guilty of the charge.\n\"11. On the application for the stated case counsel for the accused asked that the evidence of the witness Gwyther in the Police Court should be made part of the stated case. This application I refused.\n\"12. However, I gave leave that an appeal should be taken on this point.\n\"13. The questions submitted are:\u2014 \"1st. Was there evidence that a proper oath had been administered to the accused in the Police Court proceedings, in which perjury was alleged to have been committed, and was I right in charging the jury that there was such evidence?\n\"2ndly. Was I right in refusing the application of Counsel for the accused that the deposition of Gwyther taken in the Police Court proceedings should form part of this case?\"\nBy the judgment appealed from, the conviction was affirmed, Irving J. dissenting.\nW. L. Scott for the appellant.\nJ. A. Ritchie for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. Sufficient reasons are assigned therefor and appear in the judgments of the court below and it seems needless to repeat them here.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think there was evidence, meagre it is true, but still sufficient, to support a finding by the jury that the accused, presenting himself as a witness in a court of justice, and giving the answers he did give, on his examination, on the voire dire, in effect declared that the ceremony which was accepted as the taking of an oath was in fact binding on his conscience as an oath. It is probable that the jury in reaching their conclusion assumed, as I think they were entitled to assume, that the witness under- stood that he was going through that which was the ordinary form of oath administered to persons of his race and class in the courts of British Columbia, and of course generally accepted as a form of oath binding on their consciences.\nOn the questions of law I am in entire agreement with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Martin, in which Mr. Justice McPhillips concurred, which view is concisely stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice in the case of Rex v. Lai Ping[2], in a passage which is quoted in the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin and is in the following words:\u2014\nIt seems to me that when a man without objection takes the oath in the form ordinarily administered to persons of his race or belief, as the case may be, he is then under a legal obligation to speak the truth, and cannot be heard to say that he was not sworn. If we were to decide otherwise we would deprive the evidence given in a court of justice of the most powerful and necessary sanction which it is possible to give it, namely, the risk of a prosecution for perjury.\nIn British Columbia, indeed, the facts being as above mentioned the question would seem to be beyond controversy by reason of the declaratory enactment of 1& 2 Vict, ch. 105, as follows:\u2014\nAN ACT TO REMOVE DOUBTS AS TO THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN OATHS.\nBe it declared and enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that in all cases in which an oath may lawfully be and shall have been administered to any person, either as a juryman or a witness, or a deponent in any proceeding, civil or criminal, in any court of law or equity in the United Kingdom, or on appointment to any office or employment, or on any occasion whatever, such person is bound by the oath administered, provided the same shall have been administered in such form and with such ceremonies as such person may declare to be binding; and every such person in case of wilful false swearing may be convicted of the crime of perjury in the same manner as if the oath had been administered in the form and with the ceremonies most commonly adopted.\nEighteen years before that statute was passed, Abbott C.J., in the Queen's Case[3], used these words:\nI conceive, that, if a witness says he considers the oath as binding upon his conscience, he does, in effect affirm, that, in taking that oath, he has called his God to witness, * * * and having done that, that it is perfectly unnecessary and irrelevant to ask any further questions.\nThere seems to be no substance in the objection that the oath was administered by the interpreter and not by the magistrate. The interpreter was merely the mouthpiece of the judicial officer.\nI think the appeal fails.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant was admittedly capable of taking an oath. He was not a person authorized to make affirmation under section 14 of the \"Canada Evidence Act.\" To sustain his conviction for prejury under section 170 of the Criminal Code it is therefore necessary to shew that he told. what was known to him to be false as part of his evidence upon oath in a judicial proceeding.\nWith Mr. Justice Galliher I regret that greater care was not taken in the Police Court proceedings, when the appellant was called as a witness, to make it certain that he fully understood that he was about to give evidence under the sanction of an invocation of the Deity (his Deity) as witness to his truthfulness. In whatever form it may be administered, that is in English law the essence of an oath. Omychund v. Barker[4]; Attorney-General v. Bradlaugh[5]; Curry v. The King[6], at pages 534 and 535.\nThe evidence on the defendant's trial for perjury fairly establishes that, before giving his testimony at the Police Court, he solemnly promised with uplifted hand to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That he said \"I swear,\" though probable, is uncertain. But he answered \"yes\" to the question: \"Is the oath you have taken binding on you?\" or, it may have been, \"binding on your conscience,\" or some equivalent term? (The Queen's Case[7].) It also appears that it is the custom of the people to whom the defendant belongs to swear by putting up the hand; and he himself was so sworn when giving evidence on his own behalf on his trial for perjury. Taking all these circumstances into account it would seem to be a not unreasonable inference that the defendant knew he was taking what was intended to be an oath\u2014 that his purpose was to have the court believe that he was swearing to tell the truth and by uplifting his hand to invoke the Deity as witness. On the whole, though not entirely satisfied that the appellant did actually call upon the Deity to witness his truthfulness, neither am I satisfied that he did not. I entertain no doubt, however, that he gave his testimony with full knowledge that it would, and with deliberate intent that it should, be received and acted upon as evidence given under oath.\nI am, for these reasons, not prepared to dissent from the judgment affirming this conviction. BRODEUR J.\u2014The appellant claims that he has not been duly sworn and that he could not then be convicted of perjury.\nHe is a Hindoo, and the evidence shews that when he was sworn the interpreter did his best to convey to the mind of the witness what he was bound to do as such. He volunteered to take the oath by the uplifting of the hand.\nAs the Chief Justice said in Curry v. The King[8]:\u2014\nHaving taken the oath in that form without objection it is an admission that the witness regarded it as binding on his conscience.\nI cannot see how the appellant may claim to-day that he has not been duly sworn.\nHe was examined in this case before the criminal court and there took the oath in the same way.\nI am of opinion that if a witness allows himself to be sworn in any form without objecting to it, he is liable to be indicted for perjury, if his testimony prove false. Best on Evidence (10 ed.), page 151.\nIt would be a pity if perjurers could escape on technicalities as the one which is raised in this case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Clarence Darling.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Sask. 1909, c. 73, ss. 3, 10\u2014Non-compliance with S.C. Rule\u2014Costs.\nA company, having its chief place of business in the Province of Quebec and incorporated under the Dominion statute with power to trade and carry on its business throughout the Dominion of Canada, did not comply with the provisions of the \u201cForeign Companies Act,\u201d R.S. Sask., 1909, ch. 73, requiring registration previous to carrying on business within the Province of Saskatchewan. In the ordinary course of its business, it sold and brought certain machinery into the province and did the work of installing it therein for a price which included setting it up and starting it working. An action for the contract price was dismissed by the judgment of the trial court (6 West. W.R. 1159), and this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, on the ground that the unregistered extra-provincial company was denied the right of action in the courts of the province by the tenth section of the \u201cForeign Companies Act.\u201d\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the judgment appealed from (7 West. W.R. 89) was reversed.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The mere setting up and starting the working of the machinery by the extra-provincial company did not constitute the carrying on of business in the Province of Saskatchewan within the meaning of the \u201cForeign Companies Act.\u201d Per Anglin J.\u2014The installation of the plant was a substantial part of the consideration of the contract and, consequently, the unregistered extra-provincial company would be denied the right of enforcing its claim by action in the courts of the province under the provisions of the tenth section of the \u201cForeign Companies Act,\u201d but, inasmuch as the legislation in question had the effect of depriving the extra-provincial company of the status, capacities and powers which were the natural and logical consequences of its incorporation by the Dominion Government, it is ultra vires of the provincial legislature and inoperative for the purpose of depriving the company of its right to maintain the action in the provincial courts. John Deere Plow Company v. Wharton ([1915] A.C. 330), applied.\nCosts were refused the appellant, on the allowance of the appeal, in consequence of non-compliance with Supreme Court Rule No. 30 in respect of the printing of the statutes regarding which questions were raised.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of His Lordship Chief Justice Haultain, at the trial[2], by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note.\nAt the opening of the argument the court announced that there could not, in any event, be any costs allowed on the appellants\u2019 factum on the appeal in consequence of non-compliance with the requirements of Supreme Court Rule No. 30 in respect to the printing of the statutes regarding which questions were to be raised on the appeal.\nAtwater K.C. for the appellants.\nThe respondents were not represented at the hearing of the appeal.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed without costs. Idington J.\u2014The appellant is a company incorporated under a Dominion charter and carrying on its business in Montreal. The respondent is, or was, carrying on business at Moose Jaw, in the Province of Saskatchewan, in succession to another company which had a contract with appellant to supply it with a refrigerating plant, on the \u201cLinde System,\u201d and erect same on the foundation prepared by the company receiving it.\nThe appellant did so and the respondent, I infer, became, in some way not clear, the company that is to pay therefor.\nThe statement of defence alleged as follows:\u2014\n2. The defendant says that the plaintiff corporation is a foreign corporation and was at the time the alleged cause of action arose and still is unregistered in the Province of Saskatchewan under the \u201cForeign Companies Ordinance\u201d and that the plaintiff is, therefore, not entitled to bring this action.\nThe learned trial judge held that the appellant, though otherwise entitled to recover, was barred thereunder by section 3 of the \u201cForeign Companies Act\u201d of Saskatchewan.\nThat section is in its first sub-section as follows:\u2014\n3. Unless otherwise provided by any. Act no foreign company having gain for its object or a part of its object shall carry on any part of its business in Saskatchewan unless it is duly registered under this Act.\nThe only pleading on the record upon which such defence is rested is the second paragraph of the statement of defence which is quoted above.\nThis does not appear to me to raise such a defence as is contemplated by section 10 of said Act which reads as follows:\u2014\n10. Any foreign company required by this Act to become registered shall not while unregistered be capable of maintaining any action or other proceeding in any court in respect of any contract made in whole or in part in Saskatchewan in the course of or in connection with business carried on without registration contrary to the provisions of section 3 hereof.\nThe plea does not bring the appellant within this section and, therefore, the defence as pleaded (Should not be held a bar to the action. This may be technical and amendable, but no one is here to ask therefor and there are no merits in the defence.\nThe third sub-section of said section 3 relied upon below is as follows:\u2014\n(3) The taking orders by travellers for goods, wares or merchandise to be subsequently imported into Saskatchewan to fill such orders or the buying or selling of such goods, wares or merchandise by correspondence, if the company has no resident agent or representative and no warehouse, office or place of business in Saskatchewan, the onus of proving which shall in any prosecution under this section rest on the accused, shall not be deemed to be carrying on business within the meaning of this Act. (1903, ch. 14, sec. 3; 1903 (2), ch. 19, sec. 1.)\nThe respondent has filed no factum and has not appeared by counsel on this appeal. Counsel for appellant relied upon the recent case of the John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[3], decided since this case was heard below, and seeks some amendment to bring this case within that.\nAs there are many features of the Act upon which that case was decided, and the Act here in question and the respective facts relevant respectively to said Acts, which may distinguish the two cases, it would be most unfortunate to have the decision turn thereon without argument.\nI do not think it is necessary to deal with the appeal from that point of view. The contract seems to be one which may well fall within the exception provided by said sub-section 3 of section 3. The appellant proved that it had no resident agent or representative and no office or place of business in Saskatchewan. The goods and machinery contracted for and other goods were shipped from Montreal and, on such reading and understanding of the contract as I am enabled to give it, I do not think the mere installation of the machinery so ordered, shipped and delivered, fairly falls within the meaning of the carrying on business in Saskatchewan. I cannot think it was intended to apply to the mere setting up and starting of machinery by a company doing no more in way of carrying on business than such acts involve. And if it did, that has been paid for, I imagine, or might be severable if we knew and understood the facts. The application of this Act made by the courts below would apply to many cases of mere agricultural machines and implements which are very commonly sold on terms of thus testing by starting them satisfactorily as we have found by experience in this court. The view of this court in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Agnew[4], does not seem to have been presented to the courts below.\nIt is also to be observed that the company\u2019s contract provided as follows:\u2014\nTaxation:\u2014All local or provincial taxes liable to be levied on outside companies or their employees to be paid by the purchaser.\nThe appellant, in any way one can look at it, was entitled to have within the Act (when acting in violation thereof) become licensed and then to proceed to recover from respondent what the trial judge found was justly due. The respondent would have had to pay, under the clause just quoted, the taxes; and the incidental expenses of procuring registration, is all that would have been involved.\nIf the words \u201cmaintaining any action\u201d in the above quoted section were liberally interpreted, in any case the action would not have to be dismissed in such a way as to put an end to the appellant\u2019s rights as it might if the legislation in question can be upheld by distinguishing it from the British Columbia legislation which certainly is of a more objectionable character than that involved in this case.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, but, as directed at the argument, without costs.\nDuff J.\u2014J concur in allowing this appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiffs are a company incorporated by the Dominion of Canada with power to trade and carry on their business throughout the Dominion. Although the definition of \u201cforeign company\u201d in the \u201cForeign Companies Act,\u201d R.S. Sask. (1909), ch. 73, is not as clear or precise as could be desired, doubtless it was meant to include, and probably does cover any Dominion corporation. This action is brought to enforce payment under a contract made with the plaintiffs in Saskatchewan.\nThe provincial courts, in my opinion property, have held that the installation by the plaintiffs, pursuant to the provisions of the contract sued upon, of the refrigerator plant which they sold to the defendants was a carrying on of a part of the plaintiffs\u2019 business in Saskatchewan within the meaning of section 3, and, therefore, brought the contract itself within the purview of section 10 of the \u201cForeign Companies Act,\u201d because it was a contract made in Saskatchewan in connection with business carried on without registration contrary to the requirements of section 3. I am, with deference, unable to read the statute as affecting only the contracts of companies which have resident agents or representatives, or warehouses, offices or places of business in Saskatchewan (section 3, sub-section 3). Companies not having resident agents or representatives, or warehouses, offices or places of business in Saskatchewan may, no doubt, though not registered, fill orders taken in Saskatchewan by travellers for goods, wares and merchandise to be subsequently imported into that province, or may make contracts by correspondence for the buying or selling of such goods, wares, or merchandise without rendering themselves subject to the provisions of the statute. But even such companies may not enforce, by action in the Saskatchewan courts, any contract made in whole or in part in Saskatchewan in connection with business carried on without registration contrary to the provision which requires that no foreign company having gain for its object shall carry on any part of its business in Saskatchewan unless registered. Although the installing of the plant may in the present case have been a comparatively insignificant part of that which the plaintiffs contracted to do, it was a substantial part of the consideration which they agreed to give to the defendants in return for their money. That installation they undertook to carry out, and it was in fact carried out, by their engineer. As put by Haultain C.J.:\u2014\nIt is not a matter of contract by correspondence; it is not purely a matter of an order for goods to be made or to be taken by a travelling salesman. It is a contract for work as well as for material \u2014for work to be done within the province that is subsequently done within the province by the plaintiff company, through their engineers who took charge of the installation of the plant. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Elwood, the installing of refrigerator plants sold by them was admittedly a part of the plaintiffs\u2019 ordinary business. Nor was the installation here in question a solitary act of business done in Saskatchewan not indicating a purpose to carry on business in that province. Oakland Sugar Mill Co. v. Fred. W. Wolf Co.[5]; Cooper Manufacturing Co. v. Ferguson[6]. There was evidence that other plants had been installed by the plaintiffs in the province, and I cannot think that this evidence should be ignored, as is suggested by Elwood, J., merely because the defendants had failed to prove that the plaintiff company was not \u201cregistered\u201d when these other transactions took place. Taking all the evidence into account, I think it sufficiently appears that what the plaintiff\u2019s did in this case was with the purpose and in the course of pursuing or carrying on such business as it could obtain in the Province of Saskatchewan and was not an isolated act, such as has in some cases been held to be insufficient to warrant a conclusion that business was being carried on. It should be noted that what is prohibited by the Saskatchewan statute is not the carrying on of the business of the company, but the carrying on of any part of its business while it remains unregistered. I respectfully concur in the view of the learned Chief Justice that there was in connection with the contract sued upon a carrying on of a part of the business of the plaintiff company in contravention of the provisions of the \u201cForeign Companies Act.\u201d\nThe question is therefore directly presented for decision whether it is intra vires of a provincial legislature to enact that, as a penalty for, or consequence of, non-compliance with a provincial statute requiring it to become registered, a Dominion company shall be denied the right to maintain actions in the provincial courts upon contracts made by it in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by its Dominion charter. In the John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[7], the Judicial Committee categorically decided that it is not, when it held (at page 341) that\nthose provisions of the \u201cCompanies\u2019 Act\u201d of British Columbia which are relied on in the present case as compelling the appellant company * * * to be registered in the province as a condition of exercising its powers or of suing in the courts, are inoperative for these purposes.\nTheir Lordships had already said (page 341):\u2014\nThe province cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers.\nFurther on they say (page 343):\u2014\nIt might have been competent to that legislature to pass laws applying to companies without distinction and requiring those that were not incorporated within the province to register for certain limited purposes such as the furnishing of information. It might also have been competent to enact that any company which had not an office and assets within the province should under a statute of general application regulating procedure, give security for costs. But their Lordships think that the provisions in question must be taken to be of quite a different character, and to have been directed to interfering with the status of Dominion companies, and to preventing them from exercising the powers conferred on them by the Parliament of Canada, dealing with a matter which was not entrusted under section 92 to the provincial legislature. The analogy of the decision of this Board in Union Colliery Co. V. Bryden[8] therefore applies. They are unable to place the limited construction upon the word \u201cincorporation\u201d occurring in that section which was contended for by the respondents and by the learned counsel who argued the case for the province. They think that the legislation in question really strikes at capacities which are the natural and logical consequences of the incorporation by the Dominion Government of companies with other than provincial objects.\nNo doubt the British Columbia statute contained objectionable provisions not found in the Saskatchewan Act, such as that requiring a foreign company to submit to a change in its corporate name as a condition of securing registration should the registrar deem it proper to demand such a change. But the sections of the Saskatchewan Act which are invoked by the defendants in this case I am unable to distinguish on any substantial ground from the corresponding provisions of the British Columbia legislation which were under consideration in the John Deere Plow Company\u2019s Case[9]. Legislation excluding Dominion corporations, because they are not registered in conformity with the requirements of the provincial statute, from access to the provincial courts for the purpose of enforcing contracts made by them in the exercise of their charter powers is something which, as I understand the opinion delivered by the Lord Chancellor, the Privy Council has explicitly declared to be ultra vires of a provincial legislature, because it\nreally strikes at capacities which are the natural and logical consequences of the incorporation by the Dominion Government\nand\nthe status and powers of a Dominion company as such cannot be destroyed by provincial legislation.\nI am for this reason of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed. Brodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Willoughby, Craig, McWilliams & Benyon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Caldwell & Fraser.\n[1] 7 West.

C.R. 265) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], granting the petition of the respondents, with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported. St. Germain K.C. and J. A. Ritchie for the appellants.\nJ. F. Edgar for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The only doubt I have entertained in this case arises out of the contention of Mr. Ritchie that the Exchequer Court had not jurisdiction to hear and determine it. That contention was based upon the limited construction placed by him upon the sections of the \u201cTrade Marks and Designs Act\u201d applicable, namely, sections 11, 12 and 13, and section 42.\nAn application had been made by the respondent company to the Minister for the registration of the trade mark \u201cVulcan\u201d to be used in connection with the sale of their matches.\nThe application was refused on the ground that the word \u201cVulcan\u201d had been registered as a trade mark in January, 1894, in the name of Quintal & Sons and now stood in the name of appellants, Bergeron, Whissell & Co., and that without their consent further action could not be taken by the Department.\nThe appellants\u2019 contention on this branch of the case was that it was absolutely in the power of the Minister under the 12th section of the Act to refer, or decline to refer, the matter of such an application to the Exchequer Court of Canada and that unless and until such reference was made that court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter.\nSection 42 of the Act is as follows:\u2014\n42. The Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney-General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the register of trade marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the court thinks fit, or the court may refuse the application.\n* * * * *\n3. The court may, in any proceedings under this section, decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide for the rectification of any such register.\nIt was contended that this section was only for the correction of errors in the registry and that it does not extend to errors made by the authority of the Minister, but, if I understood the argument correctly, is limited to clerical errors, or errors which had crept in without the Minister\u2019s authority. As to clerical errors, the section clearly does not refer to them. They are provided for by section 40. As to the limitation upon the section that the errors are to be confined to those made without the Minister\u2019s authority, I cannot see any justification for it in reason or in the statute.\nThe error complained of in this case was in the making of an entry of the trade mark \u201cVulcan\u201d in the name of Quintal & Sons in an unlimited form, which covered \u201cmatches,\u201d as to which plaintiffs had acquired a right to a trade mark, as well as other articles about which there is no contention. It was a substantial and not a technical or clerical error and was made, as the decision in this case shews, \u201cwithout sufficient cause,\u201d within my construction of those words in the section.\nThe effect of the decisions under the English Act is that the words \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d used in both statutes embrace any one who may possibly be injured by the continuance of the mark on the register in the form and to the extent it is so registered. Re Rivi\u00e8re\u2019s Trade Mark[2], and on further hearing[3]; Re Apolinaris Co.\u2019s Trade Mark[4]; Re Trade Mark of Wright, Grossly & Co.[5]. Quite apart from these decisions I should have been prepared to hold that the plaintiffs are quite within the words of the section \u201cany person aggrieved,\u201d and are not, as suggested by Mr. Ritchie, mere \u201coutlaws\u201d not within the purview of the Act at all.\nThen it was contended on the authority of an observation made by Lindley L.J., in Re Trade Mark \u201cNormal\u201d[6], at page 245, that the words \u201cwithout sufficient cause\u201d in the sections of both Acts are the controlling words and do not cover the error or mistake the plaintiff in his action seeks to have rectified. But it seems to me the observation of the Lord Justice had reference only to the question before him in the case and under the English statute he was then dealing with, namely, whether a person whose application to register a trade mark had been refused by the comptroller, could appeal direct to the court from such refusal as a person aggrieved by the omission of his name from the register under section 90 of the \u201cPatents, Designs and Trade Marks Act, 1883,\u201d or must take the special course prescribed by section 62 of appealing to the Board of Trade from the comptroller\u2019s decision. The court held that the latter was his proper remedy and that an appeal did not lie to the court.\nThe sections in the English Act and in the Dominion Act are not at all the same. Nor is the scheme for the registration and control of trade mark in the Dominion analogous to that in Great Britain. Under the English Act an appeal lies from the decision of the comptroller to the Board of Trade and that body may, if they think fit, hear it themselves or may refer it to the court for hearing and in the case of such reference the court has jurisdiction to enter upon and determine all questions arising upon the objections, including, in a case where the comptroller has already registered the mark, the question whether the mark has been rightly admitted on the register. Re Arbenz\u2019 Application[7]. An observation made by Lindley L.J., at page 264, of that case, is in point as applicable to the argument here. He says, dealing with the argument of want of jurisdiction:\u2014\nThe consequence of adopting that conclusion, as was candidly admitted, would be that we shall be precluded from doing what is right upon evidence, simply because the comptroller has done what he thought was right without evidence, a state of things which would be utterly intolerable. I have no doubt whatever that on the true construction of section 69 the whole case is properly before the court, and that being so, and the conclusion at which I have arrived from the evidence being what it is, I have no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, this appeal ought to be allowed.\nUnder the Dominion Act there is no appeal from the Minister\u2019s decision and counsel for the appellants conceded that, if the Minister refused an application to register a trade mark under the 11th section of the Dominion Act and did not choose to refer to the Exchequer Court the matter of the application, the applicant, no matter how much aggrieved he might be, would be without any remedy. Lord Justice Lindley simply held that section 90 of the English Act did\nnot apply to the case which was for the comptroller subject to the superior control of the Board of Trade to determine. His reasoning would not apply to our statute which does not give any appeal from the registration of the trade mark or from the refusal to register, and if the court was without jurisdiction to give an aggrieved party a remedy there would arise what Lord Lindley calls \u201ca state of things which would be utterly intolerable.\u201d\nSections 11 and 42 of the \u201cTrade Marks Act\u201d must be read in conjunction with section 23 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d which conferred jurisdiction upon that court inter alia,\nin all cases in which it is sought * * * to have any entry in any registry of copyrights, trade marks or industrial designs made, expunged, varied or rectified.\nThe jurisdiction conferred by the words of this section is broad and general, quite sufficiently so to cover the case now before us and I decline to read a limitation into the language of Parliament which would confine that jurisdiction either to references made to the court by the Minister under section 12 of the \u201cTrade Marks Act,\u201d or to omissions in entries, or entries made without sufficient cause in the register of trade marks under section 42, if any such limited meaning is to be given to the words \u201cwithout sufficient cause,\u201d as counsel suggest. Such a suggested limitation would in a large measure operate to defeat the object and purpose of the \u201cTrade Marks Act\u201d and the jurisdiction section of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d above quoted.\nThe two statutes were passed at the same session of Parliament. The plaintiff in this case is clearly a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d within the words of section 42, as appears by the decisions I have referred to above and in my opinion the court had jurisdiction either under it or under section 23 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d to hear and determine plaintiffs\u2019 application to have the register of the appellants\u2019 trade mark rectified by limiting it in the manner it has done.\nIn Canada Foundry Co. v. Bucyrus Co.[8], a case similar to that now at bar, both in the Exchequer Court and in this court, jurisdiction was entertained without doubt or question.\nAs to the facts and merits of the case, 1 have only to say that I concur in the disposition of the case made by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court and with his reasoning.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014If we observe the historical development of the Exchequer Court jurisdiction relative to registration of trade marks I think no difficulty in regard thereto exists in this case. Originally the Minister had been entrusted with absolute discretion free from other judicial supervision of what he might do in the course of granting or refusing registration. This was continued down to the time of the Revised Statutes of Canada, in 1886, ch. 63. By section 11 of the said chapter, formerly section 15 of 42 Vict. ch. 22, the Minister of Agriculture and his deputy were given limited judicial powers of determining the rights of rival claimants.\nEvidently this, after some years\u2019 experience in its use, had been found unsatisfactory and was repealed by 53 Vict. ch. 14, sec. 1, which substituted therefor a section giving the Minister power in such cases to defer his decision till the matter in question had been passed upon by the Exchequer Court, which was empowered, by section 2, to bear such cases as the Minister had found a difficulty in dealing with. The Minister was to be guided by the order of the Exchequer Court. As a precautionary measure it was declared this new section should not be held to take away or affect the jurisdiction of any other court.\nThe scheme provided thereby in a rather clumsy manner seems to have been found unsatisfactory. The next step was taken, in 1891, by the enactment of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 35, sec. 1, which repealed sections 11, 12 and 32 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 63, as it then stood amended by the foregoing Act.\nIn substitution therefor there was enacted a judicial code, as it were, for dealing with the whole matter.\nIt is quite clear to my mind that there was provided by this later statute just what it enacts, that the Minister if he thought fit might refer the matter of what he is entrusted with by the first sub-section, to the Exchequer Court which in such case was empowered to hear and determine any matter so referred.\nIn any case so falling under that sub-section of this lastly amending Act or of the entire provision above referred to of the previous session, the argument addressed to us relative to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court should have been entitled to prevail.\nBut over and above all that, section 12 of the Act thus amended created an entirely new and independent jurisdiction in the Exchequer Court.\nThat section 12 is now, slightly amended, section 42 of the Act as in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, and reads as follows:\u2014\n42. The Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney-General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the register of trade marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the court thinks fit; or the court may refuse the application.\n2. In either case, the court may make such order with respect to the costs of the proceedings as the court thinks fit.\n3. The court may, in any proceedings under this section, decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide for the rectification of any such register.\nThere does not seem to me any room for doubt as to the intention to create thus a jurisdiction wholly independent of the will of the Minister and that thereunder the Exchequer Court has the power to make such an order as made herein provided always the evidence warrants such an order being made and that from such order an appeal will lie here.\nI can understand the contention that the facts do not warrant such an order as made herein, but I cannot quite understand any one appealing here trying to deny the jurisdiction of the court and yet appealing here.\nIf the contention is right appellants need not concern themselves with the result. Besides there has been in such case no final judgment. There may be an obvious fallacy in this suggestion, but 1 think it is quite as arguable as that there is no independent jurisdiction created.\nOn the merits of this case there seems to me to be but one rather serious difficulty, and that is that the predecessor in title of the appellant got without fraud a general trade mark registered and that the respondents failed to question it for at least sixteen years thereafter.\nThe effect of this under ordinary circumstances would perhaps be fatal to such a suit as this. For usually any business firm having adopted a trade mark uses it. But if we accept the learned judge\u2019s view of the facts this firm, which registered what appellants now claim, never used the mark in connection with their dealings in matches. Nor did appellants until three or four years before this action.\nIt was so easy, if this finding is not correct, to have put the matter beyond the shadow of doubt that the finding must stand so far as I am concerned.\nThe match manufacturer who departs from the use of his own trade mark and fill orders for a wholesale grocer to put up matches under the latter\u2019s trade mark I imagine does so reluctantly and only under well guarded stipulations relative thereto and tempted by better profit than he can make by adhering to his own trade mark. Such a dealing is not an ordinary everyday transaction such as a housewife ordering home a few bunches or boxes of matches in a way liable to be forgotten.\nThat no further proof of actual use of the trade mark was attempted than this record shews is most suggestive. That was the crucial point of this case. In it appellants fail. If they or their predecessors ever so habitually used, in relation to the selling of matches, this trade mark, they could have proved it up to the hilt and thereby invoked the authorities which might have maintained in a case so made out the abandonment of all claims on the part of respondent to interfere therewith.\nThe term \u201cgeneral trade mark\u201d is so indefinite that I am not quite fully prepared to accept what seems to be the view of the learned trial judge that because the dealing in a particular article may properly fall within the ordinary course of a business classified as, for example, \u201cwholesale grocers,\u201d therefore, every possible article within that class must, for the purposes of this Act, be held covered by the trade mark adopted and used by a wholesale grocer.\nThe wholesale grocer may, in fact, confine his trade to a few articles; and he may expand or contract his list just as his capital and facilities for and perhaps necessities of business may demand.\nWithout going further than this to illustrate my meaning I think the course of dealing and of use of a general trade mark in relation thereto for a number of years after registration of such a trade mark may well be looked at as the measure of what was claimed and intended to be registered. If a firm having registered as herein such a general trade mark for ten or twelve or more years, never used it but for limited purposes and then assigned to another, I think that other got nothing beyond that which its assignor by use and mode of dealing had thus and thereby rendered definite.\nIf it had been shewn that the firm registering had prior thereto in fact used the trade mark more extensively, in the sense of covering a greater variety of kinds of articles and dealings, than it chose to apply it to later than the registration, 1 by no means think it would have lost its property therein. It is possible to lose by abandonment property of any kind. But it is not the case of abandonment by the firm registering we have to deal with so much as the finding of what the firm really intended to register.\nI would measure that in such a vague and uncertain notice of registration as in evidence here and, no evidence being given of the use of such trade mark anterior thereto, by the conduct of those registering.\nSo looked at I cannot find the appellants ever had in law that which they claim herein. There is another and probably much more powerful reason for holding they never had that which they claim.\nThe respondent had beyond any doubt used most extensively the said trade mark all over the world, including Canada. The use thereof in Canada was not extensive, but clearly anterior to the registration, and such as to preclude the claim of the predecessor of appellants to register as regards matches, or by terms comprehensive of that which they had no legal property in or right to use.\nIt certainly was the property of respondent when the appellants\u2019 predecessors appropriated it to describe what they wanted in way of a general trade mark, and any such claim as made thereby must be limited accordingly.\nThe registration is of that and only that which at the time of registration was the property of him registering. Clearly this registration if to be interpreted as covering the selling of matches was void, for the property therein was then in respondent and, to use the language of section 42, the entry was made \u201cwithout sufficient cause.\u201d\nI must wholly dissent from the view urged so well by Mr. Ritchie that this registration creates a right not only akin to but also identical in kind with that created by a patent. The right of property always existed in a trade mark and was after much difference of opinion in regard to its being property finally so recognized about the time when our Act relative to trade marks was first passed. See the case of Leather Cloth Co. v. The American Leather Cloth Co.[9]. It is the purpose of procuring a system of registration of such property that is the design of the Act now in question and for the convenience and security of business men is enforced by restricting, as section 20 of the Act does, the right in law to assert the right of protecting such property.\nIt is just there that the necessity exists for an independent authoritative jurisdiction such as section 42 creates in order to protect those who may inadvertently have been thus prim\u00e2 facie deprived of the protection in the enjoyment of their property.\nI conclude that the respondent is a part thus aggrieved by the registration of something which appears to deny its right and hence entitled to invoke the powers given in said section.\nThe use of the trade mark by the respondent, may not have been extensive, but it was continuous from 1882 down to 1896 and cannot within the principles upon which the case of Mouson & Co. v. Boehm[10] proceeded, be held to have been abandoned toy non-use in Canada in later years.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I have been unable to satisfy myself that the Exchequer Court possesses the jurisdiction it has exercised in this case and on that ground I should allow the appeal. My learned brothers are, however, unanimous in thinking otherwise and as the point of jurisdiction involves no question of general principle, but only the construction of particular statutory provisions with respect to which the decision of this court in this case will be conclusive, there seems to be no object in entering at large upon my own particular views.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The respondents are manufacturers, in Sweden, of matches on which they have been using since 1870, throughout the world, the trade mark \u201cVulcan.\u201d From that period to 1894 they have shipped to Canada some cases of their goods bearing that trade mark.\nIn 1894, the assignors of the appellants, Quintal & Sons, wholesale grocers in Montreal, had the trade mark \u201cVulcan\u201d registered in connection with their business and they have been using extensively that trade mark since. Later on the firm of Quintal & Sons was dissolved and the appellants acquired the assets of that firm, including that trade mark.\nThe respondents, in 1910, sought to secure registration of their trade mark in Canada to be used in connection with the sale of matches. This was refused by the Minister of Agriculture because there had already been such a trade mark registered for the appellants.\nThe Swedish manufacturers then applied to the Exchequer Court, under section 42, to have their trade mark registered as far as matches are concerned and to expunge and vary the trade mark registered in favour of the appellants. The Exchequer Court maintained the petition and ordered that the trade mark \u201cVulcan\u201d should be registered in favour of the Swedish manufacturers as far as matches were concerned and prevented the appellants using their general trade mark on matches. The main contention of appellants is that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter and they rely on section 42 of the \u201cTrade Mark and Designs Act,\u201d which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney-General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the said register of trade marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the court thinks fit; or the court may refuse the application.\nI am unable to agree with that proposition that the Exchequer Court was without jurisdiction.\nFormerly, the Minister of Agriculture was the only authority that could decide whether a trade mark should be registered or not. (R.S.C., 1886, ch. 63, sec. 11.) Provision was made also that if there was any contest as to the rights of parties to use a trade mark, the matter could be settled by the Minister.\nIt was found evident that the exercise of such judicial functions was more or less advisable to be made by the Minister and, in 1890, the law was amended and it was provided that if the Minister was not satisfied that the person was entitled to the exclusive use of the trade mark, he should cause all persons interested to be notified that the question should be decided by the Exchequer Court and the entry should be subsequently made in the register after the decision of that court. Then the matter could be brought up before the Exchequer Court upon information of the Attorney-General of Canada and at the relation of any party interested (53 Vict. ch. 14, sees. 1 and 2).\nThe same Act of 1890 provided also that if there were errors in registering a trade mark and oversight in regard to conflicting registration, that could be remedied and corrected by the Exchequer Court. In 1891, Parliament dealt again with that question of jurisdiction. In proceeding to amend the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d it was stated that that court had jurisdiction in all cases of conflicting applications for any trade mark, or in which it was sought to impeach or annul any entry in any register of trade marks, or in cases of infringement (54 & 55 Viet., ch. 26, sec. 4).\nIn the same year, by the Act of 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 35, secs. 1 and 2, it was at first provided that the Minister could refuse a trade mark and then power was given to him to refer the matter to the Exchequer Court and, then, a section was enacted corresponding word for word with the above section 42 that we find in the Revised Statutes of 1906.\nThe history of that legislation convinces me very conclusively that the matter which was at first exclusively in the hands of the Minister and under his judicial control could now be dealt with by the Exchequer Court. The Minister can register any trade mark, or refuse registration, but that would not prevent the Exchequer Court deciding whether the trade mark had been properly registered, or whether the omission of registration had been properly decided by the administrative authority.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction in the premises and could give the order which has been given.\nNow the evidence shews that the trade mark \u201cVulcan\u201d had been used in Canada by the Swedish manufacturers before the general trade mark of the appellants was registered. Then, when Quintal & Sons applied for the registration of a general trade mark, if all the facts had been known, the Department would have rejected their application.\nFor those reasons, the judgment a quo should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Belcourt, Ritchie & Chevrier.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.

Until fully paid for the buildings were to remain the property of M. who was to retain possession and operate the elevators and all net revenues were to be applied in reduction of the price for which they had been constructed. M. also owned lands in Saskatchewan, known as the \u201cKirkella Lands,\u201d which he had agreed to sell to purchasers under agreements under seal, in his possession in Manitoba at the time of his death, by which he remained owner until they had been fully paid for and then the lands were to be conveyed to the purchasers. The agreements contained no specific covenant to pay the price of the lands. The executors denied the right of the Government of Manitoba to collect succession duties. in respect of these debts under the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act,\u201d R.S.M., 1902, ch. 161, sec. 5, as re-enacted by the Manitoba statute 4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 45, sec. 4.\nPer curiam.\u2014The debt due under the contract with L. constituted property within the Province of Manitoba and, as such, was liable for succession duty as provided by the Manitoba statute. Also Davies J. dissenting, that under the agreements for sale of the \u201cKirkella Lands\u201d a covenant to pay should be implied and, consequently, they were specialty debts which, as such, constituted property within the Province of Manitoba and were liable for succession duty there.\nPer Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The duties imposed by the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d are direct taxation and, consequently, the legislation imposing them is intra vires of the provincial legislature.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The provincial legislature is competent to impose taxation as a condition for obtaining the benefit of probate.\nPer Duff J.\u2014In so far as the statute professes to impose duties in respect of property having a situs within Manitoba it is intra vires of the provincial legislature. Rex v. Lovitt ([1912] A.C. 212) followed. In so far as the statute professes to impose duties on property not having a situs in Manitoba, and without respect to the domicile of the owner, the reasoning of Lord Moulton in Cotton v. The King ([1914] A.C. 176), applies, the result of which is that such taxation if effectual in cases in which the beneficiary is domiciled abroad cannot be \u201cdirect taxation\u201d within the meaning of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The succession duties imposed by the Manitoba statute are not fees payable for services rendered, but constitute taxation subject to the restrictions mentioned in item 2 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The provisions of the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d in respect to taxation which may be ultra vires may be treated as severable and do not render the statute ineffective as a whole.\nIdington and Anglin JJ. questioned the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada under sub-section (d) of section 37 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d to entertain an appeal in a matter or proceeding originating in the Surrogate Court of Manitoba.\nAnglin J. suggested that in the proceedings provided for by section 19 of the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d the judge of the Surrogate Court would act as persona designata and that there may not be an appeal from his order to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe judgment appealed from (24 Man. R. 310) was affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of the judge of the Surrogate Court for the Eastern Judicial District of Manitoba by which it was declared that the estate of the late Robert Muir was liable for succession duties, claimed by the Government of the Province of Manitoba, in respect of the debts owing under a contract for the construction of buildings in the Province of Saskatchewan and under certain agreements for the sale of lands in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThe circumstances in which the Government of Manitoba claimed the succession duties in question are stated in the head-note and the issues raised on the present appeal are fully discussed in the judgments now reported.\nW. R. Mulock K.C. for the appellants.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and R. B. Graham for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014In this appeal important questions were raised not only as to whether the \u201cSuccession Duties Acts\u201d of the Province of Manitoba were ultra vires the legislature of that province on the ground that the duties they imposed were indirect taxation, but also, in case the acts were intra vires the legislature, whether certain properties consisting of debts due to the testator at the time of the death, from parties some of whom were residents of Manitoba and others of whom resided abroad, were subject to the provisions of the Act. In the latter case, the contention was that these debts were \u201cspecialties\u201d and for that reason were so subject. As to the \u201cLittle debt,\u201d it being a simple contract debt and both debtor and creditor being residents of Manitoba, it could have no local situation other than the residence of the debtor where the assets to satisfy it would presumably be and would be bona notabilia within Manitoba where he resided. Commissioners of Stamps v. Hope[2], at p. 482, cited with approval in Rex v. Lovitt[3], at p. 218.\nAs to the debts due or claimed in respect of the lands near Kirkella in Saskatchewan being specialty debts, by reason of the recital in the several agreements of sale and purchase entered into by the testator with certain purchasers under seal, I have come to the conclusion that these debts are not \u201cspecialties\u201d which come within the meaning of the principle \u201cmobilia sequuntur personam\u201d I think the rule laid down in Marryat v. Marryat[4], and in Isaacson v. Harwood[5], applies to these agreements of sale and that no covenant to pay can be implied from the mere recital. The agreements did not contain any express covenant to pay the purchase money and the only question is whether one must be implied from the recital. I cannot understand how such an implication could create such a \u201ccorporal existence\u201d with respect to this debt as would change its locality and make the debts \u201cconspicuous\u201d within the jurisdiction where the agreement happened to be found with the testator at the time of his death. But in any case, and supposing the rule to be as applicable to the case of an implied as of an express covenant to pay, it remains a pure question of the construction of the agreements. What did the parties intend? If they intended that the recital should operate as a covenant, then the debtor would be liable accordingly. But it seems to me clear that the recital was not inserted for the simple purpose of acknowledging a debt by a deed under seal without any other object declared by the deed in which case a covenant to pay might be implied. On the contrary, the object and purpose of the agreement was to create a binding contract for the sale of a piece of land and to shew how and when the purchaser was to complete the payments of the purchase money, in order that he might obtain his title. As to the intention of the parties, the fact that the agreements do contain express covenants as to money that might be expended by the vendor in paying insurance rather goes to shew that where it was intended there should be a covenant to pay moneys under the agreement it was so expressed. Those agreements even if a covenant to pay the purchase money could be implied from the language of the recital are not, I agree with Perdue J.A., of the Court of Appeal, like money bonds, scrip or mortgages containing express covenants to pay money, etc. Before the executors could have any right to recover the purchase moneys under these agreements, they would have to obtain probate of the will in Saskatchewan and have the lands transmitted to them in accordance with the statute of that province. They have no rights under the agreements until they have put themselves in a position to perform the vendor\u2019s obligations under them. They could not recover the purchase moneys until they had obtained power to convey the lands to the purchaser and they could only obtain such power by having their probate of the will re-sealed in Saskatchewan, the statutory equivalent of taking out ancillary probate there.\nThese instruments are mere agreements for the sale of land in Saskatchewan and involve mutual obligations on the part of vendor and vendee which can only be performed under the laws of that province and which cannot be enforced by the appellant executors until they have first complied with those laws.\nThe most important question, however, still remains, namely, whether the \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d of the Province of Manitoba was intra vires of the legislature of that province.\nThe contention on the part of the appellant was that the construction to be put upon this Act and other similar succession duties Acts of the different provinces of the Dominion, was decided by the Judicial Committee in the recent case of Cotton v. The King[6]. In that case it was held that the Quebec \u201cSuccession Duties Acts\u201d did not impose duties upon the transmission of movable property outside of the province and that the taxation imposed by them on such property was not direct taxation within the meaning of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d and was consequently ultra vires the legislature of the province.\nIf this contention as made by the appellants was sustained, of course this appeal should have to be allowed and the results in the several provinces of the Dominion would be most serious and disquieting.\nI have reached the conclusion after a very careful study of this decision of the Judicial Committee in the Cotton Case[7], that it does not warrant the broad contention stated above.\nThe language made use of by Lord Moulton, who delivered the judgment, in parts of his judgment dealing with the transmission of movable property outside of the province, was very broad and general and would seem at first sight to justify the conclusion that all succession duties Acts of the several provinces necessarily violated the constitutional prohibition against provincial indirect taxation.\nI do not think, however, their Lordships intended by any means to go that far or, indeed, to go any further than the specific question then before them required them to go. The language used by Lord Moulton must be read as only having reference to this special question they were in that case called upon to decide, namely, whether the Quebec Legislature imposed succession duties or had power to do so upon the transmission of movable property outside of the province.\nIn the Cotton Case[8] the duties had been levied upon two estates: first, on that of Charlotte L. Cotton; and, afterwards, on that of her husband, Henry H. Cotton, whom Charlotte predeceased.\nA distinction was attempted to be made between the law as it stood at the death of Charlotte L. Cotton and as it was afterwards amended and stood at the death of Henry H. Cotton, and it was there contended that the amendment defining the meaning of the term \u201cproperty\u201d expressly included\nall movables wherever situate of persons having their domicile or residing in the Province of Quebec at the time of their deaths. Their Lordships, however, were of the opinion that this amended definition of the word \u201cproperty\u201d did not enlarge the express language of the operative clause of the Act which provided that of this property (that is the property made subject to the duties) those portions only are taxed which are \u201cbiens situ\u00e9s dans la province.\u201d\nDealing with this Act before it was amended and with reference to Charlotte L. Cotton\u2019s estate, His Lordship says at page 186:\u2014\nNo question arises as to the applicability of the doctrine mobilia sequuntur personam, because the section expressly limited the taxation to property in the province, and, therefore, whether or not the province possessed and might have exercised a right to tax movable property locally situated outside of the province, (such right arising from the domicile of the testatrix) it did not see fit so to do. For the same reason no question of ultra vires arises in this part of the case, since the appellants do not dispute the power of the Quebec Legislature to tax movable property situated in the province.\nDealing next with the Act after it was amended and with reference to Henry H. Cotton\u2019s estate, he says:\u2014\nThe same consideration which was decisive in the former case (Charlotte L. Cotton\u2019s), therefore, applies with equal force here.\nHis Lordship having thus disposed of the appeal with respect to the claims for succession duties on each of the two estates, on the ground that the statute either as originally enacted or as subsequently amended did not authorize the taxation of movable property situate outside of the province, went on to consider whether the succession duty imposed would be within the definition of an indirect tax if it be taken that the duty was imposed on all the property of the testator wherever situate \u2014 that is on the assumption that the limited words \u201cproperty situate within the province\u201d were deleted from the operative taxing section.\nAfter quoting a number of the sections of the Act, he concludes that they only can be construed as\nentitling the collector of Inland Revenue to collect the whole of the duties on the estate from the person making the declaration under oath of a complete schedule of the estate required by the sections quoted and who must recover the amount so paid from the assets of the estate or more accurately from the persons interested therein.\nTaking as an instance the facts of the case, then before him, of movables in New York bequeathed to one domiciled in Quebec, and stating that there was no accepted principle in international law to the effect that nations should recognize or enforce the fiscal laws of foreign countries \u2014 and that in such a case the legatee would, on duly proving the execution of the will, obtain the possession and ownership of such securities after satisfying the fiscal laws of New York relating thereto, he asks: How then would the provincial Government in such case obtain the payment of the succession duty? And answers his question by saying that it could only be from some one who was not intended himself to bear the burden but to be recouped by some one else, and that\nsuch an impost appeared to their Lordships plainly to lie outside the definition of direct taxation accepted by this Board in previous cases.\nTo assume that by this judgment the Judicial Committee intended to reverse many previous decisions of the Board which had held either expressly or by necessary implications that succession duty statutes properly framed and imposing taxes on movable or other property within the province were intra vires the legislatures which enacted them, would be unjustifiable. In the case of Rex v. Lovitt[9] their Lordships expressly held, at page 223, that the statute of New Brunswick there in question\nwas intended to be a direct burden on that property (i.e., taxable property within the province) varying in amount according to the relationship of the successor to the testator.\nNothing is said in the judgment of the Board now under review calling in question this declaration of the intention and effect of the New Brunswick \u201cSuccession Duties Act.\u201d The only reference made to that case is as follows:\u2014\nIn the case of Rex v. Lovitt9 no question arose as to the power of a province to levy succession duty situated outside the province.\nAnd so in regard to Woodruff v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[10], the decision of the Judicial Committee in which, when the Cotton Case[11] was before us I considered as binding upon us, and followed, the only remark they made is that\nthe circumstances of the case were so special and there is so much doubt as to the reasoning on which the decision was based that their Lordships have felt that it is better not to treat it as governing or affecting the present decision.\nBut not a suggestion that the Ontario \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d so far as it levied taxes upon property within the province was ultra vires the legislature.\nAssuming, therefore, I am correct in my understanding of the decision reached by their Lordships in the Cotton Case11, I come to the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d as it stood amended at the death of the testator Muir and under which the taxes in dispute in this case are levied. With respect to the \u201cKirkella lands\u201d of the testator, situated in Saskatchewan, and the debts arising out of the agreements for the sale thereof I have already expressed my opinion that they do not come within the Act and are not taxable.\nAnd with regard to the subject matter the statute deals with I am of opinion that it is direct taxation and not indirect. I accept the definition of direct taxation as\none which is demanded from the very person whom it is intended should pay it,\nand I think that the taxes sought to be imposed by that statute are such.\nIt is the estate that must pay the tax and it is the estate upon which the statute imposes the liability. The fact that the executor or the administrator is the channel through which the estate makes payment cannot make the tax indirect. He represents the estate. It is, in fact, by the law of Manitoba all vested in him and in paying the duties when he does so, he acts merely as the agent or person in charge of the estate.\nThe question is one of intention or expectation. Did the legislature either expect or intend that the executor or administrator should pay money out of his own pocket and afterwards take his chances of recovering it back from the legatee or beneficiary to whom the property was bequeathed or who by law became entitled to it?\nThe statute answers the question I think in its 15th and 16th sections, which read as follows:\u2014\n15. Any administrator, executor or trustee, having in charge or trust, any estate, legacy or property subject to the said duty shall deduct the duty therefrom, or collect the duty thereon upon the appraised value thereof, from the person entitled to such property, and he shall not deliver any property subject to duty to any person until he has collected the duty thereon.\n16. Executors, administrators, and trustees shall have power to sell so much of the property of the deceased as will enable them to pay said duty in the same manner as they may be or are enabled by law so to do for the payment of debts of the testator or intestate.\nHere executors and trustees are classed together. They are to deduct the duty from the property under their charge or which they hold in trust or collect it from the beneficiary, and are forbidden to deliver any property subject to duty to any person until the duty is collected. They are given power to sell so much of the property of deceased as will enable them to pay the duty in the same manner as they may do to pay the debts of the testator or intestate. If the property is of a character enabling them to deduct the duty they do so. If it is not they collect the duty from the beneciary or sell so much of the property as will enable them to pay the duty. But there is neither an intention nor an expectancy that they would pay, nor an obligation imposed upon them to pay, the duty out of their own moneys and take the chances of recovering it back from the beneficiary.\nIt must be remembered that in Manitoba the executor or administrator is by statute made for the time being the owner of all the property of the deceased testator or intestate as the case may be. Section 21 of the \u201cDevolution of Estates Act\u201d as enacted by 5 & 6 Edw. VII., ch. 21, sec. 1, and section 20 of the \u201cWills Act,\u201d R.S.M., 1902, ch. 174\nBut, of course, he only holds it for the purpose of administering the estate and as I have shewn is expressly empowered by section 16 of the \u201cSuccession Duties Act,\u201d to sell the property to pay the tax.\nSection 5 of that Act says:\u2014\nSave as aforesaid the following property shall be subject to a succession duty as hereinafter provided. and sub-section (a) says:\u2014\nAll property within this province and any interest or income therefrom\nshall be liable to the duties. Section 6 provides for the filing by the executors or administrator before the issue of letters probate or grant of administration\nof a full itemized inventory of all the property of the deceased person and the market value at the death of such deceased person,\nand goes on to provide either for the payment by the executor or administrator of the duties called for by the Act or for the delivery of a prescribed bond conditioned for the due payment of any duty to which the property coming to the hands of such executor may be found liable.\nI conclude that the duties under this Act were to be, as they were determined by the Judicial Commitee to be in the Lovitt Case[12],\na direct burden on the property varying in amount according to the relationship of the successor to the testator,\nand so to be burdens which the legislature had authority to impose.\nI would, therefore, vary the judgment appealed from by excluding from the property subject to duty the debts arising out of the agreements for the sale of the \u201cKirkella lands\u201d in the Province of Saskatchewan as not being specialties within the rule and with this variation I would dismiss the appeal, but without costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The question of jurisdiction raised at the opening of the argument herein, is, in my opinion, so far from being beyond doubt that if either party had taken or maintained the objection I think we should have refused to exercise so doubtful a jurisdiction.\nThe parties hereto seem tacitly agreed we should act. Hence we may be justified in ignoring the doubt though, if that consent be our only right to hear them, the result may be a non-appealable judgment such as appears in Attorney-General of Nova Scotia v. Gregory[13].\nIt is upon the amendment of 52 Vict., ch, 37 (D.), alone that our jurisdiction, if any, must rest. It seems, in one way of reading it, possibly wide enough to confer jurisdiction in any case relative to what is involved in the probate of wills. But is the question to be determined herein at all of that nature? It may be that the legislature in the due exercise of its plenary power over civil rights in a province can say, as a condition precedent to anything being done in its courts, constituted by it with such limitations of authority as it has seen fit to confer, that such courts shall not hear the application for probate unless and until the tax for transmission has been secured and hence make the refusal to grant or granting of probate dependent thereon. But what has all that to do with the plain primary meaning of a \u201ccourt of probate\u201d acting as such or how can it bring this appeal within that term as used in the amending Act?\nI take the phrase \u201ccourt of probate\u201d in the sense indicated, for example, in Pattison\u2019s Trustees v. Edinburgh University[14], referred to in vol. 4, page 437, of Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary.\nBut if all the judgments pursuant to any of the powers assigned to and exercised by said courts (called \u201cSurrogate\u201d in Ontario and the Western Provinces) in a variety of ways beyond the mere granting or refusing of probate were to be held reviewable here whenever involving five hundred dollars, then it seems singular that this court has not been troubled ere this with some such case as might fall within the ambit of that view.\nIt is not the work of the court when acting in hearing the application for probate that we are herein asked to pass upon.\nThe Maritime provinces have called their courts dealing with such matters \u201cCourts of Probate\u201d and a number of appeals resting upon said amendment have come from there, but none involving any mere collateral matter without touching upon what is, properly speaking, the work of a court of probate has been cited in argument herein.\nThat is a remarkable result if the expression is to be held as covering anything, else done in or by said court than what I suggest. It is to be observed that the case of Lovitt v. The King[15] came here by virtue of a case stated for the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe exclusion of Quebec (where there are no courts bearing the name \u201cprobate,\u201d but the Superior Court in certain cases discharges the duty involved) from the operation of the Act, rather clearly indicates we should not attach too much significance to the name, but look at the substance and confine appeals within the limits which that indicates.\nHaving thus indicated the reasons for my doubt I accept what seemed on the argument to be the opinion of the majority of this court as to its jurisdiction as binding me, and accordingly proceed to pass upon the questions raised by the appeal.\nI have no doubt as to the power of the legislature, resting upon its plenary power over not only the property in a province, but also civil rights in a province and the constitution of the courts therein and limitation of their powers, to enact a law such as before us imposing a tax as a condition precedent to giving its assent through its courts to the transmission of any property so far as such assent may be necessary in law.\nIt is argued that it is not a direct tax because the executor has not the money to pay it and in the first place gives a bond for its due payment and the amount payable thereunder depends upon a number of considerations set forth in the legislation, and the modes of inquiry and determination also thereby provided for, and that the executor has to recoup himself out of the estate when realized and when debts and expenses are paid.\nAll these things constitute but the legal machinery for the determination of the facts and the scale by which the tax is to be measured.\nThose beneficiaries sharing with the state in that which the executor may have realized, I rather think feel that the tax is pretty direct. They know that the executor or other personal representative is but their agent, as it were, by whose hands they receive what they get and that he has no civil right in the province to assert any acquisition of the property of the deceased, but what the legislature has chosen to give assent to.\nI repeat we must look at the actual substance of things and not be misled by mere words.\nIf and so far as the person becoming ultimately entitled under this process to receive his share in the estate of a deceased can obtain by law any of it without provincial legislation that property so obtained may not be taxable. No such proposition in law or in fact is or can be put forward relative to what is in dispute herein; therefore, I am, for clarity\u2019s sake, resolved not to travel into side issues and other eases.\nThere are only two items in question herein.\nThat known as the claim against one little residing in the province, clearly is not only in the province and dependent upon the civil right conditionally conferred by the province, but is also collectable there. And if his assets have to be followed elsewhere it is only by virtue of that civil right so conditionally given that they can be followed.\nThe other item is a specialty debt held by deceased at his domicile in Manitoba, enforceable there if the debtor had any property there, and wherever to be enforced must be dependent upon the same civil right also conditionally conferred by the province.\nI hold that there is in the contract in question a covenant for the payment of said debt. And even if the purchaser of the land, for which it is given, has to be constrained, by virtue of his necessity to get a title, to pay, and that upon the facts should happen to be efficacious as a means of enforcing payment, it is to Manitoba he must come to discharge his debt and there tender a conveyance for execution.\nI can conceive of the like cases where the balance unpaid might so far exceed the value of the land as to render the covenant of no value and the recovery of the land be the only thing available. No such thing is set up here except incidentally arguing that there is. no covenant; I, therefore, need not follow that alternative.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel tells us there is required by the law of Saskatchewan an ancillary probate to be got there to complete the title to the purchaser. That is the purchaser\u2019s business. If there is required by Saskatchewan law anything beyond the nominal expense of producing such verification as to obtain registration, and thus in the nature of a second succession tax, then I should be sorry to find such legislation in any province. It is the vicious practice of insisting upon such double taxation that has aroused some antagonism to these succession taxes. I am glad to see that the Legislature of Manitoba has been moving in the direction of trying to avoid the evil. The merely reprehensible nature of legislation producing such evil should have no weight in measuring the right and power of the province. And every attempt on the part of the courts to ameliorate such incidental evil results by way of needlessly limiting and cutting down the power given by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to provincial legislatures weakens the forces which would otherwise be directed to enlighten public opinion and produce in the legislature a proper consciousness of the unrighteousness of such methods.\nThere is only one thing involved in this case for us to deal with and that is the power of the legislature. All such collaterial arguments as bear upon the abuse of the power should be discarded and we will thereby be the better able to reach a clear apprehension of what that power is.\nThe basis of the right to tax the transmission was expressed by Lord Loreburn in Winans v. Attorney-General[16], at page 30, as follows:\u2014\nIn both cases the property received the full protection of British laws, which is a constant basis of taxation, and can only be transferred from the deceased to other persons by a British Court.\nI admit that some recent decisions and dicta in other judgments, if followed to their logical conclusions of measuring the civil rights in a province by the consequences thereof when having to be dealt with abroad, would so abridge the rights and powers of provincial legislatures as to revolutionize the fundamental principles upon which the legislatures and judiciary of this country have for a life time proceeded. For my part I shall not attempt to build upon the foundation so laid until, if ever, it has reached such further development as to become by concrete decisions absolutely identical in principle with that we have to pass upon.\nIn regard to the argument founded upon such decisions and the supposed logical result thereof I should adopt and apply here the language of Lord Halsbury in the case of Quinn v. Leathem[17], at page 506.\nThis case does not fall within that category. It is well within the principles proceeded upon in the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[18], where the court above, referring to the application of the definition of scientific political economists as limiting the powers of principal legislatures over direct taxation, at page 582, spoke as follows:\u2014\nIt would deny the character of a direct tax to the income tax of this country, which is always spoken of as such, and is generally looked upon as a direct tax of the most obvious kind; and it would run counter to the common understanding of men on this subject, which is one main clue to the meaning of the legislature.\nNot only the income tax but much else of local taxation that has hitherto passed unchallenged would have to be revised if some such definitions had to be rigidly adhered to as the measure of the provincial legislatures\u2019 powers instead of the common sense of mankind as recognized in what I quote and the recognized legislative powers of other colonies in this regard.\nIt is further to be observed that it is not direct taxation of property within the province, but direct taxation within a province, that is the term used in the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nIf people can get property of a deceased outside the province without asking or relying upon provincial authority then they may escape the tax.\nCounsel for appellant complained that a schedule had to be filed shewing the entire estate of the deceased. That is simply as the basis of classification and for the determination of whether or not the deceased and his estate and those getting it fall within the class who could reasonably be asked to contribute to the public revenue.\nThat may in some cases rank the estate as of those which should pay 10%, for example, instead of 5%, or nothing.\nThe severity of it may in many cases be unwise and unjustifiable, but that has nothing to do with the existence of the power. It is merely the scale upon or by which the tax is to be measured.\nIf we had to clarify the legislative mind on the subject of taxation or to pass upon the merits of its product relative to taxation we should have perhaps a pretty heavy task. Some notions apparent in the work may occasionally seem to us to be crude.\nBut for us to tell the legislators that when using this exclusive power of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d over civil rights they must in the case of the beneficiaries by the death of one who has grown rich under the laws of his domicile, perhaps by virtue thereof, be careful that the power over civil rights be not used, but the law be so framed as to offer him a premium at the close of life to invest his acquisitions abroad and thereby escape the tax which probate duty, legacy duty, succession tax or death duty, or whatever other name be given the tax, would be apt to bring a sharp retort.\nTo try to distinguish between these names accidentally given in the course of the development of a century or more of law in England tends only, I submit, to lead to confusion. The purpose of the legislature has plainly been to so use its power over civil rights and to insist upon its right to withhold its needed sanction to give him claiming such benefits as derivable therefrom, unless and until this tax is paid. So acting I think the legislature is well within its powers within the province.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. The statute in so far as it professes to impose duties in respect of property having a situs within Manitoba must be held, I think, to be intra vires on the authority of Rex v. Lovitt[19]. In so far as it professes to impose duties on property not having a situs within the province it must, I think, be held to attempt the imposition of taxes which are not \u201cdirect\u201d taxes because it appears to me that as regards that feature of it the reasoning of Lord Moulton in Cotton v. Rex[20], at page 195, applies; and the result of that reasoning is, I think, that any attempt on the part of the province to exact succession duties in respect of property not situate within the province and without respect to the domicile of the beneficiary must fail for the simple reason that such taxation if effectual (in cases in which \u2014 the situs of the property being, let it be noted, outside the province \u2014 the beneficiary is domiciled abroad as well as in other cases) cannot be \u201cdirect taxation\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as construed in that case.\nI have had not a little difficulty in satisfying myself upon the point whether the provisions of the Act which bring personal property outside the province under the incidence of the duty ought not to be considered as of the essence of the statute in such a degree as to make it impossible to sustain the duty upon property within the province; after a good deal of doubt I have come to the conclusion that it is possible, in this case, and right to treat the provisions of the statute which if enacted by themselves would have been valid, as severable from those provisions which are ultra vires.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellants challenge the right of the Province of Manitoba to recover succession duties from them as executors of the late Robert Muir, who died domiciled in Manitoba, in respect of certain debts known as the \u201cLittle debt\u201d and the \u201cKirkella lands debts,\u201d which formed part of the assets of his estate. It is asserted that these debts are not dutiable because they are not \u201clocally situate\u201d within the province; and that whether they are \u201clocally situate\u201d within or without the province the legislation authorizing the tax imposed is ultra vires.\nProceeding under section 19 of the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d (R.S.M., 1902, eh. 161), the Surrogate Court of the Eastern Judicial District of Manitoba held the appellants liable to pay these duties. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nAt the threshold of the appeal to this court there arises a question of jurisdiction. Is the Surrogate Court of Manitoba, admittedly not a superior court, a \u201cCourt of Probate\u201d within the meaning of clause (d) of section 37 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d? This provision was introduced by 52 Vict., ch. 37. It had been held in Beamish v. Kaulbach[21], that this court had not jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in a case which originated in the Court of Wills and Probates of the County of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Having regard to the special provision made in section 96 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d in regard to the courts of probate in the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and to the history of the surrogate courts in Ontario, upon which the surrogate courts of Manitoba appear to have been modelled in their constitution and jurisdiction (R.S.O., 1913, oh. 62; R.S.M., 1902, ch. 41), there would seem to be some ground for the suggestion that, if its application is not confined to the probate courts in the two former provinces, which have always been styled \u201cCourts of Probate,\u201d such courts as the surrogate courts of Manitoba are not within clause (d) of section 37 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d If they are, a rather wide field of jurisdiction to entertain appeals in surrogate court matters would seem to be opened up.\nIt is also suggested that in the proceedings provided for by the section 19 of the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d the surrogate court does not act as a court of probate, or that those proceedings are taken before the judge of the Surrogate Court as persona designata subject to a special right of appeal to the provincial court of appeal, and that there is, therefore, no right of appeal to this court. While by no means entirely satisfied that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, in deference to the opinions of my learned colleagues who think that we have jurisdiction, I shall proceed to consider the appeal on its merits.\nIn regard to the \u201cLittle debt\u201d the unanimous conclusion in the provincial courts, that, as a simple contract obligation, it was locally situate at the residence of the debtor in Manitoba, seems to me incontrovertible and, while it has occasioned some divergence in judicial opinion, I am not prepared to differ from the view of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the respondent\u2019s contention that the \u201cKirkella lands claims\u201d are locally situate in Manitoba, because they are specialty debts, is also well founded. Commissioners of Stamps v. Hope[22]; Emmens v. Elderton[23]; Russell v. Watts[24]; Aspdin v. Austin[25]; Farrall v. Hilditch[26]; Lay v. Mottram[27].\nIn Cotton v. The King[28] the nature of succession duties imposed by the Legislature of Quebec was considered by the Judicial Committee. Although the case then before their Lordships might have been fully disposed of by the construction placed by them on the Quebec \u201cSuccession Duties Act,\u201d which excluded the property in question from its purview, Lord Moulton, delivering the judgment of the Board, after stating the questions at issue \u2014 the one as to the construction of the Quebec statute, the other as to the nature of the taxation which it imposed\u2014says:\u2014\nThese are the two questions which this Board has to resolve, and though it may well be that the decision of one of these questions in favour of the appellants might render it unnecessary to decide the other, their Lordships are of opinion that they are of co-ordinate importance in the case, and that they should base their judgment equally on the answers to be given to the one and to the other. The latter of the two questions is of the greatest practical importance in view of the fact that by a later statute the operative portion of the section has been amended by omitting the qualifying words \u201cin the province\u201d so that a decision depending on the presence of those words would have no application to the present state of legislation.\nTheir Lordships\u2019 opinion, that, at least in regard to outside movables, the tax imposed by the Quebec \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d would be indirect and the Act to that extent ultra vires, certainly cannot be regarded as obiter dictum. They have seen fit expressly to base their judgment upon it. The liability to succession duties of movable property locally situate outside the province was the question at issue in the Cotton Case[29]. Under the Quebec statute the person who made the schedule and declaration of the assets of the estate was held to be personally liable to pay the whole of the duties imposed on the estate (p. 194), and to be entitled to\nrecover the amount so paid from the assets of the estate, or, more accurately, from the persons interested therein.\nThis provision was dealt with as if applicable equally to assets outside and to assets within the province. As an illustration of the indirectness of the Quebec taxation, Lord Moulton instances the case of\nbonds or shares in New York bequeathed to some person not domiciled in the province,\nwhich the legatee could obtain on duly proving the will in New York and satisfying its fiscal laws in relation thereto regardless of any duty imposed by the Quebec statute. \u201cThe Quebec Government,\u201d his Lordships adds,\ncould in such a case obtain its succession duties only from some one who was not intended himself to bear the burden, but to be recouped by some one else.\nBecause\nthe payment is obtained from persons not intended to bear it, within the meaning of the accepted definition above referred to, (John Stuart Mill\u2019s well-known definition of indirect taxation.)\ntheir Lordships held the Quebec legislation ultra vires, at all events as to movables situate outside the province, as imposing taxation which was not \u201cdirect taxation.\u201d\nSection 5 of the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act,\u201d as enacted in 1905 and in force in 1908, rendered the movable property of a domiciled decedent situate without the province as well as all his property situate within the province liable to succession duties. Section 15 provided that:\u2014\nAny administrator, executor or trustee having in charge or trust, any estate, legacy, or property subject to the said duty shall deduct the duty therefrom, or collect the duty thereon upon the appraised value thereof, from the person entitled to such property and he shall not deliver any property subject to duty to any person until he has collected the duty thereon.\nOn obtaining grant of probate or administration the personal representative was required by section 6 to execute and deliver to the surrogate clerk a bond\nconditioned for the due payment to His Majesty of any duty to which the property coming to the hands of such executor or administrator may be found liable.\nGiving to the words \u201ccoming to the hands\u201d their widest signification (Batten, Proffitt & Scott v. Dartmouth Harbour Commissioners[30]), having regard to the terms of section 15, it would seem to be at least arguable that the personal liability of the executor or administrator was confined to duties payable in respect of property of which he should be entitled to obtain possession under and by virtue of the Manitoba grant, as a condition of receiving which he was obliged to give the bond for payment of succession duties. If so, as to the duties on outside movable property the Manitoba statute would seem to be distinguishable from the Quebec legislation. But if the liability of the Manitoba executor or administrator should also extend to duties in respect of movable property of which possession could be obtained only under a foreign grant of probate or administration, or if outside movable property, though coming to the hands of the Manitoba executor or administrator, should be dealt with by a foreign court in the manner indicated in Lord Moulton\u2019s illustration, no doubt the duties imposed upon it by the Manitoba statute would contravene the prohibition against indirect taxation equally with the duties considered in the Cotton Case[31].\nUpon a careful study of Lord Moulton\u2019s opinion, however, although I certainly do not find that the view which I expressed in the Cotton Case[32], at pages 532 et seq., was approved of in the Judicial Committee, neither do I find that it was overruled or even questioned. Their Lordships merely preferred to rest their conclusion that the taxation of outside property in that case was ultra vires upon another ground. Having had no reason to change or modify it, I respectfully adhere to my opinion that succession duties such as those provided for by the Manitoba statute imposed in respect of any property physically or locally situate outside the province are not \u201ctaxation within the province\u201d and are, therefore, ultra vires of a provincial legislature. To that extent I think the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d as it stood in 1908 cannot be supported.\nBut I see no difficulty in severing the provision of that Act relating to the taxation of outside movable property from the rest of the Act. It is not essential to the scheme of the legislation. Neither the character, the incidence, nor the amount of the duties imposed on the property within Manitoba could be in any way effected by the excision of the provision for the taxation of outside movables. The only effects of deleting it would be that the province would receive a somewhat smaller revenue under the statute and the beneficiaries of outside movable property would escape the burden of the taxation.\nAfter indicating the indirect character of the tax imposed by the Quebec statute by instancing the procedure requisite for its collection in the case of foreign bonds or shares bequeathed to a person not domiciled in the province, Lord Moulton proceeds to say:\u2014\nAlthough the case just referred to is probably one of the most striking instances of the excess of these duties beyond the legal limits of the powers of the provincial legislature it is by no means the only one. Indeed, the whole structure of the scheme of these succession duties depends on a system of making one person pay duties which he is not intended to bear, but to obtain from other persons.\nIn this passage it seems to me that their Lordships condemn the Quebec succession duties as indirect taxation regardless of whether the property in respect of which they are levied is within or without the province.\nBut with regard to assets within the province the Manitoba legislation differs essentially from that of Quebec. Under the latter, as construed by the Judicial Committee, direct personal liability to pay the duties is imposed on a person who may never have any of the assets of the estate in his hands. Speaking of the sections of the statute which deal with the method of collection of the duties imposed upon the property of the decedent, L\u00f3rd Moulton says:\u2014\nTheir Lordships can only construe these provisions as entitling the collector of Inland Revenue to collect the whole of the duties on the estate from the person making the declaration, who may (and as we understand in most cases will) be the notary before whom the will is executed and who must recover the amount so paid from the assets of the estate or, more accurately, from the persons interested therein. Under the Manitoba statute the only liability im-upon the executor or administrator or trustee and is confined to duties upon any estate, legacy or property which he has in charge or trust (sec. 15). Title to the entire succession of the decedent within the province posed, other than that upon the property itself, is vests in his personal representative. It is out of that which comes to his hands as personal representative that the executor or administrator is required to pay. He is empowered to collect the duty from the devisee or legatee before delivering over any property subject to duty and to sell so much of the property of the deceased as may be necessary to enable him to pay such duty (sec. 16). We have not, therefore, the case of one not intended to bear the burden being required to pay the duty and to recoup himself thereafter either from the assets of the estate or from the persons interested therein: The personal representative has imposed upon him the obligation of collecting for the province the duties imposed upon the property of the decedent which comes to his hands and is under his control. The security which he gives is for the faithful discharge of that duty. It is only upon default in fulfilling it that he incurs personal liability. To hold that such taxation is indirect merely because it is levied through the instrumentality of the personal representative seems to me not only to be something which the Judicial Committee did not decide in the Cotton Case[33], but to involve a limitation on the provincial power of direct taxation which would be largely destructive of it. Unless required to do so by a decision of their Lordships, or of this court, much more directly in point, I am not prepared to accept that position. As to the duties imposed upon property locally situate within the province the Manitoba \u201cSuccession Duties Act,\u201d in my opinion, provided for\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes,\nand was, therefore, intra vires of the provincial legislature.\nI have not overlooked Lord Moulton\u2019s observations, at page 194, that in the Quebec ease \u201cthere is nothing corresponding to probate in the English sense,\u201d and at page 195, that\nthis (the payment of duties) is not in return for services rendered by the Government as in the cases where local probate has been necessary and fees have been charged in respect thereof,\nor Lord Robson\u2019s remarks in Rex v. Lovitt[34], at page 223. I cannot think that their Lordships meant to suggest that the succession duties imposed by the New Brunswick statute, which is in this respect indistinguishable from the Manitoba statute, were in the nature of probate fees and therefore not to be deemed taxation. But, if they did, these expressions of opinion were obiter and I am, with all proper deference, of the opinion that the duties imposed by both these statutes are not in any sense \u201cfees charged in respect\u201d of the grant of probate or administration. They are imposed in addition to and independently of the fees charged for these services \u2014 \u201cover and above the fees provided by the \u2018Surrogate Courts Act.\u2019\u201d They are levied indifferently upon movable property within and without the province \u2014 upon all the decedent\u2019s property within the province to which title is conferred by the Manitoba probate or administration and upon his movable property without the province to which it confers no title. Their amount varies according to the degree of consanguinity between the decedent and the beneficiary and the amount of the estate. I deem these succession duties taxation \u2014 not fees payable for services \u2014 and as taxation subject to the restrictions of sub-section 2 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nFor these reasons I would, with respect, dismiss this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The first question to be determined is whether the debts in respect of which succession duty is claimed by the respondent are \u201cwithin the Province of Manitoba.\u201d\nThere does not seem to be any serious difficulty as to the debt which is called the \u201cLittle debt.\u201d The deceased and the debtor were both residing in that province. It may be that Little has not in the province sufficient means to pay what he owes, but at the same time there is nothing to shew that he will not discharge his obligation. It is a simple contract debt due by a resident of the province and it is liable to the succession duty claimed.\nAs to the debts due in respect of the \u201cKirkella lands,\u201d there is a more serious dispute. It is claimed by the appellants that they are not \u201cproperty within the province\u201d as required by sub-section (a) of section 5, chapter 161, Revised Statutes of Manitoba (\u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d).\nThe deceased in his lifetime owned certain lands in the Province of Saskatchewan and they had been sold by him to different purchasers. All those sales were evidenced by agreements for sale under seal and those agreements were in the possession of the deceased in Manitoba at the time of his death.\nThese agreements for sale are specialty debts and applying the principle enunciated by Lord Field in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[35], at page 482, a debt under seal, or a specialty, has a species of corporeal existence by which its locality might be reduced to a certainty, and it is bona notabilia where it is conspicuous and is under the jurisdiction in which the specialty was found at the time of death.\nAnother very important question has been raised as to whether the \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d is intra vires.\nIt is claimed by the appellants on the authority of the judgment rendered by the Privy Council in the case of Cotton v. The King[36], that the taxation imposed by the \u201cSuccession Duties Act\u201d is indirect and, therefore, beyond the powers of the provincial legislatures.\nIt is true that the very wide and inclusive language used in some parts of that judgment might be construed in that way. But in the Cotton Case36 the question at issue was whether the Legislature of Quebec, in view of the restrictive language of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which gives to the provinces the power to impose \u201cdirect taxation within the province,\u201d could tax property situate outside the province.\nAt the time of his death the deceased, in the Cotton Case[37], was domiciled in Quebec, but the provincial government levied succession duties on bonds, debentures and shares that were all locally situate in the United States.\nSo the question that presented itself in that case was as to the right of a province to tax property situate outside of the province, and it is in connection with that feature of the case that the question of indirect taxation was raised. I do not think it was intended to declare that a province could not require, as a condition for local probate, that a succession duty should be paid on property within the province.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mulock, Armstrong & Lindsay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Graham, Hanneson & McTavish.\n[1] 24 Man.

Parker (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1915: May 10, 11; 1915: June 24.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLife insurance\u2014Non-payment of premiums\u2014Misrepresentation to insured\u2014Estoppel.\nP., in payment of premiums on a life policy, gave his note for one instalment and an overdue balance of another. Shortly before it matured an official of the company, specially authorized to deal with the matter, informed P. that his policy had lapsed owing to the inclusion in the note of the overdue balance which was against the company rules. In consequence of this representation P. did not pay the note nor tender the amount of another instalment falling due before his death. In an action on the policy by the beneficiary no rule of the company was proved avoiding the policy as stated.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed against (48 N.S. Rep. 404), Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. dissenting, that the company was estopped, by conduct, from claiming that the policy lapsed on non-payment of the note and subsequent instalment.\nPer Davies J., that the non-payment of the note could not be relied on as avoiding the policy, but the estoppel did not extend to the failure to pay the quarterly premium which afterwards became due.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming by an equal division the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. J. J. O\u2019Meara for the appellants.\nMellish K.C. and Findlay MacDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would allow this appeal.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I do not think there was error in the court of appeal in holding on the findings of the learned trial judge that the non-payment of the note which the deceased, insured, had given for the payment of one of the quarterly premiums of his policy and which note included a balance of a former quarterly premium, did not operate to avoid his policy or cause it to lapse.\nWhen the note in question was about maturing, Mr. Sorey, the superintendent of agencies of the defendant company, in the course of his travelling in the company\u2019s business, met the deceased in Sydney in the presence of two of his brothers and, after seeing the condition of his health, informed him that his policy was no longer in force because \u201che had allowed one part of an overdue premium to be carried forward with a note covering the next premium, which is against the rules of the company.\u201d\nThis statement of the company\u2019s chief representative took place between the 27th February and the 2nd March as found by the trial judge and the note fell due either on the 4th or, allowing for three days\u2019 grace, on the 7th.\nIn consequence of the statement as above of the policy being no longer in force the deceased did not pay his note and I am not prepared to say that the company was not under the circumstances estopped from setting up its non-payment as a ground for avoiding the policy.\nI am, however, utterly unable to understand how such a holding can apply to the non-payment of a subsequent quarterly premium which fell due some time after the conversation before alluded to and before the death of the deceased insured.\nThat such a quarterly premium did so fall due and was not paid is proved and admitted.\nCan it be contended for a moment that the conversation alluded to released the defendant for the remainder of his life from paying the premiums falling due upon his policy and estopped the defendant in an action on the policy from setting up such non-payments?\nIf the argument cannot be accepted as covering the whole period of the insured\u2019s life, then for how long did it release the defendant from payment of his premiums and estop the company from setting up such subsequent defaults?\nThe conversation had reference to a particular note then about falling due and to the effect which the inclusion in that note of part of a former overdue premium had. It may well be held to have induced the deceased not to have promptly paid his note until he had had time to understand what his true position was, and to have estopped the company from taking advantage of such default in its prompt payment to avoid the policy. But it surely cannot be held to operate in the same way with respect to premiums subsequently falling due; or to release deceased from his, obligation to pay such subsequent premiums or to estop the insurance company from appealing to the contractual result of such non-payment which was the avoiding of the policy.\nFor this reason that there is no estoppel with respect to such subsequent accruing premiums, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs in all the courts.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action on a policy of life insurance for a thousand dollars. The defence set up is non-payment of premiums and consequent lapsing of the policy. The appellant received through the hands of its local agent at Sydney a promissory note for one premium and a small part of another. This note was on a printed form evidently supplied by appellant for such uses. Its heading in type is as follows:\u2014\nRenewal Premium Note.\nNote\n$.....................\nDue.........................\nT. R. (if any)\n$.....................\nOttawa\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026........, 1914.\nBalance\n$.....................\nInterest\n$.....................\nThe part on right hand is filled in by writing of date. That on left hand is filled in opposite word \u201cnote\u201d by figures (39.20, and opposite the letters \u201cT. R.\u201d in figures 20c, and opposite the word \u201cbalance\u201d (39.40, but nothing opposite the word \u201cinterest.\u201d No explanation is given in evidence or argument of what \u201cT. R.\u201d stands for. The figures opposite that \u201cT. R\u201d and the words due date and balance seem to me from the ink to have been done by a later filling in than the remainder of the filling in of the blank.\nWithout attaching undue importance thereto, I think the fair inference, from the fact that this note was received in due course and never returned, but retained till the trial by the company, is that this note was received and accepted as payment.\nThe pretence that the small part of the note as clearly indicated to those at the head office being for a part of a past due payment must suffice to justify treating the policy as lapsed, seems idle. It may have been competent for the company to have so treated it on receipt and forthwith accordingly to have returned it and said so.\nIt was not competent for the head office to have held on to the note and later on attempt to repudiate it. Neither in law, justice nor common sense can such a position be maintained.\nAnother payment of premium fell due on the 20th March, which remained unpaid at the death of the insured.\nBy the learned trial judge it is found as fact that on a date between the 27th February and the 2nd March before the note fell due, the appellant\u2019s superintendent of agencies called on the insured and finding him in such a physical condition that an early death must be expected, told him, in language sworn to by two brothers of the insured, and not denied, that the policy was not in force because one part of the premiums had been carried forth into a note covering the next premium.\nOne of the brothers swears the premiums, but for this assertion, would have been paid, and doubtless that is true. They and deceased were thus dissuaded from tendering the amount of the note and of the March premium. It is not pretended that if tendered such payments would have been accepted. The repudiation of the policy in such distinct and absolute terms dispensed with such tenders.\nThere was no justification under the circumstances for appellant\u2019s repudiation after accepting and retaining the note given in payment and receipted for as such by the local agent.\nThe superintendent alleges he wanted information or instructions from the head office of appellant before stating as alleged, so there can be no doubt of his conduct being duly authorized or confirmed.\nEven his dispute of the date of this repudiation which was a leading question in contest at the trial, did not induce him to produce and file in evidence the telegram or other written communication to the head office or replies thereto.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The controversy on this appeal reduced to its lowest terms presents two questions of fact both of which are, as I think, conclusively determined against the appellants by reference to two pieces of evidence; the letter of August 29th addressed by the secretary to Mr. MacDonald, the respondent\u2019s solicitor, and the evidence relating to the interview between the assured and Mr. Jorey, referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ritchie, which the learned judge finds took place between the 22nd of February and the 2nd of March.\nThe letter is as follows:\u2014\nE.L. Ottawa, Canada, August 29th, 1914.\nFinley MacDonald, Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor, etc.,\nDillon Block, Sydney, Nova Scotia.\nRe William J. Parker.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your favour of the 24th instant received. Policy No. 624 called for a premium of $27.65 payable four times yearly in advance, commencing Dec. 20th, 1912, At Dec. 20th, 1913, there remained a balance of $10.70 unpaid on account of the four instalments of premium due for the first policy year. This balance of $10.70 with interest of 85 cents for delay up to that time was merged by our agents with the next quarterly instalment due December 20th, 1913, and a note for the combined amounts, in all $39.20, was taken by them. This note fell due by its terms March 4th, with no payment whatever made thereon, and the policy consequently lapsed automatically. It might have been reinstated upon payment of the amount due, and submission of satisfactory evidence of health, but no application was ever made. So far as official receipts of premiums are concerned, these are handed to the insured upon his setting by cash or note. If a note is given, the policy, by the terms of the note, lapses unless payment is made on or before the due date thereof.\nYours truly,\nM. D. Grant, Secretary.\nIn itself this letter, a guarded letter, written by the secretary of the company after the death of the insured and no doubt framed in view of the probability of a claim being made under the policy, is sufficient evidence that the note of the second of February was accepted in payment, conditional payment, of course, of the moneys then due in respect of renewal premiums and that the company had treated the policy as a policy in force down to the maturity of the note. \u201cNo payment having been made\u201d upon the note, \u201cthe policy,\u201d to quote the last letter, \u201cconsequently lapsed automatically.\u201d The letter, of course, is not conclusive evidence. It was open to the company to shew at the trial that the secretary had made a mistake, or to supplement the facts stated in the letter by other evidence shewing as was contended by the appellant that the policy had lapsed in consequence of non-payment of the premium due on the 20th September, or of that due on the 20th December; that the agent at Sidney had acted in excess of his authority in taking the note of the 2nd February, and that his action had not been ratified by the company. But no attempt was made to do this, no testimony was offered to shew how the note was treated at the head office of the company or what communications were made with respect to it by the agent to the head office. The statement made by Mr. Jorey in the conversation above referred to, to the effect that the note had been \u201cput through,\u201d confirms the conclusion suggested by the perusal of the letter itself.\nI concur with the two courts below in thinking that the proper conclusion of fact is that the note was accepted in payment and \u2014 assuming (a point on which I am by no means satisfied) that on the 2nd February when the note was received, the insured was in default and that the company was entitled by reason of his default to treat the policy as a lapsed policy \u2014 the company by accepting the note as payment manifested its election to treat the policy as a policy in force and not to take advantage of the default of the insured. The company being bound by its election the policy was, of course, at the time of the interview between the insured and Mr. Jorey (some time before the 2nd March, as the trial judge found) a policy in force, and the company was bound on payment of the note at maturity and renewal premiums as they should fall due to observe and carry out its contract of insurance according to the terms of it. That was the state of affairs when the interview referred to took place.\nThe learned trial judge has accepted the account of that interview (which he has set out in his judgment) given in the evidence of George Richard Parker and Thomas Parker. I see no reason for the slightest doubt as to the correctness of his finding, and I think the proper interpretation of that interview is the interpretation contended for in the respondent\u2019s factum and on the oral argument before us. The insured was in fact told by Mr. Jorey (and it was upon this view of what he was told that he acted) that his policy had lapsed; and that the company would accept no payment from him except upon the condition that he furnished satisfactory evidence of health. This condition Mr. Jorey admits was obviously an impossible condition and the insured rightly interpreted the intention of the company\u2019s representative when he construed it as a refusal on the part of the company to continue the insurance. The declaration of the company of its intention not to carry out its contract was on well known principles an actionable breach of contract. Frost v. Knight[2]; Hochster v. De La Tour[3]; Honour v. Equitable Life Assurance Society[4]. The insured, as he was entitled to do, treated it as a refusal to carry out the contract and a right of action immediately arose.\nIt is no answer to say that he might have tendered the amount of the promissory note and the renewal premiums. There is no suggestion and it could not have been suggested that any such tender would have been accepted and there is nothing in the law making it incumbent upon the insured to go through any such idle formality. Indeed, considering the evidence before us as to the state of health of the insured if the action had been brought in March immediately after the repudiation of the policy by the company the damages could have been but little less than the amount of the policy less the amount of the note and such premiums as the insured might be expected to be obliged to pay.\nI think the judgment below is right and should be affirmed.\nAnglin J.\u2014I entertain serious doubts whether upon the evidence before us the assured was so in default when the local agent of the respondent company took his note covering the premium due in December and a small balance of the September premium that the company was then entitled to terminate his policy. But if it was, I am satisfied that by what occurred in connection with that note (it was promptly sent to the head office of the company, it was there \u201cput through,\u201d we are told by the defendants\u2019 superintendent of agencies, presumably as a payment of the premium, it was held for nearly a month before the insured was notified that there was any question as to its being accepted or as to his policy being in force, he being left in the meantime under the belief that the note had been accepted and that his policy was in good standing) the company is estopped from alleging that it elected to terminate the policy for any default prior to the taking of the note, and that if the amount of that note and of the March premium had been paid at maturity or had been duly tendered to the company there would have been no ground upon which they could have successfully resisted payment. Very shortly before the maturity of the note, however, the company, through a leading official (their superintendent of agencies), specially sent from the head office to deal with this matter, notified the assured that his policy was void because the local agent had exceeded his authority in including in the note taken for the December premium the balance of the premium due in September. The evidence, I think, supports the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the statement of the company\u2019s representative that the policy was void led the insured to believe that payment of the note and of Subsequent premiums would not be accepted, and caused him not to tender them. This was a reasonable inference which the company\u2019s representative should have contemplated would be drawn by the insured. Although this misrepresentation might not justify the insured refraining indefinitely from tendering premiums or entitle his beneficiary after the lapse of a long period (how long it may be difficult to say) to prefer a claim for payment of the policy, I think, the conduct of the company\u2019s representative precludes their setting up the failure of the assured to pay his note and the March premium, which fell due only a few days afterwards, as a defence to this action. National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Home Benefit Society[5]; Hayner v. The American Popular Life Ins. Co.[6]; Heinlein v. Imperial Life Ins. Co.[7], and other cases cited in May on Insurance, vol. 2, sec. 358, and 19 Am. & Eng. Encyc, page 57, N. 4; and Webb v. New York Life Ins. Co.[8]. Of course, the defendants are entitled to deduct the amount of the note and of the March premium and also of the July premium (which had accrued due before the death of the insured, although the thirty days of grace had not expired) from the sum to be recovered on the policy.\nIn another aspect of the matter, the assured might have treated the declaration of the company\u2019s representative as a repudiation of the contract entitling him to maintain an action of damages for breach. Honour v. Equitable Life Assurance Society[9]. Having regard to his precarious state of health, the amount of his damages \u2014 the value of his policy at the date of the repudiation \u2014 would be little less than the sum insured. Re Albert Life Ins. Co.[10].\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Colin Mackenzie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Finlay MacDonald.\n[1] 48 N.S.

Rep. 39), that as the company, when issuing the policy, knew that a gasoline engine had been installed in the building for use in manufacturing, and must be deemed to have known that a reasonable supply of gasoline for feeding it would be kept close at hand, the keeping of the barrel where it was placed was not a circumstance material to the risk, non-disclosure of which would avoid the policy.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe questions raised for decision are stated in the above head-note. Roscoe K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia which reversed a judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiff for the amount insured by its policy in the defendants\u2019 company on its stock of apples and general stores contained in a two-and-a-half story frame and cement building 60 \u00d7 94 and addition 20 \u00d7 20, situate in the Town of Windsor.\nAll kinds of defences were pleaded to the claim of the plaintiff, but they were either dropped or disposed of at the trial and the only two relied on by the court below and at the argument at bar were (1) the omission on plaintiff\u2019s part to communicate to the defendants before or at the time the policy issued what was alleged to be a material circumstance under condition 1 of the policy, namely, the presence of a barrel of gasoline under a broad platform running up to the building and about 15 or 16 feet from the building from which the daily supply of gasoline (about 5 gallons) for the gasoline engine in use in the building for evaporating applies was obtained, and (2) condition 11 which prohibited the storing or keeping of more than five gallons of, amongst other oils, gasoline \u201cin the building insured\u201d unless permission in writing from the insurer was first obtained.\nThe court below did not rely upon this condition for their judgment. On the contrary, I gather that they were of the opinion that the keeping of the gasoline in a barrel outside of the building and some 15 or 16 feet away from it for the purpose of obtaining the daily supply of five gallons for the running of the gasoline engine within the building was not in contravention of this eleventh condition.\nIn that conclusion I fully concur and with respect to the true meaning of that eleventh condition I would call attention to the observations of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Thompson v. Equity Fire Ins. Co.[2], at pp. 596 and 597.\nThe ground upon which the court below based its judgment reversing that of the trial judge was the omission on the part of the insured company to communicate the fact of the presence of the barrel of gasoline some 15 or 16 feet away from the building under the platform leading to the building from which the supply for the gasoline engine was daily obtained.\nThey held that was a material fact affecting the risk which it was the duty of the party insured to have disclosed to the insurance company at or before the date when the policy issued and that the failure to make the disclosure vitiated the policy.\nThe information given to the general agents of the defendant company and on which the policy sued on was issued, was that the goods, etc., upon which insurance was sought were contained in a factory, the machinery of which was operated by an engine for which gasoline furnished the power and in which factory were furnaces, piping, etc., besides the engine.\nThis information must have satisfied the insurance company that gasoline was used in the engine and the protection they required and the prohibition they provided for in consequence were provided for in the eleventh condition of the policy, prohibiting the keeping or storing of gasoline exceeding five gallons in quantity \u201cin the building insured or containing the property insured.\u201d There was, as all the courts have held and as this court holds, no violation of that condition.\nIf with the knowledge the insurance company possessed when issuing the policy sued on of the facts that gasoline supplied the power which operated the engine in the factory or building the goods in which they were insuring and that such supply of gasoline had to be daily obtained from some outside source as it was prohibited from being kept or stored in the building or believed so to be; then if they desired further security and to know where the source of supply was kept or obtained, they should surely have asked for the information.\nI am of the opinion that under the facts and circumstances proved in this case and in view of the knowledge of these facts possessed by the insurance company, the keeping of the barrel of gasoline under the platform some 15 or 16 feet away from the building for the purpose of furnishing the daily supply required for the running of the engine, was neither a breach of the eleventh condition nor such a material circumstance within condition 1 as it was the duty of the insured company voluntarily and without being asked to communicate to the insurance company.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the court of appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge. Idington J.\u2014This is an action brought by appellant against respondent on a fire insurance policy, dated 7th January, 1912, for a year from that date, upon stock contained in a building in Windsor, Nova Scotia, for $2,500, to recover losses caused by fire on the 21st March, 1912.\nThe numerous defences pleaded were at the trial practically reduced to three in number, each resting upon one of the statutory conditions. That upon the condition No. 1 is relative to the alleged omission of the insured to communicate a circumstance material to the risk. Another was rested upon condition No. 9, relative to prior and subsequent insurances. And the third is dependent upon condition No. 11, so far as relative to the quantity of gasoline stored or kept in the building.\nThe learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Drysdale, held none of these defences established and entered judgment for the appellant for the amount claimed.\nOn appeal therefrom the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia does not seem to have been asked to pass upon anything arising out of condition No. 9 as only that raised by the others of said conditions is dealt with.\nOf these that court maintained only the defence raised upon condition No. 1. We are not favoured by a copy of the reasons of appeal (if any) presented to that court.\nIt may be observed that, if no objection was raised in that court to the ruling of the learned trial judge relative to condition No. 9 and hence assented to or accepted by respondent, it should not now be entertained here.\nThe validity of the defence maintained by the court of appeal must depend on how we look at the circumstances under which the insurance was effected, and the facts which are alleged to have materially increased the risk.\nThe authority of the local agency which accepted the risk and issued the policy sued upon may also have to be considered.\nThe risk had been presented to these local agents in October, accepted by them and a policy issued accordingly by them but rejected by the head office under a misapprehension of the nature of the building in which the stock was.\nThe head office, on explanations, desired to retain the risk, but were too late on that occasion as another company had (upon such rejection) meantime taken it for three months. This is only material in considering the knowledge they in said head office must have acquired in course of that dealing; and its bearing upon the authority these local agents had relative to such matters as are involved in this defence.\nThe insurance now in question was asked for by Mr. Blanchard, another insurance agent, asking the local provincial agents of respondent over the phone when the three months\u2019 policy already referred to had expired, or was about to expire, to take the risk.\nMr. Pryor, of the firm representing the respondent for that province, states the matter thus:\u2014\nQ. Do you recognize this policy? L.B. 8\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. That was issued by your firm at your office?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And forwarded to whom?\nA. To Mr. Blanchard in Windsor.\nQ. How did it come to be issued?\nA. Through a telephone message from Mr. Blanchard.\nQ. Applying for? A. For extra insurance on stock of the Evangeline Fruit Company at Windsor.\nQ. At that time were you aware of any other insurance on this stock?\nA. Yes.\nQ. In what companies, and how much?\nA. $1,000 in the Nova Scotia and $2,500 in the Dominion.\nQ. Can you tell me whether you were referred to any place by Mr. Blanchard to get particulars\nA. Yes, to the Nova Scotia Fire.\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I went to their office and took a copy from the daily report in their office of the stock item and building which they had.\nQ. What was the daily report in reference to which you saw?\nA. Building, stock and machinery.\nQ. Of what?\nA. Of the Evangeline Fruit Company.\nQ. Made in respect to what?\nA. From inspection report.\nQ. This daily report was in respect to what? Was it in respect to a policy issued by the Nova Scotia Fire?\nA. Yes, it was.\nQ. You saw that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What information did you get from that with reference first, to the building, if any, machinery, gasoline engine or gasoline?\nA. They were carrying $4,000 an the building, and $1,000 on the stock. I took a note of the stock item and also of the building, I understood there was machinery and gasoline engine, but there was a permit on the policy that no gasoline was to be kept in the building, but as we were not interested in the machinery, why i thought it was not worth taking notice of.\nQ. You got this information before issuing the policy?\nA. Yes.\nQ. When you came over to your office, what steps did you take?\nA. I simply handed the memorandum over to the stenographer and asked her to issue the policy.\nIt is not disputed now that said firm must have known, and, I should suspect, the head office of respondent must also have known unless it neglected to pay attention to that which had previously been before it that a gasoline engine was in use in the building containing the stock in question.\nIt turned out that instead of the supply cask from which five gallons of gasoline were daily drawn to keep the engine running being in the building, it was kept under a platform running at right angles to the building and used for delivery of goods from or to waggons unloading or loading in the adjacent yard.\nI should infer the end of this platform touched or at least came very near to the building. I understand any one inspecting in the most casual way could see this cask.\nWhen insurers know that a gasoline engine is in use in a building regarding which they are concerned as insurers I cannot think they should be heard to say that they were ignorant of the fact which common sense tells them, that a reasonable quantity of gasoline is kept in or near by for purposes of keeping that engine running. No one has ventured to say that the quantity so kept was unreasonable under such circumstances.\nIt is not stated exactly what the size of the cask or barrel as it is sometimes referred to, really was, but if of an unusual capacity I think we would have heard of it.\nIt is shewn that in the case of a gasoline engine on the premises, an extra charge is made for the insurance on account of its use, but it is not shewn or pretended that the mere keeping of what is reasonably necessary to its use is still further taxed by any further increased rate. We have had in the case of Anglo-American Fire Ins. Co. v. Morton[3], an insurance company setting up this defence and claiming change of occupation whereby gasoline came in use and for other reasons policy voided. The appeal failed. The Prairie City Oil Co. v. The Standard Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[4], though turning upon a condition similar to No. 11 in this case seems in principle adverse to respondent\u2019s contention herein.\nI, therefore, conclude this defence is not open to the respondent.\nThe defence under condition No. 11 has, if possible, still less to be said for it. It only applies to the keeping or storing in the building, and what was done here cannot come within the language used.\nBesides that the case of Thompson v. The Equity Fire Ins. Co.[5], reversing the decision of this court[6], seems to make the point hardly arguable, and, indeed, was not pressed on argument.\nThe remaining defence under condition No. 9, though apparently discarded in the court of appeal, was strongly pressed upon us by counsel for respondent.\nBut for the decision of this court in Parsons v. Standard Fire Ins. Co.[7], I should be inclined to think it much more arguable than the other foregoing defences.\nI cannot, however, distinguish it in principle from that case and decision.\nThere is to my mind just one notable fact that might, but for what I am about to refer to, enable us to distinguish it. That is this: In that case the total of the other insurance in question would seem to have been noted upon the policy sued upon and the only change was in substituting one subsequent policy for part of said total. That decision related only to a subsequent insurance and Mr. Newcombe has quite properly put forward this as one where there was also a prior insurance without express notice in writing or written waiver. I hardly think there is sufficient therein to distinguish this from that unless the fact, to which I have already adverted, that in that case the total of the existing insurance having been noted on the policy sued upon would bring the matter of the subsequent insurance more directly to the mind of the insurer than the knowledge I am about to refer to in this case.\nBoth the questions of prior and subsequent insurance are involved herein.\nThe question raised must, therefore, turn upon the effect of the knowledge of the local agents who were provincial agents for transacting the business of the respondent.\nIt certainly was competent for the head office to waive this condition. If the management there, possessed of actual knowledge of the existence of a prior insurance, chose to accept in face of such knowledge payment of the insurance premiums, and deliver as valid a policy of insurance, and thereby induce the insured to accept same, surely such insurers could not be heard to set up the omission on their part to make the necessary entries as an answer to the insured after the loss.\nNow it seems to me that it is clearly established the provincial agents of respondent were authorized not merely to solicit business and give an interim receipt, but to make the contract and issue the policy. Those agents, as shewn by the evidence already quoted, knew of the existence of the prior insurance and that it should have been shewn upon the policy. That, however, and the omission to enter a record thereof upon the policy and knowledge of the substitutionary subsequent policy on the property are exhibited in their true light by the further evidence of Mr. Pryor as follows:\u2014\nQ. Did you know that the prior insurance should have been mentioned on the policy?\nA. I did not see the policy when it was sent out of the office. Had I checked it, I would probably have noticed it and made the correction.\nQ. Tell me what you intended in reference to this prior insurance with regard to your policy?\nA. I intended to put it on the policy, in addition to other concurrent insurance. It was simply a mistake it was not there. It was my intention to have it on. As I said before, I did not see the policy before it went out of the office.\nQ. Was the policy signed by you?\nA. No.\nQ. It was sent out without you having an opportunity of seeing it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You say at the time there was what other insurance, to your knowledge, on the stock?\nA. $2,500 in the Dominion and $1,000 in the Nova Scotia.\nQ. Who were the agents for the Dominion?\nA. Mr. Renwick.\nQ. What became of the Dominion policy, was it ever replaced?\nWhen it expired what happened?\nA. It was replaced by the Provincial.\nQ. By a policy in the Provincial?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And was this the policy L.B. 8 by which that was replaced?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Do you know anything about a policy in the London Mutual?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What was that on?\nA. On stock.\nQ. The same stock?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did that expire?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. What became of that?\nA. I think that was placed on the property. Q. How much was the insurance on this property in the London Mutual?\nA. i think it was $2,500. i would not swear to it.\nQ. You knew that was outstanding at the time this policy was prepared?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you say the same about that as of the other policies that were outstanding, that they should have been inserted in here, and would have been except for your mistakes?\nA. Yes, if i had seen the policy, no doubt it would have been done.\nIt seems to me that under the foregoing statements of fact and having regard to the authority of such agents who received the premium, the respondent cannot he heard to set up as defence the result of its own neglect to note on the policy the facts. And as to the subsequent substitution of a policy in the Provincial Company for that in the London Mutual which had expired, any objection thereto is met by the Parsons v. Standard Fire Ins. Co.[8] case, already referred to, where we find the responsibility for failure to note the latter on the policy is shewn to have rested with the respondent.\nThere is not so far as I have been able to see any English case exactly covering the questions raised by this defence under condition No. 9. This no doubt arises from the fact that English companies do not habitually use such like conditions.\nThere are many cases in the American courts and in our Canadian courts which are not binding upon us but amply cover this case. The many text books referred to by Mr. Roscoe on the law of insurance deal with and refer to waiver of such a condition as set up by the conduct of the insurers. Besides the case already referred to in this court there is the case of Billington v. The Provincial Ins. Co.[9], which seems clearly distinguishable and shews how the promise of an agent who had merely power to issue an interim receipt, would not bind his company.\nThe case of Richard v. Springfield Fire and Marine Ins. Co.[10] shews the distinction observed between the authority of such an agent and the authority of such agents as respondent\u2019s provincial managing and contracting agents in question herein.\nI think the principle observed in the numerous cases cited in the text books referred to and in which the facts fit this case should be followed; though not binding upon us, they seem in line with the Parsons v. Standard Fire Ins. Co.[11] case, which does bind us.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with the costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014I see no reason why the policy upon which the action was brought should not be construed according to the usual rule contra proferentem. I think the insurance of a going factory where the motor power is supplied by a gasoline engine must be taken to contemplate the keeping of a reasonable supply of gasoline for the engine and the keeping of it in a reasonably convenient way. I think, therefore, that the condition of the policy prohibiting the storing of the gasoline in larger quantities than five gallons does not apply to gasoline kept for that purpose. I think, moreover, that the language of Lord Macnaghten in Thompson v. Equity Fire Ins. Co.[12], at page 596, is applicable and that \u201cstored or kept\u201d imports a notion of warehousing or depositing for safe custody or keeping in stock for trade purposes; Lord Macnaghten\u2019s illustration of the keeping of it for domestic uses seems to cover the ground.\nAs to non-disclosure; as the keeping of a reasonable quantity of gasoline must be taken to have been within the contemplation of the parties to the contract, I do not think there was any change of conditions of which the appellants were under any obligation to notify the insurance company.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am, with great respect for the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Drysdale, who tried the action, restored.\nBecause the insurers were referred to a former policy with another company for a description of the property to be insured they seek to incorporate the terms of that policy with regard to the presence of gasoline into the risk assumed. In their policy, however, they saw fit to substitute for the special provisions of the former policy dealing with gasoline the usual statutory condition, and, in my opinion, they are thereby precluded from contending that the risk was subject to any other condition in that particular.\nBy the statutory condition in the defendants\u2019 policy it is provided that the insurer shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring while gasoline is \u201cstored or kept\u201d in the building containing the property insured unless permission in writing is given by the insurer. I doubt whether the supply of gasoline which the plaintiffs had on hand in order to furnish fuel for a gasoline engine known by the insurers to be in use in the building containing the stock insured, and which consumed five gallons of gasoline per diem, can properly be said to have been \u201cstored or kept\u201d within the meaning of this condition. Thompson v. Equity Fire Ins. Co.[13]. But if it was otherwise within it, I am satisfied that the gasoline was not in the building which contained the insured property. It was in fact outside the building and under an adjacent platform used for purposes of loading and unloading wagons. There is no reason why the word \u201cbuilding\u201d should here be given a meaning other than that which it ordinarily bears. Moir v. Williams[14].\nNeither do I think that the policy is avoided because of non-disclosure of the proximity of this supply of gasoline to the building under the condition requiring communication by the insured of all circumstances material to the risk. Being aware that the insured were using the gasoline engine in the building for manufacturing purposes, the insurers must be taken to have had knowledge that a reasonable supply of gasoline for fuel would be kept close at hand. Having this knowledge, they saw fit to stipulate expressly against this supply being kept in the building and did not see fit to inquire at what distance from the building it was placed, although they must have known that convenience required that it should be reasonably close. They can scarcely be heard to say that its precise location was so material to the risk that the insured must have specially communicated it at the peril of the policy being avoided by his failure to do so.\nThe defence that subsequent assurance was effected without notice to the company in breach of the 9th statutory condition, is not referred to in the judgment in the full court, and I am of opinion that it is satisfactorily dealt with by Mr. Justice Drysdale. The general agents of the insurers who issued the policy in question were fully apprised of the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 concurrent insurance when the defendants\u2019 risk was assumed. Their knowledge was that of the defendants, and I think the latter cannot set up their failure to note their assent in or upon the policy as a defence. The subsequent transfer of one of the policies from one company to another was immaterial, there having been no increase in the amount of the concurrent insurance. Parsons v. Standard Fire Ins. Co.[15].\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. M. Christie.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. H.

Raynor (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1915: June 10, 11, 24.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Power company\u2014Accident to employee\u2014Injury from supposed dead wire\u2014Duty of employer\u2014Proper system.\nA power company is not liable for injury to an employee from contact with an electric wire represented to be harmless, but which had, in some way become charged, when it is shewn that every reasonable precaution had been taken for the safety of employees and there is nothing which proves or from which it can be inferred that the accident was due to the negligence of some person for which the company was responsible.\nPer Idington J. dissenting.\u2014The only reasonable inference from the evidence is that the accident was caused by negligence; therefore, as decided by McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co. ([1905] A.C. 72) and Toronto Railway Co. v. Fleming (47 Can. S.C.R. 612), it is not necessary to determine precisely how such negligence produced the injury complained of. There was also some evidence of a want of a proper system and of failure to employ competent persons to superintend the work.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (32 Ont. L.R. 612) reversed, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant company generates electrical energy at Niagara Falls, Ont., and transmit it by high volt- age wires to Hamilton and Toronto. The wires are divided into units consisting of three each, two of which are, for the purposes of this case, known as units A. and B.\nOn Sept. 2nd, 1913, the respondent, Rayner, was engaged in painting a tower supporting a wire of unit A. As the trial judge found he had been assured that this unit contained no current and that he could safely work there. He had been working about fifteen minutes when he received an electric shock which resulted in severe injuries. The trial judge also found that the shock came from contact with a wire on unit A.\nAt the trial, without a jury, the learned judge held the appellant company liable and assessed the damages at $1,200. This judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellants.\nJ.H. Campbell for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent was engaged in the service of appellant in painting for it part of one of its towers beside the Welland Canal, at a point one hundred and thirty-five feet from the ground, when he received an electric current which burned his hand and possibly other parts of his body and caused him to fall some distance to a platform below him, thereby causing other bodily injuries.\nHe sued appellant for damages for such injuries, claiming them to have been caused by its negligence.\nThe tower in question and other like towers carry a number of wires used for conducting electric energy from the Niagara Falls where generated to the City of Toronto.\nThere are two of these wires or sets of wires which for the purpose of this work and this case are designated respectively A. and B. The respondent and his fellow workmen had been assured by appellant\u2019s representative that they would be in perfect safety from the electric current whilst engaged in their work. I do not think, though that assurance was relied upon in argument, that it carries the respondent further than the common law or the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d for the purpose of this case.\nThe respondent, and a fellow workman named Hamilton, under the direction of one Maudsley, their foreman, had painted as required that part of the work carrying line \u201cB\u201d when they awaited the preparation in way of taking the electric current off line \u201cA\u201d and thereby so deadening it, as the expressive phrase used implies, that work could be safely done in close proximity thereto. That being supposed to be perfectly done they in response to the directions of one Creswick on the said tower, and one Smith on another tower some distance away, both engaged in said work of deadening the wire, began their work of painting where directed. They had only been engaged there some ten or fifteen minutes when respondent was so stricken by the current of electricity as to cause the injuries complained of. The learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division who tried the case finds as a fact that these injuries were caused by electric current on the supposed dead wire.\nI have read the entire evidence in the case and I have not the slightest doubt of the correctness of that finding.\nThe respondent and other men called to testify to what happened seem probably to have been strangers to each other till a few days before the accident when Rayner was first engaged by Maudsley. At all events no attack seems to have been made on the trial on their credibility.\nThe story told by Hamilton of a flash from the wire when he and respondent were engaged so closely together is such as to render it impossible to account for that flash by respondent having touched the live wire \u201cB,\u201d five or six feet away from the point they were working at. Maudsley corroborates him. The respondent whose story seems told in a truthful manner denies emphatically touching the other wire or departing from his work. Indeed, the suggestion of his doing so seems most improbable. And curiously enough one Bull, also under Maudsley, working at another point, in proximity to same wire \u201cA,\u201d says:\u2014\nQ. What were you painting?\nA. I was painting iron.\nQ. You heard nothing more?\nA. I heard a sizzle on the wire and turned around immediately: and saw Rayner fall.\nQ. Can you tell from what wire the sizzle was?\nA. From my estimation it came right from the wire alongside of what I was working, Rayner was in the position falling from that wire.\nAnd in cross-examination he tells that he turned round and jumped because he felt sure the wire was alive.\nThe importance of this is that the appellant alleges that wire was dead, and rests its case chiefly upon that ground.\nUpon all that evidence it seems impossible to impugn the finding of fact, even if one felt inclined, as I do not, to doubt the correctness of the finding. I only dwell upon it because there is an attempt, indirectly it is true, to challenge it by asking us to accept theories put forward as opposed to it yet resting only upon the evidence of some witnesses for appellant.\nThe appellant\u2019s case as presented by a number of witnesses convinces me that there was undoubtedly negligence on the part of appellant.\nThe evidence as to the steps taken by Cole and others looking to the clearance of the wire preparatory to the work of painting, may be accepted. But he and others testify in such a way as to demonstrate that, under weather and other conditions then prevailing, it was quite impossible, if the \u201cA\u201d line of wire had all been properly grounded, there could have been any such accident.\nThere seems a general concurrence of opinion that even when the power feeding the current is shut off any wire of the Niagara end, there may be in the wire so shut off what they term static and by induction from other wires an accumulation thereof may occur, which may become a source of danger. Hence the necessity, not only to have those at Niagara shut off the current from the wire to be deadened, but also the wire, when so relieved, protected by groundings at various places and specially so almost immediately at the point next where men are set to work in proximity to or upon the supposedly dead wire.\nCole says in his examination in chief:\u2014\nQ. If a line is properly grounded what is the possibility of having power in it?\nA. No chance at all if it is properly grounded; it would be impossible to get any juice off it.\nAnd in cross-examination:\u2014\nQ. The static will give a shock?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And a man working at that wire at that point that I have described to you would possibly receive a shock from electricity if either one of these ground wires was not efficiently placed?\nA. I do not see how he could get it there because the other man did not get it; if he got it the others would too.\nQ. Answer the question; is that a correct proposition?\nA. Of course, the man told me they had it on good\u2014\nQ. I am not asking you that at all; I am asking you to answer the question?\nA. If it was not on properly certainly he might get it.\n* * * * *\nQ. What is the true and correct meaning of statics as applied to electricity?\nA. It is gathered off the other lines, the live lines.\nQ. In the first place these three wires are dead, that is, the power is shut off at Niagara Falls?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And there is supposed to be no electricity or current in any of those wires in unit A. at that time, that is correct, is it?\nA. Yes, just the static.\nQ. But notwithstanding the fact that the power has been turned off at Niagara Falls, there is a certain quantity of electricity still in the wire?\nA. Static, yes, from the other line.\nQ. That is electricity, is it not?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And in order to protect men who are working at any particular point from that static it is necessary to ground the wires on either side?\nA. That is the idea.\nQ. So the proper grounding is essential?\nA. Yes.\nSeiler, foreman of the transformer at Niagara, says:\u2014 Q. The only power that can get on to that line is from your end of the system?\nA. No, you can make that line alive from some other source, at my end of it it is the only place you can make the line alive, and it might happen that is the only place I could make it alive.\n* * * * *\nQ. Is it possible for him to receive a shock if the wires are not properly grounded?\nA. Yes, static shock.\nQ. I do not care so long as it is a shock; and if Rayner did get a shock either while putting his paint brush in or taking it out of the paint pot which was hanging on this wire or one of these wires he must have received it by reason of improper grounding of the wires?\nA. I could not say on that; I would make no statement there.\n* * * * *\nQ. Can you give any explanation as to how Rayner sustained this injury?\nA. Why, the only way that I can see that he received that shock was that in some way he made contact with line B.\n* * * * *\nQ. That is your inference?\nA. It was as near as I can say; that is truthfully in every way I know; I came to that firm conclusion that he must have got up against the live wire in some way which was carrying the load.\nAnd Alexander Strangways says:\u2014\nQ. Do you know as a matter of fact whether it would be safe for a person to work on what is called a dead line in the event of a ground wire not being properly secured?\nA. In which way?\nQ. Would it be safe for you to work at any certain point on a dead line and that point being between two ground wires, providing those ground wires were not properly attached to the tower?\nA. It would if they were not very far apart; one set of ground wires to a distance of about four or five towers would be perfectly safe to work either side of the ground.\nQ. That is one wire?\nA. One set of ground wires.\nQ. That would be one wire attached to the tower and the other end of it being attached to three wires?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can you say whether it is sufficient simply to attach the wire to the tower or whether there should be some other grounding?\nA. With a proper set of grounds, the kind I was using, it was perfectly safe. Q. What I mean is this, was it necessary and proper that the tower itself should be grounded?\nA. I could not say.\nQ. Your experience does not warrant you in answering that question?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. Do you know anything about these towers, the kind of foundation for them?\nA. There are footings in the ground, I do not know how far they go down in the ground.\nQ. You cannot tell anything about that, whether they are grounded or not?\nA. I could not say.\nThis witness evidently used a patent appliance and something else not in use by others for grounding wires.\nConnery appellant\u2019s superintendent says:\u2014\nQ. Do you mean to say there would not be any mark left on him?\nA. No, sir. I have seen a man killed right in front of my eyes with static shock and there was not a mark on him.\nQ. Then it is possible for a person who gets a static shock to get a severe injury?\nA. Yes, because he fell on his head or fell 40 feet off a tower on his head.\nAnd departing for a moment from this line of evidence this witness, who ought to have known, but does not seem to have, says as to the grounding:\u2014\nQ. You have had these twelve years\u2019 experience; can you tell me the system which is used in the grounding of wires in this company?\nA. Certainly I can.\nQ. Kindly do it; are the towers grounded?\nA. Every tower is grounded, and that particular tower\u2014\nQ. Do you know that as a matter of fact?\nA. I think as a matter of fact I saw those towers built, and there is a copper ribbon in a box of gravel that has a bag over it, and a coil of wire made of copper brought up and riveted to the tower legs right down on the bottom.\nQ. You saw those towers built?\nA. Yes. I was right there when they were built.\nAckerman says he was engaged in an advisory capacity by appellant:\u2014 Q. I asked you what voltage on the static, which is induced by the friction, how much voltage would you get on the wire?\nA. The voltage could theoretically reach, accumulate up to this point where this air gap would break down theoretically, but practically it depends very much on the country, and the fact is due to some conditions probably of the air; having leakage from some of the insulators, it would very seldom reach this voltage where this air gap goes; it happens sometimes, we have some records in very dry summer days where we do not have any lightning reported, we get so called discharge all over our lightning arresters, which we keep records from, which would indicate we have an accumulation of voltage up to this point of breakdown.\nQ. I am speaking of the static?\nA. About the static on a dead wire, where we would not have any ground whatever, just the insulated wire we could reach the same voltage.\nQ. What voltage would you reach?\nA. We could come up to possibly 60,000 volts or higher.\n* * * * *\nQ. You said the static that would get on the line by way of inducement would be 120 volts?\nA. Approximately 120 volts.\nQ. What is the voltage on the ordinary wires where they burn 20 or 30 lights?\nA. That is 110 or 120 volts.\n* * * * *\nQ. I want to get a little further information upon this first kind of static, the static which is due to the wind and swinging wires?\nA. Yes.\nQ. I understood you correctly then; I also understood you to say that static would extend to the adjoining wire, the voltage of the adjoining wire could be given to a dead wire?\nA. Yes.\n* * * * *\nQ. Could you get any static in the way you first mentioned in fifteen minutes on a wire?\nA. I could hardly think so; it takes some time to build up.\nNow, assuming respondent\u2019s story true, can any one say on this evidence that there is any doubt but that somebody in appellant\u2019s service blundered?\nThere is no mystery about the matter. If the appellant\u2019s story be true some neglect of a gross character I fear led to the incident. Creswick, already referred to as one of those who invited respondent to the work, I assume imagined he had grounded his part, for he says he sat on one wire. I doubt if he sat still, as he says, I doubt if his dealing with the wire did not disturb his imperfect work. It is also a very curious circumstance in his connection with the case that he started the rumor, without hearing anything about its truth (as he admits by failing to prove it) that respondent had touched \u201cB\u201d line and hence this accident. Why did he do that? That story flashed down to Niagara twenty minutes later coming from this man has a disagreeable aspect. And unless protected by some non-conductor his story of sitting upon the wire seems highly improbable.\nUpon such a case as the evidence presents there could be no doubt if respondent sued as a stranger, entitled to do so, and not as a servant of the appellant, of his right to recover damages.\nThe decision in the case of McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[2], followed by this court in Toronto Street Railway Co. v. Fleming[3], shews that it is not necessary where the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that there was negligence which caused the accident, to reach a finding of exactly how the result of such negligence produced the injuries complained of.\nIn considering the case then as one by a servant against his master it does not, in view of the moderate damages assessed, seem to matter whether the case can be rested upon the common law or not if maintainable upon the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d Let us consider, however, the liability of appellant at common law:\u2014\nThe defence of common employment is not pleaded as some authorities seem to suggest must be done, and hence possibly not open to the appellant unless it can be implied under the fifth paragraph of the statement of defence.\nThat raises the issue of whether or not there was a proper system furnished to protect those in the position of the respondent.\nIn some features of the system as presented in evidence there certainly was all that possibly might be expected. But in many respects it was not by any means an ideal one.\nThe methods of grounding seem to have been left to the men engaged in the work. It is frankly admitted there were no standard appliances. One man, I infer, adopted one appliance. Others adopted another just as suited their respective views of what would be effective.\nIf we apply the oft-repeated test of Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[4], at page 332, that the master is to select proper and competent persons to superintend the work and to furnish them with adequate materials and resources for the work, I cannot think that was done in this case.\nIn the last analysis it comes to a question of the competence of Creswick and Smith, and the appliances put at their disposal which seem to have been of a very questionable character.\nWhether when used as they saw fit or not the possibility of the tower itself being such as to form a means of grounding which I infer was treated as the means of grounding seems most doubtful from the evidence of the superintendent quoted above.\nIn this regard the onus rested upon the appellant to establish a defence and I think it failed. The evidence is meagre and most unsatisfactory.\nI cannot assent to the proposition that a mere certificate of character in the general terms given by these men for themselves and by the superintendent for them, can fulfil all that is to be expected of men guarding others in a most dangerous occupation requiring therefor a degree of knowledge and skill they evidently did not possess.\nThen under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d R.S.O. ch. 146, sec. 3, sub-secs, (a) and (c), I think the action can be maintained.\nThe painters, including respondent and foreman, as well as others, evidently were expected to conform to the direction of the patrolmen of whom either or both must have failed in his duty.\nOf the other ground what I have said already presents my view of appellant\u2019s failure in many respects.\nIndeed, in argument there was not very much attention paid to this branch of the case, though the matter is dealt with in appellant\u2019s factum.\nThe argument, however, was chiefly directed to the alleged improbabilities of the accident happening in the way or by reason of what respondent and his witnesses alleged and that failing, its cause was suggested to be an insoluble mystery which I have already dealt with.\nRylands v. Fletcher[5], relied upon below does not seem to one, whatever it stands for, to involve any question of negligence, upon which alone respondent must rest his action.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed. There is nothing in the so-called invitation augmenting the duties which the law imposed on the company as incidental to the relation of master and servant; it cannot reasonably be construed as involving anything like a warranty against accidents. If it had that effect it was clearly ultra vires of the foreman.\nThe respondent fails to make out a case and he fails in my opinion for this reason; when the evidence is looked at as a whole and I have carefully examined it all the proper conclusions are:\u2014\n(1) That the appellant company, neglected no duty which the common law cast upon it in relation to the safety of the respondent; that is to say, the appellant company neglected no precaution suggested by science or practical experience which could reasonably be required of them for the diminution of the risk of accident.\nFurther assuming that the accident was the result of negligence of some servant of the company there is no ground whatever for saying that it was the negligence of anybody of whom the appellant company would be at common law responsible vis \u00e0 vis the respondent.\n(2) There is nothing in the evidence to bring the respondent\u2019s case within any of the classes of the cases in which by the terms of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d he would be entitled to recover. I asked Mr. Campbell during the argument more than once to refer to the clause of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d upon which his right to recover could be based, but the question, of course, does not admit of an answer from the record.\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Clute in the Court of Appeal proceeds, as far as I can gather, on the application of the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher[6].\nThis doctrine has never been applied and could not, without bringing the direst confusion into the law on the subject, be applied in cases of this description between master and servant, where apart from statute the question must always be (the master being charged with responsibility for harm coming to the servant in the course of his employment): Was the harm caused by the failure of the master in any duty to the servant arising out of the relation subsisting between them? The duty of protecting or compensating the servant for harm arising from the perils incidental to the service which cannot be avoided by any reasonable degree of care on the part of the master, is not one of the duties which the law casts upon the master. Even where the peril can be avoided the master performs his duty if he provides adequate means and appliances and competent servants, and provides a proper system of working with a view to securing safety.\nThe doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher6 imposes a responsibility which in the first place is, speaking generally, absolute for the consequences of the escape of the noxious agent (excepting where the escape is due to the act of God or the mischievous intervention of a third party) and in the second place cannot be discharged by employing independent contractors or servants never so competent and never so well equipped as to skill and means.\nSuch a principle could only become part of the law of master and servant by the instrumentality of legislation and, one must add, revolutionary legislation.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With very great respect for the learned trial judge and the majority of the judges of the Appellate Division, I am of the opinion that the judgment in favour of the plaintiff cannot be sustained. The learned trial judge found as a fact that the electric current which the plaintiff received came from the supposedly dead wire on which he was working, and, while he did not accept that finding, Mr. McCarthy conceded that he could not attack it with any hope of success. But the learned judge did not suggest how the wire had become charged; nor did he indicate any negligence, which would be imputable to the defendant company, as the cause of this having occurred\u2014and it is only, if there was such negligence, that the plaintiff can recover.\nIt may not improperly be assumed in favour of the plaintiff that the happening of the accident under the circumstances in which it occurred cast upon the defendants the burden of proving that they had taken every reasonable precaution to ensure the plaintiff\u2019s safety while at his work. That burden the defendants assumed and counsel for the plaintiff was unable to point to any particular in which they had failed to discharge it. Improbable\u2014almost impossible\u2014as it may seem in view of the precautions taken and the surrounding\u201d circumstances, if the wire upon which the plaintiff was working became charged with electricity, upon the evidence it is quite as likely that this was due to some inexplicable electric phenomenon against which no precaution known to science would be effective as that it occurred through the negligence of any person. If it was the result of negligence it must be the purest conjecture that such negligence was in matter which would entail liability at common law, or was that of a person for whose fault the company would be responsible under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 146), and was not the negligence of some workman against which the defence of common employment would prevail alike at common law and under the statute. The case does not fall within the maxim res ipsa loquitur. Indeed, upon the evidence accepted as veracious, negligence of any kind is, I think, completely disproved. I am, with respect, unable to understand the application of the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher[7], invoked in the Appellate Division to the case of a claim against his master by a servant injured in the course of his employment.\nIt may be that this case affords a striking illustration of an evil which the new \u201cOntario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d is designed to remedy. But under the law as it stood when the plaintiff was injured he had, in my opinion, no recourse against his employers.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the defendants are entitled to their costs of the litigation throughout, if they should see fit to exact them.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lancaster, Campbell & Lancaster.\n[1] 32 Ont.

Co. v. Weir, (1915) 51 S.C.R. 506\nDate: 1915-06-24\nThe Hamilton Street Railway Company (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nRobert Weir and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1915: June 11, 24.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Obstruction of highway\u2014Street railway\u2014Trolley poles between tracks\u2014Statutory authority\u2014Protection by light.\nThe Act incorporating the Hamilton Street Railway Co. authorized the City Council to enter into an agreement with the company for the construction and location of the railway. A by-law passed by the Council directed that the poles for holding wires should, on part of a certain street, be placed between the tracks, which was done under supervision of the City Engineer.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed against (32 Ont. L.R. 578), that the location of the poles was authorized by the legislature and did not constitute an obstruction of the highway amounting to a nuisance; the company was, therefore, not liable for injury resulting from an automobile while driven at night coming in contact with the pole.\nHeld, also, that as on the City Council was cast the duty of regulating the operation of the railway in respect to traffic and travelling on the street and it had made no regulation as to lighting the pole the company was under no obligation to do so.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nOn the 23rd day of May, 1913, at about nine o\u2019clock in the evening, the respondent Robert Weir was driv- ing an automobile in an easterly direction along King Street, being a public highway in the City of Hamilton, and came into collision with a pole supporting the trolley wires belonging to the appellants situated on the devil strip between the tracks of the said appellants\u2019 line of railway, which were situated on King Street immediately north of a park in the centre of the street, known as the Gore Extension, and by reason of the said collision, the respondent\u2019s automobile was damaged and the respondent Robert Weir and another occupant of the car, the respondent Gladys Weir, to some extent injured.\nThe action came on for trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice Latchford with a jury on the 21st of April, 1914, at the sittings holden at Toronto, when questions were submitted to the jury, who found the company guilty of negligence and respondents not guilty of contributory negligence. The trial judge entered judgment upon these answers in favour of the respondents, Robert Weir and Gladys Weir, for the sum of $1,035.20, the action being dismissed as to the claims of the respondents, James Gowans Kent and Caroline Kent.\nFrom this judgment an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario and that court gave judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, the Honourable Mr. Justice Hodgins dissenting, the Honourable Mr. Justice Leitch expressing no opinion.\nFrom that judgment the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe statute incorporating the appellants and under the authority of which the municipal corporation of the City of Hamilton had power and control over the location of the poles of the appellant company is chapter 100 of 36 Victoria (1873), more particularly sections 7, 15 and 16.\n\u201c7. The company are hereby authorized and empowered to construct, maintain, complete and operate a double or single iron railway, with the necessary side tracks and turnouts, for the passage of cars, carriages and other vehicles adapted to the same, upon and along streets and highways within the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the City of Hamilton, and of any of the adjoining municipalities as the company may be authorized to pass along, under and subject to any agreement hereafter to be made between the council of the said city and of said municipalities respectively, and of the said company and under and subject to any by\u2011laws of the said corporation of the said city and municipalities respectively, or any of them, made in pursuance thereof * * * and to construct and maintain all necessary works, buildings, appliances and conveniences connected therewith.\u201d\n\u201c15. The council of the said city and of any of the said adjoining municipalities, or any of them, and the said company, are respectively hereby authorized to make and to enter into any agreement or covenants relating to the construction of the said railway; for the paving, macadamizing, repairing and grading of the streets or highways; and the construction, opening of, and repairing of drains or sewers; and the laying of gas and water pipes in the said streets and highways; the location of the railway, and the particular streets along which the same shall be laid; the pattern of rail; the time and speed of running of the cars, the time within which the works are to be commenced; the manner of proceeding with the same, and the time for completion; and generally for the safety and convenience of passengers; the conduct of the agents and servants of the company; and the non-obstructing or impeding of the ordinary traffic.\u201d\nIn pursuance of the authority conferred upon the municipality by sections 7, 15, and 16, by\u2011law No. 624 of the City of Hamilton, was passed and is incorporated as schedule \u201cA\u201d to an Act respecting the Hamilton Street Railway Company, being 56 Vict. ch. 90 (1893)\u2014section 28 of the said by-law providing as follows: \u201cAll poles shall be placed on the sides of the street, except on King Street, between Hughson and Mary Streets, where they shall be placed between the tracks, and all the poles of the company shall be placed in such manner as to obstruct as little as possible the use of the streets for other purposes.\u201d And section 31 provides that \u201call works of construction and repair and of removal and spreading of snow or ice shall be done, and all poles shall be placed under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the city engineer.\u201d\nThe pole in question was located in the position it occupied at the time of the accident, in the year 1893, by Mr. Haskins, who was city engineer at that time, and was erected under his directions. Subsequently, before the accident, an application was made by the street railway company to remove the poles on the devil-strip between Hughson and Mary Streets, of which the pole in question was one, but the municipality refused to entertain their application.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and A.H. Gibson for the appellants, referred to National Telephone Co. v. Baker[2]; McLelland v. Manchester Corporation.[3]\nHowitt for the respondents. No statutory authority could justify the obstruction of the highway by placing the pole in the middle of the street. See Atkinson v. City of Chatham.[4]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I confess myself unable fully to appreciate the meaning of the statement of the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the second Appellate Division of Ontario, and on which that judgment was founded as to \u201cthe limited character of the power of the provincial legislature to interfere with a public highway.\u201d\nI have always understood that when legislating within any of the powers conferred upon it by the 92nd section of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d the powers of the provincial legislature are plenary except in so far as its legislation may be over-ridden or controlled by legislation of the Parliament of Canada under some one of the enumerated powers of section 91 of that Act.\nNo such question, however, of the clashing of the powers of the Parliament and the legislature arises in this case.\nIn my judgment the by-law under which the pole in question was placed in its specific location in the street was fully authorized by the incorporating statute of the appellant company and the pole must, therefore, be held to have been there properly. The finding of the jury that the trolley poles \u201cshould have been placed in a uniform position\u201d cannot be upheld under the proved facts and the law. The company placed the poles in the places where they were directed by the city authorities under the by-law to place them. No other negligence on the defendants\u2019 part was found and this specific finding excludes any other.\nI think, therefore, the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs including any costs which may have been incurred by the city the third party to the action.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant company is found by the verdict of a jury, maintained by the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, guilty of negligence because its \u201ctrolley poles should have been placed in a uniform position along the entire thoroughfare,\u201d and, therefore, condemned to pay damages suffered by the respondents in consequence of driving, at thirteen miles an hour, along that part of the street whereon the appellant\u2019s electric street railway was constructed and colliding with one of the said trolley poles, although there was alongside the said railway a travellable space of street twenty-five feet in width upon which they might easily have driven.\nThe Legislature of Ontario which has absolute legislative power in the premises delegated to the municipal council of the corporation of the City of Hamilton the powers contained in the following amongst other sections:\u2014\n7. The company are hereby authorized and empowered to construct, maintain, complete, and operate a double or single iron rail- way, with the necessary side tracks and turnouts, for the passage of cars, carriages, and other vehicles adapted to the same, upon and along streets and highways within the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the City of Hamilton, and of any of the adjoining municipalities, as the company may be authorized to pass along, under and subject to any agreement hereafter to be made between the council of the said city and of said municipalities respectively, and the said company, and under and subject to any by-laws of the said corporation of the said city and municipalities respectively, or any of them, made in pursuance thereof, and to take, transport, and carry passengers and freight upon the same, by the force or power of animals or such other motive power as they may be authorized by the council of said city and municipalities respectively by by-law to use, and to construct and maintain all necessary works, buildings, appliances, and conveniences connected therewith.\n15. The council of the said city, and of any of the said adjoining municipalities, or any of them, and the said company, are respectively hereby authorized to make and to enter into any agreement or covenants relating to the construction of the said railway; for the paving, macadamizing, repairing, and grading of the streets or highways; and the construction, opening of, and repairing of drains and sewers; and the laying of gas and water pipes in the said streets and highways; the location of the railway, and the particular streets along which the same shall be laid; the pattern of rail; the time and speed of running of the cars, the time within which the works are to be commenced; the manner of proceeding with the same, and the time for completion; and generally for the safety and convenience of passengers; the conduct of the agents and servants of the company; and the non-obstructing or impeding of the ordinary traffic.\n16. The said city, and the said municipalities, are hereby authorized to pass any by-law or by-laws, and to amend, repeal, or enact the same for the purpose of carrying into effect any such agreements or covenants, and containing all such necessary clauses, provisions, rules, and regulations for the conduct of all parties concerned, including the company, and for the enjoining obedience thereto, and also for the facilitating the running of the company\u2019s cars, and for regulating the traffic and conduct of all persons travelling upon the streets and highways through which the said railway may pass.\nThe said council pursuant thereto passed a by-law which permitted the use by appellant of certain streets for its railway, and amongst other things relative thereto, provided as follows:\u2014\n28. The poles to be used for the company\u2019s wires on James Street, from Cannon Street to Hunter Street, and on King Street, from Bay Street to Mary Street, shall be of iron and of the most improved pattern, except where the company shall use the poles of any telegraph or telephone company, and the wooden poles used by the company shall all be straight and perpendicular, and as nearly as possible of the same shape and size, and shall be dressed and painted throughout, and all poles shall be placed on the sides of the street except on King Street, between Hughson and Mary Streets, where they shall be placed between the tracks, and all the poles of the company shall be placed in such manner as to obstruct as little as possible the use of the streets for other purposes.\n31. All works of construction and repair and of removal and spreading of snow or ice shall be done, and all poles shall be placed under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the city engineer.\nThe poles complained of were accordingly placed as directed some twenty years before this accident now in question. The location of the railway was wholly within the power of the council. Ample reason is assigned for placing the poles as was done.\nThe matter was wholly within the legislative power thus conferred upon said council who no doubt exercised their best judgment (aided as appears by able and experienced counsel as to the law and by an engineer of skill) relative to public safety and convenience.\nI do not think it is competent for a jury to sit in review upon such legislative work twenty years later, and to find that such legislative action was an act of negligence.\nAnd if it was not negligence on the part of the councillors so directing, it certainly could not be negligence on the part of the appellant bound to conform therewith or have their road removed off the street.\nI am also unable to understand how a gentleman driving an automobile, on a dark and misty night, at the rate he admitted over that side of the street whereon the appellant\u2019s track was laid, even though well lighted, could be acquitted of negligence, when he had no occasion for such a proceeding and a reasonably wide street alongside the track to travel upon. Possibly the city council has been guilty of negligence in failing (if it has) to pass and enforce a by-law prohibiting such conduct.\nI think the action should have been dismissed and that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the action dismissed.\nDUFF J.\u2014There are two questions:\u2014First, is the company liable as for nuisance in placing its poles where it did place them? That question must be answered in the negative for the short reason that by-laws passed under the authority of statute expressly required the poles to be placed where these poles were placed. The precise thing that was done was authorized by the legislature. It, therefore, could not be a nuisance in contemplation of law. If harm arises from the placing of poles where the legislature directs they shall be put, such harm, as Lord Blackburn said, is damnum absque injuri\u00e2. As to the authority of the legislature, with great respect, I think item 10 of section 92, \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d must have been overlooked. If the construction of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d adopted below were accepted the result would be that every provincial railway crossing a highway with its locomotives, and every tramway worked under provincial authority in the streets of a city, is a public nuisance.\nThe next question is whether there is evidence of negligence to go to the jury in the failure to provide a light. I think the answer to that also lies in the fact that the company was authorized to put its poles where it did put them, the city council having power to exact conditions for the protection of the traffic, and the city council also assuming the lighting of the streets. I do not think that any jury would be entitled to find that in these circumstances any legal duty was cast upon the railway company to apply itself to the question whether the lighting provided by the municipality in the particular locality was or was not sufficient for the protection of persons using the highway.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe ground of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, which has been upheld in the provincial courts, is that they were injured as the result of an automobile in which they were travelling colliding with a trolley pole of the defendants placed in the middle of the space between the double track, commonly called the devil-strip, on King Street in the City of Hamilton. This they allege was an unlawful obstruction of a highway amounting to a nuisance. The defendants maintain that they were obliged by the provisions of the statute under which their railway is constructed and operated to place and maintain the pole in question precisely where it was. There is no doubt that the pole was placed where a by-law of the municipality expressly required that it should be. The contention of counsel for the respondents is that the provincial statute does not authorize such a by-law, and that, if it does, the statute is pro tanto ultra vires.\nIts incorporating statute (36 Vict., ch. 100), authorizes and empowers the appellant company\nto construct, maintain, complete and operate a double of single iron railway * * * upon and along streets and highways within the Jurisdiction of the corporation of the City of Hamilton * * * subject to any agreement hereafter to be made between the council of the said city * * * and the said company and under and subject to any by-laws of the said corporation of the said city * * * made in pursuance thereof * * * and to construct and maintain all necessary works, buildings, appliances and conveniences connected therewith.\nIt is further enacted that\nthe council of the said city * * * and the said company are respectively hereby authorized to make and to enter into any agreement or covenants relating to the construction of the said railway * * * the location of the railway and the particular streets upon which the same shall be laid * * * and generally for the safety and convenience of passengers, the conduct of the agents and servants of the company and the non-obstructing or impeding of the ordinary traffic;\nand the city is authorized\nto pass any by-law or by-laws and to amend, repeal or enact the same for the purpose of carrying into effect any such agreements or covenants and containing all such necessary clauses, provisions, rules and regulations for the conduct of all parties concerned, including the company and for the enjoining obedience thereto and also for the facilitating the running of the company\u2019s cars and for regulating the traffic and conduct of all persons travelling upon streets and highways through which the said railway may pass.\nThe by-law in question was passed under this legislation and was subsequently appended as a schedule to an amending statute (56 Vict. ch. 90), which, however, does not in terms approve or confirm it. The effect of this legislation is discussed in the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Hodgins and I concur in his opinion that it empowered the municipality to enact the by-law under which the pole in question was placed and maintained where it was.\nBut I cannot agree with the view of the learned judge that there should be a new trial to permit of an investigation being made to ascertain whether some such precaution as the placing of a light on the pole should have been taken. There is no by-law or regu- lation of the municipality which prescribes anything of the kind and it was to the council of the municipality and not to the defendants that the legislature entrusted the regulation of the operation of the railway so far as it might affect the safety of traffic on the highway. In my opinion the statute and the by-law afford a complete answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nMr. Justice Sutherland appears to think that if the by-law in question is authorized by the provincial statute the latter involves an interference with the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament over criminal law. \u201cCommon nuisance\u201d as defined in the Criminal Code would not cover an obstruction in a highway authorized by a provincial legislature in which control over highways as local works and undertakings is vested. Moreover, we are now concerned merely with a question of civil rights, over which the legislature of the province had undoubted jurisdiction. With respect, I am unable to appreciate the ground on which the learned judge bases his view that there has been an invasion of federal jurisdiction.\nI would, for these reasons, allow the defendants\u2019 appeal and would dismiss this action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gibson, Levy & Gibson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gregory & Gooderham.\n[1] 32 Ont.

[1897] ch. 191, has no power to guarantee payment of advances by a bank to another company whose sole connection with the guarantor is that of a customer, for the general purposes of the latter\u2019s business, and such a contract of suretyship is ultra vires and void.\nJudgment appealed against (30 Ont. L.R. 87) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe facts which brought about the action in this case are not in dispute. The action is brought upon a guaranty executed under the defendants\u2019 seal and by its officers. The defences are two-fold, first that there was no money owing for the debt, second that the guaranty was ultra vires of the defendant company.\nThe defendants were incorporated pursuant to the \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d then in force (R.S.O., 1897, ch. 191), by letters patent of the Province of Ontario dated the 28th September, 1904, and the said guaranty is in form a general guaranty to the United Empire Bank of Canada guaranteeing the account of the West Lorne Wagon Company, Limited, to the sum of fifteen thousand dollars.\nThe Union Bank is the successor of the United Empire Bank and entitled to any rights it might have under such guaranty.\nThe defendant company was incorporated by Archibald McKillop, his three brothers and a sister; and on the 17th February, 1905, these individuals, as individuals, had executed a guaranty to the Merchants Bank for the indebtedness to the West Lorne Wagon Company, Limited, to the sum of twenty thousand dollars.\nOn the 13th day of March, 1907, when the guaranty sued on was executed the defendant company owned one share in the West Lorne Wagon Company, Limited, the West Lorne Wagon Co. then owed the Merchants Bank about forty thousand dollars, and at this time the wagon company arranged with the United Empire Bank that this latter bank should take over the account.\nThe West Lorne Wagon Co. assigned for the benefit of creditors to Mr. G.T. Clarkson, of Toronto, on the 25th April, 1911. The West Lorne Co. paid no divident to creditors, but the Union Bank as successors of the United Empire Bank received $105,250.71 from the assignee on bonds secured by mortgage held by the bank and the bank also received $20,081 in respect of book accounts also assigned to the bank. The plaintiffs claim that at the time the action was commenced, namely, the 5th June, 1912, there was owing to them in respect of the indebtedness of the West Lorne Co. the sum of seventy-eight thousand dollars odd. The respondents claim that after making proper allowance there was no indebtedness from the wagon company to the bank.\nHamilton Cassels K.C. for the appellants, cited Attorney-General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[2]; Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[3]; Hughes v. Northern Electric and Mfg. Co.[4]\nC.A. Moss and J.B. McKillop for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Hodgins speaking for the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant seeks to recover from respondent, which is a company incorporated on the 28th September, 1904, under the \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d then in force, upon an alleged guarantee of respondent for the indebtedness of the Lorne Wagon Company, Limited, to the appellant, for the sum of $15,000.\nThe \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d enabled the partnership firm of McKillop & Sons to become so incorporated, but did not in express terms enable respondent to give such a guarantee.\nIt happens to be the fact that the said firm was, and the respondent company continued to be, a family-owned concern, having no other shareholders than those composing the firm which became so incorporated.\nIt is proven that the guarantee of said firm before its incorporation had been given for an amount and under such circumstances as would, if there had been no incorporation of the firm, have resulted, by virtue of the events which have transpired, in possibly rendering the members of the firm liable for the sum claimed.\nThey escaped that possible liability because the guarantee which the firm had given was surrendered and in substitution therefor the guarantee of the corporate company was taken.\nThe neat question whereon this appeal must turn is whether or not this corporate company had within the powers given it by the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d that of guaranteeing as sureties the debt of the West Lorne Wagon Company, which all the shareholders of the respondent had a very material interest in seeing paid, or at least in their being relieved from liability therefor, but it as a corporation had none.\nIt is alleged that respondent had no other creditors.\nIt does not appear to me that this interest of the shareholders can have anything to do with the question or any bearing thereon whatever.\nThe powers of the incorporated company must be measured by the express powers given by the Act of incorporation and such necessarily implied powers as the general purview of the statute demonstrates were intended to be covered by the expressions used in the statute. For example, the corporation may have been enabled to undertake some obligation, or by law may have had imposed upon it some obligation, which in either case must be discharged. The clear legal duty thus created may have rendered necessary the doing of that which the express language of the statute creating it or enabling its creation may not by that language have been very accurately defined.\nIn such a case the corporation may, by way of implication, be found to possess the powers which the language defining its powers might not have made quite apparent.\nIn the case presented there is no pretence of such express power and there is nothing from which the express language used can, by interpretation, be so modified by way of implication therein as to support the alleged guarantee.\nI think the corporation not only has no powers beyond that so given it, but must assert such power as it may have been given by the method through and by which it is enabled to act, and when going beyond such limits its acts are ultra vires and void. Such, I think, was the nature of this alleged guarantee.\nThe recent decision of this court in the case of Hughes v. The Northern Electric and Mfg. Co.[5], was relied upon by appellant\u2019s counsel. The decisions in that case and the unreported case of Lambert v. Richards, and some other cases, mark a trend of judicial opinion which, followed out logically, may soon justify the argument presented. The notion seems somewhat prevalent that so long as none but shareholders are concerned that they can use the name and so abuse or transgress the powers of the company as they please and by such acts as the statute has not enabled bind the corporation to contracts never contemplated by the statute creating it or upon which its creation rests, so long as it has not prohibited the doing thereof.\nI respectfully submit that the proper measure of a company\u2019s powers are what it has been enabled to do, and not what it has been prohibited from doing.\nBut I do not think even these decisions or that mode of reasoning can maintain this appeal.\nAgain, the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d was so modified in 1907 as to carry into it the word \u201cguarantee\u201d amongst the new powers of the corporations entitled to act upon such amended Act, and appellant relies thereon.\nI do not think as at present advised that the amendment applies to such a case as presented here.\nThe facts, however, do not warrant such application. In the case of a company, which this is not, having for its object, or one of its objects, the business of a guarantor, or incidentally to the transaction of its business occasions to give a guarantee, we can conceive of such a thing as a company using this new power.\nI shall not attempt to define what is intended by the amendment. I must be permitted to doubt if it ever can be applied to the case of a pure act of suretyship without any relation to the transactions in which the corporation is rightfully engaged.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellants now put their case in two ways. First, they say that the guarantee of the 13th March, 1907, was within the powers of the defendant company.\nThe contract upon which the action is brought is not within the objects defined by the letters patent either expressly or by necessary implication. Hughes v. Northern Electric and Manufacturing Co.[6] was referred to, but that decision had no relevancy, resting as it did upon necessary implication.\nCounsel for the appellant bank also relies upon the contention that he is entitled to call in aid of the provisions of the \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d of 1907, ch. 24, sec. 17, sub-sec. (d), and sections 210 and 211. The effect of the last two sections undoubtedly is to make this Act applicable to the defendant company, but it could not be read as giving validity to the pretended contract which was entered into before the passing of the Act. That contract is inoperative for want of capacity on the part of the company.\nThe ground which the appellant bank ultimately took up was that the defendant company by reason of its conduct since the Act of 1907 came in force has made itself responsible for the payment of the moneys the bank seeks to recover.\nThere is an objection based upon the Statute of Frauds which it will be unnecessary to discuss. The insuperable obstacle in the way of this contention is that it has no substratum of fact. The evidence is explicit and it is not contradicted that the advance made under this guarantee was made in the month of April, 1907, some months before the Act came in force. The note which was given for the advance was renewed a number of times after the passing of the Act of 1907, but it is not suggested that the renewals were granted by the bank upon the faith of anything done by the appellants and there is no evidence to justify a suggestion even that during this time the bank was not acting upon the faith of the guarantee given in March. I have no doubt it was assumed by everybody until advice was taken upon it that this guarantee was perfectly valid.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The giving of the guarantee, which the plaintiffs seek to enforce, was not authorized in terms by R.S.O. 1897, ch. 191, by which the defendant company was governed when it was executed and delivered, and the authorities, many of which are cited in the judgment of the Appellate Division, make it clear that such a contract cannot be regarded as something incidental either to the undertaking or to the expressed powers of such a company. The evidence seems to shew that the account of the West Lorne Wagon Company was taken over by the United Empire Bank\u2014the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors\u2014before the date at which the \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d of 1907 came into force. But, if the bank actually made its advances subsequently to that date, they were made upon the faith of the guarantee given on the 13th March, 1907. There is no evidence of any new contract, or of any subsequent ratification by the defendant company of the guarantee sued upon, if, indeed, there could be ratification of such an ultra vires instrument. Indeed, it is quite clear that in taking over the account and making its advances the bank acted upon the assumption that the guarantee had been ab initio valid and effectual, and that neither ratification nor a new contract under the powers conferred by the Act of 1907 was requisite.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Du Vernet, Raymond, Ross & Ardagh.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McKillop, Murphy & Gunn.\n[1] 30 Ont.

The $5,000 was paid and in March, 1905, when an instalment was overdue and the second accruing a new agreement was executed, to which C. was a party, for sale of the property to a mining company for the same price and on the same terms. This agreement provided that nothing in it should affect the right of the vendor to claim from C. the amount payable under the original contract up to March, 1905, otherwise the latter was to be merged in the new contract. The mining company made default in their payments and, as provided in their contract, the vendors gave notice that the contract was at an end and, later, sold the property for $75,000. They then took action against C. for the amount unpaid on the original agreement and recovered judgment. After the final sale of the mine C. applied for and obtained from a judge an order declaring that V. & Co. were not entitled to enforce their judgment against him except for the costs. On appeal from the affirmance of this order by the Appellate Division,\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Appellate Division (32 Ont. L.R. 200) that by extinguishing the interest of the mining company in the land and then selling it V. & Co. had put it out of their power to place C. in the position he was entitled to occupy on making payment and had thus disabled themselves from enforcing their judgment. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming a judge\u2019s order declaring that plaintiffs were no longer entitled to enforce their judgment against the defendant.\nThe facts are fully stated in the above head-note.\nW.M. Douglas K.C., and Lefroy K.C. for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. and H.S. White for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs,\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent bought from the appellant a mining property for the sum of $125,000 payable by instalments, paid $500 cash and gave his promissory note for $4,500 to complete the cash payment.\nThe appellant recovered judgment against him on said promissory note and that judgment was paid by him some time before February, 1906.\nMeantime he had entered into possession of the property and assigned his purchase to the Standard Mining Company.\nThereupon, on 10th March, 1905, an agreement was entered into between respondent of the first part, the said mining company of the second part, and appellant of the third part.\nTherein the foregoing facts, save as to payment of said judgment, were recited, and the further facts that the mining company had agreed to assume the payment of said purchase money and all other obligations imposed by the said contract upon the purchaser thereunder and that the parties desired in some respect to modify the terms of said agreement and to define their rights by a more formal document.\nThen followed the last three recitals which may help to interpret the clauses of said document now in question and are as follows:\u2014\nAnd whereas the vendors also claim that the party of the third part is personally liable for the sum of twenty-four thousand dollars, a portion of the purchase money, falling due on the 23rd day of June, 1904, and is also liable for a portion of the instalment to fall due on the 23rd June, 1905.\nAnd whereas the party of the third part disputes all personal liability therefor.\nAnd whereas the parties hereto desire in the making of this agreement to reserve all the rights and liabilities both of the vendors and of the party of the third part with respect to the twenty-four thousand dollars which fell due on the 23rd June, 1904, and of the said payment accruing due on the 23rd of June, 1905.\nI will refer presently to the operative parts of said agreement thus introduced.\nThe appellant, on the 27th of June, 1906, commenced an action against respondent to recover the sum of $33,000, being the instalment of the 23rd of June, 1904, and part of that of the 23rd of June, 1905, which are referred to in these recitals I have quoted.\nIn that action the appellant recovered judgment for $33,556.20, and therefrom respondent appealed unsuccessfully to the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and finally to this court.\nThese decisions[2] are respectively reported in 15 Ont. L.R 280; 16 Ont. L.R. 372, and 41 Can. S.C.R. 607. It was contended therein amongst other things, that the property having passed from the appellant, the vendor, by virtue of a tripartite agreement, and it being no longer possible for it to give to the respondent, the vendee, title thereto, the right to recover from the vendee was gone.\nThis court as well as those through which the case travelled here held that, the respondent, notwithstanding that and other contentions set up, was liable.\nIt is pressed upon us by Mr. Douglas that the right so maintained cannot now be disturbed by what has since transpired.\nThe appellant issued execution upon said judgment. The Standard Mining Company failed to pay purchase money as provided by the tripartite agreement above referred to; the appellant proceeded to declare under power therein the agreement null and to re-sell the property for $75,000, and, therefore, the respondent moved to set aside the said execution and obtained the order so asked for saving as to costs; which has been upheld by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nIt appears to me that the correctness of such holding must turn upon the interpretation to be given the agreement of 10th March, 1905.\nThat agreement expressly provided for the sale by appellant to the mining company with the usual provisions one would expect to find in such a contract of sale and purchase, plus a few special provisions designed to preserve for appellant the liability of respondent for the parts of the original purchase money in respect of which the judgment has been recovered which is now in question, and at the same time pro- vide for its discharge out of the first payments to be made by the mining company.\nClause nine substituted the mining company for the respondent in the original agreement, and that was to be deemed merged in this agreement subject, however, to the provisions next contained.\nThat is followed by clause ten, reading thus:\u2014\n10. It is expressly agreed and understood that this agreement, and anything that may he done hereunder shall not affect or prejudice the claim of the vendors against the party of the third part in respect of the sum of $24,000 which fell due on the 23rd June, 1904; or the payment accruing due on the 23rd June, 1905, or for interest upon the unpaid purchase money up to the date of the said assignment hereinbefore in part recited, nor shall it affect or prejudice the rights of the said party of the third part with respect thereto, but until the purchaser shall pay the first two instalments of $24,000 each, with interest as aforesaid, the rights of the vendors and the party of the third part shall remain as they now are in respect of said instalments and interest.\nClause 12 provided that all moneys paid under this agreement shall in the first place be applied towards the discharge of said judgment (being that on the $4,500 note) and then towards the discharge of the claim of the vendors against the respondent in respect of which their rights have been thereinbefore reserved, being manifestly the claims referred to in clause 10, which are now in question.\nThe judgment first referred to as already stated has been paid and hence out of the way.\nNothing seems to have been paid on the purchase by the mining company.\nClause 8 of the agreement provided that upon such default as thereby occurred the appellant might forfeit the agreement by giving a month\u2019s notice; which on the default that took place was duly given. Then it was declared that upon such forfeiture this agreement shall be null and void.\nIs there any answer to that realized result of what was contemplated? If null and void thereby, is not the respondent in the same position as if the agreement never existed? Is the relation between the parties hereto not left as it was originally of vendor and vendee with a judgment in favour of the former against the latter? Is not the contemplated merger of the original agreement in this later one at an end? Was it not a conditional merger?\nThe suggestion is certainly a legal curiosity, but how otherwise can we give effect to the purpose of the parties?\nCan we say the agreement stands despite this declaration of its nullity?\nIt was quite competent for the parties to have provided instead thereof that the appellant should be at liberty to resell the property. In that case the liability of the respondent as determined in the litigation to which I have adverted might have to be considered as finally determined and the result, it might in such event, have been argued, was that as he had assented to this sale to the mining company, he could not complain that his right as vendee had been infringed and he, therefore, entitled to be relieved as he claims herein.\nBut if this agreement and all therein is to be treated as null and void, surely the parties are restored to their original position as vendor and vendee, the original contract of sale and purchase and the judgment now in question standing for part of the purchase money. In that case it seems clear the relief given below is what respondent as vendee is entitled to.\nIf the re-sale had taken place by virtue of a provision in the later agreement, some very interesting questions might still have arisen. Such as in that case was he to be held only a surety for the mining company, or in some such sort of position entitled to relief over against that company and thereby entitled to claim subrogation in some way I need not pursue.\nMy construction of the agreement as result of the foregoing analysis is that all it stood for is at an end and respondent entitled under the authorities to the relief he sought and got. I cannot see my way to holding the declaration of intended merger of such a character as to dominate all else in the agreement. It was not so argued.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014What is the meaning of Clergue\u2019s being personally liable notwithstanding anything \u201cdone\u201d under the agreement? It would be an extreme construction to hold that Clergue\u2019s obligation which would be a secondary obligation should persist notwithstanding the fact that the primary obligation had been destroyed. The clause was no doubt intended to deprive Clergue of some of the defences ordinarily open to a surety in consequence of an agreement between a creditor and the primary debtor\u2014giving time to the debtor for example. I think the construction proposed by which Clergue\u2019s obligation is held to continue after the primary obligation has been wiped out must be rejected.\nIt is necessary to note very distinctly that no ques- tion is raised as to the validity and effectiveness of the so called forfeiture. The appellant is insisting upon the forfeiture and the vendee is not disputing it. The result of the appellant\u2019s contention if successful would be that Clergue would be entitled to enforce his indemnity against the assignees and in that way the assignees would be compelled to pay an unpaid instalment after the contract had been put an end to. That would be a fraud on this contract.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Upon the assignment to the Standard Mining Company of his contract to purchase from the plaintiffs the defendant became entitled to be indemnified by his assignees against liability under it. The right of indemnification carried with it a right, in the event of his being called upon to pay the plaintiffs, to a lien for the sum so paid on the Standard Mining Company\u2019s interest in the land, or to subrogation pro tanto to the rights of the plaintiff\u2019s under their vendors\u2019 lien. Vivian & Co. v. Clergue[3]. By a subsequent agreement, to which the plaintiffs, the defendant, and the Standard Mining Company were parties, the liability of the defendant to pay two instalments of purchase money due under his original agreement, and now in controversy, was expressly preserved, as were also his rights with respect thereto, and it was declared that the rights of the vendors and of the defendant should\nremain as they now are in respect of said instalments and interest.\nAmongst such rights were those incident to the position of quasi-surety to the plaintiffs, which the de- fendant held, for payment to them by the Standard Mining Company of these instalments of the purchase money.\nJudgment was recovered against him in the present action for the two instalments in question, which the Standard Mining Company had failed to pay. Before realizing on this judgment, the plaintiffs, exercising a power conferred by their agreement with the Standard Mining Company, annulled their contract for sale to that company by notice to them. Without any notice to the defendant they subsequently sold the land thus forfeited to another purchaser for $75,000\u2014$50,000 less than the sale price to the Standard Mining Company. The defendant claims that he was thereby discharged from his liability to the plaintiffs and that execution on the judgment against him, still unsatisfied, should be stayed except as to costs; and his right to that relief has been upheld in the provincial courts.\nBy extinguishing the interest of the Standard Mining Company in the land and re-selling it, the plaintiffs have put it out of their power to place the defendant in the position he was entitled to occupy upon making payment in fulfilment of his obligation as surety. Having done so they, in my opinion, disabled themselves from enforcing their judgment. Indeed, by annulling their contract with the Standard Mining Company they would seem to have extinguished the defendant\u2019s liability for any moneys not already paid, although judgment had been recovered for them. The liability of the principal debtor, the Standard Mining Company, no longer existed and with it the liablity of the surety also ceased. An unsatisfied judg- ment against the principal debtors for purchase money could not have been enforced after the vendors took back the land. Cameron v. Bradbury[4]; Gibbons v. Cozens[5]; McPherson v. U.S. Fidelity Co.[6] The surety\u2019s position must be at least equally favourable. The former judgment in this action affords no support to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention in this appeal. No question such as that now before us was, or could have been, then presented for consideration.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014By their agreement of the 10th of March, 1905, the appellants sold to the Standard Mining Company of Algoma certain property with the condition that upon default of payment of the purchase price the appellants could rescind the agreement which would then become null and void.\nThe appellants having exercised that power of rescission, the contract was put an end to and they could not afterwards claim the payment of the purchase money from the purchasers.\nThe same property had been previously sold to the respondent, but he failed to pay the instalment that became due in June, 1904, and it was agreed then between the appellants and the respondent that the property would be re-sold for the same price to the Standard Mining Company and the agreement of the 10th March, 1905, was then passed for that purpose. It was stipulated that the\nagreement and anything that may be done hereunder shall not affect or prejudice the claim of the vendors against the party of the third part (Clergue) in respect of the sum of $24,000 which fell due on the 23rd June, 1904, * * * nor shall it affect or prejudice the rights of the said party of the third part with respect thereto, but until the purchasers (Standard Mining Company) shall pay the first two instalments of $24,000, etc.\nWe have to construe the agreement and specially the clause just quoted.\nThere is no doubt that the respondent was bound to pay the sum of $24,000. He tried to dispute that liability, and this court decided against him[7]. But the appellants having thought advisable to rescind the contract because the payments were not properly made, can they still claim from the respondent the payment of those $24,000?\nThe cancellation of the contract has put an end to the right of the vendors to claim the payment of the purchase money. But they say that the obligation of Clergue did not cover any part of the purchase money. I cannot accede to such a proposition. I consider that Clergue was surety for a part of the purchase price, and as the vendors cannot, after the rescission of the contract of sale, claim any part of the purchase money from their purchasers, they could not proceed also against the surety.\nWe must not forget also that it was formally stipulated in the agreement that the whole agreement would become null and void in case the vendors would exercise their right to rescind. The nullity which is stipulated would affect all the obligations mentioned in it, not only the obligations of the purchasers, but also the obligations of Clergue. The judgment a quo which declared that the appellants could not recover from the respondent is well founded and should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.H.F.

Gillies (Defendant) Respondent.\n1915: June 15, 24.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Construction\u2014Sale of foxes\u2014Mixed breeds.\nBy contract in writing G. agreed to sell to C., who agreed to buy, two black foxes \u201cto be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton in the year 1911.\u201d\nHeld (Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting), that the proper construction of the contract was that the two foxes to be sold must have both Dalton and Oulton parentage and G. could not be compelled to deliver a pair bred from the Dalton strain only.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis action was brought by the plaintiff for damages for breach of an agreement to deliver two silver-black fox whelps of the litter of 1913, the offspring of Dalton and Oulton stock owned by the defendant. The agreement was reduced to writing, and the material parts are as follows: \u201cThe vendor (defendant) agrees to sell to the vendee (plaintiff), and the vendee agrees to purchase from the vendor (2) black foxes\u2014silver tips\u2014male and female whelps in 1913 on the ranch of the vendor in the Township of Fitzroy, County of Carleton, in Ontario, near the Town of Arnprior\u2014the said foxes to be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R Oulton in the year 1911, and to be a fair average pair selected by the vendor at or for the price or sum of $12,000, and on the terms and conditions hereinafter contained.\u201d The agreement also further provided that 10% of the purchase price was to be paid on the execution of the agreement, and the balance on or before the 10th September, 1913, delivery f.o.b. Arnprior, title and ownership to remain in the vendor until the whole of the purchase money is fully paid. Clause 4 was as follows: \u201cIn case the vendor shall be unable by reason of any unforeseen occurrence or accident to deliver the said foxes at the time hereinbefore mentioned, deposit of 10% of the purchase money shall be returned forthwith upon said occurrence or accident rendering the vendor unable to make delivery as aforesaid to the vendee, and this agreement shall ipso facto be cancelled and rendered null and void.\u201d\nAt the time of entering into this agreement the vendor had a pair of black foxes, silver tips, purchased from Charles Dalton in 1911 which he had interbred, and which had a litter of four or five pups, and also a pair purchased in the same year from W.R Oulton, which he had interbred and which had a litter at this time of six, five males and one female. The defendant says that he selected the female of the Oulton and one of the Dalton males to answer the plaintiff\u2019s contract. All the Oulton litter died, but there was a pair, male and female, of the Dalton litter which the plaintiff was willing to take in performance of the contract. The defendant refused to deliver this pair under the contract, at first placing his refusal upon the ground that the plaintiff had only a third option, and that one J.W. Jones had the first right to a pair from the litters. The contract is silent as to options. The defendant finally took the position by letter of 9th July, 913, probably after having had legal advice, a position which has been maintained ever since, that the agreement intended that the pair should be selected one from each litter, and as the Oulton litter had all died he was relieved from his contract under clause 4 thereof. The plaintiff on the other hand contended that a pair from one litter or from each litter would satisfy the contract, and that he was willing to take the Dalton pair, that the defendant had broken his contract in refusing to deliver this pair, that the intention in inserting the two strains was for the sake of protecting himself from being supplied with inferior stock, Dalton and Oulton being well-known on Prince Edward Island as pioneers in the fox industry, and had practised selective breeding to improve the type for a longer period than any other breeder, and their breeds of foxes were much sought after and had the highest value.\nThe case came on for trial before Latchford, J., without a jury at Toronto on the 26th day of June, 1914, when he gave judgment for the plaintiff for $1,750 with costs. The defendant thereupon appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (Mulock, C.J., Clute, Riddell, and Sutherland, JJ.), and judgment was given on the appeal on the 28th of October, 1914, unanimously allowing it with costs and dismissing the action with costs.\nFrom the judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. D.C. Ross for the appellant.\nW.M. Douglas K.C., and J.E. Thompson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014This action is brought by the plaintiff appellant for damages for breach of an agreement to deliver two silver black whelps of the litter of 1913, the offspring of Dalton and Oulton stock owned by the defendant. The agreement was reduced to writing and the material parts are as follows:\u2014\nThe vendor (defendant) agrees to sell to the vendee (plaintiff) and the vendee agrees to purchase from the vendor (2) black foxes\u2014silver tips\u2014male and female whelped in 1913 on the ranch of the vendor in the Township of Fitzroy, County of Carleton, Province aforesaid, near the Town of Arnprior\u2014the said foxes to be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton in the year 1911, and to be a fair average pair selected by the vendor at or for the price or sum of $12,000, and on the terms and conditions hereinafter contained.\nClause 4 is as follows:\u2014\nIn case the vendor shall be unable to deliver the said foxes at the time hereinbefore mentioned, deposit of 10% of the purchase money shall be returned forthwith upon said occurrence or accident rendering the vendor unable to make delivery as aforesaid to the vendee, and this agreement shall ipso facto be cancelled and rendered null and void.\nAt the time of entering into this agreement the vendor had a pair of black foxes, silver tips, purchased from Charles Dalton in 1911, which he had interbred and which had a litter of four or five pups, and also a pair purchased in the same year from W.R. Oulton, which he had interbred and which had a litter at this time of six, five males and one female. The defendant says that he selected the female of the Oulton and one of the Dalton males to answer the plaintiff\u2019s contract. Unfortunately all the Oulton litter died, but there was a pair, male and female, of the Dalton litter which the plaintiff was willing to take in performance of the contract.\nThe defendant refused to deliver this pair under the contract, at first placing his refusal upon the ground that the plaintiff had only a third option, and that one J.W. Jones had the first right to a pair from the litters. This was clearly an untenable ground, as the contract is silent as to options. The defendant finally took the position by letter of 9th July, 1913, that the agreement intended that the pair should be selected one from each litter, and as the Oulton litter had all died he was relieved from his contract under clause 4 thereof.\nThe plaintiff on the other hand contended that a pair from one litter as well as one from each litter would satisfy the contract, and that he was willing to take the Dalton pair, that the defendant had broken his contract in refusing to deliver this pair, that the intention in inserting the two strains was for the sake of protecting himself from being supplied with inferior stock, Dalton and Oulton being well known on Prince Edward Island as pioneers in the fox industry, and as breeders who had practised selective breeding to improve the type for a longer period than most of the other breeders, and whose breeds of foxes were much sought after and had the highest value.\nThe case came on for trial before Latchford J., without a jury, at Toronto, on the 26th day of June, 1914, when he gave judgment for the plaintiff for $1,750 with costs. On appeal this judgment was reversed by the second Appellate Division of Ontario and the action dismissed on the ground that the contract meant delivery of a pair of foxes\nwhich were the offspring of the two pairs purchased from Dalton and Oulton, that is one from each pair, and that to otherwise interpret the language of the contract \u201cor\u201d must be substituted for the word \u201cand.\u201d\nI cannot agree with this conclusion or reasoning. I agree that the language used is not as clear as might be wished, but I do not think the substitution of the word \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand\u201d would remove any ambiguity which may at present exist. The pups were to be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton. Now if \u201cor\u201d was inserted instead of \u201cand\u201d it would be argued that these foxes must be from either one or other of the Dalton or Oulton purchases and not from each of them as is now contended.\nI do not doubt what the real intention of the parties was. I think, though it might have been made clearer, it is tolerably clear as the contract reads. The dialectician and the lawyer may dispute over the meaning, but the men in the business of fox raising, or the businessman on the street would, I think, have no doubt whatever what the intention was. As the trial judge says:\u2014\nAny pair of cubs\u2014a male and a female\u2014from either one or both of the litters would have satisfied the language of the agreement.\nI think the conduct of the parties afterwards shews what the true meaning of the ambiguous language was understood by the parties to be. The contract does not say that the pair is to be selected by the vendor from each strain, Daltons and Oultons. The position taken at first by the defendant respondent in his correspondence was not that the plaintiff\u2019s contract had become null and void because the Oulton litter had all died, but that the purchaser was not entitled to the surviving pair of Dalton pups or cubs because he had only a third option, Professor Jones having a prior one, and the female selected for the plaintiff had died.\nIt was only after this defence had failed that he set up this other construction of the agreement now relied on. Such later construction never seemed to have entered his mind when he first was called on to carry out his contract.\nMy view is that the contract could have been satisfied in any one of three ways: (1) A pair from the cross-breeding of the strains, Dalton and Oulton; this, however, was impossible because they were interbred; (2) a pair selected from either litter; (3) a pair selected one from each litter.\nIf conditions existed which enabled the vendor to offer the purchaser a pair from either one litter or the other, I venture to say neither one of the parties would have dreamt that in doing so he was not fulfilling his contract.\nNothing could better exemplify what I venture to call the somewhat narrow construction placed on the contract than the paragraph in Mr. Justice Riddell\u2019s judgment where he says:\u2014\nI think that the contract contemplated the deliver of young foxes the offspring in 1913 of all the four certain foxes bought in 1911 from the persons named, and not simply of some of these four foxes, and that the delivery of two pups which did not have between them the blood of all these four foxes would not be enough.\nI think it would be difficult to prove the possibility of the offspring of the two pairs having between them the blood of all these four foxes unless by a crossbreeding of the strains which was not done. They had been interbred and their offsprings were alive and did not have between them the blood of all these four certain foxes, as their owner well knew, which is conclusive, if Mr. Justice Riddell is right, that the parties did not intend what is now said to be the meaning of the language used.\nThis language will be interpreted in the light of the facts which existed and were equally well known to both parties when the contract was entered into and if they used language somewhat ambiguous, the subsequent conduct of the parties can be used as explanatory of the real meaning of the ambiguous words.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The determining question raised herein must turn upon and be answered by the construction given that which forms the material part of a contract between the parties hereto and is as follows:\u2014\nWitnesseth that the vendor agrees to sell to the vendee and the vendee agrees to purchase from the vendor two (2) black foxes\u2014silver tips\u2014male and female, whelped in 1913 on the ranch of the vendor in the Township of Fitzroy in the County of Carleton and Province aforesaid, near the said Town of Arnprior, the said young foxes to be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton in the year 1911, and to be a fair average pair, selected by the vendor at or for the price or sum of twelve thousand dollars, and on the terms and conditions hereinafter contained, that is to say:\u2014\nIt appears to me that having regard to what the parties were concerned about in framing the contract and the plain ordinary meaning of the language used that the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton,\ndid not exist when the time came for fulfilment of the contract. It is not denied that the offspring of the Oulton litter died. It is neither alleged nor proven that the offspring of the Dalton litter could be described truthfully as in any way issue of the Oulton purchase specified.\nThe contract provided for the event of the deaths which took place and thereby relieved the vendor.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario has correctly construed the contract and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal raises the question of the construction of the agreement upon which the action is brought. It is set out in the third paragraph of the statement of claim.\n3. The said agreement is in the words and figures following:\u2014\nThis agreement made (in duplicate) the fifteenth day of May, A.D. 1913.\nBetween: James R. Gillies, of the Town of Arnprior, in the County of Renfrew, and Province of Ontario, gentleman (hereinafter called the vendor), of the first part,\n\u2014and\u2014\nE.S. Coffin, of the City of Charlottetown, in the County of Queen\u2019s, and Province of Prince Edward Island, grocer (hereinafter called the vendee), of the second part.\nWitnesseth that the vendor agrees to sell to the vendee and the vendee agrees to purchase from the vendor two (2) black foxes\u2014silver tips\u2014male and female, whelped in 1913 on the ranch of the vendor in the Township of Fitzroy in the County of Carleton, and Province aforesaid, near the said Town of Arnprior, the said young foxes to be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton in the year 1911, and to be a fair average pair, selected, by the vendor at or for the price or sum of twelve thousand dollars, and on the terms and conditions hereinafter contained, that is to say:\u2014 1. The vendee shall pay to the vendor for the said foxes the sum of twelve thousand dollars, payable as follows, namely: ten per cent. of the said purchase price, net at Arnprior aforesaid, upon the execution of these presents, and the remainder of the said purchase price, net at Arnprior aforesaid, on or before the tenth day of September next, 1913.\n2. The vendor shall ship to the vendee and the vendee shall accept shipment of the said foxes not later than the tenth day of September next, 1913\u2014f.o.b. Arnprior.\n3. The title to and the ownership in the said foxes shall remain in the vendor until the whole of the said purchase price is fully paid as aforesaid.\n4. In case the vendor shall be unable, by reason of any unforeseen occurrence or accident, to deliver the said foxes by the time hereinbefore mentioned, the said deposit of ten per cent. of the said purchase money shall be returned forthwith upon such occurrence or accident rendering the vendor unable to make delivery as aforesaid, to the vendee, and this agreement shall ipso facto be cancelled and rendered null and void.\n5. In case the vendee shall make default in payment of the said purchase price as aforesaid, the vendor shall be entitled to retain the said deposit of ten per cent. of said purchase money, as liquidated damages and not by way of penalty, and shall be accepted by the vendor in full of all claims for or on account of such default on the part of the vendee.\nIn witness whereof the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and seals.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\n(Sgd.) R.J. GILLIES.\n(Sgd.) B.J. GILLIES.\nWitness to signature of E.S Coffin,\n(Sgd.) E.S. COFFIN.\n(Sgd.) RITA MCKINNON.\nAt the time this agreement was entered into the fact was known to the purchaser as well as to the vendor that the vendor had two foxes purchased from Charles Dalton and two foxes purchased from W.R. Oulton and it is admitted that these are the foxes referred to as certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton in the year 1911. In fact at the time the agreement was signed the two Dalton foxes had been mated and the other foxes had been mated, or rather the female of the Dalton pair was in pup by the Dalton male and the female of the other was in pup by the other male, and it is not disputed that the agreement contemplated selection and delivery of foxes from foxes comprised in these litters. Further the facts are stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Latchford:\u2014\nCOFFIN V. GILLIES.\nJune 26th, 1914.\nLATCHFORD J.:\u2014Apart from the question of damages no issue of fact arises in this case.\nOn the 15th May, 1913, by an agreement in writing, the plaintiff agreed to purchase and the defendant to sell \u201ctwo black foxes\u2014silver tips\u2014male and female, whelped in 1913, on the ranch of the vendor near the Town of Arnprior\u2014the said young foxes to be the offspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and W.R. Oulton in the year 1911, and to be a fair average pair selected by the vendor at or for the price or sum of $12,000.\u201d\nTen per cent. of the purchase money, or $1,200, was payable, and was paid, upon the execution of the agreement. Delivery was to be at Arnprior not later than the 10th September, 1913.\nThe agreement provided that, should the vendor be unable, \u201cby reason of any unforeseen occurrence or accident,\u201d to deliver the foxes, the deposit should be returned, and the agreement should thereupon be null and void.\nIt was known to the plaintiff that the defendant had at his fox ranch in this province at least four Prince Edward Island black foxes\u2014one pair of Dalton ancestry and one pair of Oulton ancestry. The plaintiff does not appear to have known what other foxes the defendant had, as in his letter of the 7th May, written after the purchase had been made, though before it was embodied in the formal agreement, the plaintiff asks the defendant to \u201cstate breeding of parents and from whom purchased and when.\u201d\nEach pair produced cubs in the summer of 1913. All the Oulton litter died. Several, if not all, of the Dalton litter survived. The plaintiff was willing to accept a pair of the Dalton foxes, but the defendant refused to supply them, contending, as he now contends in this action, that, upon the true interpretation of the agreement, one of the foxes to be delivered was to be of the Dalton strain, and the other of the Oulton strain, and that as, by an \u201cunforeseen occurrence or accident\u201d\u2014the loss of the Oulton litter\u2014he was unable to deliver an Oulton cub, the contract with the plaintiff, upon the return (which was made) of the $1,200, was at an end. The defendant\u2019s original contention, made as early as the 24th May, or within ten days of the date of the agreement, was, that the plaintiff had but the \u201cthird option\u201d on the litters of 1913\u2014\u201cthe Dalton, also the Oulton\u201d stock\u2014and that, as the female of the pair the plaintiff was to receive\u2014inferentially the third pair\u2014had died, the agreement could not be carried out. That the inference mentioned is correct is shewn by a letter in evidence written by the defendant a few days later, on the 28th May, to J. Walter Jones, of Charlotte-town, offering to supply a pair, a male and a female, from the Dalton little of six puppies. It seems clear that, as the Oulton litter had perished, the defendant at first intended to supply the plaintiff with a pair of cubs from the Dalton litter. This litter must, on the defendant\u2019s statement, have contained at least two females\u2014the one mentioned as having died, and the one the defendant was willing to sell to Mr. Jones.\nJones was\u2014unknown to the defendant\u2014interested in the purchase which the plaintiff had made, and informed the plaintiff of the offer of the Dalton pair made to him by the defendant. The plaintiff then claimed to be entitled under the agreement to a pair of the Dalton litter; and the defendant, after assuming a manifestly untenable position as to the order in which the agreement was to be fulfilled\u2014after two other pairs had been set apart\u2014ultimately, on the 9th July, in a letter to the plaintiff, set up the construction on which he now relies.\nThere are several conceivable constructions of the agreement treating it as a matter of verbal analysis simply. First, that \u201cthe said young foxes\u201d means each of \u201cthe said young foxes\u201d and that each of these foxes is to be the \u201coffspring\u201d of all of the four foxes purchased as mentioned. Admittedly this construction is inadmissible because both parties knew that on such a construction the agreement would be impossible to perform.\nSecondly, that the description, \u201coffspring of certain foxes purchased, etc.,\u201d applies to the two foxes sold as a group only; and that the group is to have the character of being the offspring of all the foxes \u201cpurchased, etc.\u201d The only way in which a description could take effect as applied to a group as such (in the circumstances in which the parties were con- tracting) was that the two foxes together should combine the strains of all four.\nThirdly, that the description \u201cthe offspring, etc.,\u201d is applicable to each of the foxes sold but that the words of the description are to be read as \u201coffspring of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from Charles Dalton and of certain foxes purchased by the vendor from W.R. Oulton\u201d; so that each is to satisfy the condition of combining the character of being Dalton offspring with the character of being Oulton offspring.\nFourthly, that the description \u201cthe offspring, etc.,\u201d applies to each of the said foxes and that the description is satisfied if each one of them belongs to the category described by \u201coffspring of certain foxes, etc.,\u201d and that this category is simply a class which is made up of all the foxes which are the offspring of the four foxes mentioned mated in the way in which they had been mated, whatever that might be at the time the agreement was entered into.\nIt is admitted that the third of these alternative constructions must be rejected for the simple reason that it was known to both parties that there had been no cross-mating. I think that on the facts found by Latchford J., which were not impugned before us, the second construction must he rejected. It is clear enough from the findings of the learned judge that the respondent was quite ready to insist on the fourth construction as the proper construction if he had been in the position to carry out the agreement under that construction. Had it not been for the conduct of the respondent, I am not sure that I should have been able to arrive at the conclusion which of these was the better construction. It may, however, be said that both parties admit that the fourth construction imposes the minimum of what it was intended that the appellant should be entitled to. If the appellant had been suing resting upon the third construction I think it would have been a complete answer to say, you have not stipulated for that, you have used language which is consistent with the intention to create the less exacting obligation and, therefore, you must fail in your contention unless you can shew some surrounding circumstances controlling the construction of the language. It seems to me perfectly clear that it could not be contended that there is any such absurdity in the fourth construction as to lead us to reject it. It is not shewn that the price paid was any higher than the price that should have been paid for a pair of Daltons.\nIf the purchaser intended to mate them with the other stock a pair of Daltons might for all the evidence shews to the contrary have been quite satisfactory; and it appears that two from the Dalton strain were in fact allotted to and accepted by a purchaser. There is nothing in the appellant\u2019s letters or conduct inconsistent with this construction.\nIt is possible, of course, for a contract to be so uncertain in its terms as to be incapable of enforcement; as to he indeed no contract; Ryan v. Thomas[1] is an example. But the parties undoubtedly intended to enter into an enforceable contract and I think that on the facts found by Latchford J. the right construction is that indicated above. Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson[2].\nI may add that the discussion touching the reading of \u201cand\u201d as \u201cor\u201d of which we had a good deal on the argument, seems to miss the mark.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The description of the pair of foxes sold in my opinion could be satisfied either by two foxes each having one parent of the Dalton strain and the other of the Oulton strain, or by two foxes one having parents both of the Dalton strain and the other parents both of the Oulton strain. But it could not be satisfied by the delivery of two Dalton foxes without any Oulton blood in either. Counsel for the plaintiff stated on his behalf at the opening of the trial that cross-breeding of the defendant\u2019s foxes of the Dalton strain with his foxes of the Oulton strain had not been contemplated by the parties. No doubt it was because this admission was made that evidence was not given to shew that the defendant\u2019s pair of Dalton foxes had already been bred together and that his pair of Oulton foxes had likewise been so bred, as the facts were, and that these facts were known to the purchaser. At all events, it would seem to follow from the admission made by counsel that the construction put upon the contract by the Appellate Division was the only one of which it was, under the circumstances, susceptible.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: DuVernet, Raymond, Ross & Ardagh.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Douglas & Clipsham.\n[1] 55 Sol.

W.R. 416) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought to set aside a bill of sale executed in favour of the defendant by her brother, at a time when the latter was financially embarrassed, and to have the bill of sale declared void as a preferential assignment in fraud of the rights of the other creditors of the assignor.\nThe circumstances of the case which are material to the issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. E. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. F. Orde K.C. for the respondent.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. He thought the circumstances under which the bill of sale was executed suspicious and declined to accept the uncorroborated testimony of the plaintiff's brother, who made the assignment to his sister now being impeached.\nThe Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal seems to have thought that although the trial judge did not accept the evidence of the defendant, Smith, still the burden of proof lay upon the plaintiff and that he had not discharged it.\nThe learned trial judge on the contrary found that the circumstances were so suspicious, connected with and surrounding the impeached bill of sale, as to throw the burden of proof of its bona fides upon the grantee, the plaintiff's sister. I agree with his findings in that regard. I think the rule laid down by the courts of Ontario with regard to assignments made between near relations and impeached by the creditors of the assignor as fraudulent is a salutory one, namely, that where it is accessible some corroborative evidence of the bona fides of the transaction should be given. No attempt was made by the defendant to act upon that rule in this case. Smith's evidence was not accepted and the trial judge pointed out many alleged facts which were accessible and could have been proved, if true, as corroborative evidence but were not. Under all the circumstances I think the learned trial judge was right and that the appeal should be allowed with costs and his judgment restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal presents a rather unsatisfactory case. The Court of Appeal in reversing the trial judgment proceeds upon the ground that the bill of sale attacked was not shewn to be void as against creditors on the ground of being preferential to the knowledge of the appellant. In that I quite agree if regard is had to the authorities relied upon by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nBut the learned trial judge seems to have discredited the judgment debtor who had made the assignment and was the only witness called to support it.\nI cannot say as matter of law that he erred in so finding. These cases of alleged fraudulent assignment must generally depend largely upon the view of the facts taken by the trial judge. It is quite competent for him, if impressed with the veracity of the assignor, to accept and act upon his unsupported statement. The transaction and established surrounding circumstances might be such as to justify his doing so. Or, on the other hand, they might be such as to render his doing so questionable.\nIn this case he has found the surrounding circumstances and the statements such as to call for corroboration, and that view is not attempted to be disputed and hence has not yet been reversed. The reversal of the judgment of the learned trial judge proceeding upon the question of a preferential assignment does not touch the want of bona fides in the transaction upon which he proceeded.\nThe pleadings, I suspect are partly responsible for this curious result. The pleader improperly blends, in almost every sentence that is essential to his pleadings, the two distinct grounds of complaint. Casually looked at one might say it was intended only to attack the transaction on the ground of the assignment being preferential.\nThe case I imagine must have been argued upon that assumption. There does not appear in the case any notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal or reasons for or against same to enlighten us as to how all this happened.\nThe appeal must be allowed.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, who tried the action, restored. The majority of the Court of Appeal appear, if I may say so with respect, to have fallen into the error of treating the relationship of the parties to the impeached transaction as possessing no very material significance. The learned trial judge, on the other hand, treated the relationship as decisive in this sense that it determined the point of view from which the evidence was to be considered and the all important question of the onus of proof. The learned trial judge indeed appears to have laid it down as a proposition of law that a transaction of this kind between two near relatives, carried out in circumstances in themselves sufficient to excite suspicion, can only be supported (in an action brought to impeach it by creditors) if the reality or the bona fides of it are established by evidence other than the testimony of the interested parties; and there is a series of authorities in the Ontario courts which has been supposed to decide that, and it may be that it is the settled law of Ontario to-day. I do not think the proposition put thus absolutely is part of the English law or of the law of British Columbia; but I think it is a maxim of prudence based upon experience that in such cases a tribunal of fact may properly act upon that when suspicion touching the reality or the bona fides of a transaction between near relatives arises from the circumstances in which the transaction took place then the fact of relationship itself is sufficient to put the burden of explanation upon the parties interested and that, in such a case, the testimony of the parties must be scrutinized with care and suspicion; and it is very seldom that such evidence can safely be acted upon as in itself sufficient. In other words, I think the weight of the fact of relationship and the question of necessity of corroboration are primarily questions for the discretion of the trial judge subject, of course, to review; and that any trial judge will in such cases have regard to the course of common experience as indicated by the pronouncements and practice of very able and experienced judges such as Chief Justice Armour and Vice-Chancellor Mowat and will depart from the practice only in very exceptional circumstances.\nI may add that I think it doubtful whether the Ontario decisions when properly read really do lay it down as a rule of law that the fact of relationship is sufficient in itself to shift the burden of establishing the burden of proof in the strict sense. It may be that the proper construction of these cases is that the burden of giving evidence and not the burden of the issue is shifted. (As to this distinction see the admirable chapter IX., in Professor Thayer's \"Law of Evidence.\") In my own view, as indicated above, even this would be putting the matter just a little too high; I think the true rule is that suspicious circumstances coupled with relationship make a case of res ipsa loquitur which the tribunal of fact may and will generally treat as a sufficient prim\u00e2 facie case, but that it is not strictly in law bound to do so; and that the question of the necessity of corroboration is strictly a question of fact. Having examined the evidence carefully I am satisfied that the learned trial judge was entitled to take the course he did take and not only that the evidence, as I read it in the record, casts the burden of explanation upon the respondent, but that the testimony given by her brother ought not in the circumstances to be accepted as establishing either the actual existence of the debt or of the bona fides of the transaction.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having regard to the circumstances of the impeached transaction, as deposed to by the transferror, who is the defendant's brother, and was her only witness \u2014 the relationship between the parties to it, the making of the transfer while the entry of judgment on the plaintiff's claim was deferred to enable the brother to make an arrangement to meet it, the nature of the property transferred, and the brother's admission that a power of attorney to the defendant would have served his alleged purpose of realizing on the property \u2014 the burden rested on the defendant of establishing the rectitude of her bill of sale. Whether this transaction was bon\u00e2 fide was eminently a question for the trial judge, and he has found that,\nthe outstanding fact is that this story of this transfer is not supported in any particular.\nIt was, I think, clearly his view that no real debt from her brother to the defendant had been shewn to exist \u2014 that the purpose of the transfer was to protect the property covered by the bill of sale against his creditors, and that that purpose was sufficiently known to the defendant to involve her participation in it. After carefully considering the reasons given by the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal and the argument presented on behalf of the respondent, I am, with respect, unable to find any ground on which the reversal of the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia can be supported. The only evidence of the existence of a legal debt owing to the defendant by her brother was the testimony of the latter, which the learned Chief Justice declined to accept. It is difficult to conceive what was his motive for transferring to his sister his only exigible property, if it were not to stave off the plaintiff and his other creditors. Her knowledge of his financial embarrassment would seem to be a fair inference from all the circumstances. Although loath to reverse a considered judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia on a question of fact, I think this is a case in which the opinion of an able and experienced trial judge, in whose conclusions two members of the appellate court have agreed, must prevail.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this court and the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the Chief Justice of British Columbia.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The plaintiff's action was for a declaration that the sale of the horses made by T. J. Smith to his sister the defendant respondent, was null and void under the provisions of the \"Fraudulent Preference and the Fraudulent Conveyances Acts\" of British Columbia (R.S.B.C., ch. 93, secs. 2 and 4, and ch. 94, sec. 3). The trial judge maintained the action on the ground that the conveyance was fraudulent The Court of Appeal, by a judgment of three to two, reversed the finding of the trial judge.\nThe debtor, T. J. Smith, was very largely indebted and had given a confession of judgment in favour of the plaintiff, Koop, on the 13th of February, 1912, for the sum of $63,000 and, on the 15th day of May following he sold the larger part of his assets to his sister.\nHe claimed, when under oath at the trial, that the consideration of that sale was the salary he owed to his sister. He said that she had been living with him for eight years and that he had always paid her a salary of $1,500 a year.\nThat evidence was not corroborated and was not accepted by the trial judge.\nIt would have been very easy for Smith to shew by his books or by his cheques that the alleged salary had been paid; but he did not do so. The sister could have given evidence to corroborate her brother; but she would not do so, claiming she was too nervous to appear in public. It is in evidence, however, that she had been able to attend horse shows and to ride horses.\nThe decision of the trial judge in these circumstances should not have been disturbed. I am of opinion that his judgment should be restored and that the appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Burns & Walkem.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Russell, Macdonald & Hancox.\n[1] 7 West.

In the Town of Chicoutimi, no such bylaw having been enacted, the mayor gave orders for the demolition of a building for the purpose of arresting the progress of a general conflagration and, in carrying out his directions, an adjacent building was destroyed which was insured by respondents for $4,700. The municipality settled with the owner by paying her $5,500, as full indemnity for all damages sustained, and obtained a transfer of her rights under her policy of insurance. In an action on the policy so transferred:\u2014\nHeld (Duff J. dissenting), that, as the destruction of the building insured was occasioned by an act justified by statutory authority and full indemnity had been paid, the municipality was entitled to subrogation in the rights of the owner and to maintain the action against the insurance company for reimbursement to the extent of the amount of the insurance upon the property.\nPer Duff J. dissenting.\u2014Although the destruction of the building insured was occasioned by an act justified at common law, the rights of the municipal corporation were determined by the principle laid down in Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney (Q.R. 10 K.B. 378), and the claim for reimbursement to the extent of the amount for which the property was insured should not be maintained. Quebec Fire Insurance Co. v. St. Louis (7 Moo. P.O. 286) applied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of Letellier J., in the Superior Court, District of Chicoutimi, by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note and the issues raised on the present appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nAtwater K.C. for the appellants.\nBelcourt K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I will state briefly the facts which I think are relevant and which are very simple. On the 24th June, 1912, a fire broke out on the Town of Chicoutimi which attained the portions of a general conflagration. In order to check the progress of this fire the mayor of the town ordered a house adjoining that of Mme. Claveau to be blown up by dynamite. The explosion involved the accidental demolition of Mme. Claveau\u2019s house as well.\nThe action of the mayor was authorized toy article 4426 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, which is as follows:\u2014\nTo authorize certain persons to cause to be blown up, pulled down or demolished such buildings as may appear necessary in order to arrest the progress of any fire, saving all damages and indemnity payable by the corporation to the proprietors of such buildings, to an amount agreed upon between the parties, or, on contestation, to an amount settled by arbitrators.\nIn the absence of any by-law under this article, the mayor may, during the course of any fire, exercise this power by giving a special authorization. Mme. Claveau was insured in the appellant\u2019s office and the town having paid her the full amount of the damages which she sustained by the demolition of her house now seeks to recover from the appellant the amount of the insurance moneys.\nMme. Claveau would have had a right to collect these insurance moneys from the appellant and to recover from the town any further sum necessary to indemnify her for the destruction of her property. The town having paid the whole damage sustained by her is, I think, entitled to pursue the appellant for the value of the policies of the insurance.\nIn the case of Simpson v. Thomson[1], the Lord Chancellor in the course of his judgment referred to the\nwell known principle of law, that where one person has agreed to indemnify another, he will, on making good the indemnity, be entitled to succeed to all the ways and means by which the person indemnified might have protected himself against or reimbursed himself for the loss.\nI can see no difference in the present case except that the indemnity is provided by the statute instead of by agreement between the parties, and that does not appear to affect the principle.\nIn ordinary circumstances where A. has without any fault of his own damaged the property of B., A. is under no liability to indemnify B. for his loss. It is otherwise if A. was a wrongdoer, in which case he is liable to B. for the whole of the damage, and if B. recover any part of the loss from insurers, these latter are entitled to recover, in the name of B., the amount of their payment.\nA statute may authorize the doing of an act which without such authorization would he unlawful. In the present case the act of the council in blowing up a building to prevent the conflagration spreading might have been unlawful, but the statute legalized its action.\nA statute may, however, as in the present case, impose upon an innocent party a liability to indemnify for damage caused by him.\nAnother instance of this may be found in the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, sec. 298, as amended by 9 & 10 Edw. VII., ch. 50, sec. 10. By this section it is provided that:\u2014\nWhenever damage is caused to any property by a fire started by any railway locomotive the company making use of such locomotive whether guilty of negligence or not shall be liable for such damage.\nProvided also that if there is any insurance existing on the property destroyed or damaged the total amount of the damages sustained by any claimant in respect of the destruction or damage of such property shall for the purposes of this sub-section be reduced by the amount accepted or recovered by or for the benefit of such claimant in respect of such insurance. No action shall lie against the company by reason of anything in any policy of insurance or by reason of payment of any moneys thereunder.\nThe legislature might have provided any indemnity it thought fit either, as in the case of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d expressly limiting it to the net loss after deduction of any insurance moneys or making it the total loss and so relieving the insurance company of its liability. In the absence of any express provision in article 4426 the question to be determined is the extent of the liability under the indemnity it provides. Is the indemnity to be interpreted by the principle which would apply in the case of a wrongdoer as being the total amount of the loss or only the net loss sustained by the owner after deducting from the total loss the amount for which the property was insured? The respondent had not only a right, but a duty to destroy the property and unless the statute had provided for indemnity there would have been none. There is no reason to suppose that the statute meant to relieve insurance companies of their contractual liabilities, I think it merely intended to secure a complete indemnity to property owners for whatever loss they might suffer.\nThe case is different from the liability of a wrongdoer. In Yates v. Whyte[2], in which the plaintiff was suing the defendants for damaging his ship by collision and the defendants sought to deduct from the amount of damages to be paid by them a sum of money paid to the plaintiff by his insurers in respect of such damage, Chief Justice Tindal said:\u2014\nIf the plaintiff cannot recover the wrongdoer pays nothing and takes all the benefit of a policy of insurance without paying the premium.\nIn construing the indemnity provided by article 4426 to be given by an innocent party I do not think the principle governing the liability of a wrongdoer is to be looked to. On the contrary, I think the indemnity should be confined to the narrowest limits which the words of the statute will permit. I think it should be taken to cover the actual loss sustained after deducting therefrom any insurance moneys paid in respect thereof; it should not be held to relieve an insurer of liability in respect of which he has been paid a premium.\nWhatever may be the rights of the insurer, under the English law, to subrogation upon payment to the insured of the amount covered by the policy, in my opinion the insurance company is not entitled in the Province of Quebec, after subrogation, to recover from a third party who may be liable to the insured, where there has been no fault on the part of the third party. The only right of subrogation is contained in article 2584, C.C., which says:\u2014\nThe insurer on paying the loss is entitled to a transfer of the rights of the insured against the person by whose fault the fire or loss was caused.\nIn the present case the acts of the corporation were authorized by statute. There was, therefore, no fault and the insurance company, if they had paid the insured, could not have recovered back the amount so paid, from the corporation.\nThe whole subject is fully and very learnedly discussed in La Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil, vol. 5, 1906, at page 37. See also Planiol, Droit Civil, vol. 2, Nos. 2142 and 2143 and Dabb\u00e9\u2019s note to S.V. 80.1. 441.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant had insured one Madame Claveau in respect of a house, in the town of respondent, against loss by fire.\nIn a disastrous fire the mayor of respondent directed the use of some explosive to be applied to an adjacent house in order to arrest the progress of the fire. In so using the explosive not only was the house to which it was applied blown up, but that of Madame Claveau was also destroyed. The operation was successful in arresting the fire. The respondent town was threatened by Madame Claveau with a claim for damages and settled with her for an amount in excess of the amount of her insurance, upon the condition that she should assign to the respondent her claim under the policy of insurance issued to her, to indemnify her against loss, and she accordingly assigned to it, contemporaneously with and as part of the settlement, her claim (if any) against the appellant upon the policy in question. The respondent then sued appellant thereon. The learned trial judge allowed the claim and this the court of appeal has maintained. The appellant contends it is not liable because it alleges the respondent was primarily liable therefore.\nOf course, if this can be maintained as a legal proposition the appellant should succeed. It is just there in my view that the case turns. For if the insurer can shew that the respondent was a wrongdoer and in law liable for the loss, then it could pay the insured and have recourse over against the respondent as a wrongdoer.\nThere may be, under other circumstances not present to my mind just now, possible cases where such right over or of subrogation might exist. But in this regard the appellant seemed to me in argument singularly weak.\nI could not on the argument elicit from able counsel for the appellant any authority substantiating such a proposition as resting upon the facts herein would have entitled his client to an assignment of Madame Claveau\u2019s rights or otherwise in any way of subrogation as against the respondent.\nMuch reliance was placed upon the positions taken by respondent in the court below and in its dealings with the insured in way of acknowledgment of liability to her which seem to me entirely irrelevant.\nIt is not what respondent or its advisors imagined the law to have been, and her legal rights resting thereon to have been, that should have any weight with us.\nWe must decide upon what we conceive to have been the actual legal rights of the parties and discard all such other imaginary legal positions as irrelevant.\nIf respondent was a wrongdoer, and in law liable therefor, the appellant is entitled to so answer any claim it (the respondent) may have imagined it either had or could acquire as against the appellant.\nIn that case, repeating what I have already said, the appellant in virtue of its right of recourse over could not be held liable herein.\nThe respondent, however, was not a wrongdoer, by reason of what was done, because the mayor, who ordered that to be done which was done, had the legal warrant embodied in the last part of the section 4426 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec of 1888, which is as follows:\u2014\nIn the absence of any by-law under this article, the mayor may, during the course of any fire, exercise this power by giving a special authorization.\nTo my mind it is exceedingly doubtful if, armed with such authority, he or those he represented, could be held liable for anything. That authority when acted upon might produce great hardship, but I fail to see how a man so acting could be said to have committed any legal wrong.\nOf course, there is an argument for the construction of the section just quoted which might imply a right of indemnity, as in the case of a by-law authorizing such action as provided for in the section.\nAssuming that argument good and liability resting upon the statute, what should be the measure of damages? It does not appear to me that a person fully insured against loss could claim to have been damnified thereby. Her damages should be measured by the actual loss she sustained. And the insurance which she was entitled to have received must in such case have gone in reduction of the aggregate amount of such damages, and the assessment be made accordingly.\nThe course of events has been such that, instead of her suing therefor, she has compounded with the respondent upon the terms which entitled her to receive what she suffered, but upon the condition of subrogating conventionally respondent to her rights as against appellant. She might have accepted from respondent the part of the sum total in excess of the insurance and have sued the company. In that view I can see no reason for appellant\u2019s complaining.\nThe appellant primarily was liable and possibly has secured by what respondent\u2019s mayor did, great benefits beyond what appear herein.\nOf this latter suggestion we have no evidence and it weighs naught with me save as an illustration of the legal position in which appellant stands.\nThe cases cited do not help. The principles upon which they proceed are either against appellant or irrelevant to the peculiar facts of this case.\nThe Mahoney Case[3] may be perfectly good law. I express no opinion thereon, but it does not touch what is involved herein.\nThe leading cases upon subrogation in relation to the rights of an insurer are lucidly explained in Bunyon on Insurance. I can find nothing in that or the cases so referred to justifying this appeal. Take the case of Castellain v. Preston[4], at page 388, where the exposition of the law by Brett L.J. is as follows:\u2014\nNow it seems to me that in order to carry out the fundamental rule of insurance law, this doctrine of subrogation must be carried to the extent which I am now about to endeavour to express, namely, that as between the underwriter and the assured the underwriter is entitled to the advantage of every right of the assured, whether such right consists in contract, fulfilled or unfulfilled, or in remedy for tort capable of being insisted on or already insisted on, or in any other right, whether by way of condition or otherwise, legal or equitable, which can be, or has been exercised or accrued, and whether such right could or could not be enforced by the insurer in the name of the assured by the exercise or acquiring of which right or condition the loss against which the assured is insured, can be or has been diminished.\nThis covers the whole of the subject matters out of which the right of subrogation can arise to the insurer. There is nothing of a contractual nature in question therein.\nAnd, as already shewn, there is nothing in the way of tort which in any way can found a right in the insured to be acquired by the insurer. Any right the insured had must rest in the right to be indemnified. She got that only to the extent of her actual loss, less what she had covered by the appellant\u2019s insurance which she chose to assign rather than follow.\nIn doing so she gave nothing appellant was entitled to claim.\nI have given most careful consideration to the several articles of the Civil Code dealing with the subject of subrogation in general and to the subject of insurance in particular, to which we were referred in argument. I cannot find therein anything essentially different from the principles expounded in said authorities as I read them.\nArticle 2584, C.C., seems that most directly applicable to this case. It is as follows:\u2014\n2584. The insurer on paying the loss is entitled to a transfer of the rights of the insured against the persons by whose fault the fire or loss was caused.\nI do not think this case falls within that. Indeed, it seems possibly narrower than the rule of Brett L.J. above quoted. If there is any difference in their effect, preference should be given to the article.\nIt is exceedingly desirable there should be no difference in the laws governing such a subject.\nIf there had been legal negligence shewn in the doing that which was done, the result might have given rise to the application of the doctrine in that case, or legal principles outside that case.\nI can find no negligence, and, indeed, though suggested, that ground was not much relied upon or pressed as it appeared to me.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent municipality does not dispute that it became, by reason of the act of its officials in causing the destruction of the house of Madame Claveau, bound to make reparation to her for the loss thereby suffered by her. The payment to Madame Claveau was made on that footing. That is the position taken by the respondent in its pleadings, in its factum filed in this court, and by counsel in the argument. This responsibility, according to the position taken by the respondent, rests upon the principle of law upon which the Court of King\u2019s Bench proceeded in Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney[5]. The Court of King\u2019s Bench in this case has refused to apply that principle on the ground that the evidence shews the destruction of the property and progress of the fire to have been manifestly inevitable when the officials of the municipality took action; but the respondents have admitted their responsibility and the applicability of the common law principle on which the case of Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney5 proceeded, and do not support the decision below upon the ground taken up in the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment. The respondent, in its factum, says:\u2014\nWas respondent bound in law to pay the loss caused by the demolition?\nThe only similar case which we have been able to find is that of the Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney5.\nThe majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court by which the City of Quebec had been condemned to pay $400 for a demolition made under circumstances similar to those in the present case, on the ground that municipal corporations, representing the whole community, are bound to indemnify those who suffer loss by reason of the exercise of municipal authority, when such is done in the interest of the municipality. Whilst the Chief Justice in the King\u2019s Bench was dissenting he did so because there was not in his opinion sufficient evidence that the demolition had been ordered by the municipal authority, because the house so demolished had not been attacked by the fire and would not have been burnt as the fire had been put under control at the fifth house from the one so demolished, and because article 4426, Revised Statutes, Quebec, concerning demolitions, was not applicable to the City of Quebec, the latter being provided with a special charter.\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice Letellier, who gave the judgment in the present case, considered himself bound by the decision above quoted and adopted the reasoning thereof.\nIn England and in the United States the right to demolish under similar circumstances and the right to indemnity have been sanctioned repeatedly and the jurisprudence in these countries recognizes the right of a proprietor of a building demolished for the purpose of staying the progress of the fire to receive an indemnity, to be paid either by the municipal corporation or the insurance companies. The court of appeal in the case of Mahoney based its decision on French law, which is the law that governs questions of civil responsibility, and upon articles 677, Municipal Code, and 4426, Revised Statutes, Quebec, 1888.\nArticle 5638 of the present Revised Statutes, 1909, has replaced article 4426, and gives the right to demolish without dealing with the question of indemnity. The result is that the indemnity is left to the discretion of the court and is to be granted or not according to the facts of each case. The indemnity is one that exists by common law. The former article 4426 provided that in the absence of any by-law the mayor could order the demolition in case of fire.\nArticle 5638 does not so provide, but this right exists notwithstanding; it is a common law right. The learned trial judge very justly remarked in his notes that it is not when the fire is doing its ravaging work that the municipal council can meet and adopt a by-law to authorize the mayor to give an order of demolition.\nThe town did not have any by-law on the subject; the mayor, as such, gave the order in the interest of all; his action was subsequently ratified by the municipal council, which authorized the payment of the indemnity to Madame Claveau. The Town of Chicoutimi is subject to the general laws governing cities and towns.\nThe order of the mayor, ratified by the council, put an end to a vast conflagration which threatened to spread all over the town and which would have caused still far greater damages. The demolition was not only a measure of prudence; it was urgent and necessary. Without it, the whole east ward would have been burnt and other wards of the town as well. The object of the demolition, which was to circumscribe the fire, was secured fully and the fire was stayed at the building which was demolished and on both sides of the street. Under the circumstances the town was legally authorized and bound to indemnify the proprietors who suffered by reason of such demolition.\nBefore the Court of King\u2019s Bench the appellant, in its factum, admitted that the conclusion arrived at by the court of first instance on this point must be adopted.\nI think the respondent\u2019s counsel is right in his contention that article 4426, R.S.Q., 1888, has been superseded by article 5638, R.S.Q., 1909, but, by reason of the position taken by the respondent, I do not think it is incumbent upon me to consider and I do not consider whether or not, by reason of the evidence to which the Court of King\u2019s Bench refers, the principle of the Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney[6] is inapplicable here.\nThe contention of the respondent on this branch of the case is, and it is on this contention that I think the respondent fails, that admitting the principle of the Mahoney Case[7] to be applicable the proprietor\u2019s right to reparation is only for the amount of his loss after taking into account the value of any insurance of which he may be entitled to the benefit.\nI do not think the right to which effect is given in that case is so limited.\nI quote from the judgment of Cimon J., at p. 401:\u2014\nFavard de Langlade, Repert. vbs. expropriation pour cause d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique, par. XIV.: \u201cSi la d\u00e9possession a lieu dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier, comme, lorsque, pour arr\u00eater un incendie, on abat une maison afin de pr\u00e9server les \u00e9difices voisins, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par tous ceux dont on peut pr\u00e9voir que les maisons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sauv\u00e9es.\u201d Proudhon, Usufruit, no. 1594, dit la m\u00eame chose.\nEt, en passant au droit fran\u00e7ais plus moderne j\u2019y trouve encore, comme r\u00e9sultat, qu\u2019on assimile le cas \u00e0 la doctrine du jet de mer, bien que plusieurs appelent cette d\u00e9molition une expropriation tacite; et il en r\u00e9sulte que le propri\u00e9taire de la maison abattue a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\nSeulement, avec le syst\u00e8me des municipalit\u00e9s, ou, plut\u00f2t, le syst\u00e8me communal en France, ce ne sont plus les voisins \u00e0 qui le propri\u00e9taire de la maison d\u00e9molie doit s\u2019adresser, car ces voisins sont confondus dans la commune, et c\u2019est pour le salut public de la commune que la d\u00e9molition a eu lieu: il faudra que le propri\u00e9taire de la maison d\u00e9molie s\u2019adresse, pour son indemnit\u00e9, \u00e0 la commune, d\u2019autant mieux qu\u2019elle a le contr\u00f4le des mesures \u00e0 prendre pour combattre l\u2019incendie.\nM. le conseiller Aimeras Latour, dans son rapport de la cause de la Commune de Chareton c. Gillet[8], r\u00e9sume ainsi la doctrine:\u2014\n\u201cD\u2019apr\u00e8s le jugement, nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une faute, d\u2019un accident; nous avons devant nous un fait correspondant \u00e0 un int\u00e9r\u00eat public, une mesure pratiqu\u00e9e dans le but de s\u2019opposer au progr\u00e8s d\u2019un incendie. En pareil cas, la demande de sieur Gillet se retranche dans les principes ordinaires du droit civil. Le dommage souffert ou les frais faits par un seul, profitant \u00e0 la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des habitants, la commune doit indemniser celui qui a co\u00f6p\u00e9r\u00e9 ainsi \u00e0 la conservation de tous. C\u2019est absolument comme en cas de guerre, la contribution pay\u00e9e par un seul dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de tous; c\u2019est le jet a la mer, qui, en sauvant le navire, oblige \u00e0 repartir la perte sur ceux qui en ont profit\u00e9.\u201d\nDans une cause devant la cour de cassation, sous la pr\u00e9sence de M. Troplong, une d\u00e9molition est, en pareil cas, appel\u00e9e \u201cexpropriation\u201d (D.P. 66,1.75). Je crois cette qualification impropre. Mais qu\u2019importe l\u2019expression!\nThere is here no trace of any such restriction and the analogies suggested \u201cla doctrine du jet de mer\u201d and \u201cexpropriation tacite\u201d are not consistent with the existence of such restriction.\nAs to the amount of the loss, that has been ascertained by the agreement of the parties. What then is the position of the appellant company?\nThe contract of insurance is a contract of indemnity and I think that according to the law of Quebec the appellant company would have been entitled, on payment of the loss, to be subrogated to Madame Claveau\u2019s rights against the municipality.\nThe French version of article 4584, C.C., is clear upon the point. The English version creates a difficulty. The two versions are as follows:\u2014\n2584. L'assureur, en payant l'indemnit\u00e9, a droit \u00e0 la cession des droits de l'assur\u00e9 contre ceux qui ont caus\u00e9 le feu ou la perte.\n2584. The insurer on paying the loss is entitled to a transfer of the rights of the insured against the persons by whose fault the fire or loss was caused.\nI shall assume that the right admitted by the municipality resting on the principle of Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney[9] is not a right of action for a \u201cfault.\u201d This does not conclude the matter. Article 2615, C.C., provides that where the French and English versions differ that version is to be accepted which most nearly accords with the existing law. I have came to the conclusion that the right of subrogation enjoyed by insurers under French law being an equity arising out of the fact that the contract is a contract of indemnity is not limited to a right to have the benefit of the obligations springing from the wrongful destruction of or injury to the property insured.\nSuch a view would not be consistent with the doctrine of Pothier (ed. Bugnet), vol. 5, \u201cAssurance,\u201d art. 161:\u2014\nLorsque les assureurs ont indemnis\u00e9 l\u2019assur\u00e9 des pertes et dommages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s pour le salut commun dans les marchandises assur\u00e9es ils doivent \u00eatre subrog\u00e9s aux droits de l\u2019assur\u00e9 dans la contribution qui doit se faire en ce cas.\nThe rule of the French law in 1830 is stated by Quenault, arts. 325 and 326, in these words:\u2014\n325. Le paiement de l\u2019assurance n\u2019op\u00e8re pas seulement en faveur des assureurs l\u2019effet dont nous venons de parler. Il a encore pour effet d\u2019obliger l\u2019assur\u00e9 \u00e0 subroger les assureurs qui le paient, dans les droits, recours et actions en indemnit\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait par rapport \u00e0 la chose assur\u00e9e.\nCet abandon des actions de l\u2019assur\u00e9 au profit des assureurs semble une cons\u00e9quence forc\u00e9e des principes qui dominent la mati\u00e8re. En effet si l\u2019assur\u00e9 pouvait, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu des assureurs l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de sa perte, exiger encore de l\u2019auteur du sinistre la m\u00eame indemnit\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, l\u2019assur\u00e9 trouverait dans le sinistre une source de b\u00e9nifices, puisqu\u2019il recevrait deux fois la valeur de ce qu\u2019il aurait perdu. Les principes qui r\u00e9gissent le contrat d\u2019assurance s\u2019opposent \u00e0 un pareil r\u00e9sultat; ils veulent que ce contrat ne devienne point un titre lucratif pour l\u2019assur\u00e9, et cons\u00e9quemment, que l\u2019action qui en r\u00e9sulte en sa faveur ne puisse \u00eatre cumul\u00e9e avec une autre action tendente \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de la m\u00eame perte. L\u2019assur\u00e9 ne peut donc se faire payer par les assureurs l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de sa perte, qu\u2019\u00e0 la condition d\u2019abandonner les autres actions en indemnit\u00e9, qu\u2019il aurait \u00e0 exercer \u00e0 raison du m\u00eame sinistre.\n326. Si l\u2019assur\u00e9 se refusait \u00e0 faire cet abandon au profit des assureurs, ils pourraient obtenir que le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre recouvr\u00e9e contre l\u2019auteur du sinistre fut d\u00e9duit de la somme qu\u2019ils auraient \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9; et cela, en vertu du m\u00eame principe que les autorise \u00e0 d\u00e9duire de cette somme la valeur des d\u00e9bris, de la chose assur\u00e9e conserv\u00e9s par l\u2019assur\u00e9. L\u2019assur\u00e9, pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019on impute sur l\u2019assurance le montant d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas certain de recouvrer contre l\u2019auteur du sinistre, a \u00e9videmment int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 subroger les assureurs dans tous ses droits contre ce dernier. Mais quelque conforme aux principes du contrat d\u2019assurance que soit cette subrogation, elle a besoin d\u2019\u00eatre formellement consentie par l\u2019assur\u00e9e.\nThe principle governing the rights of an insurer in this connection was considered in the judgment of Parke B., in 1851, in Quebec Fire Assurance Co. v. St. Louis[10], at pages 316 and 317. I quote the passage which gives the ratio decidendi:\u2014\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiffs admit that they did not fall within the description of persons who are subrogated by operation of law without requisition to or convention with the creditors, nor strictly to the class of co-obligors or sureties, to whom Pothier, \u201cCoutume d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans,\u201d tit. xx., sec. 5, p. 846, ascribes the right of requiring the creditors, when they pay the debt, for which they are jointly bound or responsible to him, either to subrogate or discharge them. But the learned counsel contended that an assuree, by a policy against either maritime or terrestrial risks, is clearly within the equity of the rules and has a similar right to require a subrogation at the time of the payment of the loss. The authorities cited in support of that position seem to us to establish that the assurees have that right; they are: Alauzel \u201cOn Assurance,\u201d p. 384, s. 477; Pardessus, \u201cCours de Droit Commercial,\u201d 595; Quinault, p. 248; Touiller, tit. 4, s. 175; Em\u00e9rigon (English trans., 1850), ch. xii., s. 14, pp. 329-336; and Pothier \u201cOn Assurance,\u201d 248, who lays it down that in the case of a general average, the assurer, after having indemnified the assured against the losses sustained for the common benefit, ought to be subrogated to the rights of the assured, to the contribution, which in such case must be made. These authorities are so consistent with justice, and founded upon so equitable a principle, that we have no difficulty in adopting them; and we do not think that any of these are shewn to have been derived, as was suggested in argument, from the Code Napoleon, which is not in force in Canada.\nI think the present case is well within the authority of this passage. I should add that I have not found it necessary to consider the contention of the appellant company that the act of the mayor was a wrongful act or whether, assuming it were so, the municipality would be responsible or whether, in the circumstances, Madame Claveau in strict law would on that hypothesis have acquired a right to more than nominal damages. I have considered the case upon the footing upon which the respondent municipality has from the beginning put it, namely, that the act of demolition was a rightful act under powers vested in the municipality at common law and that the doctrine of the decision in Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney[11] governs the determination of the appeal and that the municipality was responsible to make reparation according to the principle enunciated in the passage quoted above from the judgment of Cimon J.\nOn this footing I think the contentions of the appellant company ought to prevail over those of the municipality.\nAnglin J.\u2014Incorporated by 57 Vict. ch. 66 (Que.), the Town of Chicoutimi is governed by the provisions of the \u201cTown Corporations\u2019 General Clauses Act,\u201d 1888, articles 4178, et seq. Applicable to towns incorporated prior to 1903 Which have not been subsequently taken out of its operation (R.S.Q., 1909, art. 5884), this Act is still in force and unrepealed. See R.S.Q., 1909, vol 4, p. 373. By articles 4389 and 4426 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, town corporations are authorized to pass by-laws\n4426. To authorize certain persons to cause to be blown up, pulled down or demolished, such buildings as may appear necessary in order to arrest the progress of any fire, saving all damages and indemnity payable by the corporation to the proprietors of such buildings to an amount agreed upon between the parties, or on contestation to an amount settled by arbitrators. In the absence of any by-law under this article, the mayor may during the course of any fire, exercise this power by giving a special authorization. (40 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 251.)\nIt does not appear upon the record that any by-law such as is authorized by this article was passed by the Town of Chicoutimi. But the demolition of Mme. Claveau\u2019s house resulted from the blowing up of the adjacent Tremblay residence under the special direction of the mayor, and the liability of the municipal corporation to the owner was, in my opinion, the same as if the work had been carried out under the provisions of a by-law. This, I think, is the effect of the words \u201cmay exercise this power\u201d That the demolition of Mme. Claveau\u2019s house was not directed or intended, but was occasioned by the use of an excessive charge of dynamite in blowing up the Tremblay residence, owing to a desire to insure the complete destruction of the latter, does not, in my opinion, suffice to take the present case out of the purview of article 4426, or to render the mayor or the municipal corporation liable therefor ex delictu. Under the circumstances \u2014 regard being had especially to the emergency which called for prompt and effective action \u2014 a case of fault has not been established against them under article 1053, C.C., in respect of liability for which the appellants might be entitled to subrogation. Article 2584, C.C., and report thereon of the Codification Commissioners.\nUpon consideration of the scope and purpose of article 4426, R.S.Q., 1888, I am convinced that it was not the object of the legislature, in enacting it, to indemnify insurance companies against losses occasioned to them through the demolition of buildings pursuant to its provisions for the purpose of arresting the progress of fires. The intention was, in my opinion, to subject the municipality to liability to the proprietor of any building so demolished for his own benefit, and not through him for the benefit of any insurance company interested, for the net loss which he would sustain in consequence \u2014 that is, for his damages over and above any indemnification to which he might be entitled under the provisions of any insurance policy. The fact that in most cases where buildings are demolished under the provisions of article 4426 they would themselves, if not so destroyed, become a prey to the conflagration which their demolition is designed to arrest, with consequent liability of the insurance companies, seems to me to confirm the view that the construction which. I put upon that article is what the legislature intended it should bear. Where the building demolished is not covered by insurance, or, for any reason not attributable to his own fault, the proprietor is unable to recover upon his insurance, the municipal corporation would, of course, be liable to the full amount of the value of the property destroyed. But where the owner is entitled to the benefit of insurance the amount thereof recoverable must be first deducted from the total value of the property destroyed in estimating the amount of damages and indemnity payable to him by the corporation. To place any other construction upon article 4426 would, I am satisfied, be to give it an effect not intended by the legislature. In my opinion, therefore, the statute did not subject the respondent to any liability in respect of the part of Mme. Claveau\u2019s loss covered by insurance, and she, therefore, had no such rights against it to which the appellants could claim subrogation. As already stated delictual liability of respondents has not been established. On the other hand it is admitted by the appellants \u2014 and I think there is no doubt \u2014 that they were liable, under their policy, to Mme. Claveau. Her loss was caused \u201cby the means used for extinguishing the fire\u201d Article 2580, C.C.\nIn settling with Mme Claveau for the sum of $5,500 the municipal corporation insisted upon her assigning her interest in her policies of insurance with the appellant company, which she did. Although in making this settlement it was not explicitly stated that the municipality assumed liability only for the amount of Mme. Claveau\u2019s loss in excess of her insurance, it is quite clear that it was not intended by the payment made to her to satisfy or extinguish the liability of the appellants. If it were, the taking of an assignment of her claims under her policies would be meaningless. I think the proper interpretation of what was done is that the municipality intended to purchase Madame Claveau\u2019s rights against the insurance company and to pay to her, in discharge of its liability under article 4426, only the difference between the amount recoverable under her insurance policies and the sum of $5,500, the balance being the purchase price of the assignment of her claims against the insurance company. Her policies amounted in all to $4,700 and the loss recoverable under them has been fixed by the learned trial judge at $4,000. No appeal has been taken against this assessment of the amount of the appellants\u2019 liability. The assignability of Madame Claveau\u2019s rights accrued against the insurance company has not been questioned.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the judgment in appeal Should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige sont les suivants:\u2014\nLa compagnie appellante avait assur\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Madame Claveau, situ\u00e9e dans la Ville de Chicoutimi, Le 24 juin, 1912, un incendie consid\u00e9rable s\u2019est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qui mena\u00e7a de d\u00e9truire la principale partie de la ville.\nLe maire, apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 la brigade du feu et certains citoyens, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire d\u00e9truire par la dynamite certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le b\u00fbt d\u2019arr\u00eater la conflagration; et parmi les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui furent ainsi d\u00e9truites se trouvait celle de Madame Claveau.\nMadame Claveau s\u2019est alors adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la corporation pour se faire rembourser la valeur de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La municipalit\u00e9, vu l\u2019incertitude o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait de savoir si elle \u00e9tait responsable ou non, a cru devoir r\u00e9gler avec Madame Claveau, mais en se faisant transporter l\u2019assurance que cette derni\u00e8re avait sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; et elle poursuit maintenant la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante pour en r\u00e9clamer le montant.\nLa compagnie d\u2019assurance pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas tenue de payer \u00e0 la ville, vu que cette derni\u00e8re ne pouvait pas \u00eatre, dans les circonstances, subrog\u00e9e aux droits de Madame Claveau contre la compagnie d\u2019assurance.\nEn vertu de l\u2019acte des villes, art. 4426, S.R.Q. (1888), qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la Ville de Chicoutimi, les corporations municipales ont le droit\nd\u2019autoriser certaines personnes \u00e0 faire sauter, d\u00e9molir et abattre autant de constructions qu\u2019il para\u00eet n\u00e9cessaire pour arr\u00eater les progr\u00e8s d\u2019un incendie, sauf les dommages et indemnit\u00e9s payables par la corporation aux propri\u00e9taires de ces constructions, au montant convenu entre les parties, ou sur contestation au montant fix\u00e9 par les arbitres.\nEn l\u2019absence de r\u00e8glement fait en vertu de cet article, le maire peut, dans le cours d\u2019un incendie, exercer ce pouvoir, en donnant une autorisation sp\u00e9ciale.\nDans le cas actuel il ne para\u00eet pas y avoir eu de r\u00e8glement de pass\u00e9 par le conseil municipal de la Ville de Chicoutimi; mais, en vertu de la loi dont nous venons de lire le texte, le maire pouvait certainement pendant la conflagration ordonner de d\u00e9truire et de d\u00e9molir toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il jugerait n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019arr\u00eater le progr\u00e8s du feu.\nDans ce cas-l\u00e0, il serait oblig\u00e9 cependant d\u2019indemniser le propri\u00e9taire de ces b\u00e2tisses.\nNous retombons virtuellement sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 407 du Code Civil qui dit que nul ne peut \u00eatre contrait de c\u00e9der sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 si ce n\u2019est pour une cause d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique et pour une juste et pr\u00e9alable indemnit\u00e9.\nL\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public commandait, dans les circonstances exceptionelles o\u00f9 on \u00e9tait, de d\u00e9truire les b\u00e2tisses en question. Mais le propri\u00e9taire avait le droit alors de se faire indemniser ainsi que la loi le d\u00e9clare et ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019ailleurs dans la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Mahoney[12].\nSi la ville e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 en faute, la subrogation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de nul effet parce que la compagnie d\u2019assurance, en acquittant sa dette, aurait eu le droit de se faire c\u00e9der les droits que le propri\u00e9taire avait contre ceux qui par leur faute avaient d\u00e9truit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMais dans le cas actuel il n\u2019y a pas de faute qui puisse \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 la ville. Le maire a fait ce que la loi l\u2019autorisait de faire. Il n\u2019y a donc pas eu de d\u00e9lit de sa part. M. Atwater, dans son argument, nous a dit que l\u2019article 2584, C.C., s\u2019appliquait non seulement au cas d\u00e9lictuel, mais aussi au cas o\u00f9 il y aurait responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale ou conventionelle de la part de celui qui aurait d\u00e9truit la chose.\nJe suis incapable d\u2019accepter cette pr\u00e9tention.\nL\u2019article 2584 du Code Civil a \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la doctrine maintenue par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Quebec Fire Assurance Co. v. Molson[13], en 1851. C\u2019est ce que d\u00e9clarent formellement les codificateurs dans leur rapport.\nIl s\u2019agissait dans cette cause de l\u2019incendie d\u2019une \u00e9glise qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute de Molson et de St. Louis.\nLa compagnie d\u2019assurance, ayant pay\u00e9 les propri\u00e9taires de l\u2019\u00e9glise, a poursuivi les auteurs du d\u00e9lit, Molson et St. Louis, et le Conseil Priv\u00e9, saisi de la cause, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9,\nque les assureurs contre le feu ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre subrog\u00e9s aux droits et actions de l\u2019assur\u00e9 contre ceux qui ont caus\u00e9 le feu et la perte.\nLes codificateurs ont ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le Code l\u2019article qui est devenu notre article 2584, qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\nL\u2019assureur en payant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 la cession les droits de l\u2019assur\u00e9 contre ceux qui ont caus\u00e9 le feu ou la perte.\nSi nous lisons litt\u00e9ralement cet article, nous en arriverons \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019assur\u00e9 serait tenu de c\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019assureur tous les droits qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de contre les tiers, que ces droits r\u00e9sultent du d\u00e9lit de ces derniers ou qu\u2019ils existent en vertu de la loi ou d\u2019une convention. En d\u2019autres termes, que l\u2019obligation du tiers soit d\u00e9lictuelle ou simplement contractuelle ou l\u00e9gale, l\u2019assur\u00e9 devait c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019assureur contre ce tiers.\nLa version anglaise cependant ne laisse pas de doute que la seule obligation du tiers qui passe \u00e0 l\u2019assureur est l\u2019obligation d\u00e9lictuelle. Voici, en effet, le texte de l\u2019article:\u2014\nThe insurer on paying the loss is entitled to a transfer of the rights of the insured against the persons by whose fault the fire or loss was caused.\nLes deux textes diff\u00e8rent \u00e9videmment. Alors nous devons pour les int\u00e9rpr\u00e9ter, suivre la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e en l\u2019article 2615, C.C., qui dit que nous devons suivre\nle texte le plus compatible avec les dispositions des lois existantes.\nLes codificateurs dans leur rapport se sont charg\u00e9s de nous expliquer cet article.\nComme je viens de le dire, les codificateurs ont donn\u00e9 comme l\u2019une des sources de cet article 2584 la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Quebec Fire Assurance Co. v. Molson et al.[14]. Or, cette cause consistait en un recours en dommages de l\u2019assureur contre ceux qui par leur faute avaient incendi\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e et dans leur rapport les codificateurs disent formellement:\u2014\nIl semblerait que le droit de l\u2019assureur qui paie est le droit d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019assur\u00e9 une cession de son recours en dommage.\nLes codificateurs citent aussi, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur rapport, Pardessus, Droit Commercial, paragraphe 595, qui nous dit qu\u2019il arrive souvent que la perte dont l\u2019assureur est oblig\u00e9 de faire la r\u00e9paration est caus\u00e9 par le crime ou par la faute d\u2019un tiers, alors dans ce cas l\u2019assureur aurait toujours le droit de r\u00e9qu\u00e9rir l\u2019assur\u00e9 de lui c\u00e9der le droit d\u2019action qu\u2019il aurait contre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit (p. 143, 6\u00e8me \u00e9dition):\u2014 Ce n\u2019est point, il est vrai, le cas de subrogation l\u00e9gale; ce n\u2019est pas m\u00eame celui de la subrogation conventionelle; c\u2019est le cas de la r\u00e8gle que nul ne peut se dispenser de r\u00e9parer le tort qu\u2019il a fait (art. 1382, C.N.).\nJe pourrais aussi citer Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vo. \u201cAssurance,\u201d No. 136, qui dit:\u2014\nIl est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis que l\u2019assureur a une action directe contre les tiers responsables du sinistre en vertu du principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral formul\u00e9 par les articles 1382-1383. Cette action ne lui permet pas d\u2019invoquer toutes les garanties sp\u00e9ciales dont jouit l\u2019assur\u00e9.\nLes articles 1382 et 1383 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspondent \u00e0 notre article 1053, n\u2019ont trait qu\u2019aux d\u00e9lits et non pas aux obligations r\u00e9sultant de la loi ou des conventions. Il est donc \u00e9vident pour moi que les droits dont parle l\u2019article 2584 du Code Civil ne sont que les droits de l\u2019assur\u00e9 contre les personnes par la faute desquelles la perte a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e\nLe texte anglais de cet article est donc celui qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019intention des codificateurs et qui \u00e9nonce le plus correctement la loi alors existante.\nJe pourrais citer \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette opinion: Laverty, Insurance Law, pp. 458-459 et 460; Dalloz, 1853-1-93; Dalloz, 1882-2-238.\nLa compagnie d\u2019assurance n\u2019avait donc pas le droit dans les circonstances de se faire c\u00e9der les droits que Madame Claveau, l\u2019assur\u00e9e, avait contre la Ville de Chicoutimi. Par contre, cette derni\u00e8re est l\u00e9galement devenue propri\u00e9taire de la cr\u00e9ance de l\u2019assur\u00e9e contre la d\u00e9fenderesse appelante.\nJe consid\u00e8re que la compagnie est tenue de payer et le jugement qui l\u2019a condamn\u00e9e doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Atwater, Daclos & Bond.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.

The King, (1915) 51 S.C.R. 588\nDate: 1915-06-24\nCyrille Turgeon (Suppliant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Respondent) Respondent.\n1915: June 2; 1915: June 24.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nGovernment railway regulations\u2014Operation of trains\u2014Negligent signaling\u2014Fault of fellow servant\u2014Common fault\u2014Boarding moving train\u2014Disobedience of employee\u2014Voluntary exposure to danger\u2014Cause of injury\u2014R S C., 1906, c. 36, ss. 49, 54.\nBy a regulation of the Intercolonial Railway, no person is allowed to get aboard cars while trains are in motion. Without ascertaining that all his train-crew were aboard, the conductor signalled the engineman to start his train from a station where it had stopped to discharge freight. One of the crew, who had been assisting in unloading, then attempted to board the moving train and, in doing so, he was injured.\nHeld, that the injury sustained by the employee was the direct and immediate consequence of his infraction of the regulation which he was, by law, obliged to obey and not the result of the fault of the conductor; that by disobedience to the regulation, the employee had voluntarily exposed himself to danger from the moving train; that the negligence of the conductor in giving the signal to start the train was not an act for which the Government of Canada could be held responsible and that its relation to the accident was too remote to be regarded as the cause of the injury.\nJudgment appealed from (15 Ex. C.R.), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the petition of right of the suppliant with costs. The circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the issues raised on the appeal are discussed on the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Lane, K.C. for the appellant.\nP. J. Jolic\u0153ur for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Rule No. 48 enacts (inter alia):\u2014\nNo person shall be allowed to get into or upon or quit any car after the car has been put in motion or until it stops.\nTo this extent at all events the rule is within the rulemaking authority conferred, by the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, ch. 36, sec. 49, upon the Governor-in Council; and it must be given effect to as a legislative enactment as well as one of the rules of the appellant's employment. The injury suffered by the appellant was the direct and immediate consequence of a violation of this rule; but he alleges that the act done in violation of it was done at the invitation of the conductor and upon that allegation he bases his contention which is the ground of his appeal that this is a case of faute commune.\nThere are three answers to that. 1. If what the conductor did was an invitation to commit a breach of this rule, it was, in so far, an act for which the Government is not responsible. 2. The forbidden act was the act of the appellant; and it could only be in very special circumstances, if ever, that conduct such as that of the conductor which is relied upon as constituting the fault upon winch the claim is based could be so connected with the forbidden act as to bring it within the category of fault dans locum injuri\u0153. In this case it is clear that the fault relied upon is in its relation to the injury too remote to be regarded as in the legal sense one of the causes of it, 3. The rule is plainly framed with the object of avoiding just such accidents as that which happened. The observance of it is one of the duties which the law imposes upon the employee for that purpose. The violation of it cannot give him a right of action merely because other fellow servants equally bound to observe it concurred with him in that violation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014There can be no doubt that the direct and immediate cause of the injuries sustained by the appellant was his violation of Rule No. 48, which enacts that\u2014\nNo person shall be allowed to get into or upon or quit any car after the car has been put in motion or until it stops.\nThis was a rule\nto be observed by conductors, engine-drivers and other officers and servants of the Intercolonial Railway: R.S.C., ch. 36, sec. 49,\nand was intended for the safety of persons in the position of the appellant. While the conductor was, no doubt, most blameworthy for having signalled the train to start when he knew, or should have known, that if the appellant was to board it he must do so while it was in motion, that does not excuse the plaintiff's breach of the explicit prohibition of Rule 48. I agree with the learned trial judge that on this account alone this petition of right must fail. Brodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un accident de chemin de fer arriv\u00e9 sur \u201cl'Intercolonial.\u201d L'appelant \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 comme serrefrein sur un convoi de marchandises.\nCe convoi \u00e9tait en gare et l'appelant en \u00e9tait descendu pour aider \u00e0 charger et d\u00e9charger des marchandises. Apr\u00e8s avoir fini son ouvrage, il se disposait \u00e0 rejoindre le char o\u00f9 les employ\u00e9s se tiennent pendant le trajet d'une gare \u00e0 l'autre et qui se trouvait \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re du convoi. Le conducteur du train donna ordre de partir; et, pendant que le convoi \u00e9tait en mouvement, l'appelant a essay\u00e9 de monter dans son char. Malheureusement il glissa et se fit \u00e9craser la jambe gauche et re\u00e7ut d'autres contusions moins graves.\nLe gouvernement plaide que l'accident est d\u00fb enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la faute de l'appelant parce qu'il aurait mont\u00e9 sur le train lorsque ce dernier \u00e9tait en mouvement.\nPar la section 49 de l'acte des chemins de fer du gouvernement, le gouverneur en conseil est autoris\u00e9 de faire des r\u00e8glements pour la conduite des employ\u00e9s du chemin. Parmi ces r\u00e8glements se trouve celui portant le No. 48 qui dit:\u2014\nNo person shall be allowed to get into or upon or quit any car person doing so or attempting to do so has no recourse upon the Railway Department for any accident which may take place in consequence of such conduct.\nPar la section 54 du m\u00eame acte il est dit que ces r\u00e8glements seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant force de loi. Bien loin d'\u00eatre tenu de monter sur le convoi lorsqu'il \u00e9tait en mouvement, cela lui \u00e9tait formellement d\u00e9fendu par les r\u00e8glements qui lui \u00e9taient donn\u00e9s comme r\u00e8gle de conduite. Laurent, vol. 20, p. 521, dit:\u2014\nQuand la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e a enfreint un r\u00e8glement et que c'est par suite de cette infraction qu'elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un dommage, elle ne peut pas, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, se plaindre; c'est le cas de dire avec l'adage qu'elle est cens\u00e9e n'avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9e.\nIl pourrait peut-\u00eatre se pr\u00e9senter dans cette cause la question de savoir s'il y a eu \u201cfaute commune\u201d de la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e et de la partie d\u00e9fenderesse.\nLes faits cependant sembleraient d\u00e9montrer que l'accident est d\u00fb enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la faute de la victime.\nLa cour d'appel de Qu\u00e9bec, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier un accident \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s semblable, dans une cause de Central Vermont Railroad Co. v. Lareau[2], en 1886, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait pas un cas de faute commune mais que la personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e en \u00e9tait seule responsable.\nC'est l\u00e0 d'ailleurs, je crois, la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est venu lui-m\u00eame l'honorable juge de la cour inf\u00e9rieure, que l'accident est d\u00fb enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la faute de la victime. Cependant je ne pourrais pas acquiescer \u00e0 la proposition que je rel\u00e8ve \u00e0 la fin de son jugement et qui est dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nAs the proximate cause of the accident is the boarding by him of a train in motion, he thus contributed to the cause which determined the accident and the doctrine of faute commune does not apply when the person injured contributed to the determining cause of the accident.\nIl ne faut pas oublier que les principes de la \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d du droit anglais ne s'appliquent pas dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec (Juge Dorion dans Desroches v. Gauthier[3]), et cet accident ayant eu lieu dans cette province doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9 suivant les lois de cette province.\nLa faute de la victime n'est pas toujours un obstacle \u00e0 sa demande en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Si son imprudence ou sa faute est la seule cause du dommage, \u00e9videmment elle ne peut rechercher personne en justice pour l'indemniser de ce dommage. Mais si une autre personne a contribu\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 produire le fait pr\u00e9judiciable, si les deux parties sont en faute, alors nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une faute commune. Et l'imprudence commise par la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e ne saurait affranchir de toute responsabilit\u00e9 celui dont la faute a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'accident. Cette imprudence de la victime du dommage a seulement pour effet d'en entra\u00eener la r\u00e9duction du chiffre. Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, No. 108, dit:\u2014\nLes tribunaux arbitreront jusqu'\u00e0 quel point la faute de l'un et celle de l'autre sont intervenues comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la perte, et feront supporter \u00e0 chacun la valeur, proportionnellement \u00e0 ce qui lui est imputable.\nTout en confirmant le jugement de la Cour d'Echiquier dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je ne saurais accepter le principe que\nthe doctrine of faute commune does not apply when the person injured contributed to the determining cause of the accident.\nC'est, au contraire, dans ces cas l\u00e0 que la faute commune existe et qu'il y a lieu d'appliquer les principes.

The formal judgment provided merely that costs should be taxed as between solicitor and client. Per Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014In the taxation of costs, the registrar should follow the directions given in the judge\u2019s opinion to interpret the formal judgment as framed. Duff J. contra.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The registrar, in taxing costs, is required by law to follow the terms of the formal judgment and it is not open to him to correct it in order to make it accord with his interpretation of the opinion judgment. The court appealed from, however, may correct the formal judgment in so far as it does not express the intention of the opinion judgment.\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada by which the defendants, in both actions, were refused claims for interest on the value of lands in respect of which expropriation proceedings had been commenced and subsequently abandoned.\nIn the month of April, 1912, the Government of Canada gave notice of the expropriation of a strip of land, of which the appellants were owners, and which was required for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway. At the same time a plan and book of reference describing the lands were deposited in the office of the registrar of deeds for the County of Quebec within which the lands were situated. The Crown did not enter into possession of the lands, which the appellants continued to occupy, and, in June, 1914, an information was filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada tendering, respectively, certain sums as compensation therefor. The appellants filed answers claiming much larger amounts as the values of their lands. After issue had been joined and some evidence given on behalf of the appellants, the respondent filed an abandonment, as provided by section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 143, and moved the court for an order granting leave to discontinue proceedings. The appellants then claimed reimbursement of their costs and also that they should be paid interest upon the amounts at which they had valued their lands or, alternatively, upon the amounts which had been tendered as compensation by the Crown. No further evidence was adduced and, on 27th January, 1915, the judge of the Exchequer Court rendered judgment, holding that the appellants had not suffered any special damages in consequence of the proceedings taken, but that they were entitled to their costs, as between solicitor and client, and to be recouped all legitimate and reasonable charges and disbursements. Judgment was formally entered allowing the discontinuance of the proceedings, declaring that the appellants, defendants, were not entitled to recover compensation and that they were entitled to recover from the Crown their costs in connection with the proceedings \u201cto be taxed as between solicitor and client.\u201d From this judgment the present appeals were taken.\nThe questions in issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nE. A. D. Morgan for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy-Minister of Justice, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed in the judgments dismissing the appeals with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014These two appeals from the Exchequer Court of Canada raise for determination the same questions and were argued together. The questions arise out of proceedings having been taken on behalf of the Crown for the expropriation of lands of the respective defendants and the rights and liabilities of the parties\u2014defendants and the Crown\u2014under those proceedings are to be determined by the provisions of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d\nA plan and description of the lands intended to be taken under section 8 of the Act were duly filed. Subsequently and before compensation was agreed upon or paid the Crown, under section 23, gave notice to the appellants that their lands were not required and were abandoned by the Crown.\nThe appellants thereupon filed, to the information of the Attorney-General claiming a declaration that the amount tendered by the Crown was sufficient, a new defence claiming to recover interest at 5% upon the sum which should have been awarded them for damages in case the Crown had not abandoned. In the alternative they claimed interest upon the sum the Crown had tendered as the value of the lands taken.\nIn my opinion, the section of the Act relating to interest being allowed has reference only to cases where the Crown has retained the lands taken and does not extend to or cover cases where, after filing notice of intention to take lands, the Crown has subsequently \u201cabandoned\u201d the lands to the owners under the provisions of the Act. Sub-section 4 of section 23 makes special provision for the assessment of damages in the latter case.\nThe learned trial judge acting under this sub-section found, as the appellants had always retained \u201cthe unlimited user of the lands taken\u201d which were enclosed with fences, that they had not sustained any special damage but, under the circumstances, determined that they should be allowed the costs of their action to be taxed as between attorney and client so as to cover\nall the legitimate and reasonable charges and disbursements under the circumstances.\nCounsel for the appellants admits that no special damages were sustained by his clients, but contends that they were entitled as of right to interest, as previously stated, whether they have sustained special damage or not.\nI cannot for the reasons I have stated accept this contention and am of opinion that the finding of fact of the learned judge as to the actual user and possession of the land, which was fenced in, having continued with the appellants and never having been interfered with, their rights are confined to the damages which might be awarded them under sub-section 4 of section 23. That sub-section directs\nthe fact of the abandonment or revesting shall be taken into account, in connection with all the circumstances of the case,\nin assessing the damages to be awarded. This the learned judge has done and he has in excluding the claim for interest, in my opinion, acted properly.\nNo doubt, in the taxation of costs, the registrar will follow the directions of the learned judge as to the basis upon which allowance should be made, and the formal judgment so interpreted will fully protect the appellants.\nThe appeals, therefore, fail and must be dismissed with costs,\nIdington J.\u2014These appeals involve the same points of law and were argued together. In each case the respondent had instituted proceedings for the expropriation of land needed for the National Transcontinental Railway, under and pursuant to 3 Edw. VII., ch. 71, and deposited a plan and book of reference on the 23rd of April, 1912, with the registrar of deeds for the County of Quebec.\nInformations respectively filed in each case in the Exchequer Court sought to have it declared that a sum named was sufficient compensation for the land taken. Thereupon proceedings were had in each case until the respondent desisted from further proceedings and the court declared the defendant was not entitled to recover from respondent any compensation in respect of such expropriation and abandonment, but that the defendant was entitled to recover from respondent its costs in connection with the proceedings to be taxed as between solicitor and client.\nIt was further ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff (now respondent) should have leave to discontinue.\nThese appellants each claim to be entitled to interest upon at least the amount tendered as compensation.\nThere seems to be rather a curious misconception of legal rights arising out of such proceedings.\nThe statute under which the respective proceedings were taken rendered that done legal and furnishes the only remedy the appellant can have. It entitles the respondent to withdraw when so advised but provides for the assessment of any damages sustained in consequences of the proceedings.\nThe learned trial judge has found there were no damages suffered save the costs duly awarded.\nEach of these appellants, however, contends that it is entitled to interest; though frankly admitting there were no damages suffered and no change of actual possession.\nThe statute provides for interest being awarded in the case of the proceedings being so continued as to determine a sum due for compensation, but makes no provision for interest upon any imaginary undetermined sum.\nThere is neither contractual nor statutory basis upon which to award interest.\nThe references to the Code and to the condition of things arising between an ordinary vendor and purchaser are all beside the question.\nThese would not help appellants much even if applicable when he, parting with his ownership in the property, had not been deprived of the fruits thereof, but remained in undisturbed possession thereof.\nCases may arise where the party whose property has been claimed in way of expropriation has by reason of its being tied up suffered material damages, but this is not that case.\nThe appeal as to costs seems hopeless in view of the costs awarded. I agree that the opinion judgment of Mr. Justice Audette should be read to interpret the formal judgment issued.\nThese appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The learned trial judge has found first, that the appellants retained possession, and secondly, that they had suffered no loss in consequence of the expropriation proceedings apart from the expenses of preparation for trial thrown away.\nThese findings are fatal to the claim for interest although it is better to say nothing on the point which might have arisen had possession been taken by the Crown.\nThe appellants are entitled, however, and I think the learned judge so held, to be indemnified fully in respect of their costs as between solicitor and client and all costs, charges and expenses properly incurred in preparation for the trial. The formal judgment does not sufficiently provide for that. As the judgment now stands the registrar, bound as he is to follow the terms of the formal judgment, is required by law to tax the costs as between solicitor and client according to the well settled rule, and that will be far indeed from affording the appellants the indemnity to which they are justly entitled.\nThe law requires the registrar to follow the formal judgment and it is not open to him to correct it to make it accord with his interpretation of the learned trial judge\u2019s reasons; and as the judgment is perfectly plain and unambiguous in its terms there is no room for interpretation. Expressions of opinion by judges of this court can add nothing to the powers of the registrar who is bound by law to act upon the judgment as framed construed as the law requires it to be.\nThese expressions may, however, remove the reluctance the learned judge would probably have felt otherwise in correcting the formal judgment (after appeal to the court) and making it conform to the judgment he in fact pronounced.\nThe judgment ought to have been formally altered by this court; but nevertheless I think the learned trial judge in the circumstances would be acting within his jurisdiction in making the correction this court ought to have made.

Quevillon, (1915) 51 S.C.R. 603\nDate: 1915-05-18\nPaul Saint-Denis (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Quevillon and Henri Payette (Defendants) Respondents,\n1915: February 15; 1915: May 18.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH (APPEAL SIDE), PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nLease of land\u2014Special condition\u2014Promise of sale\u2014Option\u2014Pacte de preference\u2014Unilateral contract\u2014Real rights\u2014Registry laws\u2014 Arts. 2082, 2085 C.C.\u2014Specific performance\u2014Damages\u2014Right of action.\nIn a lease of lands for the term of five years, which was registered, the lessor agreed to sell the property to the lessee for a certain price at any time during the term of the lease. It was also stipulated that in the event of a proposed sale to any other person, for any price whatsoever, the lessor should notify the lessee thereof and give him the right, by preference, to exercise his option to purchase. After the expiration of about two years of the term, the lessor served written notice on the lessee requiring him to exercise his option forthwith and stating that, in default, he would sell to another person, without, however, mentioning the terms and conditions of the proposed sale and, on request by the lessee, these particulars were refused. The lessee took no action on this notice and the lessor executed a deed of sale of the property to P. by conveyance in which the latter undertook that the registered lease would be maintained in force. Two years later, the lessee brought suit against the lessor and P. for specific performance of the agreement to sell and, alternatively, for damages against the lessor for breach of contract.\nPer curiam.\u2014The notice as given, without mentioning the terms and conditions of the proposed sale to P., was ineffectual to place the lessee in default in regard to exercising his option; the rights of the lessee under the deed of lease continued to subsist during the whole term of the lease.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ. (Duff and Anglin JJ. contra).\u2014The promise of sale and pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence were accessory to the contract of lease and created a real right in favour of the lessee which was capable of being registered against the leased lands. The registration of the deed of lease and actual knowledge by the purchaser of the rights of the lessee thereunder placed P. in the position of a purchaser in bad faith and, consequently, he became bound by the obligations resting upon the lessor and specific performance should be decreed against him as well as against the lessor.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The promise of sale and pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, being stipulations separate and distinct from the contract of lease, did not create real rights in the property leased which might be protected by registration under the registry laws of the Province of Quebec. Under the laws of that province (there being no evidence of bad faith on the part of the purchaser), the purchase of the leased property with knowledge of the owner\u2019s obligations, in personam, could not render such purchaser liable to a decree for specific performance thereof.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014The plaintiff had the right to bring his action notwithstanding the expiration of the period of two years after the date of the sale; the wrongful act of the lessor, in violation of his obligations under the deed of lease, did not impose upon the lessee the duty of asserting his rights at a period earlier than that required in his option.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 23 K.B. 436) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench[1], reversing the judgment of Lafontaine J. in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions in issue on the present appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Perron K.C. for the appellant.\nMigneault K.C. and Robillard K.C. for the respondents The Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action \u201cen passation de titre\" and in the alternative damages are claimed on the ground that the defendants, now respondents, conspired together to prevent the plaintiff, now appellant, from getting his deed. The trial judge maintained the action, but his judgment was reversed on appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench on these two grounds:\u2014\n(1) That respondent Payette was a \u201cbon\u00e2 fide\u201d purchaser for value, and that his knowledge of the option given by his co-respondent Quevillon to the appellant St. Denis in the lease of the latter did not constitute him fraudulent purchaser or chargeable with illegal collusion;\n(2) That Quevillon complied with the stipulation in said deed of lease in favour of said St. Denis respecting said option and that the said St. Denis did not exercise his rights of purchasing the property in question in this cause, although duly notified and put in default to do so by the said Quevillon.\nIt appears by the record that in July, 1908, Quevillon leased to St. Denis for a period of five years a store and dwelling; the lease was duly registered in the month of September following, and in the interval St. Denis entered into possession of the premises which were subsequently purchased (8th June, 1910) by the respondent Payette.\nThe lease contains this clause:\u2014\nLe locataire aura droit de prendre possession des dits magasin et logement au vingt de juillet courant, 1908. Et le dit locataire aura en outre le droit d\u2019acheter l\u2019immeuble ci-dessus lou\u00e9, comprenant les dits magasin, logement, \u00e9tal de boucher et d\u00e9pendances, en aucun temps pendant la dur\u00e9e du pr\u00e9sent bail, moyennant le prix de sept mille cinq cent piastres, dont trois mille piastres seront payables comptant et la balance par versements annuels de mille piastres, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de six pour cent, par an; et dans le cas o\u00f9 le dit bailleur d\u00e9sirerait vendre a quelque autre pour un prix quelconque, il devra en signifier l\u2019avis par \u00e9crit au dit locataire et donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce dernier.\nThe questions to be decided in this appeals are:\u2014 (1) What are the rights of the landlord and tenant respectively under this clause during the term of the lease; (2) what is the legal recourse of St. Denis in view of the sale to Payette?\nThe trial judge came to the conclusion that the intention of the parties was (1) to give the tenant St. Denis the right, at any time during the whole period of the lease, to purchase the property at $7,500; (2) to reserve to the landlord Quevillon the right to dispose of the property during the same period to any one and at any price, provided, however, notice in writing of the landlord\u2019s intention to avail himself of that right was given to the tenant, who was in that case entitled to take the property at the new price offered by any serious intending purchaser. The trial judge held also that the sale to Payette, having been deliberately entered into by both the parties to it, for the purpose of defeating the plaintiff\u2019s rights, should be set aside.\nI agree entirely with the learned trial judge in his appreciation of the evidence and his statement of the law.\nHaving carefully read the notes of Mr. Justice Cross in the court of appeal, I come to the conclusion that the main ground upon which the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed is that St. Denis, when notified of Quevillon\u2019s intention to sell, did not object more definitely and explicitly. The learned judge says, speaking of the time when Quevillon served notice of his intention to sell to Payette:\u2014\nI think that the plaintiff St. Denis should have objected more definitely and should have pressed his request for particulars then and there more explicitly. Instead of doing so, he remained inactive for over two years.\nWith all respect, it is impossible for me to agree that the appellant was under any obligation to take action upon the notice served upon him by Quevillon, or that his rights under the promise of sale were in any wise affected by that notice. By virtue of the promise of sale the appellant was entitled to buy the property at any time during the currency of the lease for the stipulated price of $7,500. (S.V., 60.1.849.) On the other hand, the respondent Quevillon reserved to himself the right to sell the same property at any time and for any price obtainable, but that right so reserved could only be exercised subject to notice to the appellant, who then was entitled to the preference, that is to say, to the right to purchase the property by preference on the same terms as the intending purchaser offered. To exercise this right it was, of course, necessary for the appellant to be informed not only of the price offered, but also of the name of the purchaser, that he might be in a position to judge of the bona fides of the offer (see Beaudant, page 224), otherwise the tenant could not intelligently exercise his right to purchase subject to which the landlord retained the right to sell notwithstanding the option contained in the first part of the clause. I gather from the notes of judgment that Mr. Justice Cross is also of opinion that a notice such as was required was not given. He says:\u2014\nIf Quevillon desired to sell to somebody else pending the option the covenant was that \u201cil devra en signifier un avis par \u00e9crit au dit locataire et donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce dernier.\u201d\nThe notice served called upon the plaintiff to sign a draft deed and intimated that if he did not comply, Quevillon would hold himself free to sell to another person, but it did not give the plaintiff a notice of the purport or terms of the sale desired to be made to another, as I think should have been done.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s testimony is to the effect that he asked who the intending offerer was.\nThe defendant Quevillon admits that his intention was not to disclose the term or terms of the contemplated sale to the plaintiff, and he did not do so.\nIf, as found by Mr. Justice Cross, the required notice was not given, I am with all respect, unable to understand how it can be said that Quevillon complied with the express condition subject to which he retained his right to sell and what steps St. Denis was obliged to take in order to protect his option, which had still about three years to run.\nComing now to the sale to Payette. Assuming in favour of the respondents that the clause in the lease is analogous to a \u201cpacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\u201d In ordinary circumstances the recourse of the appellant Payette would be limited to damages (Beaudant, Vente et Louage, p. 224). But the trial judge finds that Payette bound himself\nde maintenir les baux existants, en percevant les loyers, \u00e0 compter du premier juin aussi courant.\nWhen examined as a witness, he says that he was careful to take legal advice as to the meaning of the clause above quoted. Payette also knew, before he bought, of the difficulty which had arisen between Quevillon and St. Denis about the sale and that the latter was insisting upon his right to have the terms and conditions under which the sale was to be made before exercising his right under his deed. And finally Payette served a protest on the appellant from which I quote the three following clauses:\u2014\n(a) Qu\u2019en vertu d\u2019un bail par le dit F. X. Quevillon \u00e0 Paul Saint-Denis, devant Mtre J. H. A. Boh\u00e9mier, N.P. le 3 juillet, 1908; ce dernier Paul Saint-Denis est locataire et occupant de partie des lieux sus-mentionn\u00e9s, magasin No. 1580 et logement 1582 de la dite rue Saint-Hubert, et ce, pour le loyer et aux charges, clauses et consid\u00e9ration sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es au dit bail;\n(b) En cons\u00e9quence les requ\u00e9rants, notifient et signifient au dit Paul Saint-Denis de se conformer au dit bail et \u00e0 tout ce qui y est mentionn\u00e9, tel que loyer, etc., en faveur des dits H. et D. Payette, en leur payant tous les loyers \u00e9chus et \u00e0 \u00e9choir pour la dur\u00e9e d\u2019icelui.\nQu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le dit Paul Saint-Denis d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ce que mentionn\u00e9 aux dits actes en leur faveur, les requ\u00e9rants prendront contre lui tous proc\u00e9d\u00e9s l\u00e9gaux et de droit pour l\u2019y contraindre et le tiennent responsable imm\u00e9diatement de to us frais, perte, d\u00e9pens, dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats soufferts et \u00e0 souffrir et du co\u00fbt des pr\u00e9sentes, copie et signification. Pour que le dit Paul Saint-Denis ne puisse plaider ignorance, je, dit notaire, lui ai signifi\u00e9 une copie de l\u2019acte de vente suscit\u00e9 et des pr\u00e9sentes en parlant comme susdit.\nWhat could be the object or the meaning of this protest if not to notify the tenant that he was thereafter to deal with his new landlord on the same footing as with the old and to warn him that the \u201ccharges, clauses et consid\u00e9rations sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es\u201d in his lease were to be considered as still binding upon both parties?\nI was much impressed by the argument that the provision in the deed by Quevillon to Payette above referred to was merely to give effect to article 1663, C.C., but after much consideration I cannot escape from the conviction that in the protest served by Payette on St. Denis the former construed his deed of sale to mean that he, Payette, acquired all the rights and assumed all the obligations of his vendor Quevillon towards St. Denis, not only as landlord, but also as owner of the property.\nThe authorities referred to by the learned trial judge are conclusive in support of his judgment granting rescission on the ground of collusion. Alambert v.Reynal[2]; Dal. 1903, 2, 41 (vide note); Dal. 1903, 1, 38.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was lessee of certain property owned by the respondent Quevillon. By the terms of the lease appellant was given an option of purchase at a price named, during the entire term of the lease and a further option, as some put it, but as others contend in modification of said option, that in case the lessor should desire to sell to someone else for any price whatever that he must notify in writing the appellant lessee, and give the preference to the latter.\nWe have heard many diverse attempts in argument to put a construction upon the terms of this clause. Some of these attempts seemed to me to begin with adopting that which might best fit the legal consequences sought to be reached by him arguing.\nI think we should, rather than beginning thus, begin by attempting to realize what the parties, in a business-like common-sense way, probably desired to accomplish and let the legal consequences be ascertained after so determining the realization of the actual purpose in hand when framing a somewhat ambiguously worded contract. If there were surrounding circumstances which might have helped they have not been brought much in evidence by those concerned.\nI think in default thereof we are safe in assuming that the parties were rational business people who were fair-minded enough at that stage, whatever they may have become since, to try to arrange to give such advantages to the lessee as would be likely to induce him to give the best renting terms he could, in light of such advantages, afford to the advantage of the lessor. And on the other hand the lessor would desire whilst giving the option hot to be tied down thereto for five years if during that term he should find a purchaser. It was agreed accordingly in such case that the lessee should be notified of any such proposal and given his alternative option. That no doubt was fair and a very common way, and common sense way, of dealing with such a problem and I think the document should be construed accordingly.\nIf the respondent had acted thereupon in the way I have no doubt intended originally, he would have informed the appellant of the offer he had got and its terms and possibly as evidence of, or means of shewing, good faith the name of the purchaser also.\nThe latter, however, need not have to be pressed for, unless the terms are such as to arouse some suspicion, and it was not.\nA full knowledge of the terms, however, was pressed for and refused. That part of the contract having been so broken could not affect the first option and hence that stood. Had it been honestly observed and the terms of the alleged, purchase disclosed and the chance given appellant to accept them or reject them then the lessee would have been driven to act. If he accepted in such case the matter of purchase was closed. If he in such event had rejected such terms then I think the respondent, Quevillon, would have been quite within his rights in making the sale and the first option might have ended.\nI have no hesitation in accepting the version of appellant as to what transpired when he sought to learn the terms. The sort of contradiction given thereto is quite as emphatic as a straightforward assent thereto. So far I have little trouble in dealing with this case.\nBefore coming to what arises out of mere local practice and mode of thought, in regard to which I speak with diffidence, there are to be considered one or two interesting questions.\nIs this contract a subject of registration? It has, as embodied in the lease which was duly registered, but by some error so as to omit an unimportant part of the land, been in fact registered.\nCould it if embodied in a separate instrument have been registered?\nIt seems to me that article 2085 of the Civil Code was only designed to force any one having a registrable deed to register it under pain of losing his priority even over another who has notice of the right conferred thereby unless he is claiming through an insolvent.\nAs fit was in fact registered the operation of this article seems automatically eliminated from any possible bearing upon the question of what effect notice or knowledge on the part of Payette might otherwise have had on his good faith.\nHence it seems to me Payette whether acting in face of a contract affecting real property, or in face of a mere personal right such as his counsel contends this alleged unilateral contract to have been, must be held to have acted in bad faith.\nIn the latter point of view I agree with the learned trial judge that Payette has as a result of his bad faith become bound to observe the obligation thus resting upon Quevillon.\nIt is to be observed that the article 2085, C.C., does not in terms protect such a purchaser except as against\nan unregistered right belonging to a third party and subject to registration. If as contended (of which I say nothing) this option was not the subject of registration then no protection exists for him acting in face of positive knowledge and he must abide by the general consequences attaching by law to such a course of conduct.\nIf on the other hand the unilateral contract is to be treated according to the authorities referred to in Mr. Justice Cross\u2019 judgment, at lower part of page 438 of the official report of this case in volume 23, Cour du Banc du Roi, then there can be no doubt of the matter.\nAnd I most respectfully submit that in view of what I have above set forth relative to the question of registration the learned judge\u2019s view of the effect of the registry system upon said opinions, which he cites, is not well founded.\nThere is another view occurs to me, not in conflict with what the same learned judge has later on presented, and that is that an option such as this in question in a lease and forming part of the bargain between the parties might well be considered accessory thereto and part of the leasing contract and consideration for the terms in way of rental and, hence, cannot be dissociated from the lease in the way sought to be done by counsel for respondent. It is quite clear to my mind that many a man would for the sake of obtaining such an option in his lease be willing to increase the rent beyond what he would otherwise give and may have done so in this very case. The case where a tenant, as often happens, desires to make improvements (which the lessor cannot afford) in the property, and does so relying upon his option in the lease, is one where pushing too far the doctrine of the option being merely unilateral and hence merely a personal obligation dissociated from the lease proper might in the consequences work much injustice. As this suggestion only occurs to myself and was not dealt with in argument by the able counsel representing the parties herein, I put it forward with much hesitation.\nYet I must say that when I come to consider the question of what meaning is to be attached to the language of the deed from Quevillon to Payette and the obligation therein to maintain the lease and of the protest following it relative thereto, I think such considerations are entitled to some weight.\nWhen people speak of a lease they usually mean all that exists therein and hardly ever think of severing all that is therein from that which in a narrow sense alone constitutes the lease.\nLooking to the matter in that way makes me the more inclined to adopt the view pressed by Mr. Lafleur that the vendee of Quevillon assumed as part of his obligation to maintain the lease, to observe the option therein as well as all else and thereby preserve his vendor from damages for breach of anything arising from the failure of said vendor to maintain his tenant in possession. It may be answered the law in such case does so in case of registration. Granted so; what then is the use of any covenant unless to cover any risk beyond the mere tenant\u2019s possession?\nHowever all this may be I think the construction I put upon the much discussed clause giving appellant the option renders it unnecessary to rely upon this part of appellant\u2019s contentions.\nIt is the different construction which the court of appeal has put upon the said clause that gives rise to any trouble. The other way of construing it which I adopt leads on the reasoning of Mr. Justice Cross to the same conclusion as the learned trial judge.\nIf anything in the objections of form of pleading and difficulty arising therefrom and practice I think they can be all overcome if necessary by amendment this court has the power and must observe the duty to make to render them conformable with the facts in order that justice be done.\nI should, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs here and below.\nDuff J.\u2014First as to the construction of the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. I think the lessor\u2019s right to sell was conditional upon his giving notice in writing to the lessee of the price at which he proposed to sell; and giving the lessee an opportunity to buy. Whether the lessee would be entitled to buy at the price mentioned in his option or at the price named by the lessor, or at the more favourable of the two is a question which I need not discuss. The answer to it is by no means obvious and I express no opinion on it. No notice was given and the sale was therefore a violation of the lessor\u2019s obligation; and admittedly on this construction the lessee is entitled to damages; but in the view taken by the majority of the court it is unnecessary to consider how much.\nIs the appellant entitled to enforce his option against Payette, the purchaser? He is not entitled to do so in my opinion. The lessee\u2019s right under the promise of sale is not a jus in re. It is a jus in personam ad jus in rem acquirendum. The lessor\u2019s obligation, therefore, does not (in the absence of special circumstances giving a right against the purchaser) bind the purchaser from him or the land in the hands of the purchaser.\nThen, is there just reason for enforcing the obligation against the respondent on the ground of bad faith? Of bad faith there is really no evidence, in the sense that the transaction was colourable. Bad faith in the sense of the English equity there was, the transfer, that is to say, was taken with full notice of the appellant\u2019s rights; but I have not found any authority for the proposition that, in the law of Quebec, to purchase property with the knowledge of the owner\u2019s obligation in personam to sell it to another\u2014 there being no jus in re vested in the person in whom the obligation inheres\u2014subjects the purchaser to a like obligation.\nA more important question is as to the effect of the registration of the lease. Has the registration the effect of making the obligation binding on the lands in the hands of a purchaser? Does it transform a jus in personam into a jus in re? The point to be determined is a question of strict law and that is whether or not the promisee\u2019s right is a droit r\u00e9el within the meaning of article 2082, C.C. It is not a droit r\u00e9el within the strict meaning of that term, that is to say, it is not a right in the thing or a right assertable generally against the world. I have examined the context fully (see articles 2089, 2098, 1601, 1663, 2128, 2102, 2106, 2016, 2168, C.C.) and I can see nothing justifying an interpretation inconsistent with this.\nAnglin J.\u2014There is no evidence in the record to sustain the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff parted with his interest in the lease in question and, therefore, has no status to maintain this action.\nIn the view I take it is not necessary to determine whether the option of purchase, which the lease gave to the lessee, was entirely independent of and unaffected by the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence which follows it. There is a great deal to be said in support of the position taken by Mr. Justice Lafontaine that it was and that no action by the lessor under the latter clause could effect his obligations or the lessee\u2019s rights under the earlier provision; and I am far from being convinced that his view is not correct. On the other hand, with great respect, I can find nothing to warrant the construction which its formal judgment shews was placed by the court of appeal on the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence itself, namely, that by it the lessor, on receipt of any offer of purchase which he Was willing to accept, was empowered to call upon his lessee to exercise at once his option to buy under the former clause, with the consequence that, if he should decline or neglect to do so and the lessor should accept the offer and carry out the sate, all the lessee\u2019s rights under the option would be extinguished. As I read the clause creating the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence whatever may have been its effect (if any) upon the rights of the lessee under his option, it entitled him to a preferential right during the term of the lease to purchase the property at whatever price and upon whatever terms the lessor might desire to sell it to any other person.\nIt is obvious that it was essential to the lessee\u2019s enjoyment of this right of preference that he should have been told the price and the terms which the lessor was prepared to accept from the other proposing purchaser. This information was refused him and he was notified that, although his lease had still more than three years to run, he must at once agree to buy the property under his option (which by its terms was to hold good until the termination of the lease), or forego all rights under it. Assuming, therefore, in favour of the lessor, that if proper notice had been given to enable the lessee to exercise his rights under the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence his refusal to purchase under it would have extinguished his option to buy at $7,500, such notice was not given, the lessee never had an opportunity to buy at the price and on the terms which the lessor accepted from the Payettes, and it follows that not only was the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence itself broken, but the lessee\u2019s rights under his option remained intact.\nI am, however, unable to agree with the learned trial judge that, notwithstanding the sale by the lessor to the Payettes and the, subsequent transfer from Didyme Payette to the defendant Henri Payette, the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance of his lessor\u2019s promise to sell and transfer the property in question to him. Until he signified acceptance of his lessors\u2019 offer to sell under the option, as Mr. Justice Lafontaine states, it gave him no interest in the land but merely a personal right against the lessor. I have not found in the Quebec registry law any provision for the registration of an unaccepted unilateral promise of sale or anything which would render a subsequent purchaser from the promisor liable to implement such a promise merely because it was included in a registered document, such as a lease, which contained other provisions susceptible of registration. With deference, I am unable to accept the view expressed by Mr. Justice Cross on this point.\nThe learned trial judge did not rest his judgment against the defendant Payette on this ground, but on his knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s option and fraudulent conspiracy on his part with his co-defendant to defeat it.\nBy the sale to the Payettes the lessor put it out of his power to fulfil his personal obligation to the plaintiff, and, although the Payettes took subject to the lease, I cannot find that they assumed Quevillon\u2019s obligation to sell to the plaintiff, which was not an ordinary covenant incident or accessory to a lease, but a substantive and independent contract. Fuzier-Hermann, Rep., vo., \u201cBail en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\u201d Nos.2354 and 2355; Guillouard, \u201cLouage,\u201d No. 361. On the contrary, the clear purpose of Quevillon and the Payettes was that the latter should obtain a title free from any claim of the plaintiffs. Quevillon guaranteed the Payettes against disturbance by St. Denis. Nor does it appear, as was alleged, that the Payettes were parties to a fraudulent conspiracy to deprive the plaintiff of a right which they knew he had to obtain the property. They appear to have acted in the belief, and on the assurance of Quevillon based on opinions of counsel, that he was entitled to determine all the rights of St. Denis, except his interest as lessee, by calling on him, as he did, forthwith to exercise his option to purchase. Notice of the clause in the lease under which St. Denis claims did not, I think, under these circumstances (if, indeed, it ever would) suffice to establish bad faith on the part of the Payettes such as the learned trial judge thinks would render them liable at the suit of St. Denis to carry out Quevillon\u2019s obligation to sell to him. Moreover, the deed to the Payettes was duly registered and the plaintiff has not asked to have it declared void or set aside.\nThen it is urged that by delaying for over two years after the sale to the Payettes before bringing action and paying them meantime the rental for the property under his lease, the plaintiff acquiesced in the sale to them and abandoned all rights under his option to purchase. He had, no doubt, an immediate right of action against Quevillon for his breach of the pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence by the sale to the Payettes. It may be that he could have treated that sale as a repudiation by Quevillon of the option as well and sued him thereupon for breach of his promise to sell. Rut the lease gave the plaintiff the right to exercise his option at any time during the term, and I do not think he can be charged with default or laches in asserting that right during its currency. Notwithstanding what he had done the lessor might re-acquire the property or otherwise put himself in a position to meet the exigency of the plaintiff\u2019s option. I cannot think that the lessee was bound to treat the sale as a repudiation and breach of the option and elect promptly to bring action or to abandon his rights. He was entitled to wait until it suited him (of course, within the term of the lease) to make his demand upon the lessor to implement his promise to sell and on failure to meet that demand to bring action for the breach then committed. I cannot understand on what basis the position can be maintained that the lessor\u2019s own wrongful act in selling, without giving his lessee the benefit of his pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence and in violation of the option, imposed upon the lessee an obligation to assert his rights under that option at a period earlier than the option itself required. The plaintiff certainly did nothing which amounted to a positive or direct renunciation of his rights, and, under the circumstances, there was, in my opinion, no delay on his part which implied an abandonment, or barred his assertion of them.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the appellant is entitled to succeed as against the defendant Quevillon for breach of his personal obligation, but that the recovery must be limited to damages. There is no material in the record, however, to enable us to determine the quantum of the damages which should be awarded. Unless the parties can agree upon the amount for which judgment should be entered for the plaintiff, the action must be remitted to the Superior Court for the assessment of his damages.\nThe appellant should have his costs throughout as against the defendant Quevillon. Under all the circumstances, while the appeal against the Payettes must be dismissed, I think it should be without costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action en passation de titre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la cour sup\u00e9rieure et renvoy\u00e9e par la cour d\u2019appel.\nLe demandeur appelle de ce dernier jugement.\nLes circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette poursuite sont les suivantes.\nLe 3 juillet, 1908, l\u2019intim\u00e9, Quevillon, a lou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant St. Denis une certaine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour cinq ans. Le bail contenait la clause suivante, qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige:\u2014\nEt le dit locataire aura en outre le droit d\u2019acheter l\u2019immeuble ci-dessus lou\u00e9 * * * en aucun temps pendant la dur\u00e9e du pr\u00e9sent bail moyennant le prix de $7,500, dont $3,000 seront payables comptant et la balance par versements annuels de mille piastres, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de six pour cent par an; et dans le cas o\u00f9 le dit bailleur d\u00e9sirerait vendre \u00e0 quelque autre pour un prix quelconque, il devra en signifier un avis par \u00e9crit au dit locataire, et donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce dernier.\nCe bail fut enregistr\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe 28 mai, 1910, le locateur, Quevillon, fit signifier un prot\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et le mit en demeure d\u2019acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant la promesse de vente contenue au bail pour le prix de sept mille cinq piastres, et, qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par lui de ce faire, il d\u00e9clarait qu\u2019il vendrait alors aux conditions qu\u2019il jugerait \u00e0 propos.\nIl ne d\u00e9non\u00e7a pas dans ce prot\u00eat les conditions auxquelles il disposerait de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe 8 juin, 1910, Quevillon, l\u2019intim\u00e9, vendit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Payette pour la somme de $7,925, dont $500 comptant et la balance qui \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e payable au vendeur devait \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9e par versements de $400 par ann\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en outre dans l\u2019acte de vente entre Quevillon et Payette que ce dernier maintiendrait les baux existants.\nLe demandeur a, le 22 novembre, 1912, institu\u00e9 son action en passation de titre qu\u2019il a dirig\u00e9e et contre Quevillon et contre Payette, en all\u00e9guant qu\u2019ils s\u2019\u00e9taient concert\u00e9s ensemble pour le priver de ses droits.\nIl pr\u00e9tend que la promesse de vente a toujours continu\u00e9 de subsister malgr\u00e9 la vente faite \u00e0 Payette, que ce dernier, en s\u2019engageant de maintenir le bail, a assum\u00e9 la promesse de vente qui y \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs pr\u00e9tendent, au contraire, que le d\u00e9faut par St. Denis d\u2019exercer sa promesse de vente a mis fin \u00e0 son droit, que le demandeur \u00e9tait libre de vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Payette et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de lui d\u00e9noncer les clauses auxquelles il vendait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Payette.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par la cour d\u2019appel.\nCette clause du contrat stipulant promesse de vente et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence est loin d\u2019\u00eatre claire et peut donner lieu \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes interpr\u00e9tations.\nApr\u00e8s avoir m\u00fbrement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le contrat et les circonstances \u00e9tablies par la preuve, j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le contrat pourvoit \u00e0 une promesse de vente unilat\u00e9rale et \u00e0 un pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui doivent cependant s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019un par l\u2019autre. Nous avons d\u2019abord le locateur qui promet \u00e0 son locataire de lui vendre pendant la dur\u00e9e du bail la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e moyennant le prix de $7,500. Mais en m\u00eame temps cette obligation de sa part se trouverait \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre au cas o\u00f9 il trouverait un acheteur pour sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et alors il ne pourrait en disposer qu\u2019en donnant la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son locataire.\nVoil\u00e0 pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat. Maintenant Quevillon a-t-il rempli ses obligations?\nJe consid\u00e8re que la mise en demeure qu\u2019il a faite \u00e0 St. Denis \u00e9tait insuffisante. Il aurait d\u00fb lui d\u00e9noncer les conditions auxquelles il vendait \u00e0 Payette, le prix, les termes de paiement, enfin toutes les conditions de la vente. Mais Quevillon ne s\u2019est pas soumis \u00e0 cette obligation. Comme je le disais tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure, il a simplement demand\u00e9 par son prot\u00eat \u00e0 St. Denis d\u2019acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux conditions contenues dans le bail.\nQuevillon a donc engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9. Il nous reste \u00e0 savoir si le demandeur avait droit \u00e0 une action en passation de titre et de se faire mettre en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, on bien s\u2019il n\u2019avait droit qu\u2019\u00e0 des dommages.\nLes intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tant pass\u00e9e entre les mains d\u2019un tiers, le demandeur n\u2019aurait pas le droit de revendiquer.\nJe consid\u00e8re que le concert frauduleux du promettant vendeur et du tiers acqu\u00e9reur et l\u2019obligation du tiers acqu\u00e9reur de maintenir le bail m\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer comme bien fond\u00e9e l\u2019action en revendication.\nSur l\u2019effet de l\u2019enregistrement d\u2019une promesse de vente, l\u2019honorable Juge Lafontaine, en cour sup\u00e9rieure, d\u00e9clare formellement dans son jugement qu\u2019une promesse unilat\u00e9rale de vente, sans promesse r\u00e9ciproque d\u2019acheter, de m\u00eame que la promesse de pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ne conf\u00e8rent aucun droit r\u00e9el et que, lorsque le promettant vendeur a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire, le recours que le promettant acheteur peut avoir est un recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nLa cour d\u2019appel, sur ce point, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, au contraire, que:\u2014\n1. Un acte enregistr\u00e9 qui affecte un immeuble, tel qu\u2019une promesse de vente ou option d\u2019acheter, peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers acheteur qui a un titre subs\u00e9quent \u00e0 cet enregistrement, nos lois d\u2019enregistrement n\u2019\u00e9tant pas limit\u00e9es dans leurs effets au contrat translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou aux droits susceptibles d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques.\nJe serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire avec la cour d\u2019appel que tout droit dans une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant soit d\u2019une promesse de vente, soit d\u2019un autre contrat, est un droit r\u00e9el et susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 et je citerais \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette opinion Dalloz, \u201cBiens,\u201d No. 151.\nLa loi ne dit pas qu\u2019il n\u2019y a que les contrats synallagmatiques, ou bilat\u00e9raux, qui soient susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre enregistr\u00e9s; mais tout acte qui est de nature \u00e0 affecter une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer un droit r\u00e9el sur l\u2019immeuble peut donner lieu \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement. (Aubry & Rau, vol. 2, \u00a7 209, note 1; Mourlon, Revue Pratique, vol. 2, p. 193, note 39.)\nIl nie semble que la promesse de vente et la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Dans la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 comme dans la promesse de vente le cr\u00e9ancier de l\u2019obligation n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019en demander l\u2019execution. Il n\u2019y a aucune obligation de sa part d\u2019acheter. Cependant si la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e, l\u2019acheteur ne pourra pas disposer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; (art. 2102, C.C.).\nMais il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour moi de disposer de cette question d\u2019enregistrement, vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en suis venu sur les deux autres points de la cause.\nJe consid\u00e8re en effet que le concert frauduleux qui s\u2019est fait entre Quevillon et Payette et l\u2019obligation assum\u00e9e par Payette de maintenir le bail engagent la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce dernier et le forcent \u00e0 donner suite \u00e0 la promesse de vente contenue dans le bail.\nDans une cause analogue \u00e0 celle-ci, la cour de cassation, en France, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 (Dalloz, 1903-1-38) que l\u2019on peut annuler la vente faite au m\u00e9pris d\u2019un pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence et condamner le tiers acqu\u00e9reur \u00e0 la restitution de la chose s\u2019il est constat\u00e9 en fait que le tiers acqu\u00e9reur subrog\u00e9 par son titre aux droits et obligations r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un bail a connu l\u2019existence de ce droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence et l\u2019intention du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019en profiter.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause nous avons une promesse de vente stipul\u00e9e en faveur de l\u2019appelant par l\u2019intim\u00e9 Quevillon dans le bail qu\u2019il lui a fait de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question. Cette promesse de vente, enregistr\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9tait connue au d\u00e9fendeur Payette.\nLa preuve d\u00e9montre, ainsi que le d\u00e9cide le juge instructeur, que Payette et Quevillon s\u2019\u00e9taient concert\u00e9s pour la faire \u00e9chouer. Dans ce cas il n\u2019est pas douteux que le tiers acqu\u00e9reur devient oblig\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis du titulaire.\nDe plus, Payette, en s\u2019obligeant de maintenir les baux existants sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, est devenu substitu\u00e9 aux droits et obligations de Quevillon lui-m\u00eame. Il s\u2019est contractuellement substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qui pesait sur son vendeur et il est tenu comme l\u2019\u00e9tait celui-ci.\nLe titulaire de la promesse est donc en droit d\u2019intenter contre le tiers acqu\u00e9reur l\u2019action r\u00e9elle en d\u00e9livrance de la chose d\u00e9rivant du contrat qui les lie d\u00e9sormais et de provoquer en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019annulation de la vente qui lui fait grief. Dalloz, 1885-2-259.\nEt m\u00eame au cas o\u00f9 le tiers acqu\u00e9reur n\u2019aurait pas pris vis-\u00e0-vis de son vendeur l\u2019engagement de subir la r\u00e9alisation de la promesse de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, s\u2019il s\u2019est concert\u00e9 avec le vendeur pour d\u00e9poss\u00e9der le titulaire du pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ce dernier pourrait tout de m\u00eame provoquer la nullit\u00e9 de la vente comme faite en fraude de ses droits. Dalloz 1849-2-46.\nMais on dit que dans le cas actuel Payette en s\u2019obligeant de maintenir le bail n\u2019a pas entendu par l\u00e0 assumer des obligations \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux rapports entre locateur et locataire. Pothier, \u201cLouage,\u201d No. 299, dit:\u2014\nLorsque celui \u00e0 qui j\u2019ai succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 titre singulier \u00e0 un h\u00e9ritage m\u2019a charge de l\u2019entretien du bail * * * il est cens\u00e9 * * * m\u2019en avoir aussi c\u00e9d\u00e9 tous les droits et actions. Et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la cour de Dijon que l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019un immeuble est oblig\u00e9 de respecter non-seulement le bail proprement dit mais les conventions qui y sont jointes et forment avec lui un tout indivisible. Sirey 1875-2-33.\nDans cette cause, jug\u00e9e par la cour de Dijon, le locateur s\u2019\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de fournir une mati\u00e8re premi\u00e8re pour l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une usine que le locataire devait installer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e. Il vendit plus tard la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre personne avec obligation de maintenir le bail et la cour sa d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ce nouveau propri\u00e9taire \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 non-seulement de respecter le bail proprement dit mais les conventions qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jointes.\nIl est vrai que cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 par Guillouard et Fuzier-Herman. Il me semble cependant que le fait pour un tiers acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019assumer les obligations d\u2019un bail doit couvrir tout ce qui y est mentionn\u00e9, car autrement les stipulations en faveur du locataire et pour lesquelles il est cens\u00e9 avoir donn\u00e9 consid\u00e9ration se trouveraient annul\u00e9es.\nDans la cause d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la cour de cassation et qui est rapport\u00e9e dans Dalloz, 1903-1-38, les tribunaux ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le tiers acqu\u00e9reur \u00e9tait suppos\u00e9 assumer toutes les obligations contract\u00e9es par son vendeur dans le bail.\nCette d\u00e9cision de la cour de cassation confirme par cons\u00e9quent la position prise par la cour de Dijon en 1875.\nJe consid\u00e8re que dans ces circonstances le demandeur avait le droit d\u2019instituer son action en passation de titre, que le jugement qui a renvoy\u00e9 cette action doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 et que le dispositif du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Genest, Billette & Plimsol.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Robillard, Julien, T\u00e9treau & Marin.\n[1] Q.R. 23 K.B. 436.\n[2] D. 85.2.259.\n",

Bedard, (1915) 51 S.C.R. 629\nDate: 1915-05-18\nPrevost v. Bedard.\n1915: May 10; 1915: May 18.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nPractice\u2014Recalling judgment\u2014Defect\u2014Correction of omission\u2014 Amendment of pleadings\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Costs\u2014Settlement of minutes.\nWhere by an accidental slip or oversight the formal judgment on an appeal failed to express the clear intention of the court that certain amendments in the pleadings should be allowed for the purpose of effective relief to the successful party the Supreme Court of Canada, on application subsequent to the transmission of the formal judgment to the court below, ordered that its judgment should be varied by inserting therein a direction that the judgment appealed from and the plaintiff\u2019s declaration should be varied so as to correct the inadequate description of certain lands therein mentioned. Rattray v. Young (Cout. Dig. 1123), and Penrose v. Knight (Cout. Dig. 1122), referred to Idington and Duff JJ. dissented from this order.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The judgment that the court in fact pronounced, and intended to pronounce, was simply that the appeal should be dismissed; such judgment does not involve any consequences whatever in respect of the amendment of the judgment or pleadings in the court of original jurisdiction. The power of the court to amend a judgment after it has become a record of the court is specially limited to making the record conform to the judgment pronounced or intended to be pronounced; it does not authorize the recalling of the judgment in order to deal with a collateral matter not actually or constructively involved in the court\u2019s decision. The proper course was to apply to the court of original jurisdiction for an amendment of the record of that court.\nThe application was allowed only upon payment of costs thereof by the party moving inasmuch as it had been his duty to have seen that the provision was inserted at the time of the settlement of the minutes of judgment.\nAPPLICATION, by motion on behalf of the respondent, for an order varying the formal judgment transmitted to the court below, upon the dismissal of the appeal in this cause[1], by correcting an omission therein.\nThe formal judgment issued and certified to the court below, upon the dismissal of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada failed to provide for a formal amendment of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration (which had been asked for) by supplying a reference to the cadastral number of the lot of land in respect of which the action had been brought, according to the official plan of subdivision of the lands of which it formed part. The formal judgment had been regularly transmitted to the proper officer of the court appealed from before the omission was discovered and the object of the application was to have this defect cured.\nSt. Germain K.C. supported the motion.\nLamarche K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice agreed in the judgment allowing the motion.\nIdington J. dissented from the judgment allowing the motion.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Review, in Quebec dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court in an action brought by the respondent for a declaration that he was the owner of a certain property which his auteur of certain land had professed by notarial deed to convey to the Ph\u0153nix Land Co. The appellant is curator of that company which is now in process of winding up. The appeal was dismissed and the judgment of the court dismissing the appeal was settled and entered and certified by the registrar in the usual way to the proper officer of the court of original jurisdiction.\nIt now appears that the lands which were the subject matter of the action were inadequately described in the respondent\u2019s declaration and that in consequence the respondent cannot obtain effective registration of his title; and an application is made for an order amending the judgment of this court by directing an amendment of the declaration and the judgment of the Superior Court in order to cure this defect.\nI should have thought that in the circumstances the respondents would have pursued the course of applying to the Superior Court for an order amending its judgment. The status of that judgment as a judgment of the Superior Court could not be and was not altered or affected by the appeal to this court which was simply dismissed. And I should have supposed it not open to doubt that the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec must possess authority to correct errors in the record of one of its judgments to whatever extent it might be necessary to do so for the purpose of making the record conform to the judgment which the court obviously intended to pronounce.\nThis court has power, under section 54 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d to make all such amendments in the pleadings as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the question in controversy between the parties, but the power conferred by section 54 can only be exercised, by the express terms of the section itself, during the pendency of the appeal; and that section alone is obviously not sufficient to justify the order asked for at this time after the appeal has been brought to an end by the simple dismissal of it.\nIn England the courts, including the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at common law possess authority, to quote the language of Romer J., in Ainsworth v. Wilding[2], to make the amendment:\u2014\n(1) Where there has been an accidental slip in the judgment as drawn up in which case the court has power to rectify it under Order XXVIII., Rule 11; (2) when the court itself finds that the judgment as drawn up does not correctly state what the court actually decided and intended.\nRomer J. is here specifically dealing with the power of the High Court of Justice and he naturally, for the first case, referred to the specific rule\u2014the \u201cslip order,\u201d as it is known. But the decision of the Judicial Committee in Milson v. Carter[3], is authority for the proposition that this power is one of the inherent powers of a court of record notwithstanding the absence of any specific rule; that the rule is simply declaratory of the common law. At page 640, Lord Hobhouse says their Lordships do not doubt that the court has power at any time to correct \u201can error\u201d in a degree or order arising from a \u201cslip or accidental omission\u201d whether there is or is not a general order to that effect.\nI have come to the conclusion that the power does not extend to the circumstances of this case. The application for amendment was in point of fact mentioned during the argument. But in fact it cannot be said that when the court gave judgment it had any intention in relation to this application or that the amendment was in any way necessary to give effect to the judgment of the court. It was a collateral matter which a court might or might not have thought it right to deal with.\nIt is desirable I think to add a word or two as to the limits of this jurisdiction because my impression is that some misapprehension prevails upon the subject.\nThe whole matter is summed up in the following sentence taken from the judgment of Lord Watson in Hatton v. Harris[4]:\u2014\nWhen an error of that kind has been committed, it is always within the competency of the court, if nothing has intervened which would render it inexpedient or inequitable to do so, to correct the record in order to bring it into harmony with the order which the judge obviously meant to pronounce.\nThat is the limit of the jurisdiction of this court in such cases. Once the judgment has been passed and entered once it has become a record the appeal transit in rem judicatam; and the court has no power to re-open it for the purpose of passing upon points which were not actually or constructively involved in the judgment pronounced or intended to be pronounced.\nThere is not the least reason for relaxing this rule, which is no mere rule of practice, but a rule of high policy for the protection of litigants; there must some time be an end of litigation. The practice of this court is liberal to a fault in hearing parties with respect not only to the frame of the judgment, but with respect to the topics not dealt with in the judgment up to the time when the judgment has been passed and entered; and it would be a distinct violation of the rule to grant the present application.\nAnglin J.\u2014The respondent moves to amend the judgment of this court as issued on the ground that it fails to provide for a formal amendment of the declaration and of the judgment based upon it pronounced by the Superior Court. By an accidental slip or oversight the declaration omitted a reference to the cadastral number of the subdivided official lot which covered the property in respect of which the plaintiff brought his petitory action. The judgment of the Superior Court in this respect followed the declaration and in this court an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review affirming it was dismissed. At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the respondent directed attention to the mistake and asked that the judgment of this court should provide for the necessary amendment. That the amendment would be made if the respondent should be successful would appear to have been taken as a matter of course, and that probably accounts for the fact that in disposing of the case on the merits the judges omitted to mention the amendment. The matter also appears to have escaped the attention of the solicitors in issuing the certificate of judgment and the omission was not discovered until after the formal certificate had been transmitted to the provincial courts.\nIn Rattray v. Young[5], this court appears to have held that it has jurisdiction after its formal judgment has been issued to recall it for the purpose of amending errors or omissions in it due to oversight or mistake\u2014the same power which is exercised by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England under O. 28, R. 11. Similar jurisdiction was exercised in Penrose v. Knight[6].\nIn E. v. E.[7], the President of the Probate Division directed the amendment of the judgment of that court by providing for the date from which certain payments ordered were to run. This date had been inadvertently omitted in delivering the opinion of the court. Exercising similar jurisdiction the Master of the Rolls in Ireland, where the plaintiff through an error of account in the notice of motion had obtained a judgment for less than he was entitled to, directed the necessary amendment to be made. McCaughey v. Stringer[8]. Of course this jurisdiction is distinct from the inherent power which the court possesses to correct its formal judgment when it finds that as drawn up it does not correctly state what the court actually directed and intended. There can be no doubt that the omission to provide in the judgment for the amendment was due to an accidental slip or oversight. Had the request and necessity for it been present to the minds of the judges when delivering judgment it would certainly have been directed. In delivering its judgment dismissing the appeal, the purpose of the court clearly was that the respondent should have an effective judgment for the relief which he sought. That intention might be defeated if the court were powerless to grant the amendment now asked. Under these circumstances I am of the opinion that the motion should be granted, but only upon payment of the costs of it by the respondent as he should have seen that the amendment was provided for in the judgment of the court as issued, and should, if necessary, have spoken to the minutes of judgment for that purpose.

(Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra.)\nIn his letter accepting the offer of sale, the purchaser requested the vendor to send to his notary the documents of title and the registrar\u2019s certified abstract of the deeds affecting the property.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. that this request did not intend the stipulation of a new term to the contract.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014Although the vendor is obliged to furnish the documents of title, including the registrar\u2019s certified abstract, yet, in the present case, as it appeared that the vendor made it a condition that the titles and certificate were not to be delivered into the possession of the purchaser the request in the letter of acceptance was a stipulation of a new term which left the contract incomplete. La Banque Ville Marie v. Kent (Q.R. 22 S.C. 162), and Sauv\u00e9 v. Picard (20 Rev. de Jur. 142) referred to.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 23 K.B. 495) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review[2], and restoring the judgment of Demers J. at the trial, in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the action of the plaintiff, respondent, was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judments now reported.\nSt. Germain K.C. and C. A. Archambault for the appellant.\nSt. Jacques for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe sale was complete when the respondent accepted the offer of Mr. Archambault, the vendor. There was no doubt left as to the thing (chose) which the vendor offered to sell nor as to the price at which he was prepared to sell it. Once the appellant agreed to give the property at the price fixed, nothing was left to uncertainty, the obligation to pay the purchase price was then absolute.\nIt may be that when the vendor seeks to collect the second half of the purchase price a question may arise as to the time at which it becomes payable. In my view, nothing turns on that now. This action was brought merely to get a deed evidencing the sale which was complete and produced all its effects from the moment the vendor agreed to give his property and the vendee obliged himself to take it at the stipulated price. (Art. 1472, C.C.; S. V., 87.1.167.)\nNo question was ever raised during the lifetime of the vendor, Archambault, now represented by the appellant, as to the conditions subject to which the purchase price was to be paid. Considerable negotiations took place between the parties after the contract was entered into. But the sole dispute between them turned exclusively upon the right of the purchaser to insist upon the production of the vendor\u2019s title deeds and the registrar\u2019s certificate. The vendor\u2019s position then was that there was a concluded agreement, a completed sale, between him and the respondent here. The language which he uses, invariably is \u201cqu\u2019il s\u2019en tenait \u00e0 la lettre stricte de son contrat\u201d (see pro test exchanged between the parties and fyled in the case). In his pleadings the appellant says:\u2014\nLe d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9clara alors au demandeur qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de certificats du bureau d\u2019enregistrement ni de titres a produire, except\u00e9 son propre titre d\u2019achat, (lequel se trouvait le et d\u00e8s avant le 29 octobre, 1910, en possession du notaire Olivier, mais que le dit notaire a alors pass\u00e9 au d\u00e9fendeur qui l\u2019avait en sa possession lors de sa rencontre susdite avec le demandeur) et le d\u00e9fendeur lui r\u00e9itera, comme dernier mot, qu\u2019il s\u2019en tenait \u00e0 la lettre stricte de son \u00e9crit du 27 octobre, 1910, que son \u00e9crit \u00e9tait son contrat; qu\u2019en dehors de son \u00e9crit il n\u2019y avait rien \u00e0 faire, et sur ce, les dits pourparlers de vente entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur prirent fin.\nAnd he repeats the same thing again here. One witness only was examined on behalf of the respondent, plaintiff below, and his evidence is to the same effect.\nThere does not seem to have been any doubt as to this in the minds of the judges below, as appears by the observations of Mr. Justice Tellier in the Court of Review.\nIt is true, as found by the trial judge, that Guillouiard and Duvergier would seem to make the condition of payment of the price of sale a condition of the sale itself, but it is to be noticed here that all the conditions with respect to the purchase price and to the terms of payment were settled except as to the time at which the second instalment would become due and exigible. As I said before, I do not consider this question arises on this record, but if it did, I quite agree with the judges in Bartley v. Breakey[3], where they say that the court would have, in a case like this, the power to fix the delay for payment. To the same effect, Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 19, page 540, No. 499; Aubry & Rau, vol. 4, paragraph 303, page 87. Reference may possibly be made to Dalloz 82,2,177, and to the note. I would draw special attention to the second \u201cconsid\u00e9rant\u201d of that judgment which explains why it was there held that the sale was not perfect. On this point see also Duranton, vol. 16, No. 107 his; 17 Laurent, No. 59 in fine.\nA question was raised as to the effect of the last paragraph in the writing accepting the offer of sale. \u201cFaites venir vos titres et certificat chez mon notaire.\u201d Do these words qualify the acceptance; I do not think so. The vendee bound himself absolutely in the first paragraph to buy on the terms contained in the offer and the words above quoted constituted merely a request for information as to the title and not a condition subject to which the offer was accepted. As admitted by the Court of Review, the letter of acceptance contained two distinct, separate and separable things; first, an acceptance pure and simple of the offer; secondly, a request which had reference not to the sale which was complete when the offeree expressed his intention to accept (arts. 1472 and 1025, C.C.), but to the obligation to deliver which follows on the completion of the contract of sale. I do not think there can be any doubt that the obligation to deliver the thing sold includes its accessories, (art. 1492 C.C.; Pothier, Vente, No. 47):\u2014\nLes titres et tous les enseignements qui concernent un h\u00e9ritage, en sont des accessoires que le vendeur est oblig\u00e9 de remettre \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur.\nSee also authorities in Revue Legale, N.S. Vol. 1, pages 322, 323, 324, 325, 326; Banque Ville-Marie v. Kent[4].\nOn the \u2018assumption that the vendor brought suit, could the vendee escape on the ground that having accepted the offer absolutely he asked for something in addition which the vendor might or might not be obliged to give? I think not. All the circumstances were fully and carefully considered by the trial judge and I agree in his conclusions which have the approval of the court of appeal.\nI understand that the opinion of some of my colleagues is that the sale was not complete because, although the purchase price was fixed, by an inadvertent omission the time at which the second instalment of that purchase price was made payable was not stated in the deed. I find comfort in the thought that all the judges below who heard this case agree that this objection is without substance.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The principal question is whether there was a concluded agreement of sale. I think the agreement was incomplete. The date of payment of the second instalment does not appear and I think that was an essential term. There does not appear to be any rule supplied by the general law where the parties agree that time shall be given, but do not specify what the time is to be. Where nothing is said as to the date of payment the law may imply a term that payment shall be made in cash or that it shall (be within a delay necessitated by the circumstances where the circumstances enable the court to fix the necessary delay. The implications in both cases rest upon the presumed intentions of the parties. There are no circumstances here from which the intentions of the parties can be presumed or inferred in respect of the date of payment. The respondent\u2019s suggestion necessarily involves the hypothesis that the parties had no common intention on the point except that the court should make a bargain between them in the event of their failing to agree. I think that is an inadmissible hypothesis.\nMoreover, it is not the function of the courts to complete incomplete juridical acts, but to interpret and to give effect to complete juridical acts according to law.\nIn construing the offer we must give it the meaning which a person of reasonable knowledge of business would expect it would convey to another person having like knowledge. I think any business man reading the offer in question would conclude either that the failure to mention the time of the payment of the second instalment was an oversight or that the point was to be left to further negotiations. And reading the offer and the acceptance together I have no doubt that a reasonable construction of them is that the question of this date was left to be settled and inserted in the formal deed of sale.\nThe evidence given by the notary, Olivier, to the effect that a period of two years was agreed upon cannot in my judgment be safely acted upon for these reasons: Neither the learned trial judge nor the court of appeal has accepted the evidence. There is no mention of the conversation in the protest; and the draft deed prepared by the notary leaves the matter at large. Add to that the fact that the notary was the real party in interest\u2014a fact that he concealed from Archambault\u2014and it seems clear that his uncorroborated evidence ought not to be accepted, on this point the evidence of Mr. Archambault being no longer available.\nAs to the reference in the protest to the strict letter of the offer, I do not think any inference can be built upon it because it is obvious that the point then under discussion was not the question of the terms of payment, and I think the expression must be taken only to refer to the subject matter of the discussion.\nAnglin J.\u2014If this case fell to be disposed of under English law I should be prepared to allow this appeal on the ground taken by my brother Duff. But after devoting a great deal of time to the question I remain in doubt whether under the law of the Province of Quebec the failure of the parties to fix a date for the payment of the second half of the purchase money renders the contract alleged by the plaintiff incomplete and ineffective. The weight of the authorities to which I have had access rather favours the view that it does not. On the other branch of the case I entertain no doubt that in making his request that documents of title should be sent to his notary the respondent did not and did not intend to stipulate for that as a term of the contract.\nBrodeur J. (dissident).\u2014Pour qu\u2019un contrat de vente puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme conclu il faut que les parties contractantes s\u2019entendent sur la chose et sur le prix. Ce sont l\u00e0 deux conditions essentielles sans lesquelles il ne saurait y avoir de convention.\nIl peut y avoir aussi d\u2019autres conditions que Pline ou l\u2019autre des parties peut stipuler et qui seraient de nature \u00e0 restreindre les obligations et les droits respectifs du vendeur ou de l\u2019acheteur. Ces derni\u00e8res conditions ne sont pas essentielles; mais, cependant, si l\u2019une des parties ne veut pas s\u2019engager sans que ces conditions ne soient accept\u00e9es par l\u2019autre, alors il n\u2019y a pas de convention tant qu\u2019elles ne se sont pas entendues sur ces clauses additionnelles.\nDans le cas actuel, les parties paraissent \u00eatre tomb\u00e9es d\u2019accord sur la chose. Quant au prix il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu\u2019une partie du prix de vente serait payable \u00e0 terme, mais on a omis de stipuler quand elle serait payable. Serait-ce dans un an, dans deux ans ou dans cinq ans, leurs \u00e9crits n\u2019indiquent aucune date.\nDans les cas ordinaires je crois que cette absence de stipulation devrait nous faire consid\u00e9rer que la vente n\u2019est pas parfaite parce que les parties ne se seraient pas entendues sur ce point.\nLa loi nous dit bien (art, 1533, C.C.) que si le temps du paiement n\u2019est pas fix\u00e9 par la convention l\u2019acheteur doit payer au temps de la livraison de la chose. Mais dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties ont stipul\u00e9 un terme, alors l\u2019article 1533 ne s\u2019applique pas. Ce terme alors doit faire l\u2019objet de nouvelles n\u00e9gociations. La vente reste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de projet tant que ce point n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de solution par un accord intervenu sur ce point: Dalloz, 1882-2-177; Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol. 19, No. 24.\nDans cette cause-ci, ce point, quoique soulev\u00e9e par le r\u00e9put\u00e9 vendeur, M. Archambault, dans son prot\u00eat du 3 novembre, 1910, n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une all\u00e9gation sp\u00e9cifique de son plaidoyer et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019argument qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9. Il perd, dans ces circonstances, beaucoup de sa force; car il est toujours dangereux de d\u00e9cider une cause sur des faits qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019action, dans la d\u00e9fense, ou dans les autres pi\u00e8ces de plaidoiries.\nMais dans cette cause-ci j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion \u00e9galement qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de convention qui donn\u00e2t lieu \u00e0 Faction en passation de titre parce que les parties ne se sont pas entendues sur un point accessoire, savoir l\u2019obligation pour le vendeur de fournir des titres et des certificats de recherche.\nVoici en effet ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9.\nLe 27 octobre, 1910, Archambault \u00e9crivait \u00e0 Poirier la lettre suivante:\u2014\nMontr\u00e9al, 27 octobre, 1910.\nM. Ferd. Poirier,\nOutremont.\nMonsieur,\u2014Je consens \u00e0 vous vendre mon terrain d\u2019Outremont (50 \u00d7 150) sur la c\u00f4te Ste.

Archambault,\nNotaire.\nJ\u2019accepte l\u2019offre que vous me faites, ce jour, d\u2019acheter vos terrains d\u2019Outremont (50 \u00d7 150) sur le chemin de la c\u00f4te Ste. Catherine, pour le prix et aux conditions y mentionn\u00e9es.\nFaites parvenir vos titres et certificats chez mon notaire, Me. J. H. Olivier, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai d\u00e9pos\u00e9 mon ch\u00e8que en paiement.\nFerd. Poirier.\nLe contrat de concession auquel Archambault r\u00e9f\u00e9rait contenait plusieurs conditions. La premi\u00e8re, c\u2019est que l\u2019acheteur devait payer les frais d\u2019actes et d\u2019enregistrement. La seconde condition avait trait au paiement des taxes municipales. En troisi\u00e8me lieu il \u00e9tait dit que le vendeur ne serait pas tenu de fournir de titres ou de certificat d\u2019enregistrement; mais que ces titres et ce certificat d\u2019enregistrement resteraient au bureau d\u2019un tiers, o\u00f9 l\u2019acheteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants pourraient en prendre connaissance.\nIl y avait aussi certaines autres conditions sur la nature des b\u00e2timents qui devaient \u00eatre \u00e9rig\u00e9s sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue.\nPoirier, en acceptant l\u2019offre de M. Archambault dans les termes employ\u00e9s par ce dernier et en lui demandant en m\u00eame temps de fournir ses titres et ses certificats, est-il cens\u00e9 avoir accept\u00e9 purement et simplement l\u2019offre qu\u2019Archambault lui avait faite?\nSi oui, le contrat de vente s\u2019est alors form\u00e9; et, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019action en passation de titre intent\u00e9e par Poirier devrait \u00eatre maintenue.\nSi non, le contrat ne s\u2019est pas form\u00e9, les parties ne se sont pas entendues et alors M. Archambault \u00e9tait en droit, quelques jours apr\u00e8s, de d\u00e9clarer au demandeur par prot\u00eat, comme il l\u2019a fait, que son offre \u00e9tait retir\u00e9e. A premi\u00e8re vue, \u00e0 la lecture de ces deux lettres, on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que l\u2019offre de M. Archambault \u00e9tait accept\u00e9e purement et simplement. Mais quand on examine cette offre et le contrat de concession auquel elle r\u00e9f\u00e8re et qu\u2019on examine en m\u00eame temps la lettre d\u2019acceptation et surtout la demande qui y est contenue quant aux titres et aux certificats de recherches, il me semble \u00e9vident que les parties ne se sont pas entendues sur cette condition du vendeur qu\u2019il ne serait tenu de fournir ni titres ni certificats de recherches.\nEn effet, sur ce point que dit l\u2019offre de M. Archambault? En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, elle comporte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 vendre sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais \u00e0 la condition de ne pas livrer de titres \u00e0 son acheteur ni de lui donner de certificats. L\u2019acheteur lui aurait r\u00e9pondu: \u201cJe suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; mais vous allez me donner vos titres et vos certificats.\u201d Voil\u00e0 exactement ce que ces deux \u00e9crits comportent. Peut-on pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il y a eu l\u00e0 convention? Il me semble que poser la question c\u2019est la r\u00e9soudre.\nLe 29 octobre, 1910, il y a eu \u00e9videmment de nouvelles entrevues, de nouvelles n\u00e9gociations; mais la preuve testimoniale ne pourrait l\u00e9galement nous r\u00e9v\u00e9ler ce qui s\u2019est alors pass\u00e9. (Art. 1235, C.C.). Nous sommes donc oblig\u00e9s de nous en rapporter aux \u00e9crits que nous avons devant nous. Or, ces \u00e9crits nous d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019accord entre les parties ni sur le paiement qui devait \u00eatre fait ni sur l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019obligation du vendeur de fournir des titres.\nLes jugements de la cour d\u2019appel et de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui ont maintenu l\u2019action en passation de titre seraient suivant moi mal fond\u00e9s et je serais d\u2019opinion de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour de Revision qui avait d\u00e9bout\u00e9 Poirier de ses conclusions.\nTout en maintenant le jugement de la Cour de Revision, je ne puis acquiescer \u00e0 l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par l\u2019un des honorables juges de cette cour qui d\u00e9clare qu\u2019en loi un acheteur ne peut pas forcer son vendeur \u00e0 lui fournir le certificat du r\u00e9gistrateur.\nJe crois, au contraire, que le vendeur est tenu de fournir les titres de l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019il vend, y compris le certificat.\nLa premi\u00e8re obligation du vendeur est la d\u00e9livrance qui consiste en la translation de la chose vendue en la puissance et possession de l\u2019acheteur. (Arts. 1491 et 1492, C.C.)\nL\u2019article 1493 nous dit:\u2014\nL\u2019obligation de d\u00e9livrer est remplie de la part du vendeur, lorsqu\u2019il met l\u2019acheteur en possession actuelle de la chose, ou consent qu\u2019il en prenne possession, tous obstacles en \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9s.\nCet article correspond \u00e0 l\u2019article 1605 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\n1605. L\u2019obligation de d\u00e9livrer les immeubles est remplie de la part du vendeur lorsqu\u2019il a remis les clefs, s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un b\u00e2timent, ou lorsqu\u2019il a remis les titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nComme on le voit, il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre les deux articles 1493 de notre code et 1605 du Code Napol\u00e9on. Le Code Napol\u00e9on d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que le vendeur doit fournir les titres; notre article, au contraire, n\u2019en parle pas. Mais les codificateurs nous donnent la raison de cette diff\u00e9rence; et voici ce qu\u2019ils nous disent:\u2014\nCet article est d\u2019accord avec la r\u00e8gle du C.N., article 1605, mais en diff\u00e8re par l\u2019expression et par l\u2019absence de d\u00e9tails qui, dans ce dernier article, sont incomplets et en laissent la disposition imparfaite. Notre article a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s les critiques et les judicieuses suggestions des auteurs cit\u00e9s et est conforme au Code Napol\u00e9on dans ses innovations relativement au contrat de vente.\nL\u2019article 1605 du Code Napol\u00e9on avait \u00e9t\u00e9, comme le disent les codificateurs, critiqu\u00e9 par les commentateurs et notamment par Boileux, 6\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 643, Marcad\u00e9, pp. 221-222 et 225 et par Troplong, \u201cTrait\u00e9 de la Vente,\u201d Nos. 675-6-7-8.\nMarcad\u00e9 disait, par exemple, qu\u2019il serait absurde de dire que le vendeur a rempli son obligation quand il remet les titres en gardant les clefs:\u2014\nQuand je vends la maison que j\u2019occupe, il serait ridicule de dire que j\u2019ai rempli mon obligation de vous faire la d\u00e9livrance par cela seul que je remets les diff\u00e9rents titres \u00e9tablissant mon droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et en continuant d\u2019habiter la maison. Il est clair que je dois non-seulement vous remettre tout \u00e0 la fois et les titres et les clefs, mais aussi d\u00e9laisser l\u2019immeuble\nNos codificateurs, en pr\u00e9sence de ces critiques de la r\u00e9daction de l\u2019article 1605 du Code Napol\u00e9on, ont cru simplement devoir d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019ils adoptaient la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019article du Code Napol\u00e9on, mais qu\u2019ils ne donnaient pas les d\u00e9tails port\u00e9s dans cet article parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient incomplets et qu\u2019ils laissaient la disposition imparfaite.\nLa seule conclusion \u00e0 tirer, dans les circonstances, c\u2019est que sous notre Code Civil, comme sous le Code Napol\u00e9on, l\u2019acheteur, pour remplir son obligation de d\u00e9livrance, est oblig\u00e9 de remettre les titres qui concernent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMaintenant le certificat doit-il \u00eatre aussi donn\u00e9 par le vendeur?\nOn sait parfaitement qu\u2019un acheteur ne voudrait pas se porter acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sans conna\u00eetre exactement les entr\u00e9es qui affectent cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au bureau d\u2019enregistrement: m\u00eame, \u00e0 part le contrat de vente lui-m\u00eame, ce que l\u2019acheteur a le plus d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 avoir c\u2019est la situation dans laquelle l\u2019immeuble vendu se trouve au bureau d\u2019enregistrement.\nLa cha\u00eene des titres peut \u00eatre parfaite; mais, par contre, si l\u2019un des vendeurs ant\u00e9rieurs avait dispos\u00e9 de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 entre les mains de deux acheteurs, celui qui aurait un titre parfait \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait celui qui aurait fait enregistrer son titre d\u2019abord.\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, un acheteur prudent ne paierait jamais un montant consid\u00e9rable sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en acompte sur son prix de vente sans conna\u00eetre exactement les hypoth\u00e8ques qui doivent affecter cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0.\nAlors le certificat d\u2019enregistrement est donc l\u2019un des titres les plus importants que l\u2019acheteur doit se procurer.\nTroplong, en discutant l\u2019article 1615 du Code Napol\u00e9on, dit (No. 324):\u2014\nIl y a deux r\u00e8gles qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 presque toutes les ventes que nous venons de passer en revue, mais particuli\u00e8rement aux ventes d\u2019immeubles.\nLa premi\u00e8re, c\u2019est que le vendeur est tenu de se dessaisir des titres, des plans, et autres renseignements qui se rapportent \u00e0 la chose, qui en indiquent la mouvance, en d\u00e9terminent l\u2019importance et l\u2019\u00e9tendue. Ce sont l\u00e0 des accessoires de l\u2019objet vendu.\nSelon Boileux, tous les actes qui sont une garantie pour l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur doivent \u00eatre livr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur.\nLaurent et Mourlon sont aussi du m\u00eame avis.\nOr, il est incontestable que le certificat, sous nos lois d\u2019enregistrement, est absolument n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir qui est le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un immeuble. Ces certificats d\u2019enregistrement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement assez dispendieux, surtout dans un cas comme celuici o\u00f9 il y a plusieurs lots ou parties de lots qui font partie du contrat de vente. Il est donc extr\u00eamement utile pour l\u2019acheteur d\u2019avoir ce certificat du r\u00e9gistrateur en sa possession et le vendeur, je crois, devrait \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de le remettre \u00e0 son acheteur.\nC\u2019est l\u2019opinion \u00e9mise par M. Bouchard dans une \u00e9tude remarquable qu\u2019il a faite sur la mati\u00e8re et qui se trouve au premier volume de la Revue L\u00e9gale, Nouvelle S\u00e9rie.\nC\u2019est aussi la d\u00e9cision rendue par l\u2019Honorable Juge Mathieu, un ancien notaire et l\u2019un de nos jurisconsultes les plus distingu\u00e9s, dans une cause de La Banque de Ville-Marie v. Kent[5].\nL\u2019Honorable Juge Bruneau, dans une cause de Sauv\u00e9 v. Picard[6], en est venu \u00e9galement \u00e0 cette conclusion.\nPour ces raisons, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l\u2019action du demandeur intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Hepworth Silica Pressed Brick Co., (1915) 51 S.C.R. 81\nDate: 1915-02-02\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada Appellants;\nand\nThe Hepworth Silica Pressed Brick Company Respondents.\n1934: December 22; 1915: February 2.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA.\nConstruction of statute\u2014\u201cRailway Act\u201d\u2014Spur line to industry\u2014Rebate from tolls\u2014R.S.C (1906] c. 37, s. 226.\nBy section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d the Railway Board may, on application by the owner of an industry within six miles of a railway order the company to construct and operate a spur line from its railway to such industry, the applicant to provide for the cost of construction and be repaid by a rebate to be fixed by the Board \u201cout of or in proportion to the tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line.\u201d\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that such rebate was not restricted to the tolls for carriage of goods over the said spur, but was applicable to the tolls for carriage of traffic over the company\u2019s main line to and from the said industry.\nAPPEAL by way of stated case from the ruling of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada in favour of the respondents.\nThe following case is stated by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014\n1. This was an application to the Board by the Hepworth Silica Pressed Brick Company under section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d for an order directing the Grand Trunk Railway Company to construct a spur or branch line into the applicants\u2019 premises.\n2. The point at which the spur leaves the main line of the railway is about 700 feet from the nearest station of the railway (Hepworth) and the length of the spur is 4,623 feet,\n3. Upon the application which was made to the Board on the 19th day of May, 1914, the Board made the following order:\u2014\n\u201cOrder No. 21956.\n\u201cThe Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\n\u201cFriday, the 22nd day of May, A.D. 1914.\n\u201cH. L. Drayton, K.C., S. J. McLean,\nChief Commissioner. Commissioner.\n\u201cIn the matter of the application of the Hepworth Silica Pressed Brick Company, Limited, of Hepworth, Ontario, hereinafter called the applicant company,\u2019 under sec. 226 of the Railway Act,\u2019 for an order directing the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada to construct, maintain and operate a spur to the premises of the applicant company at Hepworth, Ontario, and the complaint of the applicant company against the switching charge of $2 per car proposed to be charged by the railway company: File 21428.\n\u201cUpon the hearing of the application at the sittings of the Board held in Ottawa, May 19th, 1914, in the presence of counsel for the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the Canadian Manufacturers Association being represented at the hearing, and what was alleged\u2014\n\u201cIt is ordered\u2014\n\u201c1. That the railway company be, and it is hereby directed to construct, maintain and operate a branch line of railway or spur from a point on its railway to and into the premises of the applicant company at Hepworth, Ontario, as shewn on the plan on file with the Board under file No. 21428.\n\u201c2. That the applicant company deposit to the credit of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, in some chartered bank at Hepworth, the sum of $8,884, to await further order, being the sum estimated as being necessary to defray all expenses of constructing and completing the said spur, as provided by section 226 of the Railway Act.\u2019\n\u201c3. That if any dispute arise as to the construction or operation of the said spur, or as to the expense thereof, the same be referred to the Board.\n\u201c4. That in the event of the said work costing more or less than the above sum, such difference be adjusted by the Board.\n\u201c5. That the railway company repay or refund to the applicant company, its successors or assigns, by way of rebate, f 1 per car from the tolls charged by the railway company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant company over the said spur, until the said sum of $8,884 has been repaid by the railway company to the applicant company, its successors, or assigns.\n\u201c6. That the railway company construct and complete the said spur within three months from the date of this order.\n\u201c(Signed) D\u2019Arcy Scott,\n\u201cAssistant Chief Commissioner, \u201cBoard of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\u201d 4. Upon the application the Grand Trunk Railway Company requested that the Board should allow it to impose a charge of $2 a car for the services to be performed by it in taking an empty car from its main line and placing the same on the spur in the premises of the applicant company and in hauling out to its main line the car when loaded. The Board, however, declined to make such an order. In the case, therefore, \u00f3f traffic to and from the Hepworth Silica Pressed Brick Company\u2019s premises handled over the said spur, the Grand Trunk Railway Company will not be paid any additional sum beyond the regular freight rates chargeable under tariffs approved by the Board upon traffic to and from the Hepworth Station.\n5. The Board in making the said order interpreted sub-section 3 of section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to mean that the Board might direct a rebate to be made as ordered in paragraph 5 of the order even though no toll was collected for services performed in moving cars, loaded or empty, on the said spur.\n6. The question which at the request of the Grand Trunk Railway Company is stated by the Board and submitted for determination by the Supreme Court of Canada is:\u2014\nWhether the words in sub-section 3 of section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d \u201cthe tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line\u201d mean the tolls charged for the transportation on the railway company\u2019s line of goods carried to or from the applicant company\u2019s premises or mean the tolls charged for the movement of such goods upon the said spur. Ottawa, September 15th, A.D. 1914.\n(Signed) D\u2019Arcy Scott,\nAssistant Chief Commissioner, Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nThe appeal was heard ex parte.\nW. C. Chisholm K.C. appeared for the appellants.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the Chief Commissioner has put the proper construction upon the section in question (226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d) and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nDavies J.\u2014The question stated by the Board of Railway Commissioners for our opinion as to the meaning of sub-section 3 of section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is as follows:\u2014\nWhether the words in sub-section 3 of section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d \u201cthe tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line\u201d mean the tolls charged for the transportation on the railway company\u2019s line of goods carried to and from the applicant company\u2019s premises, or mean the tolls charged for the movement of such goods upon the said spur.\nIf the language of this sub-section is only capable of one meaning it would, of course, be our duty so to declare, irrespective of whether the effect would be to defeat the object and purpose of the Act or not. Our duty is to construe legislation not to enact it.\nIf, however, the language used is not clear, but is ambiguous and capable of two meanings, one of which would obviously carry out the purpose and intent of the Act while the other would defeat it, I take it that it is our duty to put the construction upon the language which carries out the object and purpose of Parliament. Section 226 vested in the Board power upon the application of the owner of any industry or business within six miles of the railway, to order the railway company to construct, maintain and operate a spur or branch from the railway line to the industry or business and to direct the applicant to deposit in some chartered bank such an amount as the Board might determine sufficient to construct and complete the spur, etc., which amount should be paid to the company from time to time as the work progressed.\nThe third sub-section now under consideration provided for the repayment by the company to the applicant of such cost \u201cout of or in proportion to the tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic over the spur.\u201d\nThe railway company contends that these tolls are such only as are chargeable for the carriage to and from its main line to the industry or business over the spur and has no relation to the carriage to and from the industry or business to the destination of the traffic.\nIn this view they applied to be allowed as stated in the case to impose a charge of $2 a car for the services to be performed by it in taking an empty car from its main line and placing it on the spur on the premises of the applicant and in hauling out to its main line the car when loaded.\nThe Board properly declined to make such an order. Its effect would obviously be to make the industry or business pay for the construction of the spur not in the first instance merely as the statute provided, but absolutely, and instead of encouraging and aiding such spur traffic would handicap it. The intent of the legislation was to provide for the repayment of the cost of the spur out of the traffic originating or ending on it and while the language used is capable of being construed so as to sustain the contention of the railway company it is ambiguous and may fairly be construed as the Board has construed it.\nI answer the question that the words of sub-section 3 of section 226 mean the tolls charged for the transportation on the railway company\u2019s line of goods carried to or from the applicant company\u2019s premises.\nIdington J.\u2014Section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d enabled, by its enactment in 1903, the Board to order the construction by a railway company of a branch line to connect any industry or business established, or intended to be established with the railway and provide for the applicant for such connection depositing, under the direction of the Board, of a sum or sums sufficient to cover the cost of such construction.\nSub-section 3 of said section is as follows:\u2014\n3. The aggregate amount so paid by the applicant in the construction and completion of the said spur or branch line shall be repaid or refunded to the applicant by the company by way of rebate, to be determined and fixed by the Board, out of or in proportion to the tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line.\nThe Board submits for our opinion a question involving the interpretation of the phrase:\u2014\nIn proportion to the tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line.\nIt is argued by the appellant that the tolls referred to must be those in respect only of the shunting or moving of the cars over the branch line itself.\nNo doubt the language used is capable of such a construction. But this like every other enactment must be, if possible, so read as not to produce an absurdity in its results. And when the language is ambiguous we must look to the history preceding it and the condition of things existent at the time of the enactment.\nSo viewed and having regard to what the Chief Commissioner in his judgment sets forth, I think he has interpreted and construed the section aright,\nThe question submitted should be answered that the tolls in question mean the tolls charged for the transportation on the company\u2019s line of goods carried to and from the applicant company\u2019s premises.\nThe appeal should be dismissed but without costs. Respondent filed no factum. Only counsel for appellant appeared, and he, whilst urging all that could be said for appellant, presented the case fairly and properly.\nDuff J.\u2014I have very little to add to the reasons of the learned Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners, in which the Assistant Chief Commissioner and Mr. Commissioner McLean concurred. The words of sub-section 3, section 226, are as follows:\u2014\nThe aggregate amount so paid by the applicant in the construction and completion of the said spur or branch line shall be repaid or refunded to the applicant by the company by way of rebate, to be determined and fixed by the Board, out of or in proportion to the tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage or traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line.\nI think it is permissible to read the phrase \u201cover the said spur or branch line\u201d as an adjectival phrase qualifying the word \u201ctraffic,\u201d and intended to be descriptive of the \u201ctraffic\u201d the earnings of whose \u201ccarriage\u201d are to be rebatable for refunding the outlay of the shipper. I will not dwell upon this point of verbal construction, but merely note that the words \u201cfor the applicant\u201d add nothing to the sense\u2014the idea conveyed by them being necessarily implied in the words \u201cby way of rebate.\u201d If this is the right construction, the difficulty disappears; the question is\u2014are there adequate reasons judicially admissible for its adoption?\nOne is not concerned to deny that looking to the words alone Mr. Chisholm\u2019s is the better reading. That is a consideration which tells with no little force against the conclusion I have reached. But other considerations outweigh it.\nThis sub-section cannot be read alone. It must be read with the main provisions of the Act relating to facilities as well as with the provisions on the subject of rates. The judgment of the Chief Commissioner seems to shew that the construction now advanced, if put into practice must, at least in a large number of cases, result in discriminations opposed to the spirit of the enactments of the Act on both these subjects, one leading general aim of which is the suppression of reasonably avoidable discriminations; in other words, that the reading proposed is not compatible with the objects of these enactments of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which are in pari materi\u00e2 with the provision to be construed\u2014that, indeed, such a reading is calculated to defeat one of the principal of those objects. The uniform administrative interpretation of the sub-section in another sense (by the Board of Railway Commissioners), and the acquiescence in that interpretation by the interests chiefly concerned tend to confirm this view.\nI should say that, when I speak of the \u201cobjects\u201d of these enactments, I mean, of course, objects that are expressed with sufficient definiteness by the enactments themselves.\nIf these conclusions are sound, as I think they are, then it is legitimate to reject the proposed construction and to adopt that which I have indicated above.\nNo doubt, in rejecting a construction, which from the point of view of verbal interpretation alone is clearly the better one, on the ground that it is not consistent with the objects of the legislation considered as a whole, one runs the risk of slipping from proper legal interpretation into a region where notions of policy collected from or founded upon extra-judicial considerations hold the field and into methods of interpretation inadmissible in a court of law. In the present case I agree that we do approach the limits of proper legal interpretation; but I am fully convinced that we are, nevertheless, within those limits, because, first, I am satisfied that the sub-section is not incapable of the construction above indicated, and, secondly, I think the reasons given by the Chief Commissioner justify the conclusion that the construction proposed by the railway company cannot be put into general operation consistently with the full maintenance of the governing principle of non-discrimination embodied in the cognate provisions touching the subject of rates and facilities.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014By an authorized tariff the Grand Trunk Railway Company is allowed to charge certain tolls for the carriage of freight to and from its station at Hepworth. It has recently been required by the Railway Board to construct a spur or branch line from Hepworth Station to the respondent company\u2019s premises under the provision of section 226 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The Board has refused to authorize the railway company to charge any additional tolls for the carriage of freight over such spur or branch line between Hepworth Station and the respondents\u2019 premises. They pay for the carriage of freight from their premises the same rates and tolls as are charged to other customers of the railway for the carriage of similar freight from Hepworth Station. It is, therefore, I think, indisputable that the railway company does not, and is not permitted to, charge any tolls,\nin respect of the carriage of traffic for the (respondents) over the said branch or spur line.\nNevertheless it has been ordered by the Board under sub-section 3 of section 226, to\nrepay or refund to the applicant company, its successors or assigns, by way of rebate, $1 per car from the tolls charged by the railway company in respect of the carriage or traffic for the applicant company over the said spur, etc.\nIn a memorandum of the reasons on which this order was based, the Chief Commissioner states that in his opinion the right to order a rebate under sub-section 3 is not\nlimited to cases where a toll is charged for the movement on the spur,\nbut\nthat the effect of the statute is only to limit rebates to freight charges due on cars which have passed over the spur in question, with the right to the Board to order rebates either in proportion to the amount of the tolls charged or by fixed charge per car. With respect, I am of the opinion that the language of the statute is too plain and explicit to admit of that construction. The rebate is payable only\nout of, or in proportion to, the tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line.\nI cannot understand how it can be maintained that a toll which is completely earned by carriage on the main line to or from Hepworth Station is\ncharged in respect of the carriage of traffic over the spur or branch line,\nor how such a toll can be said to be\nin respect of the carriage of traffic over the spur or branch line,\nmerely because the cars carrying the freight upon which it is payable have passed over the spur, the company being required to haul them over it gratuitously. For that additional haul the railway company receives no direct remuneration\u2014it is not permitted to charge a toll. There are no tolls in respect of the carriage of traffic over the spur \u201cout of\u201d which the rebate can come. The words \u201cin proportion to\u201d were introduced into sub-section 3, obviously not to extend the right to rebate to cases in which no toll is charged for carriage over the spur, but to make it clear that it was not intended that the railway company should be obliged to segregate tolls so charged from their general revenue and to ear-mark them as a specific fund out of which alone the rebate must be taken.\nIt is urged that the Board has this matter so entirely in its own hands that it is useless and unnecessary to pass upon the question of law which it has submitted\u2014that it can readily accomplish the result aimed at by reducing the tolls for carriage on the main line to and from Hepworth Station by amounts which it may then authorize the railway company to charge as tolls for carriage over the spur. But the anti-discrimination provisions of the statute would probably present a serious obstacle to the adoption of this somewhat ingenious suggestion. For the present it is sufficient that no attempt has been made to meet the difficulty in this way. While the tolls out of which the statute allows a rebate to be claimed do not exist, the rebate in my opinion cannot be ordered.\nI would for these reasons answer the question submitted by the Board as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe tolls charged by the company in respect of the carriage of traffic for the applicant over the said spur or branch line mean* * * the tolls charged for the movement of such (traffic) upon the said spur.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., (1915) 51 S.C.R. 94\nDate: 1915-02-08\nThe Corporation of the Town of Arnprior (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1914: December 18; 1915: February 8.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nInsurance\u2014Fidelity bond\u2014Untrue representations\u2014Materiality\u2014R.S.O. [1897] c. 203, s. 141, s.s. 2.\nThe tax collector of a town applied to a guarantee company for a bond to secure the corporation against loss by his dishonesty. The company submitted to the Mayor a number of questions which he answered in writing, one being, \u201cwhat means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct?\u201d His answer was, \u201cAuditors examine rolls and his vouchers from treasurer yearly.\u201d The auditors never examined the rolls during the time the security continued.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington and Anglin JJ., affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (30 Ont. L.R. 618), Davies J. dissenting, that this was an untrue representation which avoided the security.\nHeld, per Duff J.\u2014That the judgment of the court below could be supported on the ground that material representations made upon the application for the contract of renewal upon which the action was brought were untrue and that the effect of sub-section (a) is that such misrepresentations avoid the contract ab initio.\nPer Davies J.\u2014That the answer meant only that the \u201cMunicipality Act\u201d required a yearly audit, which would be complied with, and that it was not the Mayor\u2019s duty to check such audit and see that it was properly performed.\nThe bond was renewed without fresh submission of the questions to the Mayor.\nHeld, that as the renewal referred to the Mayor\u2019s answers as incorporated therein, and as the latter had signed an agreement that they should form the basis of the bond or any renewal or continuation of the same the answers and representations made thereby applied to such renewal.\nHeld, further, that sub-section 2 of section 141 of the Ontario \u201cInsurance Act\u201d (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 203) does not require the policy to state that any particular representation is material to the contract, its effect being only that no misrepresentation shall avoid the policy unless it is material.\nJordan v. Provincial Provident Institution (28 Can. S.C.R. 554) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe questions raised for decision on this appeal are: (1) Do the statements of the mayor, incorporated in the bond of 1904, form part of that issued in 1905 in continuance of the original security? (2) Was there non-compliance with the requirements of section 141, sub\u2011section 2 of the Ontario \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d which prevented the defendants relying on said statements to defeat the action? (3) Were the answers of the mayor, as to the safeguards against the employee\u2019s dishonesty, misrepresentations which avoided the contract?\nThe facts on which questions 1 and 3 depend are stated in the head-note and the material provisions of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d are set out in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nW.M. Douglas K.C. and J.E. Thompson for the appellant. The appellant was entitled to rely on the statutory audit, his answer to the question submitted being merely that there would be such an audit and not a warranty of its being correct. The company cannot invoke the misrepresentation, if any, in the mayor\u2019s answer, the bond not stating that it would be material as required by the Ontario \u201cInsurance Act\u201d (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 203, sec. 141, sub-sec. 2). See Village of London West v. London Guarantee and Accident Co.[2]; Jordan v. Provincial Provident Institution[3], does not overrule this case, but is distinguishable.\nWatson K.C. and R.J. Slattery for the respondents. The mayor was guilty of misrepresentation, which, independently of statute, avoids the policy. Venner v. Sun Life Ins. Co.[4]; Anderson v. Fitzgerald[5]; London General Omnibus Co. v. Holloway[6].\nAnd the statute does not save the contract. Jordan v. Provincial Provident Institution3.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton, the trial judge, restored. I agree in the main in the reasoning by which the trial judge supported his conclusion, holding the respondent liable upon the bond.\nThe action was one brought upon a bond of the Fidelity and Guarantee Company guaranteeing the honesty in the discharge of his duty of one John Matt- son, chief of police and tax collector of the Town of Arnprior.\nThe official whose honesty in the discharge of his duties was guaranteed proved faithless, and in the years 1909 and 1910 respectively embezzled sums of money received by him as tax collector for arrears of taxes due in 1908 and 1909 respectively, largely exceeding the amount of the bond sued on.\nMany defences, as is usual in cases of this kind, were set up by the guarantor company, but the one which the Appellate Division upheld and upon which it based its judgment was that the plaintiff corporation had failed to audit yearly all the outstanding collection rolls as it held that the mayor of the corporation had promised in answer to questions submitted to him before the bond was issued that the auditors would do.\nThe learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Appellate Division says:\u2014\nThe auditors themselves declare that they did not examine the collector\u2019s rolls and never even saw them, so that there is no pretence that the promised annual examination of the rolls by the auditors was ever made,\nand that\nthis neglect was a violation of the promise in the statement on behalf of the corporation that the auditors would examine the rolls yearly\nand\nthe learned trial judge erred with respect to the failure of the town corporation to keep the promise made on their behalf by the mayor in answer to questions 12 (a) and (b) that the auditors would examine the collector\u2019s rolls yearly.\nThe question before us resolves itself largely into one of the true meaning and intent of these answers. These answers made by the mayor must, in my judg- ment, be read and construed with reference to the parties by whom and to whom they were made and to the subject-matter on which they were made. The mayor of the town was answering questions as to what means were used to ascertain whether the accounts of the city collector were correct, and I construe his answer to mean that there was a yearly audit of those accounts by auditors and that these audits were those provided for by the municipal statutes under which the town was governed.\nFurther, that the plaintiff municipality did not undertake and was not understood as undertaking or promising any other audit than this yearly statutory one and that there was no undertaking, warranty or promise on the part of the mayor that the yearly statutory audit would be a thorough and efficient one.\nThe auditors were men appointed presumably because of their knowledge of accounts; their duties were defined by statute. It was no part of the mayor\u2019s duty to re-audit the auditors\u2019 audit and see that it has been properly performed; he was most probably quite incompetent for such a task and his promise went no further than this, that there was a yearly statutory audit by municipal auditors and that the Act would be complied with and such yearly audit made.\nThe questions and answers on which the point turns are as follows:\u2014\nQ. 6. (a) What will be the title of applicant\u2019s position?\nA. Chief of Police and Collector of Taxes.\nQ. (b) Explain fully his duties in connection therewith.\nA. To collect all taxes, commutation money and dog taxes.\nQ. 9. (a) Is he required to make deposits in bank?\nA. He pays direct to Treasurer.\nQ. 11. To whom and how frequently will he account for his handling of funds and securities?\nA. He accounts to Treasurer daily, or when he has collected funds. Q. 12. (a) What means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct?\nA. Auditors examine rolls, and his vouchers from Treasurer yearly.\nQ. (b) How frequently will they be examined?\nA. Yearly.\nAs I am agreeing with the learned trial judge in his conclusions and reasonings with respect to these questions and answers, I do not think I can do better than quote from his reasons. He says:\u2014\nI am of opinion that these answers do not mean more, and that they were not intended to mean more, than that the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d requires a yearly audit, and that there would be such an audit: the Act would be complied with.\nSection 295 of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act,\u201d 1903, provides for the appointment of a collector or collectors; and sub-section 3 of that section provides that the council may prescribe regulations for governing them in the performance of their duty. There is no regulation governing them prescribed by statute, and the matter is left to the fair and reasonable discretion of the council.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 council, on the 4th October, 1893, passed a by-law requiring all municipal taxes to be paid on or before the 14th day of December in each year. This by-law was amended, in a manner not material in this action, by a by-law dated the 6th October, 1899.\nUnder the by-law of 1893, five per cent. had to be added to these unpaid taxes. To have that done, and to enable the treasurer to make the return required of him, the collector was obliged to make a return to the treasurer of all persons who had paid taxes on or before the 14th day of December, and at the same time he was required to pay to the treasurer the amount of taxes so paid.\nSection 292 provides that the treasurer shall, after the 14th December and on or before the 20th December, prepare and transmit to the clerk of the municipality a list of all persons who have not paid their taxes on or before the 14th day of December. This necessitates the examination of the collector\u2019s roll for each year, down to the 14th December; and apparently no statutory duty is put upon the treasurer to examine the collector\u2019s rolls other than to that date.\nSection 299 provides for the appointment of two auditors by the council of each municipality.\nSection 304 defines the duties of these auditors. They shall examine and report upon all accounts affecting the corporation or relating to any matter under its control or within its jurisdiction for the year ending the 31st December, preceding their appointment. The treasurer of the Town of Arnprior was a salaried officer, who also gave security to the plaintiffs by a bond of these defendants for the due performance of the duties of his office.\nSection 290 prescribes the duties of the treasurer, and section 291 states what books the treasurer is to keep. He must keep a cash book and journal; and in entering receipts of money in the cash book it would seem to be sufficient to enter amount of money received from collector without stating the persons from whom the collector received it, or on account of the taxes of any person. He should enter the date of payment of any tax money to him by the collector.\nAfter the roll goes back to the collector, with the percentage added for collection, there is no statutory provision for any inspection of it.\nMattson saw his opportunity, and began to appropriate the money received by him from the taxes unpaid on the 15th December, 1908, and unpaid on the roll on the 15th December, 1909.\nIn interpreting the answer of the mayor it should be remembered that the plaintiffs are a municipal corporation. Their work is done as prescribed by statute, and as to which the defendants know as much as the plaintiffs. They are presumed to know the law. The answers were given in perfect good faith.\nI am able to find, upon the evidence, that there was no fraud or concealment of any kind, nor was there any wilful misstatement on th\u00e9 part of the mayor, treasurer, or clerk, or any officer of the plaintiff corporation, in obtaining the bond in question. I am of opinion that the answers of the mayor\u2014the statements in writing\u2014are true in the way the mayor understood the questions and in the way he wished the defendants to understand them, and in the way the defendants did understand them.\nThe company\u2019s knowledge of the fact that the examination of the collector\u2019s accounts was the yearly examination made by the town auditors under the statute and no other and that the expression \u201cthe auditors examine rolls and his vouchers from treasurer yearly\u201d refers to the yearly audit, appears clearly from Mattson\u2019s application to the defendant company for their guarantee bond and by the examination of their general agent Kirkpatrick who, in January, 1909, attended at Arnprior to make an inspection in reference to the treasurer of the town and Mattson, the town collector. The auditors\u2019 annual reports were shewn to have been in the company\u2019s hands and they knew that the audit which did and would take place was part of the general audit of the corporation accounts.\nThe same remark as to their knowledge of the meaning of this language applies to the statements signed yearly on behalf of the corporation in reference to the examination of Mattson\u2019s books and accounts. It was the statutory audit made by the statutory auditors and none other. The municipality could not audit accounts except through individuals and when they used the expression \u201cexamined by us from time to time in the regular course of business\u201d they only meant, and clearly must have been understood to refer to, the statutory examination which it was their duty to make through the auditors. On this point I am quite satisfied the company never was misled in the slightest.\nThen again it does seem to me that under any construction of the words of the answer of the mayor to the question of the auditing of the accounts, the default of Mattson for the year 1908 amounting to 3,941.12, is clear and the plaintiff is entitled to recover that sum at least. The Appellate Division apparently assumed that an annual examination of the old rolls would have shewn such default. But that seems impossible under the circumstances. Mattson\u2019s defaults for the years 1908 and 1909 did not take place in those years respectively. The taxes paid in 1908 were not in arrear until after the end of that year and Mattson may not have received the arrears for that year till long afterwards. He certainly did not receive them in the year 1908. The rolls for 1908 were examined at the end of that year and there was no default on the part of Mattson then. The report of the auditors up to and inclusive of the 31st December, 1908, shews no default. So that when the statement was signed in June, 1909, on which the policy was continued for another year it was quite correct.\nThe accounts had been examined and everything was not only found correct by the auditors, but it now appears from the evidence to have been correct.\nThe embezzlement of the arrears of the 1908 taxes took place after the annual audit. The misappropriation by Mattson of the taxes for the year 1908, which was his first embezzlement, did not take place till 1909 when the arrears of 1908 were paid to him and no audit at the end of the year 1908, however complete and searching it might be, could avail to discover a default or misappropriation which had not then taken place. As the collector\u2019s default, with respect to the 1908 arrears, could not have been detected or exposed earlier than the audit which would take place in respect of the year 1909, because only then could it have been discovered, it does seem to me that the liability of the defendant for these embezzled arrears of the 1908 taxes is clear.\nWhile I, therefore, think on any construction of the answers of the mayor to the questions of the defendant company, the corporation is entitled to recover, to the extent of the misappropriation of the 1908 arrears, as proved, $3,941.12, I am also of the opinion that on the proper construction of those answers they are entitled to recover for the full amount of the company\u2019s bond.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Appellant is a municipal corporation in Ontario. Its tax collector in 1904 applied to respondent to become his surety to appellant. It did so by its bond upon faith of representations made in answer to some eighteen questions. At foot thereof the then mayor of appellant signed as such the following:\u2014\nIt is agreed that the above answers are to be taken as conditions precedent and as the basis of the said bond applied for, or any renewal or continuation of the same that may be issued by the United States Fidelity and Guarantee Company to the undersigned, upon the person above named.\nDated at Arnprior, Ont., this 10th day of June, 1904.\nOf these questions and answers Nos. 11 and 12 are all that are necessary for us to look at for our present purpose. They are as follows:\u2014\nQ. 11. To whom and how frequently will he account for his handlings of funds and securities?\nA. He accounts to treasurer daily, or when he has collected funds.\nQ. 12. (a) What means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct?\nA. Auditors examine rolls, and his vouchers from treasurer, yearly.\n(b) How frequently will they be examined?\nA. (b) Yearly.\nThe auditors never had, when these answers were made, in fact examined a single collector\u2019s roll and never, in any succeeding year over which by renewals this obligation of respondent extended, was such examination made. The answer was palpably untrue and should not have been made by any one having due regard to his own honour.\nIt is urged that the mayor was entitled to presume that the auditors had discharged their statutory duty. The mayor had no right to presume any such thing unless and until, as his duty as mayor bound him to do, he had examined and inquired and been in some way misled. It is the duty of the mayor to see that every officer of the corporation is doing his duty. And so far as that related to the duties of an auditor it did not involve a re-examination of the work, but to see that the methods laid down in law therefor had been duly observed.\nThe respondent was entitled to presume that he had discharged that duty and spoke whereof he knew in answering these questions as he did. It was a matter of fact upon which the bond, as it plainly states, must rest as a condition precedent to liability thereon.\nIt was, moreover, when read in light of the frame of the question and the agreement quoted above from the foot of the memorandum, an undertaking that the auditors would discharge their clear statutory duty.\nThat undertaking is made, by the memorandum so signed by the mayor, the basis of the said bond, or any renewal or continuation of the same, and by the terms of the bond itself it is shewn that it was upon the faith of the said statements setting forth the nature and character of the office or position to which the employee had been appointed, the nature and character of his duties and responsibility, and the safeguards and checks to be used upon him in the discharge of said duties, and same being warranted to be true, that appellant entered into said bond; and it is stipulated in said bond that if the statement shall be found in any respect untrue the bond shall be void.\nSuch must be the result of its untruth unless by reason of the statute which I am about to refer to, that stipulation is rendered inoperative.\nThen it is said the bond sued upon was given, as in fact it was given, the following year without any re- petition of that statement of fact and undertaking and, therefore, cannot be made a foundation for respondent to rest its defence thereon.\nThis bond refers as the other had to the employer (i.e., the appellant) having delivered to the respondent\na statement in writing setting forth the nature and character of the office or position to which the employee has been elected or appointed, the nature and character of his duties and responsibilities and the safeguards and checks to be used upon the employee in the discharge of the duties of said office or position, and other matters, which statement is made a part hereof.\nWhat statement can be referred to if not that which in fact had been delivered by the employer the year before? No other has been suggested, but its identification does not rest upon that alone, for the memorandum above quoted expressly anticipates its use as basis for \u201cany renewal or continuation\u201d thereof.\nI think it is no straining of the language used to say it is a renewal of the bond given in 1904 on faith of such answers as already dealt with.\nIn all its terms save as to dates it is identical.\nI, therefore, hold it is founded upon the answers already referred to as delivered in 1904, and respondent entitled to rely thereupon and the assurance given therein and memorandum at foot thereof; subject to what may be set up by virtue of the statutory provisions contained in section 144 of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d of 1897.\nTurning to a consideration of that section which is the third, if not chief, point relied upon by appellant herein, I think the whole section must be read together and due regard be had to the history thereof if we would correctly interpret and construe any single sub-section thereof. The words in sub-section 2,\nunless such terms, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso, is limited to cases in which such statement is material to the contract,\nare pressed upon us as the governing part of the sub-section, and as requiring in each insurance contract an express statement that \u201cthe statement in the application\u201d to be made a possible ground of avoidance of the contract \u201cis material to the contract.\u201d\nI am unable to see what good the expression of any such statement in the contract could serve. It is quite clear that the insistance of it might become very embarrassing. In the multiplicity of questions often put and answered, many may be properly put and answered in the way of eliciting information, yet when taken alone may be immaterial. Is it to be supposed that the legislature intended that the insurer must under pain of losing the benefit of such answers, select the material from the immaterial and expressly tell the applicant that those immaterial are of no consequence and may be answered falsely or truly as he pleases, for they are of no consequence?\nAgain he may think quite properly that a question which he deems to be material should be put and answered: and yet a judge or jury may afterwards take an entirely different view of it and hold it immaterial and then his whole safeguard is gone as to the remaining answers though all may have been found false; for the moment he stipulates by general terms for too much, he loses the benefit of what he would otherwise have been entitled to.\nI admit that it would be possible to frame a policy in which each question and answer could be set out and the expressed statement of its materiality be declared, but with an express provision that if found im- material that would not affect any other, or the stipulation in relation to any other, and so on through the whole complex maze of questions.\nI cannot think the insured would benefit much by that sort of a bringing home to his mind which is the only object suggested of expressing in the bond something declaring the materiality of what he was answering. Indeed, taking the words in question literally and trying so to apply them, eventually leads to so many absurdities that I cannot think the object of the legislature was that which is suggested. I, therefore, seek another meaning to the words.\nThe insured is amply protected by observing the whole scope and purpose of these sections and reading the words relied upon in relation thereto, and so read I see no difficulty. The stipulation, no matter what it is, must only be good or held good so far as it relates to any statement in question which is material and not beyond. In other words I should read it as if the purpose of the sub-section was to limit the operation of such a condition, stipulation, etc., to cases in which it is material. So read the whole sub-section is made operative and to harmonize with the rest of the section and the insured gets the substantial benefit intended. The other way contended for renders the latter part of the sub-section useless and indeed an absurdity.\nIn any way one can read the curious phrase there are difficulties. Let us choose that presenting the meaning which best accords with the rest of the whole section.\nIt is said the case of Jordan v. The Provincial Insurance Co.[7] is distinguishable because the word \u201cmaterial\u201d appeared in some way in the policy there in question. I do not so read the condition in which it did appear as at all complying with the present contention. It does not profess to do so. It does not specify that any particular statement or set of statements were material. It was rather a stipulation quite independent of what the words I have dealt with seem if taken in the literal way argued for here to require. It simply declared that the fraudulent or misleading statement of a fact material to the contract in the application should render the certificate void, which is quite another thing. It does not earmark, as it were, the answers and express anything as to their meaning or import. It does not enlighten the applicant any more than the insured was here.\nBut it seems quite clear that the principle upon which this court proceeded in that case, rightly or wrongly, forbids the interpretation contended for. Then since that case or rather the facts upon which it is founded took place the legislature expressly added to sub-section 1 the following:\u2014\n(a) Nothing herein contained shall exclude the proposal or application of the assured from being considered with the contract, and the court shall determine how far the insurer was, induced to enter into the contract by any material misrepresentation contained in the said application or proposal.\nThis is clearly intended to settle the general scope and purpose of these sub-sections in the way of protection of the insurers in the same way as the respondent claims it is protected herein.\nThe insurers were as a class long ago such gross offenders that the legislature had to step in and protect the insured against themselves and the judicial interpretation of the law of contract. Let us not by disregarding that presumably considered by all men as settled and so acted upon for many years, start another era giving chances to have another crop of gross offenders in the person of the insured class. If the materiality is left to the courts and juries, as the legislature evidently intended, then both classes of offenders will, it is to be hoped, be kept in such check as equity and good conscience may require.\nIt is to be further observed that in such cases as presented herein the insured was not in fact the applicant and thus was not brought within the literal terms of the sub-section.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The statutory provisions to be applied are now contained in section 144 of the Ontario \u201cInsurance Act.\u201d That section is as follows (pp. 443 and 444, Cameron\u2019s Life Insurance):\u2014\n144. (1) Where any insurance contract made by any corporation whatsoever, within the intent of section 2 of this Act is evidenced by a sealed or written instrument, all the terms and conditions of the contract shall be set out by the corporation in full on the face or back of the instrument forming or evidencing the contract, and unless so set out, no term of, or condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso, modifying or impairing the effect of any such contract made or renewed after the commencement of this Act shall be good and valid, or admissible in evidence to the prejudice of the assured or beneficiary.\n(a) Nothing herein contained shall exclude the proposal or application of the assured from being considered with the contract, and the court shall determine how far the insurer was induced to enter into the contract by any material misrepresentation contained in the said application or proposal.\n(b) A registered friendly society may instead of setting out the complete contract in the certificate or other instrument of contract, indicate therein by particular references those articles or provisions of the constitution, by-laws or rules which contain all the material terms of the contract not in the instrument of contract itself set out, and the society shall at or prior to the delivery over of such instrument of contract deliver also to the assured a copy of the constitution, by-laws and rules therein referred to.\n(2) No contract of insurance made or renewed after the commencement of this Act shall contain, or have indorsed upon it, or be made subject to any term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso, providing that such contract shall be avoided by reason of any statement in the application therefor, or inducing the entering into of the contract by the corporation, unless such term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso is limited to cases in which such statement is material to the contract, and no contract within the intent of section 2 of this Act, shall be avoided by reason of the inaccuracy of any such statement, unless it be material to the contract.\n(3) The question of materiality in any contract of insurance whatsoever shall be a question of fact for the jury, or for the court if there be no jury, and no admission, term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso to the contrary, contained in the application or proposal for insurance, or in the instrument of contract, or in any agreement or document relating thereto shall have any force or validity.\n(4) Nothing in sub-sections 1, 2, and 3 of this section contained shall be deemed to impair the effect of the provisions contained in sections 168 to 173 inclusive, or the effect of the provisions contained in section 55 of The Act respecting the Insurance of Live Stock.\nSection 144, sub-section 4, amended by 4 Edw. VII. ch. 15, sec. 5:\u2014\nSub-section 4 of section 144 of the Ontario \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d is amended by adding at the end thereof the following words:\u2014\n\u201cOr the effect of the provisions contained in the Act of Ontario passed in the fourth year of His Majesty\u2019s reign and intituled \u2018An Act respecting Weather Insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cInsurance contract\u201d must be read in connection with section 2, sub-sections 37 and 41, and, it may be observed, includes among other things insurance of property against any loss or injury from any cause whatsoever. I have come to the conclusion that the representations made upon the applications for renewal which were contrary to the fact had the effect of invalidating the contract for renewal upon which the action is brought, and that there is nothing in the relevant enactments disentitling the company to set up such invalidity as a defence. It is unnecessary to consider what would have been the proper construction of sub-section 1 before the enactment of sub-clause (a). The effect of sub-section 1 read with sub-clause (a) appears to me to be that as regards representations set out in an application or proposal the insurance company is entitled to rely upon the legal rule by virtue of which an insurance contract brought about by misrepresentations of fact material to the contract is thereby invalidated ab initio.\nI do not think these provisions require that this rule of law should be set out in the contract of insurance. In other words, I do not think that the statute has made this rule of law inoperative unless it is embodied by an express stipulation in the insurance policy. It cannot, I think, be questioned that the representations referred to are made in a document which is properly described as an \u201capplication or proposal\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The statements themselves were made by the appellants for the purpose of the application which was made by their officer. That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With not a little reluctance, because not satisfied that the defence which has prevailed is meritorious, I find myself constrained to concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nSo far as it deals with the construction of sub-section 2 of section 141, of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 203), I am, with great respect, convinced that the decision in Jordan v. Provincial Provident Institution[8], was wrong and that the Village of London West v. London Guarantee and Accident Co.[9], was rightly decided. But I feel bound to follow the Jordan Case[10] until it has been reversed by competent authority. In view of the certificates given on behalf of the municipal corporation when renewals of the policy in question were obtained, it may be that sub-section 2 would not aid it, if construed as it contends it should be.\nOn the other questions involved in the appeal I have found no reason to differ from the conclusions reached in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.E.

McIntosh, (1915) 52 S.C.R. 1\nDate: 1915-05-20\nMoise Leroux (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nArchibald Mcintosh (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1915: February 19, 22, 23; 1915: May 20.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nSubstitution\u2014Registration\u2014Sheriff\u2019s sale\u2014Right of institute\u2014Effect of sale under execution\u2014Arts. 938-941, 950, 953, 2090, 2091, C.C.\u2014Art. 781, C.P.Q.\nThe judgment appealed from (19 R.L.N.S. 444), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, which maintained the plaintiff\u2019s action to recover certain substituted lands on the ground that the rights of the substitute had not been purged by a sheriff\u2019s sale thereof, was affirmed with a variation in regard to the expertise ordered respecting the amounts to be allowed to the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale for improvements made thereon and as to accounts for rents, issues and profits. Brodeur J. dissented.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The provisions of the Civil Code in regard to the registration of unopened substitutions do not contemplate registration affecting immovables, as such, but refer merely to registration necessary to the operation of the instrument creating the substitution; consequently articles 2090 and 2091 of the Civil Code have no application.\nPer Duff J., Brodeur J. contra.\u2014Article 781 of the Code of Civil Procedure deals primarily with procedure and should be construed in connection with article 953 of the Civil Code so as to effectuate rights resting upon the provisions of the Civil Code relating to substantive law. Vadebonc\u0153ur v. City of Montreal (29 Can. S.C.R. 9), distinguished.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The registration of an instrument creating a substitution is effective from the date upon which it is registered and protects the rights of the substitute against the right acquired by a purchaser under a subsequent sale in execution made by the sheriff. Trudel v. Parent (Q.R. 2 Q.B. 578), referred to.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014In the case of a sale under execution against an institute, subsequent to the registration of the substitution, the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale acquires merely the personal interest of the institute subject to the substitution, such a title cannot defeat the claim of the substitute.\nPer Brodeur J., dissenting.\u2014Inasmuch as the claim of the execution creditor was for a debt due and exigible prior to the date when the instrument creating the substitution was registered, the effect of the sale by the sheriff was to discharge the immovable sold from the claim of the substitute and to give the purchaser at that sale an absolute title to the land having priority over that of the substitute.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe action was instituted by Madame E. Coulombe, in her capacity of tutrix to her minor child, the present plaintiff, issue of her marriage with the late Donald J. McIntosh, deceased, for the recovery of the lands in question. By the judgments rendered in the courts below, the appellant, defendant, was ordered to deliver up possession of the said lands, reserving to him, however, the right of retention, under article 419 of the Civil Code, until reimbursement of amounts expended in necessary improvements, etc., and it was ordered that experts should be appointed to ascertain the extent of such improvements and to establish the amount to be accounted for by the defendant for rents, issues and profits during the time he had been in possession.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and G. St. Pierre for the appellant.\nMigneault K.C. and Erroll Languedoc for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (oral).\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs subject to a modification of the judgment appealed from directing that all questions as to amounts to he allowed the appellant for improvements and whether he is chargeable with rents, issues and profits from the 19th September, 1907, or some later date, shall be disposed of in the Superior Court after the expertise.\nIdington J.\u2014This case has been argued twice and as result of due consideration of all that has been urged in the somewhat varying arguments I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The registration referred to in each of the articles 938, 939, 940, 941 and 950 of the Civil Code is, in my judgment, the same registration; that is to say, registration at the registry office of the domicile. It is not registration affecting immovables as such, but registration necessary to make operative an instrument creating a substitution which is unopened. I think the effect of articles 950 and 953 of the Civil Code and 781 of the Code of Civil Procedure is that an unopened substitution registered in the sense mentioned, that is to say, pursuant to article 941, C.C., is not affected by a sale under execution except in those cases provided for in article 953, C.C. I think that is the effect of the explicit provisions of these two articles; and I think the reasonable conclusion is that to apply article 2090, C.C. (relating to immovables as such), in such a way as to prejudice rights otherwise arising from such registration would be opposed to the policy of the law. Article 781, C.P.Q., it may be observed, is an article dealing primarily with procedure and it ought to be construed as far as reasonably possible so as to effectuate rights resting upon the provisions of the Civil Code relating to substantive law. It must be read with article 953, C.C., when the effect of a sale under execution upon an unopened substitution is in question and with article 1447, C.C., when it is a question of customary dower. Vadebonc\u0153ur v. City of Montreal[2], as I read it, does not proceed upon a construction of article 781, C.P.Q., alone, but chiefly on the provisions of the Special Act upon which the respondent in that case relied.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendant attacks the judgment against him rendered by the trial judge, and confirmed on appeal with a slight modification, on several distinct grounds with which I propose to deal. I shall, however, first state the material facts.\nIt is admitted that by the will of Donald McIntosh, who died in 1846, a substitution of the property in question was created, of which the testator\u2019s son Archibald McIntosh, who died in 1866, was the institute and first grev\u00e9, Donald J. McIntosh, who died in 1907, was the second grev\u00e9, and his son, Archibald McIntosh, the younger, now of age, is the ultimate substitute. A demand of abandonment was made on Donald J. McIntosh prior to the 17th of January, 1891. Curators of his estate were appointed on the 24th of January, 1891. On the same day the will of Donald McIntosh was first registered. Subsequently, in 1896, the defendant became a judgment creditor of Donald J. McIntosh and under his judgment procured a sale of the land in question by the sheriff at which he became its purchaser. Before paying his purchase money, however, he obtained an order that the other creditors of Donald J. McIntosh should give him security against disturbance of his possession of the property by any person taking title under the substitution of which he then had full notice; and he received such security.\nThe appellant now claims that because the will of Donald McIntosh was not registered before the abandonment by Donald J. McIntosh, the right of Archibald McIntosh as ultimate substitute is defeated by the provisions of articles 2090 and 2091 of the Civil Code, which read as follows:\u2014\n2090. The registration of a title conferring real rights in or upon the immovable property of a person, made within the thirty days previous to his bankruptcy, is without effect; saving the case in which the delay given for the registration of such title, as mentioned in the following chapter, has not yet expired.\n2091. The same rule applies to the registration effected after the seizure of an immovable when such seizure is followed by judicial expropriation.\nIn my opinion these articles have no application. The title with which they deal is a title in or upon the immovable property of the bankrupt. The title of Archibald McIntosh the younger as ultimate substitute is in no wise derived from Donald J. McIntosh. Neither is it \u201cin or upon his immovable property.\u201d It is a title which comes directly from the testator who created the substitution, and it confers real rights in and upon his property. It is not as the property of Donald J. McIntosh that Archibald McIntosh the younger receives the land in question (from him only possession is taken), but as the property of his great-grandfather. (Art. 962, C.C.)\nMoreover, the title asserted by the appellant is under the sheriff\u2019s sale. He is not claiming in this proceeding under the abandonment or the bankruptcy; and I incline to think it is only persons claiming under the abandonment in bankruptcy and who have actually demonstrated by a judgment of distribution or other equivalent legal procedure that they have sustained prejudice or loss in consequence of the registration, who can attack it under article 2090, C.C. Trudel v. Parent[3]. The registration of the substitution was not a nullity. It was effectual from the date at which it was made. (Art. 941, C.C.) That was long before the defendant acquired his interest under the sheriff\u2019s sale.\nWhile the claims of creditors of the institute, which antedated the registration of the substitution, may, when duly preferred, prevail against the interest of the substitute (arts. 938 to 942; 2086-7, and 2109-10, C.C.), it does not follow that upon the sale under an execution issued upon a personal judgment, such as was that obtained by the appellant against Donald J. McIntosh, in a proceeding in which the substitute or his representative was not impleaded (art. 959, C.C.), and there was no question before the court of his interest, the title which passed to the purchaser included that interest. On the contrary it is provided by article 781 of the Code of Civil Procedure that a sheriff\u2019s sale does not discharge the property from rights of substitution not yet opened, and article 950, C.C., states that\u2014\nForced sales under execution * * * are likewise dissolved in favour of the substitute by the opening of the substitution, if it have been registered.\nThis obviously means \u201cif it have been registered\u201d before the sale takes place or, at all events, before delivery of judgment by which the sale is authorized. The registration of the substitution was effectual from the date at which it was made. (Art. 941, C.C.) It would therefore seem that all that was acquired by the appellant under the sheriff\u2019s sale (no attack having been made up to that time on the substitution or on the interest of the substitute, which had then been registered for several years) was the personal interest of the institute subject to the substitution. The purchaser under the title thus acquired cannot defeat the claim of the substitute.\nThe next contention of the appellant was that the substitution is void because it was not published as required by article 57 of the \u201cOrdonnance de Moulins\u201dof 1566. He contends that the modifying declaration of the 17th of November, 1690, was never registered by the Superior Council of Quebec and is therefore not in force in that province. In 1855 registration was substituted for publication, 18 Vict., ch. 101. The decision in Bulmer v. Dufrene[4], at page 92; Cass. Dig. (2 ed.) 873[5], is Conclusive on this point against the appellant. Article 941, C.C., which is not new law (Meloche v. Simpson[6]), embodies the former provisions as to publication and registration and declares the effect of compliance with its requirements.\nThe appellant next charges that the registration of the will was defective because in the declaration the testator\u2019s death is stated to have occurred in 1866 instead of 1846. That mistake was a mere clerical error. It could have mislead nobody because the same declaration gave the date of probate of the will as the 20th of January, 1846. Such a mistake did not affect the validity of the registration.\nCounsel for the appellant further contends that as the plaintiff\u2019s declaration in this action shews Archibald McIntosh the younger to be the heir of Donald J. McIntosh and no renunciation by him of the inheritance is alleged or proved, Archibald McIntosh must be deemed to have assumed the burden of his father\u2019s debts. It is not in his quality of heir to his father that Archibald McIntosh takes the property in substitution. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleges only the facts material to establish his title as substitute. It is true that those same facts would establish his heirship to his father. But they are not alleged for that purpose and he is not, merely because he claims and takes his great-grandfather\u2019s property as ultimate substitute, to be deemed burdened with his father\u2019s debts in default of shewing that he had made a renunciation of his father\u2019s estate. Moreover, as a minor he would have taken with benefit of inventory.\nThe appellant finally maintains that he has been wrongfully held accountable for the revenue of the property\u2014by the Superior Court from the date when he acquired it; and by the court of appeal from the date of the death of Donald J. McIntosh. He asserts that his liability to account is only from the date of the commencement of this action, because he was then first notified of the death of Donald J. McIntosh by proceedings at law. (Arts. 411 and 412, C.C.) This question may well be left open to be disposed of in the Superior Court after the report is made on the expertise directed. The judgment should be modified accordingly. With this modification the appeal should be dismissed with costs, the appellant having failed on all his principal grounds of attack. No adequate cause has been shewn for disturbing the order of the Court of King\u2019s Bench as to costs\u2014a thing which is very rarely done in this court when we dismiss an appeal on the merits.\nBrodeur J. (dissident).\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action p\u00e9titoire institu\u00e9e par un appel\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un immeuble substitu\u00e9.\nLeroux, le d\u00e9tenteur de cet immeuble, a soulev\u00e9 un grand nombre de moyens de defense \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette action p\u00e9titoire, mais devant cette cour il n\u2019en a discut\u00e9 que deux, savoir:\u2014 1\u00ba. Qu\u2019en se rendent adjudicataire de l\u2019immeuble vendu par le sh\u00e9rif pour une cr\u00e9ance ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement de la substitution il est devenu propri\u00e9taire absolu. En second lieu, il all\u00e8gue que l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans un moment ou le grev\u00e9 de substitution \u00e9tait en faillite est sans effet.\nVu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 sur le premier point, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire pour moi d\u2019examiner la seconde objection soulev\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur appelant, Leroux.\nLes faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette cause sont les suivants. En 1845, Donald McIntosh aurait cr\u00e9e par son testament une substitution fid\u00e9e commissaire pour l\u2019immeuble en question dans cette cause-ci. Par ce legs, son fils, Archibald McIntosh, \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 de substitution et au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 passait \u00e0 son fils, Donald J. McIntosh, comme deuxi\u00e8me grev\u00e9, et le fils de ce dernier, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019ans la pres\u00e9nte cause, \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution.\nLe testament d\u2019Archibald McIntosh ne fut pas enr\u00e9gistr\u00e9 du vivant du premier grev\u00e9.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me grev\u00e9, Donald J. McIntosh, faisait cession de ses biens le 17 janvier, 1891, et sept jours apr\u00e8s, savoir le 24 janvier, 1891, il faisait enr\u00e9gistrer la substitution. La preuve ne demontre pas les proc\u00e9dures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur cette cession apr\u00e8s la nomination des curateurs; mais l\u2019intim\u00e9, Mo\u00efse Leroux, qui \u00e9tait porteur d\u2019une cr\u00e9ance due par le second grev\u00e9 et ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution, fit saisir l\u2019immeuble en question; et sur d\u00e9cr\u00e9t, en date du 17 mai, 1897, il s\u2019est port\u00e9 acquereur de cet immeuble. Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du second grev\u00e9, l\u2019appel\u00e9 a la substitution a revendiqu\u00e9 cet immeuble et a institu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente poursuite.\nM. Mignault, dans sa plaidoirie devant cette cour, a pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve ne demontrait pas que la cr\u00e9ance invoqu\u00e9e par Leroux existait ant\u00e9rieur\u00e8ment \u00e0 l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution.\nJe crois, au contraire, que la preuve est aussi satisfaisante que possible et qu\u2019elle resuite de la d\u00e9claration dans la cause, de la plaidoirie et du jugement rendu dans l\u2019action institu\u00e9e par Leroux contre McIntosh.\nDans ce jugement, en effet, il est mentionn\u00e9 que la cr\u00e9ance r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par Leroux contre Donald J. McIntosh existait depuis 1889 en vertu du contrat de mariage de Donald J. MeIntosh avec son \u00e9pouse, Dame E. Coulombe, que cette cr\u00e9ance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard transport\u00e9e, en 1891, \u00e0 Leroux et que ce dernier avait le droit d\u2019en r\u00e9clamer le montant.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que les all\u00e9gations de ce jugement ne font pas de preuve contre lui parce qu\u2019elles sont res inter alios acta.\nCet argument, dans un cas ordinaire, aurait certainement beaucoup de force; mais saurait-il en avoir dans le cas actuel, quand l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame dans son action invoque ce jugement et en fait mention?\nSi toutefois il y avait quelque all\u00e9gation dans ce jugement qui ne serait pas exacte, si toutefois la cr\u00e9ance qui y \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas due par le grev\u00e9, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 temps alors pour l\u2019appel\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer ces moyens pour rendre nul et de nul effet ce jugement.\nMais il n\u2019en dit rien. Au contraire, il all\u00e8gue ce jugement dans sa d\u00e9claration et le d\u00e9fendeur dans son plaidoyer dit qu\u2019il est vrai que ce jugement-l\u00e0 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu et qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu pour une dette qui \u00e9xistait depuis 1889.\nEn outre de cela, un certificat du r\u00e9gistrateur, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans cettecause-ci et qui a d\u00fb \u00e9galement \u00eatre produit lors du jugement de distribution dans la cause de Leroux contre McIntosh, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire dans la cause o\u00f9 le d\u00e9cr\u00e8t a eu lieu, d\u00e9montre que la cr\u00e9ance reclam\u00e9e par Leroux \u00e9xistait en vertu de ce contrat de mariage, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait ant\u00e9ri\u00e8ure \u00e0 l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution.\nCette question de savoir si cette cr\u00e9ance \u00e9tait ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution ou non ne parait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par les parties en cour inf\u00e9rieure. Au contraire, comme je viens de le dire, le demandeur en faisait m\u00eame mention dans son action. Alors il me semble qu\u2019il est trop tard maintenant pour venir dire que la preuve est imparfaite et incompl\u00e8te, quand il est si evident par la preuve, peut-\u00eatre secondaire, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que la cr\u00e9ance due par le second grev\u00e9 \u00e9tait bien ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution.\nL\u2019appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution pour r\u00e9clamer est oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que le testament en vertu duquel il reclame a \u00e9t\u00e9 enr\u00e9gistr\u00e9.\nL\u2019article 938 dit que les actes qui portent substitution doivent \u00eatre enr\u00e9gistr\u00e9s dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00e8t des appel\u00e9s et dans celui des tiers et que ce d\u00e9faut d\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement op\u00e8re en faveur des tiers au pr\u00e9judice des appel\u00e9s m\u00eame mineurs.\nLes articles 939 et 940 du Code Civil disent que les cr\u00e9anciers du grev\u00e9 peuvent se prevaloir du d\u00e9faut d\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement. Il faut cependant que leur cr\u00e9ance soit ant\u00e9ri\u00e8ure \u00e0 l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire cependant qu\u2019elle soit enregistr\u00e9e. Les cr\u00e9anciers ordinaires et les cr\u00e9anciers chirographaires ont le droit de se plaindre du d\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement. Mignault, vol. 5, p. 46.\nLeroux, en sa qualit\u00e9 de cessionnaire de la cr\u00e9ance de Mde. McIntosh, \u00e9tait donc cr\u00e9ancier au moment de l\u2019enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution et cet enr\u00e9gistrement ne pouvait pas pr\u00e9valoir ni contre son c\u00e9dant ni contre lui-m\u00eame.\nIl est en preuve, en outre, que McIntosh, le grev\u00e9, \u00e0 fait cession de ses biens le 17 janvier, 1891. Ses biens ont alors \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sous s\u00e9questre judiciaire. Du moment que cette cession-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait faite aucun enr\u00e9gistrement ne pouvait \u00eatre fait sur les immeubles, m\u00eame les immeubles dont il \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 de substitution, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 affecter les droits des cr\u00e9anciers.\nLe dossier ne nous rev\u00e8le pas si l\u2019immeuble en question \u00e9tait encore sous la main de la justice quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi et vendu \u00e0 l\u2019appellant, Leroux, en 1897.\nLa vente judiciaire a eu lieu le 17 mai, 1897.\nA cette \u00e9poque les immeubles c\u00e9d\u00e9s en justice ne pouvaient \u00eatre vendus qu\u2019\u00e0 la demande du cr\u00e9ancier du failli.\nPlus tard, le ler septembre, 1897, le code de proc\u00e9dure civile a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 et maintenant les biens immeubles c\u00e9d\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre vendus \u00e0 la demande du curateur.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cependant que le code de proc\u00e9dure civile en autorisant le curateur \u00e0 vendre les immeubles c\u00e9d\u00e9s n\u2019emp\u00e8chait pas le cr\u00e9ancier du failli qui avait un jugement de proc\u00e9der lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 la vente des immeubles en ex\u00e9cution de son jugement.\nLeroux en faisant ex\u00e9cuter son jugement a pu proc\u00e9der par cons\u00e9quent contre des biens qui \u00e9taient encore dans les mains de la justice et le d\u00e9cret qui est intervenu a eu pour effet de purger la substitution. Art. 781, C.P.Q.\nComme je l\u2019ai plus haut, le cr\u00e9ancier qui a fait vendre ces biens avait une cr\u00e9ance ant\u00e9rieure et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 celle du grev\u00e9 de substitution et, par cons\u00e9quent, sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 781, C.C., la substitution se trouve purg\u00e9e.\nMais on dit: l\u2019article 953, C.C., mentionne sp\u00e9cifiquement le cas dans lesquels le d\u00e9cret purge les substitutions.\nJe ne crois pas cependant que l\u2019article 953, C.C., doive \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment de l\u2019article 781, C.P.C. Tous les deux doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s l\u2019un par l\u2019autre et je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019article 953, C.C., n\u2019est pas limitatif ainsi que cette cour l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Vadebonc\u0153ur v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[7].\nJ\u2019en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la substitution a \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e par la vente dans la cause de Leroux v. McIntosh, et que l\u2019adjudicataire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, a un titre forfait et qu\u2019il peut l\u2019opposer \u00e0 l\u2019action p\u00e9titoire institu\u00e9e par l\u2019appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution.\nLe jugement a quo devrait \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 et l\u2019action de l\u2019appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens tant de cette cour que des cours inf\u00e9rieures.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; judgment appealed from varied.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pelissier, Wilson & St. Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Greenshields, Greenshields & Languedoc.\n[1] 19 R.L.N.S. 444.\n[2] 29 Can.

[1906] c. 139, s. 37(d).\nUnder the terms of section 37(d) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in a case originating in a Surrogate Court of that province. Idington J. dubitante.\nOn the merits the judgment of the Appellate Division (32 Ont. L.R. 312) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying an order of a Surrogate Judge on the passing of accounts.\nThe only substantial question decided on this appeal was one of jurisdiction, namely, whether or not the Surrogate Court of Ontario is within the terms of section 37(d) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which provides for an appeal \u201cfrom any judgment in appeal in a case or proceeding instituted in any Court of Probate.\u201d The same question was raised but not decided in the case of In re Muir Estate.[2]\nThe proceedings originated in the Surrogate Court when the Trusts and Guarantee Company, administrators of the estate of Lilly Rundle, applied to the Surrogate Judge of the County of York to have the accounts of the estate passed. An appeal was taken from the judge\u2019s order to the Appellate Division by which it was varied and the administrators then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe appellants applied to the registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada to have the security approved, which application was granted for the following reasons.\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Second Appellate Division, in an action instituted in the Surrogate Court of the County of York. The appellant, pursuant to the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d applies to have a bond as security for his appeal allowed. No objection is taken to the form of the bond, but the sole question is whether or not the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The appellant relies upon section 37, sub-section (d) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which provides as follows:\u2014\n37. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, where the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding has not originated in a superior court, in the following cases. * * * (d) From any judgment on appeal in a case or proceeding instituted in any court of probate in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec, unless the matter in controversy does not exceed five hundred dollars.\nI am called upon first to determine whether the words \u201cCourt of Probate\u201d used in this section include the Surrogate Court of the County of York. This provision of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d is a consolidation of an amendment made by 52 Vict., ch. 37. The legislation probably was passed to meet the objections raised by the Supreme Court in the case of Beamish v. Kaulback[3], where it was held that the Court of Probate of Nova Scotia was not a superior court and, therefore, an appeal taken from such court to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was not the subject of a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. At that time the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d only gave an appeal in cases originating in a superior court.\nThe \u201cOntario Surrogate Court Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, ch. 62, provides by section 21 as follows.\n21. Subject to the provisions herein contained, every such court shall also have the same powers and the grants and orders of such court shall have the same effect throughout Ontario, as the former Court of Probate for Upper Canada, and its grants and orders respectively had in relation to the personal estate of deceased persons and to causes testamentary within its jurisdiction; and all duties which, by statute or otherwise, were imposed on or exercised by such Court of Probate or the judge thereof in respect of probates, administrations and matters and causes testamentary, and the appointment of guardians and otherwise, shall be performed by the Surrogate Courts and the judges thereof, within their respective jurisdictions.\nThe origin of the Upper Canada Court of Probate is to be found in an Act passed 33 Geo. III., ch. 8 (1793), which constituted a Court of Probate with full power and authority to issue process and hold cognizance of all matters relating to the granting of probates and committing letters of administration and to grant probates of wills and commit letters of administration of the goods of persons dying intestate having personal estates, rights and credits within this province, to be called and known by the name of the Court of Probate of the Province of Upper Canada.\nThe Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or person administering the government, presided over the said court and he was given power to appoint an official principal of the court together with a Registrar and necessary officers. By the second section of the same Act, for the convenience of the inhabitants of the province, the Governor, etc., was authorized to appoint a Surrogate Court in each district for the purpose of granting probates and letters of administration presided over by a Surrogate judge. By the 16th section an appeal lay from the Surrogate Court to the judge of the Court of Probate.\nIn 1858 by 22 Vict., ch. 93, the Probate Court was abolished and the jurisdiction in relation to the granting and revocation of probates and wills and letters of administration was vested in the Surrogate Courts of the province and this has continued the law down to the present time.\nAt the time Beamish v. Kaulback[4] was decided, the Court of Probate in the Province of Nova Scotia was substantially identical with the Surrogate Court in the Province of Ontario (R.S.N.S., ch. 395). There was a judge and a Registrar of Probate in each county and the jurisdiction of these judges covered all matters relating to the probate of wills and administration of intestate estates. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the words \u201cCourt of Probate\u201d used in the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d are not to be limited to courts bearing the name of Probate Courts, but apply to Surrogate Courts in other provinces, having similar jurisdiction.\nThe second point I have to determine is whether this is \u201can action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding\u201d or a \u201ccase or proceeding\u201d within the meaning of section 37 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d Mr. Raney contends that it does not fall within that expression; that what the judge has done, has been simply to make an audit of the administrators\u2019 accounts and that his action was in no sense judicial. I cannot accede to his argument. The Century Dictionary defines \u201cjudicial\u201d as follows:\u2014\nPertaining to the administration of justice, proper to a court of law; consisting of or resulting from legal inquiry or judgment as judicial power or proceedings.\nWebster defines \u201cjudicial\u201d as\npracticed or employed in the administration of justice as judicial proceeding.\nSee also the judgment of this court in Turgeon v. St. Charles.[5]\nThe facts of this case as disclosed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, reported in 32 Ont. L.R. p. 312, would appear to be that a dispute arose between the plaintiff and the trust company with regard to an item of $1,100 advanced by the trust company to the infant Rundle out of the corpus of his estate. When the boy became of age, he executed a release to the company for what they had undoubtedly done without warrant or authority, and the administrators\u2019 accounts were duly audited and passed by the Surrogate Court of the County of York. An action was taken in the High Court to set aside this release and I understand a consent judgment was made by the Honourable Mr. Justice Latchford as follows:\u2014\n1. This court doth declare that the order made by Edward Morgan, Esquire, acting judge of the Surrogate Court of the County of York, on the 22nd day of December, 1909, on the auditing and passing of the accounts of the defendants, as administrators of the estate of Lily Rundle, and as guardian of the said Clarence Arthur Rundle, is not binding upon the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs are entitled to have the said accounts re-taken and re-audited in the said Surrogate Court.\n2. And this court doth order that the costs in this action be paid as the judge of the Surrogate Court of the County of York shall determine on the re-taking and re-auditing of the said accounts.\nProceedings were thereupon taken de novo by the administrators to pass their accounts before His Honour Judge Winchester, Judge of the Surrogate Court of the County of York. The proceedings are regulated by the Surrogate rules and the petition and affidavits supporting the same and all the subsequent proceedings were carried on under the style of cause \u201cin the Surrogate Court of the County of York.\u201d The judge of that court, after reciting the proceedings before him, made an order on the 29th May, 1914, which is the subject of this appeal, in which he made a finding as to the receipts and expenditures of the administrators and directed that the costs which had been referred to him in the judgment of Mr. Justice Latchford, should be paid out of the estate as well as the costs of the administrators in connection with the auditing and passing of accounts.\nThe \u201cSurrogate Act,\u201d R.S.O., ch. 62, sec. 34, provides by sub-section 1 as follows:\u2014 Any person who deems himself aggrieved by an order, determination or judgment of a Surrogate Court, in any matter or cause, may appeal therefrom to a Divisional Court.\nSub-section 5 provides that:\u2014\nAn appeal shall also lie from any order, decision or determination of the judge of a Surrogate Court on the taking of accounts in like manner as from the report of a Master under a reference directed by the Supreme Court, and the practice and procedure, upon and in relation to the appeal, shall be the same as upon an appeal from such a report.\nI would interpret these provisions for appeal to be that sub-section 1 has reference to an appeal from the final order, determination or judgment of the court, while sub-section 5 is an interlocutory appeal which may be taken during the course of the audit before the judge. Mr. Raney contends that the order made by the Surrogate judge was an order made under sub-section 5 and that sub-section 1 has reference only to contestations between plaintiff and defendant in such cases as a proceeding in proof of a will in solemn form or where a will is attacked on the ground of undue influence or want of capacity. I do not think this distinction is sound and I hold that the order in this instance made by the Surrogate judge is an order within the provisions of subsection 1 of section 34 of the \u201cSurrogate Act\u201d and is a judgment in a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d and \u201cis a case or proceeding instituted in a Court of Probate\u201d within the meaning of section 37 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nIt is to be noted that the appeal under sub-section 5 would be to a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, whereas the appeal under sub-section 1 is to the full Court and that in the present case Mr. Raney\u2019s clients (so far as the papers and proceedings before me disclose) treated the judgment in question as one under sub-section 1 because the appeal was taken direct to the Court of Appeal, which has by the new \u201cJudicature Act\u201d been substituted for the Divisional Court instead of being taken to a single judge.\nThis point being determined in favour of the appellants no further question remains as to the amount involved as admittedly it is over $500. The security is, therefore, allowed with costs.\n(Sgd.) E.R. CAMERON.\nRowell K.C. for the appellant.\nHales for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014An important question of jurisdiction is raised on this appeal, which I think should be determined, although I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed on the merits.\nThe \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d section 37(d), provides for an appeal to this court\nfrom any judgment on appeal in a case or proceeding instituted in any Court of Probate in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec unless the matter in controversy does not exceed $500.\nIt is true that this legislation originated by reason of a decision of this court in Beamish v. Kaulbach[6], where it was held that the Court of Probate in Nova Scotia was not a superior court, but the language of the amending statute shews that it was not intended to apply solely to the Maritime Provinces where alone the term \u201cCourt of Probate\u201d is used for courts having jurisdiction over estates of deceased persons, the language of the statute being\nany Court of Probate in any province of Canada. In the Province of Ontario prior to 1858, the court having jurisdiction over the estates of deceased persons was called eo nomine \u201cthe Court of Probate,\u201d but after that date its name was changed to the Surrogate Court, and today the Revised Statutes of Ontario by ch. 62, sec. 21, in conferring jurisdiction upon the Surrogate Court provide that such court shall have the same powers as the former Court of Probate for Upper Canada.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the Surrogate Court in Ontario is included in the expression \u201cCourt of Probate\u201d in the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nDAVIES J.\u2014The judgment of Chief Justice Mulock speaking for the Second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in this case is quite satisfactory to me and I agree in the disposition of the appeal made by that court. I am more glad to find myself in accord with the judgment appealed from because of the ever increasing appointments of trust companies as trustees and executors of the wills of deceased persons and administrators of their estates and the great necessity which exists for impressing upon these companies that while there may be pecuniary advantages arising out of such appointments, there are also necessary liabilities calling for the exercise of reasonable prudence, skill and attention on their part.\nOn the argument of the appeal a very important question was raised as to our jurisdiction to hear appeals in actions originating in the Surrogate Court of Ontario.\nThe same point was raised before the Registrar of this court who, after hearing argument on the point by counsel, affirmed our jurisdiction. I have read his reasons for judgment and agree with them.\nThe jurisdiction of this Court is to be found in the 37th section, sub-section (d), of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which provides for an appeal to this court\nfrom any judgment on appeal in a case or proceeding instituted in any Court of Probate in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec unless the matter in controversy does not exceed $500.\nThis sub-section (d) was no doubt enacted in consequence of the judgment of this court in Beamish v. Kaulbach[7], which held that the Probate Court of Nova Scotia was not a Superior Court and, therefore, an appeal did not lie here from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in a matter or controversy originating in the Probate Court.\nIn the Province of Ontario there is no court called the Probate Court. The court which formerly existed there under that name was abolished in 1858 and its jurisdiction with respect to the granting and revocation of probates of wills and letters of administration, etc., was vested in the Surrogate Courts of the province. That jurisdiction still continues and is to be found in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, ch. 62, secs. 19, 20 and 21.\nThe latter section expressly provides that every such surrogate court shall have the same powers, etc., and its grants and orders the same effect as the former Court of Probate for Upper Canada had in relation to the personal estate of deceased persons and to causes testamentary within its jurisdiction, and that all duties which by statute or otherwise were exercised by such Court of Probate or the judge thereof in respect of probates, administration and matters and causes testamentary and the appointment of guardians and otherwise should be performed by the Surrogate Courts.\nThese latter courts were substantially the same courts as the probate courts, though under another name, and if the legislature has somewhat added to their jurisdiction, such addition cannot, in my opinion, affect the right of appeal under the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nI think the section of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d quoted above applies to these surrogate courts of Ontario (so called) and are not to be limited to those courts in some of the provinces such as Nova Scotia exercising the same jurisdiction and called \u201cprobate courts.\u201d\nIt is a mere question of name only, not of substance. The courts are the same courts: their jurisdiction covers the same subject matters. The only difference lies in the name given to the courts, and in Ontario it is expressly enacted that their powers and duties shall embrace all those of the old probate courts.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing an order of the judge of the Surrogate Court of the County of York made as a result of his passing the accounts of the appellant as an administrator and guardian appointed by the said court.\nThe first question to be considered is our jurisdic- tion to hear such an appeal. Any we have must rest on section 37, sub-section (d), as follows:\u2014\n(d) From any judgment on appeal in a case or proceeding instituted in any Court of Probate in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec unless the matter in controversy does not exceed five hundred dollars,\nfirst enacted in 1887 by 50-51 Vict. ch. 16, and probably as result of the decision of this court in the case of Beamish v. Kaulbach[8], where it was held no appeal would lie to this court from a Court of Probate of Nova Scotia, inasmuch as it was not a superior court within the meaning of the \u201cSupreme and Exchequer Court Act.\u201d The issue in that case was the validity of a will.\nThe meaning of this enactment came in question in the recent case of In re Muir Estate.[9] In that case as the parties were evidently on their way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and only calling here as at a half-way house, neither side cared to have the question raised, for they desired and got the opinion of this court on the main issues raised in appeal without any very express decision being reached by the court on the question of jurisdiction.\nI, however, then examined that question in its bearing upon that case and set forth my views to which I may be permitted to refer without repeating them at length here.\nThis case is, however, essentially different from what was involved therein. That went to the question of the jurisdiction of the Surrogate Court in Manitoba granting probate before or until the succession duties were provided for. This, however, is of an entirely different character. The issues raised herein have nothing to do with the grant of administration.\nIt is assumed that grant was rightfully made and is no way in question.\nIn Ontario the judges of the surrogate courts have, as results, partly of the development of practice and partly of statutes passed since the above quoted amendment to the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d obtained very extensive powers over the administration of estates concurrently with what still exists in the Supreme Court and formerly existed almost entirely in the Court of Chancery, and later, after the passing of the \u201cJudicature Act,\u201d in the High Court of Justice in virtue of its equity jurisdiction.\nThe outline of the story of how that has come about is somewhat thus:\u2014\nAdministrators were always required to give a bond with sureties for the due administration of the estates entrusted to them and to exhibit an inventory of the estate and make, or cause to be made, a true and just account of the administration when required.\nAny one aggrieved by misconduct in any such regard might apply to the surrogate judge to obtain an assignment of the bond in order to bring an action upon it.\nIncidentally thereto the judge might have to examine the accounts of the administrator to ascertain if there was reason to believe there had been such a breach of the condition of the bond as entitled the applicant to its assignment. There was no final adjudication upon the rights of the parties arising out of the accounting in such a proceeding. All it in- volved might be whether a prim\u00e2 facie case had been made out. Or possibly the rights had been determined by the Court of Chancery in the course of an administration suit and the establishment therein of what constituted a breach of the condition of the bond which the sureties were then called upon to make good.\nEver since 1859 the surrogate judges had power to make allowances to the administrator, executor or trustee in the way of compensation for his services upon his passing his accounts.\nThese provisions tended to the development of a practice of passing accounts, but, if my memory serves me correctly, there was nothing final therein in the way of determining the rights or liabilities of the administrator till comparatively recent legislation, of which 10 Edw. VII., ch. 31, sec. 71, is now, in R.S.O. 1914, ch. 62, sec 71, the outcome.\nI may, in passing, point out that the administration of estates, originally part of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, and later, after law and equity courts were consolidated by the Judicature Acts, of the High Court, has in practice, without depriving the higher courts of jurisdiction, largely passed by virtue of a few minor, but growing, powers, aided by numerous statutes, into the surrogate courts of Ontario.\nThese statutory provisions promoted a less expensive mode of administration than had prevailed in the Court of Chancery or the High Court of Justice.\nI doubt if the legislature of the province ever desired that in aiding such development as a means of the economical administration of justice, in that regard, it desired an appeal to exist to this court as part of the system. Of course it matters little what they desired if the legal result of a correct interpretation of the above quoted amendment brings that about.\nI may suggest, however, that I hardly think Parliament would have intended to bring about any such undesired and undesirable result.\nThe local Legislatures can remove many subjects of litigation from the jurisdiction of this court by providing, through inferior courts, for the judicial determination of matters which formerly were and still are subject matters to be dealt with in superior courts.\nImportant litigation finds its way to the superior courts in any case where the parties so desire.\nNow are we, by a side wind as it were, to gather in appeals originating in the inferior courts as well as those originating in the superior courts?\nThis appeal is a very good illustration of the probable result of such a development.\nI cannot think it ever was the intention of Parliament to bring about such a result.\nI think all that was intended by the amendment in question was to give an appeal in cases that belonged, properly speaking, to the courts of probate as such.\nThe validity of a will must always be an important question and trials of issues which involved that in cases, where as in Ontario the amount of the estate in controversy must exceed a thousand dollars, probably was all the amendment extended to.\nIf, for example, the judges of the county courts, who are generally judges of surrogate in their respective counties, were called only judges of surrogate and their jurisdiction as judges of county courts by process of consolidation were transferred to them as judges of surrogate, would that enable appeals in all cases now within county court jurisdiction to be brought here?\nThe case of Daly v. Brown[10] was referred to in the argument herein and if the point had been raised therein and decided I should feel bound to follow it. No such question, however, was raised. A question was raised of the jurisdiction of the provincial court, but none as to the competence of this court.\nFor my own part I confess I was, until the question was raised in In re Muir Estate[11], under a vague impression that the amendment was intended only to apply where, as in the Maritime Provinces, the courts were designated \u201cProbate Courts.\u201d\nThe fact that the amendment stood so long without any litigant, in a province where the courts of probate are called \u201cSurrogate Courts,\u201d attempting to come here by virtue of it, seemed to lend prim\u00e2 facie a colour to this idle notion.\nMy examination of the question in that case convinced me for reasons I therein assigned that such a construction was untenable.\nTo say the least the jurisdiction in such cases as this must be exceedingly doubtful; and it has ever been the rule of this court where the jurisdiction was doubtful not to exercise it.\nI conclude, therefore, for the foregoing reasons this appeal should be dismissed, but without costs as the point was not taken by appellant and hence not argued as it might otherwise have been. DUFF J.\u2014I think the Appellate Division has drawn the line a little more narrowly than I should have done. The Ontario courts, however, appear to have found from experience that the practice of requiring guardians to obtain antecedent sanction with regard to extraordinary expenditures must be strictly insisted upon for the protection of the property of infants on pain as a rule of the guardian establishing to a demonstration and entirely satisfying the conscience of the court as to the propriety of the payments not so sanctioned; and although this practice cannot be strictly said to be enjoined by law, yet if followed with reasonable regard to special circumstances, it is not necessarily out of harmony with the law and this court ought not to interfere with a judgment pronounced in the spirit of this settled practice unless it appears that some injustice has been done. I concur in dismissing the appeal.\nAs to jurisdiction I think \u201cCourt of Probate\u201d in section 37(d) denotes any court exercising a general probate jurisdiction.\nIt does not follow that every judgment or order of such a court is appealable; but the judgment now before us is, I think, well within the purview of the sub-section.\nANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons which I stated in Standard Trusts Company v. Treasurer of Manitoba[12], during the argument of this appeal I doubted our jurisdiction to entertain it. I cannot yet believe that Parliament intended by the amendment now embodied in clause (d) of section 37 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d to confer a right of appeal from the provincial Appellate Court to this court in cases originating in the surrogate courts of Ontario whenever the matter in controversy amounts to or exceeds $500. Cases originating in other inferior courts in that province cannot be brought here whatever the amount involved; and where the right of appeal in proceedings originating in the Supreme Court of the province is dependent upon the amount in controversy it must exceed $1,000. To allow costly appeals to this court in mere matters of summary accounting in the Ontario Surrogate Courts is destructive of the purpose for which this jurisdiction was given to those courts. It seems to me deplorable that the allowance or disallowance of an item of $500 by a surrogate judge auditing the accounts of an executor, administrator or guardian may be made the subject of an appeal to this court. Yet, upon mature consideration, I am unable to say that an Ontario surrogate court is not a \u201ccourt of probate,\u201d or to find any sufficient ground for denying a right of appeal which clause (d) of section 37 purports in explicit terms to give.\nUpon the merits, except in regard to two items, I think the appeal cannot succeed. It would be most unfortunate were anything that we might do to encourage a departure from the wholesome practice which requires guardians of infants to obtain the prior sanction of the court to any encroachment on the capital of the estates of their wards, or a relaxation of the tacit rule prescribing that when such prior sanction has not been obtained guardians seeking to have expenditure made out of capital allowed must establish by the clearest and most convincing proof that an order sanctioning it would have been made had it been applied for in advance. The appellants failed to satisfy the judges of the Appellate Division that they would have obtained such an order in regard to a large part of their expenditures in the present case, and in the disallowance by that court of all the items in question except two I have not been convinced that there has been any error.\nOne of the two excepted items is a sum of $100 deducted from the commission of $500 allowed by the Surrogate Court judge to the appellants, who were administrators of the estate of Lilly Rundle and guardians of the estate of her son, as he says in recompense for their services\nin dealing with the estate and handing the balance over to the plaintiffs.\nThe deduction was made by the Appellate Division on the assumption that of the $500 commission allowed $100 was for the services of Mr. Warren as guardian of the person of the infant. With respect, I find nothing whatever in the record to warrant that assumption and I think it should not have been made.\nThe other item is the allowance by the judge of the Surrogate Court to the appellants of the costs of an action brought by Clarence A. Rundle against them to set aside a release which they had obtained from him. The appellants acceded to this claim and judgment was pronounced by consent setting aside the release, and, presumably, to avoid the necessity of any consideration of the merits of the action in the High Court Division, referring the question of the costs of it to the judge of the Surrogate Court to whom the taking of the accounts was remitted. In dealing with these costs of proceedings in another court I think the Surrogate Court judge acted as persona designata and that his disposition of them, however erroneous it may be deemed, was not subject to appeal. Both these items should be allowed to the appellants. Subject to this modification I think the appeal fails and should be dismissed. But in view of the result there should be no costs to either party.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment a quo should be confirmed.\nIt has been found, it is true, that the minor, Charles A. Rundle, deceived the company appellant; but it was also the duty of the company, as guardian of his property, to look after his proper maintenance according to his position in life.\nIf the expenditure for the maintenance had not exceeded the income of the infant\u2019s property, no serious blame perhaps could be made to the guardian. But the expenditure exceeded largely the income; it was not made according to the position in life which the minor occupied before his mother\u2019s death and it developed in the young boy very bad habits which have perhaps affected his future.\nBesides, that money was expended without the guidance and the authorization of the court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rowell, Reid, Wood & Wright.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mills, Raney, Hales & Irwin.\n[1] 32 Ont.

Fullerton (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1915: October 15; 1915: November 2.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Auglin and Brodeur JJ.\nOn Appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Lease\u2014Licensed hotel\u2014Accommodation required by regulations\u2014Covenant by lessor\u2014Repairs and improvements\u2014Loss of liquor licence\u2014Determination of lease\u2014Implied condition.\nIn a lease of property, upon which was situated a hotel licensed to sell liquors, the lessor covenanted to repair and improve the premises in compliance with municipal regulations which might be made from time to time in respect to hotels for which liquor licences should be granted. During the term of the lease a regulation was made, requiring licensed hotel premises to be enlarged and improved in certain respects, with which the lessor did not comply and, in consequence, the renewal of the liquor licence was refused at the end of the licence year then current.\nHeld, that neither the circumstances in which the lease was entered into nor the lessor's covenant to make repairs and improvements gave rise to an implied condition to the effect that the obligation of the tenant to pay the rent reserved should terminate upon the hotel, through no fault attributable to the lessee, ceasing to be licensed premises. Grimsdick v. Sweetman ([1909] 2 K.B. 740) followed.\nJudgment appealed from (21 B.C. Rep. 19) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial[2], by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs.\nIn the circumstances mentioned in the head-note, the defendants refused to pay the rent reserved in the lease of the premises and the plaintiffs brought the action to recover the rent claimed by them. The defendants counterclaimed for damages alleged to have been sustained in consequence of the loss of the licence for want of compliance by the plaintiffs with the requirements of the municipal regulations. At the trial, Morrison J. held that the parties had not contracted on the basis of the continued existence of a liquor licence for the premises in question and maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nLafleur K.C. and Harvey K.C. for the appellants.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action by the respondents (plaintiffs) to recover the rent of certain hotel property. The defence was that by certain covenants in the lease the plaintiffs or their assigns undertook to enlarge the premises so as to comply with the by-laws and regulations of the city governing places for which liquor licenses were granted. Their defence alleges that by those regulations an enlargement of the premises and certain structural changes with respect to heating, lighting, etc., were required. The plaintiffs refused to make the necessary improvements and as a result the appellants lost their licence. They thereupon gave up possession and refused to pay rent and counterclaimed for damages. The trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs (respondents) and dismissed the counterclaim. The appellants (defendants) thereupon appealed to the full court and their appeal was dismissed.\nI am of opinion that the judgment below should be confirmed on the very short ground that the land and house, and not the licence, were the subject matter of the lease and the right of the tenant to occupy the house for any other purpose continued after the cancellation of the licence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal must fail, being concluded by the decisions in the case of Hart's Trustees v. Arrol[3], and Grimsdick v. Sweetman[4]. In the latter of these cases it was expressly held that in the case of premises leased and described\nas a beer house and premises with bakehouse in the rear\nwith covenants on tenants' part to continue the premises as a beer house at all times during the term of the lease, the non-renewal of the licence has not the effect of putting an end to the lease and the defendant was, therefore, liable for the rent.\nIn the former (a Scotch case) the same principle was affirmed. That was the case of the lease of a shop for ten and one-half years for the purpose of the tenants\ncarrying on therein the business of wine and spirit merchants.\nIt was held that the lease was not brought to an end by the loss of the licence and the consequent failure of the purpose for which the shop was let.\nThe reasoning upon which the conclusions of the courts were reached in both cases was that it could not be said there was a total failure of consideration for the tenants' covenant to pay the rent or that the leases had come to an end by the non-renewal or cancellation of the licences. The tenant's obligation to pay rent stands unless it can be shewn against the landlord that he has failed to do something that he has undertaken and so disabled himself from enforcing the obligation.\nIn the case at bar it seems clear that the landlord has undertaken no obligation whatever as to the continuance of the licence. He therefore has not disabled himself from enforcing the obligation of the tenant to pay the rent.\nThe lease continues and the premises may be used by the tenant for other and different purposes than those evidently intended when the lease was entered upon.\nMr. Lafleur's contention was that if the licence was cancelled, for any cause except the lessee's fault, the lease ended and the lessee ceased to be liable for rent under it, but that contention is at variance with the principle on which the cases above referred to were decided and which commends itself to me as sound.\nAppeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondents, as lessors, recovered judgment against appellant upon the covenant to pay rent, contained in a lease dated 15th November, 1905, whereby the lessors demised certain lands, described by metes and bounds, in Vancouver, for a term of years.\nThe premises so demised had then a building there on used as a hotel duly licensed, until 1st July, 1913, from year to year, to sell intoxicating liquors therein. At the expiration of the year ending upon said date the duly constituted authorities in that behalf refused to grant any such licence thereafter for said hotel. The appellant contends that thereby the lease was terminated and it as lessee was not to be further liable upon the covenant to pay rent. It insists that the original parties to said lease, in contracting therefor, contemplated that the premises so demised should be used only as a hotel so licensed. Counsel for it points out that in beginning the description of the land demised, the words, \"all and singular the hotel and building situate,\" etc., and after giving the metes and bounds of the property, uses the words, \"which premises are now known as 'The Royal Hotel,' and formerly known as the 'Gambrinus Hotel,' together with the appurtenances thereto belonging,\" and that, coupling those and other like expressions with the covenants which follow relative to the licence and the possible requirements which the retention of this house on the list of licensed hotels might involve, there is clearly implied a condition that upon the lessee's failure to obtain a licence the lease should end.\nIt was easy to have expressed that intention, if existent, relative to its termination and quite as obviously a necessary thing to have expressed as was the possibility of destruction by fire and what was to happen in that event.\nThis express provision for the contingency of de- struction by fire and absence of a like provision relative to the contingency of loss of licence, seems to exclude the possibility of finding in the instrument any implied condition such as contended for.\nIt is further to be observed that the law never recognized the lessor as entitled to obtain a licence. It is only the lessee who can be licensed. He is licensed to sell intoxicating liquors in the building in which he is the lessee. And as a condition precedent to his obtaining such a licence he must be the lessee or owner of a property whereon are buildings which conform with the requirements of the law in that regard.\nThere was no lease of the licence at all possible and none such existed, though mutual covenants were framed and entered into whereby the lessor might possibly assert a claim to the licence at the expiration of the term or forfeiture of the lease, or prevent a transfer of the licence against his will. The like devices have long been resorted to by those who unhappily are proprietors of hotel property, but, whether effective or not, they neither expressly nor impliedly have any relation to the determination of the term of the demise unless expressly made so.\nThe licence only issues for a year. It may be lost \u2014as has happened\u2014one year and be renewed the following. The hotel business proper can go on without a licence. It might be argued that a tenant under a lease worded as this, must continue to carry on a hotel whether it paid to do so or not. Without an obligation relative thereto, I should think there was no such condition or covenant implied by mere words of description such as these parties have used. In this case words are used binding the lessee to obtain if he can, a licence to be paid for by the lessor. It is the land which is demised and in absence of stipulation to the contrary, it would be competent for the tenant to use it for a residence or for the purpose of carrying on any business neither expressly nor impliedly prohibited.\nAs to cases cited they are for the most part entirely inapplicable to the question raised.\nThe expression of Blackburn J. in Taylor v. Caldwell[5], at page 832, relied upon by Mr. Harvey, of counsel for the appellant, as intimating that the words \"letting\" and \"rent\" were of no consequence, must be read in connection with the whole of what he says and in light of what he concludes. It is, as was usual with him, the very substance of the thing he looked at and into, as it were, and he concluded there was in that case no demise.\nThe broad distinction in our law between a demise and a mere licence has to be borne in mind in looking at many such like authorities and the point of view taken by Lord Blackburn cannot be safely discarded in doing so.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellants' contention, reduced to its simplest terms, is that the covenant to pay rent was subject to an implied condition having the effect of putting an end to the obligation to pay rent on the premises ceasing to be licensed premises owing to causes not arising from the fault of the lessor or lessee. It is not disputed that such a condition, if it can be implied, must be a condition affecting the existence of the term itself, that is to say, extinguishing the term upon the lapse of the licence. There might have been a good deal of force in the appellants' contention if the lease had expressly or impliedly required the lessee to use the demised property only as a licensed hotel; but no such restriction is expressed in the lease and there is nothing, I think, from which such a restriction can be implied.\nIt may be assumed that the parties did contract, both of them, in the expectation that the premises would continue to be licensed to the end of the term, but that is not a sufficient ground upon which to rest the implication of a condition such as that suggested. I find it impossible myself to say that the lessor and the lessee if they had contemplated the possibility of the licence being cancelled during the term, must necessarily, as reasonable business men, have made such a condition a part of their contract. Having regard to the decisions in analogous questions as between lessor and lessee, I think I cannot say that judicially; e.g., Paradine v. Jane[6].\nThe appellants rely upon the principle of Taylor v. Caldwell[7] and Appleby v. Meyers[8] which principle was applied a few years ago in a number of cases; Krell v. Henry[9]; Chandler v. Webster[10]; Herne Bay Steam Boat Co. v. Hutton[11]; and the effect of these cases has been stated in a book which has a high reputation for accuracy, in the following words:\u2014 (n) Where from the nature of the contract it is clear that the contract is based upon the assumption by both parties to it that the subject matter will, when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrives, still exist, or that some condition or state of things going to the root of the contract and essential to its performance will be in existence, the non-existence of such subject matter or of such condition or state of things when the time for the fulfilment of the contract has arrived, affords, in general, an answer to the claim for any further fulfilment of the contract, and also to one for damages for the failure to further carry out the contract.\nBullen & Leake's Precedents of Pleadings, at page 494,\nThis principle is not sufficient for the appellants because it cannot be contended that the continuance of the licence is essential to the performance of the contract.\nThe principle has not hitherto, moreover, been applied in the case of a demise of land under which possession has been taken and a term has become vested in the tenant.\nANGLIN J.\u2014If, as is undoubtedly the case, under English law, Belfour v. Weston[12]; Holtzapffel v. Baker[13]; Counter v. MacPherson[14], the destruction by fire or tempest of property demised does not terminate the lease or afford a defence to the tenant in an action for rent, I cannot understand how the mere refusal of the authorities to renew a licence to sell liquor upon premises leased for the purposes of a hotel can, in the absence of an express condition in the lease, have that effect. Krell v. Henry[15], and cases like it are distinguishable on the ground that in them the right of the tenants to possession of the premises was conditional upon the existence of a state of things which became impossible. Although, no doubt, different in some of its circumstances, the case of Grimsdick v. Sweetman[16], relied upon in the Court of Appeal, appears to be in point, and the Scotch case of Hart's Trustees v. Arrol[17], there cited and specially referred to by Mr. Nesbitt, is, I think, indistinguishable. There has not been a total destruction of the subject-matter of the lease\u2014the land and the house upon it remain\u2014and the authorities do not warrant the implication of a condition that if the licence should be taken away the lease should terminate. I agree in the view of Jelf J. (Grimsdick v. Sweetman[18], at page 747), that:\u2014\nIt would to my mind be a most extraordinary thing to say that because the licence has been taken away the tenant has no right to continue to live in the house.\nYet that would be the result if the cancellation of the licence were to terminate the lease. I prefer not to rest the disposition of this case upon the ground that because the non-renewal of the licence was something which the tenant should have anticipated and provided against, he cannot treat it as entitling him to cancellation of the lease. This test, formulated in Baily v. De Crespigny[19], and referred to in Krell v. Henry[20], seems to me unsatisfactory\u2014at least I am unable to understand why it should not have been applied in such a case as Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton Edridge & Co.[21], if it is decisive.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014The relations of the parties are those of lessor and lessee.\nThe question is whether the non-renewal of the licence of the hotel entitled the appellants to repudiate the lease and refuse to pay rent.\nIt had been stated in the defence that the non-renewal of the licence has been caused by the fault of the lessor. But the case remains now to be considered only upon the construction of the contract.\nIt seems to me clear that the parties had not contracted on the basis of the existence of a liquor licence.\nIf a warranty had been stipulated on the part of the lessor against the non-renewal of the licence, then he might be liable, but the parties did not so stipulate and no such covenant could be implied; for in the case of damage by fire a suspension of rent was stipulated. If the contracting parties had also desired that in the case where the licence would not be granted the rent should not be paid, then they would have mentioned it.\nI am unable to distinguish this case from the Grimsdick v. Sweetman[22] case decided in 1909 in England.\nBy an indenture of lease, certain premises described as \"all that beer house and premises\" were demised. The house had been licensed as a beer house for a great number of years. But the renewal of the licence was refused under the \"Licensing Act.\" In an action to recover rent due, it was held that the non-renewal of the licence had not the effect of putting an end to the lease and that the defendant was, therefore, liable for the rent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Davis, Marshall, MacNeill & Pugh.\n[1] 21 B.C.

Kimber and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1915: May 11, 12; 1915: November 5.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA\nPilotage authority\u2014Compulsory retirement of pilot\u2014Judicial functions\u2014Liability to action.\nThe pilotage authority in a pilotage district of Canada has not absolute and arbitrary power to cancel a pilot\u2019s licence, but can only do so after complaint and inquiry and proof on oath of incapacity.\nIf a pilotage authority, by resolution alone, without complaint, notice or investigation, declares a pilot to be dismissed \u201cfor neglect and incapacity\u201d and thus prevents him from performing a pilot\u2019s duties, inasmuch as it failed to observe the statutory requirements respecting the proceedings for such dismissal it has not exercised judicial functions and is not protected from liability to an action by the pilot for damages. Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. dissenting.\nPer Duff J.\u2014A by-law of a pilotage authority purporting to provide for the forfeiture of pilot\u2019s licences for incapacity could only have the effect, if at all, subject to the condition exacted by 433 (j) of the \u201cShipping Act\u201d that such incapacity should be \u201cproved on oath before the pilotage authority\u201d and a resolution of a pilotage authority pretending to dismiss a licensed pilot for incapacity without such proof on oath was legally inoperative; but as the resolution was intended to have and had the effect of preventing the pilot exercising his calling and since it was an act without justification or excuse it was actionable within the principle laid down by Bowen l.J. in Mogul Steam Ship Co. v. McGregor (23 Q.B.D. 598).\nPer Duff J.\u2014Section 433(e) of the \u201cShipping Act\u201d does not empower a pilotage authority to limit the term of a pilot\u2019s licence to a period of one year.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (48 N.S. Rep. 280) reversed. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe questions raised for decision on this appeal are stated in the above head-note.\nMellish K.C., and Finlay Macdonald K.C. for the appellant. In passing the resolution for dismissal of the appellant the respondents were not acting judicially. See Royal Aquarium, etc., Soc. v. Parkinson[2]; Baird v. Wells[3].\nEven if they were acting as a quasi-judicial body they were not protected as they did not observe the formalities required by statute. Pollock on Torts (6 ed.), p. 120.\nThe record contains evidence of malice. See Ferguson v. Earl of Kinnoull[4], at p. 303.\nRogers K.C. for the respondents. The respondents were acting judicially. Harman v. Tappenden[5]; East River Gas-Light Co. v. Donnelly[6].\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion the judgment appealed from is right. There can, I think, be no doubt that in discharging the pilot the respondents were acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, and it is settled law that those acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity incur no liability for acts performed within their jurisdiction unless actuated by malice. Many American cases indeed go so far as to hold that even malice will not affect the immunity of those performing such functions. It is unnecessary to consider this in the present instance as malice has not been charged.\nThis freedom from liability of those discharging quasi-judicial functions does not, of course, in any way prevent the courts interfering to review the proceedings. The courts do so in every variety of cases, quashing convictions, setting aside awards, granting mandamus such as would undoubtedly have been done on application in the present case. The proceedings by the Pilotage Authority were clearly irregular and the mandamus would have directed them to hear and determine the matter in a proper manner. Freedom from liability for the consequences of such acts is, however, precisely the protection which the law gives to those discharging such duties. Were it otherwise no one could venture to undertake the discharge of the duties of many public positions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I accept the reasons for the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia as delivered by Chief (then Mr.) Justice Graham allowing the appeal from the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe gist or pith of the decision is that the acts of licensing and of withdrawing a licence of a pilot are quasi-judicial, that there is no contract of hiring, and that in the absence of proof of malice in the withdrawal of a licence no action will lie against the Pilot Commissioners. Idington J.\u2014This is an action by appellant who was duly qualified as a pilot and licensed as such in 1888, under the Pilotage Act, chapter 80 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, now, so far as amended and in force, forming part of the Canada Shipping Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, against respondents, who were appointed 13th May, 1912, the pilotage authority for the Port of Sydney.\nThe respondents constituted an entirely new Board. Mr. Kimber, their secretary, testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. You know the plaintiff here, John B. McGillivray?\nA. I do.\nQ. Were you present at the meeting where it was decided to dispense with his services?\nA. Yes.\nQ. When was that?\nA. June 13th, 1912.\nQ. Who were present at that meeting?\nA. Vincent Mullins.\nQ. He was chairman?\nA. He was elected chairman. There were present Commissioners Vooght, Desmond, Barrington and myself.\nQ. Was that the first meeting you had?\nA. Yes, the first meeting.\nQ. It was at that meeting you undertook to dispense with the services of the plaintiff?\nA. He was dropped from the list of pilots.\nQ. Was that the meeting he was dismissed from the service?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Is there a resolution there?\nA. Yes. \u201cMoved by Com. Barrington, seconded by Com. Vooght that the following pilots should be dismissed from the service. Carried.\u201d John B. McGillivray is the first name.\nQ. Is that all there is to it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And that resolution was carried?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And Mr. McGillivray was dismissed?\nA. He was.\nThis resolution so read from the minute book is further evidenced by what I presume was intended for a certified copy filed as an exhibit. And apparently from that, after the motion was declared carried, there was added a note as follows: \u201cP.S. Neglect and incompetency were the reasons for the above dismissal.\u201d\nWhen this was done or how it came to be entered, we have no evidence of. And the book is not in the record. Appellant says he was notified to quit, that his services were no longer required and that he quit accordingly after seeing Mr. Kimber and Mr. Mullins, and being unable to get any information from either of them why he was dismissed.\nThere was no pretence of any accusation and inquiry in respect thereof, or of hearing the appellant, or calling upon him to answer for anything.\nIt seems later to have dawned upon some of these men that their proceedings were illegal. In August of the next year, in the absence of some of the more relentless members of the Board, the appellant was reinstated and acted as a pilot for some two or three months. The matter was again taken up pending such service, at a meeting on the 8th of October, 1913, when the following resolution was passed:\u2014\nWhereas after a meeting of the Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Port of Sydney held on August 4th, 1913, two only of the Commissioners being present, a resolution was irregularly introduced and adopted by the said two Commissioners and entry made of the same on the minutes of the doings of this Board, reappointing John B. McGillivray, George Spencer and Peter, Rigby as Pilots for the Port of Sydney, although at a prior meeting of the Board, the said persons, having previously been pilots, had, their commissions cancelled by an unanimous vote.\nBe it therefore resolved that this Board declares itself in no way bound by the resolution irregularly introduced and purporting to have been adopted after said meeting of August 4th, and that it does not, and will not recognize the said John B. McGillivray, George Spencer and Peter Rigby as pilots acting under the authority of this Board.\nBe it further resolved that the Secretary be instructed to forthwith notify the said parties that the Board does not, and will not recognize them as pilots having any authority whatsoever from this Board. Carried.\nThe secretary accordingly notified the appellant that he would not be recognized as a pilot.\nLater, on the 18th October, 1913, the secretary wrote the following letters:\u2014\nSydney, N.S., October 18th, 1913.\nD. A. McInnis, Esq.,\nMember of Pilots\u2019 Finance Committee.\nDear Sir,\u2014On the 7th inst. I notified John B. McGillivray and Peter Rigby, under instructions given me by a meeting of the Board of Commissioners held the previous day at North Sydney, that the Pilotage Authority did not and would not recognize them as pilots having any authority whatever from the Board.\nI understand that both these men have reported for duty since receiving this notice, and I, therefore, give your Committee formal notice that neither of these men are clothed with any licence or authority from the Board to act as pilots of this port.\nYours truly,\nF. C. Kimber, Secretary.\nIt is upon these acts, done or brought about by the respondents, that appellant founds this action.\nThe learned trial judge maintained the action and assessed the damages at $1,800. The Appellate Court of Nova Scotia reversed this judgment on the ground that the respondents in so acting were discharging a quasi-judicial duty and hence not liable to any action for damages therefor, unless shewn to have been moved by malice.\nIt is necessary in order to understand and correctly appreciate the relations between the Board and the appellant to ascertain what his legal position was and the degree of authority they had over him. The \u201cPilotage Act\u201d provided that before a man can act or be licensed as a pilot he must have served an apprenticeship. And then the Board had power to license him. Having done so he must register his licence with the collector of customs.\nSection 28 of that Act under which appellant obtained his licence, after serving apprenticeship, is as follows:\u2014\nEvery pilot who had received a licence from a duly constituted authority in that behalf, before the commencement of this Act, may retain the same under and subject to the provisions of this Act, and shall, for the purposes of this Act, be a pilot licensed by the pilotage authority of the district to which his licence extends.\nThis section in substantially the same terms, and doubtless intended to he a continuation in force of said section, appears in section 448 of the \u201cCanada Shipping Act\u201d above referred to.\nIt seems quite clear from said section and the other sections bearing upon the question, that so long as a licensed pilot conformed to the regulations and had not been duly condemned for any of the offences for which the Board might try him, and suspend or dismiss him, he was (until sixty-five years of age) quite independent of the Board and entitled to follow his chosen calling and earn his livelihood thereby and as provided in section 38 of the \u201cPilotage Act,\u201d now section 459 of the \u201cShipping Act\u201d secure the provisions he would be entitled, upon retirement, to claim thereunder for himself, his widow or child.\nThere is no claim set up or pretended that he failed to conform to the regulations such as requiring payment of the annual licence fee and getting a renewal so called of the licence.\nThe Board had no arbitrary authority to interfere with that tenure of appellant\u2019s office or rights as a licensee. It is quite clear that they imagined they had such arbitrary authority and acted accordingly. They never dreamed of anything else. They never for a moment supposed they had a judicial duty to discharge. Indeed, it never occurred to them to imagine such a thing in pleading their defence herein or presenting their case at the trial.\nIt seems some one suggested a possibility of such a defence in the appellate court, but I can find no leave given or asked to amend the statement of defence. I am unable to see how under the law and facts they can claim such a defence as matter of course. Their defence on the pleadings was one of absolute authority and nothing else but what fell within the scope thereof.\nI cannot say that a state of pleading, such as before us, with a glimpse into some of the vicious, and hence in law malicious, motives which impelled the mover of the resolution, can be properly remodelled at this stage in such a way as to import therein the defence of acting in quasi-judicial capacity and exclude the consideration of malice as being unproven.\nEven if Mr. Justice Graham\u2019s holding that, where a quasi-judicial act is involved, malice must be pleaded and proved, be correct, it surely devolved on defendants to set up the claim of quasi-judicial authority instead of the absolute authority set up by the statement of defence. In that case it might have been incumbent on the appellant to have replied malice and proven it.\nThe mover of the resolution so far as he is concerned puts himself out of court in assigning, as follows, his reasons for acting:\u2014 Q. Why was John McGillivray dismissed?\nA. Well, I can give you my own reasons. I had two. One was political and I considered him a disgrace to the service.\nQ. What was the political reason?\nA. I got it in the neck myself once and I thought I would return the compliment when I got the chance.\nQ. You had been dismissed when the Liberals were in office and you thought you would return the compliment to him?\nA. That was one reason and one was just as strong as the other.\nAlthough Mr. Kimber disclaims personal knowledge of appellant\u2019s politics he indicates some of the Board seemed incidentally moved by considerations relative thereto. The surprising thing is that on the issues presented we should find accidentally disclosed so much evidence of those indirect motives of action which constitute malice. If the issue had been raised on the pleadings we may, from this sample so disclosed, well imagine there may have been much more which the trial of such an issue might have brought forth.\nIndeed, it is hard to understand how, unless moved by improper motives, any one in such a position looking at this part of the statute (of which a copy was to be given every pilot and of which every commissioner presumably knew something) could have conceived it his right or duty to dismiss a man unheard.\nI cannot find it incumbent upon us to impute to the respondents a quasi-judicial character which they never supposed they had, or were required to have and have not pleaded.\nThe appear should be allowed for these reasons alone.\nBut, in deference to the judgment appealed from and the chief argument presented here, let us examine the claim that what was done was of a quasi-judicial nature. To appreciate it correctly, there is nothing in the statute, which gave the Board any power or authority it had, supporting the defence of absolute authority as pleaded. It is admitted, in argument, that the Board is not a corporation. It is, however, given power to frame by-laws subject to the provisions of the Act. That power is now contained in section 433, which in its first or operative clause is as follows:\u2014\n433. Subject to the provisions of this part, or of any Act for the time being in force in its pilotage district, every pilotage authority shall, within its district, have power, from time to time, by by-law confirmed by the Governor-in-Council, to, * * *\nThis is followed by sub-sections numbered from (a) to (n) defining such enumerated subjects as therein appear, over which the Board is given merely the initiative faculty of framing by-laws to be adopted by the Governor-in-Council, but nothing therein gives the Board any absolute or indeed any control.\nI fail to see how anything done or supposed to be done under that section can by any chance be supposed to be a quasi-judicial exercise of power.\nIn sub-section (j), which is as follows:\u2014\n(j) Provide for the compulsory retirement of licensed pilots who have not attained the age of sixty-five years, proved on oath before the pilotage authority to be incapacitated by mental or bodily infirmity or by habits of drunkenness,\nthey are thus given power to frame by-laws in respect of the incapacities and offences which are most prominently put forward by defendants as palliating their conduct relative to appellant.\nThis section 433 and its sub-sections for the most part are identical with and taken from section 15 of the \u201cPilotage Act,\u201d which again was consolidated from the Act of 1873.\nUnder that Act there were in 1906 re-enacted and amended prior by-laws which contain all that is in evidence before us relative to the powers and duties of respondents under said section of the Act. So far as they had any judicial or quasi-judicial powers such must rest in said statutes and the by-laws so far as enacted within same.\nThese furnish no ground for the assertion of any judicial or quasi-judicial powers such as would in the remotest degree warrant the procedure adopted in the passing of the resolution quoted above or in the steps taken either in accord therewith or legitimately consequent thereupon.\nI conclude, therefore, that all these steps so taken were without any colour of jurisdiction for such acts.\nAs the resolution in its terms fails to assign any cause for its passage, that should end such contention as set up.\nIf heed is to be paid to the postscript in way of assigning any cause \u201cneglect and incompetency\u201d are the only ones assigned for consideration. The said by-laws contain the following:\u2014\nBy-law No. 9.\u2014Any pilot or apprentice incapacitated by mental or bodily infirmity, or by habits of drunkenness, shall forfeit his license, and not be at liberty to serve in the capacity of a licensed pilot, and any pilot or apprentice guilty of drunkenness and incapacity while on duty shall be suspended for three months.\nIt is not pretended in argument or apparent in evidence that there was any neglect save in occurrences at least two years old and those were at the time dealt with by the then Board.\nIn regard to the charge of drunkenness that seems answered in the same manner.\nBut habitual drunkenness though not assigned in the postscript to the resolution, is alleged in some of the evidence. But how is that in law or in fact in any way so connected with the resolution and other acts of respondents complained of herein as to furnish ground for saying that the respondents were so acting in relation thereto as to maintain the pretence of quasi-judicial action?\nThat as a ground of compulsory retirement is specifically provided for by the statute in section 433, sub-section (j) as hereinbefore quoted and in No. 9 by-law also quoted which must be read therewith.\nSection 433, with sub-section (j) only enables the enactment of a by-law adapted to cases proved on oath before the pilotage authority.\nThe by-law No. 9 so enacted and apparently intended to be within said power of enactment cannot in law be extended beyond the powers given to enact it.\nIt might be treated as null by reason of being in excess of the power given. But I think the more reasonable interpretation of it is to presume it is intended to operate within the statute and to be resorted to conditionally upon proof, as required by the statute, under oath of the offence or incapacity from the causes assigned or habitual drunkenness.\nSo interpreted I fail to see how the respondents were given any semblance of jurisdiction to deal with such matters unless upon the production of proof upon oath, or in the trying of some of the specific cases for which the Act provides and, upon a finding thereby, prescribes dismissal or forfeiture of licence.\nIn every way one may look at the matter the respondents were acting entirely without jurisdiction and so acting must be held liable. In The Marshalsea Case[7] at page 76a, the case of one so acting is clearly distinguished from that where the person acting might have had jurisdiction over the subject matter or person, but erred in the mode of proceeding.\nFrom that down to the present date the distinction has been observed. Many statutes have been enacted to protect magistrates who have acted in good faith, yet that protection has often, failed.\nThe case of Clark v. Woods[8] is an illustration. But perhaps as curious as any is the case of Jones v. Gurdon[9], where, though there existed evidently good faith, yet from failure to comply with the conditions giving a right to act, the magistrate was held liable and the protecting Act held not to cover his case.\nFoster v. Dodd[10] is of another type. Needless to multiply authorities of this kind extending in principle to every kind of inferior and domestic jurisdiction.\nThe error (beyond the apprehension of the pleading and issue raised) into which I respectfully submit the court below fell, in relying upon the cases cited there, was in not observing the distinction I have just pointed out.\nThere is another line of cases from Ashby v. White, fully set out in[11] (where note is made of the many cases illustrative of what is involved in the question therein decided), down to the present time, shewing that where the officer is seized of the business to be done, indeed, has it forced upon him to decide and manifestly has a discretion or judgment to be exercised, he is, if acting without malice, free though mistaken.\nThese respondents never were seized of any business to be done in the doing of which they were discharging any duty relative to the appellant\u2019s tenure of his licence.\nIt occurs to me also that even if the resolution could by any stretch of the imagination be called a judgment of any kind, it was as such invalid for want of jurisdiction and all the acts which the respondents persisted in later, in way of executing their purpose, were mere ministerial acts, which had no valid judgment or order to justify acting thereupon, and hence rendered them liable to an action for damages.\nThey by these mere ministerial acts without a valid order to support them deprived appellant of the share he otherwise would have got in the funds distributed as well as of direct earnings.\nAgain it was suggested in argument as well as in the judgment appealed from that a mandamus was the only remedy. The doubt I expressed in the argument if such a remedy could be successfully sought as against those serving the Crown in the capacity the respondents were appointed for, has, as result of a very casual examination, increased, but I express no opinion in regard thereto.\nThe right to bring this action if, as I hold, the respondents acted without any jurisdiction, seems clear even if the remedy by way of mandamus was also open to appellant.\nThe many cases cited and others which though not cited I have looked at, seem to me to make it abundantly clear that we must have regard in considering such cases to the particular terms of the respective statutes in force bearing upon any such like question; and above all to the general purview of the statute in question, and the general principles of law such as I have adverted to.\nSo looking at the matter in question I have, for the reasons I have given, no doubt of the appellant\u2019s right of action herein. Indeed, there seems to have been such an entire absence of regard for and observation of the principles of natural justice that I am not surprised at the failure to find any exact precedent to guide us.\nI was on the argument impressed with the possibility of the damages being excessive, and still am not free from doubt. But the details bearing thereon seemed to counsel to be irrelevant. The action was framed in error and all seemed agreed on the rectification that was made in that regard. Hence I assume the changes that took place, as I now find in the second year of the new Board, are not to be considered of any consequence. That change, however, might have made an arguable difference of view as to the amount of the damages. Appellant seems to have been restored to the list and probably this detail is of no consequence.\nI think the appeal should he allowed with costs here and below and the judgment of the trial judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant after a service of twenty-five years as a pilot in Sydney Harbour was summarily retired by the respondents, the \u201cSydney Pilotage Authority\u201d constituted under the \u201cShipping Act,\u201d ch. 113, R.S.C., sec. 429. The appellant contends that the proceedings of the respondents by which they professed to retire him from the list of pilots licensed to serve as such in Sydney Harbour was wrongful and inoperative in point of legal effect, but that the respondents by these proceedings in fact effectually prevented him serving as and earning the remuneration of a licensed pilot. The respondents in their defence alleged (in paragraph 6) that they \u201chave absolute control\u201d of pilots in Sydney Harbour \u201cand the granting of licences to pilots in said waters with authority to appoint and dismiss such pilots\u201d; and (by paragraph 8) that the appellant \u201cwas not wrongfully dismissed in the month of April, 1912, but that his\nservices * * * were dispensed with at a regular meeting of the said pilotage authority for good and sufficient reasons and no licence was granted to said plaintiff to act as pilot for the season of 1912 and 1913, and said plaintiff was not entitled to receive a licence from said Board.\nThe learned trial judge held that the respondents\u2019 attempt to justify the exclusion of the appellant from the list of pilots failed because any power they possessed to suspend or withdraw the appellant\u2019s licence could only be valid if exercised after proper inquiry which had admittedly not taken place. The full court reversed this judgment on the ground that the act of the respondents was the act of a body exercising judicial functions for which they were not accountable without proof of \u201cmalice.\u201d\nI think this ground of decision cannot be sustained, but before discussing it it is desirable to consider a little more fully what the appellant\u2019s claim really is and the ground upon which it rests.\nIn June, 1912, the appellant was a pilot licensed under the \u201cShipping Act.\u201d The practice (the validity of which will demand a word of discussion) of this particular Pilotage Authority seems to have been to issue licences for a term limited according to the tenor of the licences to one year; and it was stated by the appellant and not disputed that this annual term expired in August of each year. On the 13th of June at a meeting of the Pilotage Authority a resolution was passed which is entered in the minutes in these terms:\u2014\nMoved by Com. Barrington, seconded by Com. Vooght, that the following pilots be dismissed from the service. Carried.\nAnd the appellant\u2019s is the first among the names which follow. The appellant says he was then \u201cnotified to quit\u201d and that he acted on the notice.\nThe first point to consider in the case which the appellant advances is that this action of the Pilotage Authority, assuming it to have been in law inoperative, had nevertheless the intended effect of preventing him exercising his calling as a licensed pilot.\nThis point being of considerable importance I have examined the evidence closely in its bearings upon it and I think the appellant\u2019s contention is fairly made out.\nThat such was the intention has never been disputed and in the pleadings and at the trial the respondents contended that this act was legally effective for the purpose intended; the defendant alleges and Mr. Justice Graham expressly holds, speaking for the majority of the full court, that on the passing of this resolution the appellant \u201cceased to be a licensed pilot.\u201d\nThe \u201cShipping Act\u201d contains provisions making it an offence for a licensed pilot suspended or deprived of his licence or compelled to retire\nto fail to produce or deliver up his licence (sec. 534, see also sec. 451); for any person not a \u201clicensed pilot\u201d to pilot a ship (sec. 535); or for a licensed pilot to \u201cact as a pilot whilst suspended\u201d (sec. 550(d)). There is no evidence that the superintendent of pilots was communicated with; but the appellant no doubt assumed, and rightly assumed, that the respondents would take the steps necessary to give effect to this resolution. Having regard to the consequences which resistance (other than by legal proceedings simply) might entail if it should prove that the respondents were acting within their authority, the appellant acted wisely in not resorting to primitive methods of asserting his rights; and as to legal proceedings\u2014at this stage it is enough to say that a legal contest with officials backed by the resources of the Government is not to be lightly undertaken by people in the appellant\u2019s position.\nThese considerations, together with the conduct of the respondents in October and November, 1913, to which I need not refer in detail, justify, I think, a finding that the respondents did in fact (as they intended to do) by this purported dismissal prevent the appellant from exercising his calling as a licensed pilot at least during the unexpired portion of the pending term.\nThe statement of defence seems to proceed upon the theory that for the purpose of measuring legal responsibility the consequences of this dismissal came to an end with the expiry of the term and that I shall discuss; but for the present it is sufficient to repeat that the dismissal was an act which being not only calculated, but intended to prevent the appellant continuing the exercise of his calling had in fact this intended effect; and the respondents are consequently answerable in damages unless there was in law justification or excuse for what they did. Per Bowen L.J., Mogul S.S. Co. v. McGregor[12].\nThe justification pleaded and relied upon at the trial is stated in the two paragraphs of the statement of defence quoted above. It should be observed that in these paragraphs there is no suggestion that the respondents have exercised a judicial discretion and no such suggestion was made during the course of the trial.\nThe powers of the Pilotage Authority to deprive a licensed pilot of an unexpired license rest upon the provisions of sections 433, 550, 551, 552 and 553 of the \u201cShipping Act.\u201d\nIt is not suggested that any of these sections other than 433 has any relevancy here. Sec. 433 provides:\u2014\n433. Subject to the provisions of this part, or of any Act for the time being in force in its pilotage district, every pilotage authority shall, within its district, have power, from time to time, by by-law confirmed by the Governor-in-Council, to,\u2014\n(d) License pilots and, except in the pilotage district of Quebec, apprentices, and, except in the pilotage districts of Quebec, Montreal, Halifax and St. John, grant certificates to masters and mates to act as pilot, as hereinafter provided:\u2014\n(e) Fix the terms and conditions of granting licences to pilots and, except in the pilotage district of Quebec, apprentices, and, except in the pilotage districts of Quebec, Montreal, Halifax and St. John, the terms and conditions of granting such pilotage certificates, as are in this part mentioned, to masters and mates, and the fees payable for such licences and certificates and to regulate the number of pilots;\n(\u0192) Make regulations for the government of the pilots, and the masters and mates, if any, holding certificates from such pilotage authority, and for ensuring their good conduct and constant attendance to and effectual performance of their duty on board and on shore, and for the government of apprentices, and elsewhere than in the pilotage districts of Quebec, regulating the number of apprentices;\n(g) Make rules for punishing any breach of such regulations by the withdrawal or suspension of the licence or certificate of the person guilty of such breach;\n(h) Fix and alter the mode of remunerating the pilots licensed by such authority, and the amount and description of such remuneration, and the person or authority to whom the same shall be paid subject to the limitation respecting the pilotage district of Quebec in the next following section contained;\n(j) Provide for the compulsory retirement of licensed pilots who have not attained the age of sixty-five years, proved on oath before the pilotage authority to be incapacitated by mental or bodily infirmity or by habits of drunkenness;\nThe by-laws passed under the authority of this section are before us and the only one we need consider is by-law No. 9 in these words:\u2014\nBy-law No. 9.\u2014Any pilot or apprentice incapacitated by mental or bodily infirmity, or by habits of drunkenness, shall forfeit his licence, and not be at liberty to serve in the capacity of a licensed pilot, and any pilot or apprentice guilty of drunkenness and incapacity while on duty shall be suspended for three months.\nThat is the only regulation touching the suspension or forfeiture of a pilot\u2019s certificate or the compulsory retiring of pilots which has been brought to our attention. It professes to make provision for the cases specifically dealt with in sub-section (j) and it can, I think, only go into effect subject to the condition laid down in that sub-section. The more general powers conferred by the earlier sub-sections cannot legitimately be brought into operation in order to declare that the \u201cforfeiture\u201d attached as a consequence by sub-sec. (j) to incapacity arising from the causes therein mentioned and proved as therein provided for, shall arise as a consequence of incapacity in fact whether the same is or is not evidenced as required by that sub-section; and it cannot be contended that an ultra vires by-law becomes valid in consequence of publication by force of sec. 437. It follows that if bylaw 9 is a valid by-law the \u201cforfeiture\u201d takes place only when incapacity has been\nproved on oath before the Pilotage Authority.\n433 (j) obviously imports inquiry of a judicial nature and notice and full opportunity to be heard as essential conditions of any valid decision or executive action upon the evidence adduced. It cannot successfully be invoked in support of the claim of absolute authority set up in the statement of defence. The justification relied on at the trial, therefore, fails.\nIn the Court of Appeal the judgment of the learned trial judge was reversed on the ground that as the Pilotage Authority in the acts complained of was exercising a judicial capacity, the appellant could only succeed by alleging and proving malice in fact. For two reasons that seems inadmissible.\nFirst, it rests, I think, upon some misconception of the character and ground of the appellant\u2019s claim which are that the respondents are answerable in damages for intentionally preventing him pursuing his calling of a licensed pilot without lawful justification or excuse. The respondents not denying but admitting that they had done acts which were intended to have and had the effect of preventing the appellant acting as a licensed pilot, set up as I have said as justification for these acts an absolute power conferred upon them as Pilotage Authority to \u201cdismiss licensed pilots.\u201d It was not alleged that the power was a judicial power or that in doing the acts complained of they in fact exercised judicial functions; and the defendant\u2019s case at the trial failed, I repeat, simply because they were unable to shew the existence of any such absolute authority as that upon which they alleged they had acted. I do not think it was open to the respondents in the court of appeal to change face and take up the position that in what they did they were exercising judicial functions for which they were answerable only on proof of express malice. That is a position which ought to have been taken in the pleadings or at least at the trial when the appellant if so minded could have raised the question whether the respondents had acted otherwise than in good faith in the interests of the public service. The evidence now in the record is not calculated to convince one that the prosecution of a claim founded upon such a charge would have been a hopeless enterprise.\nSecondly, assuming the respondents are entitled to rest upon the position in which they succeeded in the full court, I think the defence fails on the merits in both law and fact on the evidence as it now stands.\nI have already said enough to shew that as the facts present themselves to my mind, it is sufficiently established that there was in (fact no exercise of judicial function or of authority resting upon a judicial decision under section 433 (j).\nAs to the law, assuming there had been an intention to exercise authority under by-law 9 since there was no hearing, no evidence on oath, no judicial determination, it follows that no \u201cforfeiture,\u201d to use the language of the by-law, took place and consequently there is nothing amounting to a justification of the so called dismissal; which is, therefore, an actionable wrong under the principle of the Mogul Steamship Company\u2019s Case[13]. Moreover, the rule is sufficiently established that persons in the position of the respondents exercising quasi-judicial powers are only protected from civil liability if they observe the statutory rules conditioning their powers as well as the rules of natural justice. Wood v. Wood[14]; Riopelle v. City of Montreal[15], and see the judgment of Buckley L.J. in Ex parte Arlidge[16], and the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Herron v. Rathmines and Rathgar Improvement Commissioners[17], at page 523.\nI have not, of course, overlooked the argument of Mr. Rogers founded upon authorities relating to the responsibility of the judicial officers strictly so called, judges of the inferior courts and magistrates. Generally, no doubt, in the absence of had faith such judicial officers are not responsible for harm caused by acts otherwise wrongful when such acts are judicial acts done in the course of some judicial proceeding in which the officer has jurisdiction as regards the persons affected, and the matter before him is some matter with which he has authority judicially to deal. No authority has been cited, however, for the extension of this principle to protect administrative officers such as the respondents from the consequences of injurious acts for which authority is wanting owing to the omission of the essential statutory prerequisites. Even as regards the acts of judicial officers strictly so called in respect of matters in which there is jurisdiction over the person affected as well as over the subject matter where the jurisdiction is purely statutory, the statutory conditions must be observed at the peril of the officer, assuming, at all events, that he is under no mistake as to the facts. Thus, a magistrate being empowered by a statute to issue a warrant on complaint in writing before him on oath, the issue of a warrant in the absence of evidence on oath is an act for the consequences of which he is civilly responsible. Morgan v. Hughes[18]; see also Jones v. Gurdon[19].\nThere remains the question of damages. A preliminary point arises touching the appellant\u2019s tenure of office. The practice of the Sydney Pilotage Authority (we have no information as to the origin of it) lias been apparently, as I have said, to issue licences expressed to be for a term of one year. I can find no authority in the statute for imposing this limitation. In the by-laws produced there is nothing touching the point and having regard to the express provisions of section 454, I think that section 433(e) relating to \u201cthe terms and conditions of granting licences\u201d does not authorize the imposition of any limit upon the duration of the term for which the license is to be in force. The relevant statutory provisions appear to be sections 445, 448, 452, and 454. (It may be observed in passing that the judgment of the trial judge seems to involve a finding that the appellant was not within the operation of section 462. An application before the delivery of judgment in this appeal for leave to adduce further evidence on this point was rejected on the ground that no adequate reason was shewn for the admission of further evidence at that stage.)\nSection 454 authorizes pilotage authorities to limit the period for which any licence shall be in force to a period of not less than two years. But our attention has not been called to any authority for limiting the period to one year. I am inclined to think that the words inserted in the licence granted to the appellant professing to provide that the licence shall only be in force for one year must be treated as inoperative. But, at all events, if it must be assumed that the Pilotage Authority intended to grant a valid licence, and if the proper assumption is that the intention was to grant a licence only for the minimum period permitted by the law, then, on that assumption, each of the licences must be treated as a licence valid for a period of two years.\nOn these assumptions the appellant\u2019s licence held by him in June, 1912, did not expire until August, 1913, and the position taken by the respondents in their statement of defence and sustained by the full court that the appellant ceased in law to be a licensed pilot after June, 1912, necessarily fails.\nAssuming that the proper course is to treat the appellant\u2019s licence as a licence limited as to duration under section 454, and that the discretion to renew, conferred upon the Pilotage Authority by sub-section (b) of that section, is an absolute and not a judicial discretion; it would still, I think, be wrong to deal with the question of damages on the footing of the consequences of the proceedings in 1912 having ceased to operate with the expiry of the licence in August, 1913. The proceedings in evidence in August, October and November of 1913, shew that the majority of the Board insisted at that time on treating the appellant as compulsorily retired from the service and disqualified from holding a licence. This loss of status and the prejudice thereby occasioned him in his character of applicant for a licence in August, 1913, is one of the consequences natural and intended of the respondents\u2019 conduct in respect of which the appellant is entitled to reparation.\nOn this footing the appellant would not be entitled to recover compensation nominatim for the loss of prospective earnings in the season of 1913-14. But without deciding whether or not the appellant\u2019s position was that of a licensee with a licence limited as to time under section 454, I still think the damages found by the learned trial judge are not excessive. Apart altogether from the right to reparation just mentioned this is emphatically not a case for measuring damages with nicety.\nThere was some suggestion, although I do not think it was seriously pressed, that substantial damages ought not to be awarded on the ground that the evidence shews the appellant\u2019s habits to have been so notorious that, if there had been an investigation conducted as the law required, the respondents must have reached the conclusion judicially that the appellant was incapacitated as an inebriate. But the findings of the learned trial judge dispose of this contention effectually. Not only does the finding as to damages tacitly involve a rejection of any such contention, but the learned judge explicitly holds that the appellant had successfully repelled the attack upon his character. The statements of some of the respondents must be evaluated in light of the fact that they were seeking some refuge from legal responsibility and of the strong suspicion, not to say probability, that the respondents as a whole whatever may have been their beliefs as to the appellant\u2019s conduct, were not free in the impeached proceedings from the influence of other motives than a desire to elevate the character of the pilotage service. In this aspect of the case it is eminently one in which the view of the trial judge ought to guide a court of appeal. Two further points are suggested.\nFirst, that the acts by which the respondents professed to \u201cdismiss\u201d the appellant from the service being legally void no damages can be recovered. Secondly, that the appellant should have had recourse to mandamus and can only recover such damages as could not have been prevented by resorting to that remedy. As to the first of these points. This is not a case like Wood v. Woad[20], where a member of a partnership complained of an illegal decision of a domestic tribunal professing to exclude him from the benefits of the partnership. This decision having been invalid in law and no special damage having been proved, it was held that as damage was the gist of the plaintiff\u2019s action he must fail. It is unnecessary to repeat what I have said above in order to dispose of this point.\nAs to the second: I have already said sufficient to indicate my view that the respondents cannot complain that the appellant did not take legal proceedings to compel them specifically to execute their duties or rather to refrain from wronging him in order to reduce the damages to which he might eventually prove to be entitled. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014I assume, as was contended on their behalf, that when acting within the ambit of the jurisdiction conferred upon them, the defendants are entitled to the immunities of a quasi-judicial body. But after a careful consideration of the duties and powers of the Pilotage Authority, their relations to pilots, the relevant provisions of the \u201cCanada Shipping Act,\u201d and all the circumstances of the present ease, I have reached the conclusion that in directing the cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s licence, the defendants neither acted, nor professed to act in the discharge of a quasi-judicial function, but exercised an assumed absolute and arbitrary power to dismiss the plaintiff or to cancel his licence, without complaint, notice or investigation. Having regard to sections 433(j), 514, 550(e), 552 and 553 of the \u201cCanada Shipping Act\u201d (R.S.C., eh. 113), I think it is clear that the Pilotage Authority did not possess any such absolute power. The relationship of master and servant does not exist between the Board and the pilot. The Board has a statutory control over the licensing of pilots within the territory for which it is constituted. Its jurisdiction to cancel a pilot\u2019s licence is also statutory and arises only after it has been satisfied either by a quasi-judicial investigation, held after fair notice has been given the pilot and he has had a reasonable opportunity to make his defence (and in cases not within sections 552-3 it would seem that the Board must take testimony upon oath), or by the production of a conviction thereof made by a competent tribunal, that the commission of an offence subjecting the pilot to cancellation of his licence has been established. The plaintiff had a clear and definite interest in the earnings of the body of pilots to which he belonged. His sharing in those earnings depended upon the continuance of his licence. The principles which govern the action of such a body as the Pilotage Authority in dealing with charges which, if established, may entail forfeiture of licence, are those which the courts have applied in such cases as Lapointe v. L\u2019Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la Police de Montreal[21], at page 539; Fisher v. Keane[22]; Labouch\u00e8re v. Earl of Wharncliffe[23]; Beland v. L\u2019Union St. Thomas[24].\nThere is some evidence which indicates that the defendants\u2019 action in cancelling the plaintiff\u2019s licence was induced by motives other than zeal for the public welfare, and a finding of malice on their part would not entirely lack support. It is, however, unnecessary to deal with this aspect of the case.\nIn ordering the cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s licence the defendants, in my opinion, proceeded without jurisdiction. They committed an unwarranted and illegal act which subjected them to liability to the plaintiff for such damages as he sustained as a natural and direct consequence thereof.\nThe learned trial judge assessed these damages at $1,800. The plaintiff\u2019s loss was, no doubt, substantial; but, with respect, I incline to think the evidence does not warrant so large a verdict. The plaintiff was bound to minimize his loss by seeking other employment. This he does not appear to have made any great effort to obtain. His conduct was by no means above reproach and it may be that the cancellation of his licence was not undeserved. Had the Board proceeded judicially and in accord with the requirements of natural justice its action could not have been reviewed. It is certainly difficult, however, to determine with any degree of accuracy what amount of compensation should be awarded. My learned colleagues, with whom I agree in allowing this appeal, think the plaintiff entitled to the full amount of the damages awarded by the learned trial judge. It may be that as wrongdoers the defendants are not in a position to ask that the amount of the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled should be closely scrutinized. Their course of action was undoubtedly high-handed. On the whole, while not entirely satisfied with the amount allowed, I am not prepared to dissent on the quantum of damages.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Finlay Macdonald.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Joseph Macdonald.\n[1] 48 N.S.

V., c. 71, s. 5 (B.C.)\nBy an agreement, executed in 1898, H. agreed to sell to A. and S. certain subsidy lands of a railway company and it was therein provided that the moiety of the lands should be subsequently conveyed to H. but no formal instrument was ever executed for the purpose of vesting this interest in him. In 1912, an agreement was entered into by all the persons interested in the lands and the Crown for the re-purchase by the Government of British Columbia of the unsold portions of the lands and this latter agreement was validated by the \"Railway Subsidy Lands Re-purchase Act,\" 2 Geo. V., ch. 37 (B.C.) (to which it was annexed as a schedule), which declared that the provisions of the agreement were to be construed as if expressly thereby enacted. The agreement so validated declared, in recitals therein, that H. was entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the lands in virtue of the agreement executed in 1898, that the portions thereof conveyed to the Crown were subject thereto, and that the title should pass to the Crown subject to such estate or interest.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (20 B.C.

On an appeal to a special Court of Revision appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council this assessment was confirmed and the judgment of that court was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., and Wallace K.C., for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the notes of Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J. concurred with Duff J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal resting upon section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" relative to the assessment for taxation of a certain interest which the original appellant was alleged to have had, in 1913, in certain lands in British Columbia.\nThe original appellant, now dead and represented by present appellant, owned the entire stock of the Columbia and Western Railway Company which had earned a large land subsidy under 59 Vict., ch. 8, of the Statutes of British Columbia and also owned a number of other properties. He, in February, 1898, entered into an agreement with Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy to sell them these other properties and said stock of said company for the price or consideration of eight hundred thousand dollars and their agreement that the moiety of said land subsidy should be conveyed to him, Heinze, when and how he should direct and the other moiety should be the property of the said company.\nThe agreement provided by many details for securing the payment of the liabilities of the company and the charges against the said other properties.\nThe agreement was so framed that the other properties and stock should be acquired free from liability and without being in any way complicated by the provisions dealing with the land subsidy and division thereof. That land subsidy was free from taxes in the hands of the company for ten years, which did not expire till October, 1911, and the original appellant, for that very obvious reason, did not desire to have them sooner transferred to him than he desired.\nFor some reason or other Angus and Shaughnessy, who it is alleged (and the sequel shows) represented the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. did not desire to keep the matter open so long. And they attempted to bring about a partition, by a partition suit, and therein amongst other things to terminate their trust. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that neither form of relief could thus be granted under the said agreement against the will of the said Heinze.\nThis court, on appeal thereto, in 1909 (Angus v. He\u00ecnze[2], maintained that position.\nBecause of what, I respectfully submit, was either an unfortunate expression of the reasons given by the only judge in this court assigning reasons for the dismissal of the said appeal, or misapprehension of these by the courts below, it was when the time came that these lands, or any interest therein, might properly be taxed, alleged that this court had declared that said original appellant had no equitable interest in the moiety of the undivided land subsidy.\nThe courts below apparently accepted that interpretation put upon said judgment and assumed that he had none but such as depended upon the legislative enactment I am about to refer to.\nSaid Angus and Shaughnessy having failed in said partition suit, the said railway company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, which Angus and Shaughnessy seem to have represented, and the British Columbia Southern Railway Company, on the 31st January, 1912, entered into an agreement with respondent whereby, amongst other things, the unsold part of said lands earned as subsidy by the Columbia and Western Railway Company, which had been granted to said company should be, pursuant to a statutory option relative thereto, reconveyed to the respondent for the price or sum of forty cents an acre to be computed on the basis of one-half of the total area so reconveyed but subject nevertheless to the rights of said Heinze in the other moiety of said lands.\nThe Crown by virtue of said agreement, and an Act of the Legislature of British Columbia confirming same, acquired said lands subject to the interest of said Heinze therein under the said agreement first mentioned.\nIt is the said interest of said Heinze in said lands which has been assessed by virtue of an Act passed by said legislature and known as \"Taxation Act Amendment Act, 1913,\" and from that assessment this appeal has been taken.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on appeal to it from the Court of Revision, maintained the assessment.\nThe section providing for that assessment is as follows:\u2014\n(2) Where the title of any land has become vested in His Majesty in right of the province, subject to any estate or interest therein of any person, or where the title to any lands is vested in His Majesty and it appears that any person had, prior to the vesting of such title in His Majesty, acquired or had such a right, whether legal or equitable, to an interest in such lands as would be enforceable against a private individual if such title were vested in a private individual, and such person has such right though he may not have actually acquired such interest, it shall be lawful for the as sessor to assess the interest of such person or the right of such person to an interest in such lands by estimating the value of the whole of said lands at their cash value per acre, and the proportion thereof representing the value of the interest or of the right to an interest of such person shall be set down by the assessor upon his roll.\nThis seems to have been designed to meet the very case of Heinze's interest in the lands in question.\nThere never could have been a doubt of Heinze having acquired or rather retained an equitable interest in the said lands under the first mentioned agreement, but for the possibly arguable question of the capacity of the company to become bound in such way as sought to be accomplished thereby.\nI should, however, feel inclined to hold that the absolute owner of a company might, where no other claims of any kind existed in or against the company, and no one in existence to be injured by or to complain of such a mode of dealing, stipulate with his vendees for the reservation to himself of part of the lands of the company and that a court of equity could and would so long as no third party had acquired any right against the company hold the vendees had thereby become his trustees and enforce the agreement accordingly.\nIt is the constant habit of courts of equity in looking at the ordinary transactions and relations of vendors and vendees to treat the vendee as the equitable owner and the vendor or other possessor of the legal estate as trustee for him.\nThe owner of such an equity can so long as he discharges his own obligations depend upon the courts of equity protecting him without his being driven to an action for damages as his only remedy.\nBut to put that beyond peradventure it is admitted, as part of this case, that in April, 1906, the said company and the said Angus and Shaughnessy signed a notice to Heinze expressly acknowledging that said lands had been then granted by the Crown to said company and recognizing the right and interest therein of said Heinze under the said agreement of 1898, and that he was entitled to a moiety of said lands as provided therein and proposing a partition of said land so as to give him his said moiety.\nHis reply thereto, also made part of the admissions in the case, shows that his only objection to acceding thereto was the possibility of his being taxable therefor in case of a division; whereas the company could not be so taxable.\nI am, therefore, unable to understand how it ever could have been supposed that Heinze had no equitable interest in said lands.\nSuch an interest I conceive may become the subject of taxation and of direct taxation of land within the province.\nI can understand how by reason of their having been no joint interest either legal or equitable and no clear right in Angus and Shaughnessy or any one else to insist on the termination of the relationship created by the agreement till, within the terms thereof, he, Heinze, had expressed how and when it should terminate and its determination might have been to his detriment any such right could not be asserted by way of a partition suit.\nThe denial of that relief by way of partition was all that was involved in the decision relied upon save the minor question of the trustee passing his accounts.\nI may reiterate once more that a decision of any court relative to what is before it for judicial determination is what binds as authority and not the possibly irrelevant reasons assigned for coming to such decision.\nIn justice to myself I may be permitted to add that the report of the case does not correctly represent me. The records show I filed no opinion or concurrence and only one other judge than he writing appears of record to have concurred therein, in the usual mode when intending to agree in the reasons as well as result.\nThe result is, I am sure, a misapprehension for which I may not be blameless in failing to file a memorandum expressing how I desired to treat the opinion in question.\nI have no doubt of the legislative power to declare, as I think the confirming Act does, Heinze entitled or to declare him assessable in the manner the later Act sets forth.\nHis non-residence might prevent steps being taken to collect the rates abroad, but that cannot affect the undoubted right of the legislature to limit his rights in claiming from the Crown the recognition by grant or otherwise of his interest and charging it with the amount of the taxes as provided by the statute.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the appellant's rights originating in the agreement of the 11th of February, 1891, are now assessable as constituting an interest in land under the British Columbia Statute, 1913, ch. 71, sec. 2.\nBy chapter 8 of the statutes of British Columbia for 1896, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered to aid the construction of the Columbia and Western Railway by a land grant. Section 8 of that chapter exempted this land grant from taxation until the expiration of ten years from the date of the acquisition of it by the company or until alienated by lease, agreement for sale or otherwise by the company.\nThe Columbia and Western Railway was divided into six sections. Sections one, three and four were constructed, but there was no construction on sections two, five and six. In respect of sections one and three the company earned 1,603,312 acres, of which 794,440 acres were granted on or about the 17th day of April, 1908. To these lands the exemption applies.\nThe residue of the subsidy earned, namely, 808,872 acres, could not be granted under the Act of 1896 as the lands were not designated and surveyed within seven years from the passing of the Act, as required by section 5.\nThis state of affairs led to the passing of chapter 9 of the statutes of 1906 whereby the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered to grant and did grant to the company this residue of 808,872 acres. By section 3 of that statute the exemption of these lands from taxation expired on the 3rd October, 1911.\nIn February, 1898, F. August Heinze, owned or controlled the capital stock of the Columbia and Western Railway Company. Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy, acting in the interests of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, acquired this property from Heinze under an agreement executed in that month.\nIt was part of the arrangement between the parties that the benefit of an undivided half of the land sub sidy earned at the date of the transfer should be secured to Heinze. The stipulations for securing this are a little complicated and in some respects perhaps not easy to comprehend; but while Heinze no doubt had in view the condition imposed by the subsidy Act that the exemption from taxation should cease upon alienation in any manner of the subsidy lands by the company, still the agreement provided clearly enough that either the company or Heinze should be entitled to a partition of any portion of the subsidy lands affected by the agreement as soon as such portion should be granted to the company by the Crown. The Columbia and Western Railway Co. was not a party to the agreement. In Angus v. Heinze[3], an action by Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy for a partition was dismissed, this court taking the view that under the agreement of February, 1898, alone, Heinze had acquired neither a legal nor an equitable interest in the lands in question.\nIt would, I think, not be open to doubt that Heinze's rights under the agreement constituted an interest in the lands if it had appeared that they had been vested in Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy for the purpose of enabling them to carry out the agreement. We are not informed whether this was done and it may be assumed that, when the agreement of 1912 was executed, Heinze was not in possession of any \"interest\" within the meaning of the statute of 1913.\nThe agreement of 1912 was made a schedule to chapter 37 of the statutes of that year; and to ascertain the effect of them they must be read together. I reproduce the statute in full and the material parts of the agreement:\u2014\nSTATUTES OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, 1912.\nChapter 37.\nAn Act Respecting the Repurchase by the Crown of Certain Railway\nSubsidy Lands.\n(27th February, 1912.)\nWhereas by the \"Railway Subsidy Lands Re-purchase Act,\" being chapter 198 of the \"Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1911,\" the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered to enter into conditional agreements to acquire for the province, by re-purchase, exchange, or otherwise, any lands theretofore or thereafter granted by the Crown in the right of British Columbia in aid of the construction of railways:\nAnd whereas, pursuant to the provisions of the said statute, a conditional agreement has been entered into between His Majesty's Government and the Canadian Pacific, British Columbia Southern, and the Columbia and Western Railway Companies for the re-purchase by the Crown of certain unsold portions of the lands granted in aid of the construction of the British Columbia Southern and the Columbia and Western Railways:\nAnd whereas it is expedient to ratify the said agreement pursuant to the provisions of the said \"Railway Subsidy Lands Repurchase Act\":\nTherefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. The agreement, a copy of which forms the schedule to this Act, made between His Majesty the King, represented by the Honourable the Premier of British Columbia and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the British Columbia Southern Railway Company and the Columbia and Western Railway Company is hereby ratified and confirmed and declared to be legally binding, according to the tenor thereof, upon the parties thereto; and the said parties to the said agreement are hereby authorized and empowered to do whatever is necessary to give full effect to the said agreement, the provisions of which are to be taken as if they had been expressly enacted hereby and formed an integral part of this Act.\nSCHEDULE.\nAnd whereas, by agreement bearing date the 11th day of February, 1898, and made between F. August Heinze of the one part, and Richard B. Angus and Thomas G. Shaughnessy of the other part, the said Heinze became entitled to an undivided one-half interest in certain portions of the said Crown grants to the Columbia and Western Railway Company, containing approximately 615,600 acres, and detailed in the document hereunto annexed, marked \"Schedule B\" hereto, and signed by the parties hereto.\n2. The Columbia and Western Railway Company agrees to sell and convey to the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia, and the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia agrees to purchase, all those portions of the lands of which the Columbia and Western Railway Company has obtained Crown grants or of which it is entitled to Crown grants, as set out in the recitals hereto, and which the said company has not sold or contracted to sell at the date of this agreement, reserving, however, to the said company all timber upon the lands covered by timber permits in force at the date of this agreement and during the existence of each respective timber permit, particulars of which are shown in the statement hereto attached, marked \"Schedule C\" hereto, and signed by the parties hereto, but so that, with the expiration of each respective timber permit, the timber remaining upon the land in such permit comprised shall revert to the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia; and subject to the estate and interest held by F. August Heinze under the agreement bearing date the 11th day of February, 1898, hereinbefore mentioned, in portions of the said lands containing approximately 615,600 acres, the details whereof are shown in Schedule B hereto. The lands to be conveyed under this paragraph being estimated to contain approximately 1,514,832.66 acres.\n4. The Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia agrees to pay to the said Columbia and Western Railway Company compensation at the rate of forty cents per acre for all the lands to be sold and conveyed by the said company to the Crown pursuant to paragraph 2 hereof, excepting from the computation of the amount payable under this paragraph one-half of the total area in which the said F. August Heinze is entitled to an undivided one-half interest, as detailed in Schedule B hereto, under the terms of the agreement hereinbefore mentioned; the said compensation to be payable on the execution and delivery of conveyances of the said lands, subject to the interest of the said F. August Heinze therein, and otherwise free from encumbrances.\n6. The Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia agrees to accept the conveyance of the lands mentioned in paragraph 2 hereof, subject to the estate and interest of the said F. August Heinze, his heirs and assigns, therein; and so that the estate and interest of the said F. August Heinze, his heirs and assigns, in the said lands and his right to a conveyance or partition thereof shall not be impaired by the execution and delivery of this agreement, and the Crown will not refuse or neglect to grant, convey or partition the interest of the said Heinze in the said lands upon proof of right, title and interest.\nIf Heinze had been a party to this agreement of 1912 it would hardly be susceptible of dispute that his rights in relation to the lands in question under the agreement of February, 1898, had become binding on the Crown or that they constituted an \"interest\" in those lands in the sense of the Act of 1913. It is argued and this argument raises the substantial point for decision that the declarations touching Heinze's rights and the stipulations contained in the clauses quoted above must be read as contractual stipulations in an agreement inter partes and intended to have no other effect; and that it is only as contractual stipulations that the statute recognizes and sanctions them. It follows, of course, if this be accepted, unless it could be argued that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company or the Columbia and Western Railway Company were trustees for Heinze in entering into the contract (of which there is no evidence) that these provisions having legal effect only as contractual stipulations inter partes confer no rights upon Heinze who was not a party to them.\nRead literally the words\nthe provisions of which (of the agreement) are to be taken as if they had been expressly enacted hereby and formed an integral part of this Act\nwould seem to give the force of statutory declarations to the recitals,\nthe said Heinze became entitled to an undivided one-half interest in certain portions of the said Crown grants ; and to import a declaration that portions of the lands conveyed to the Crown were \"subject to\" an estate or interest\nheld by F. August Heinze under the agreement bearing date the 11th February, 1898,\nas well as a further declaration that the title passed to the Crown\nsubject to the estate and interest of the said F. August Heinze, his heirs and assigns therein.\nAnd the words quoted from the statute, literally read and applied to paragraph 6 of the schedule, involve a declaration that Heinze had at the time of the passing of the statute an interest in the lands in question. It is urged, however, that, treating the agreement as an integral part of the statute and as \"expressly enacted\" thereby, it still must be read as an agreement and the various provisions of it interpreted and given effect to as the provisions of an agreement.\nThe argument has considerable force. But this construction does, I think, deprive the words of the Act of some part of their literal effect and when the statute is read, as it must be read, in light of the documents and the other facts mentioned in the statute and the agreement themselves, I think it is a construction which cannot be accepted.\nWe must assume that the parties to the agreement had in view the protection of the interests, on the one hand of Heinze and on the other of Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy. These last mentioned gentlemen had entered into covenants with Heinze by which they were personally bound, but concerning the fulfilment of which there could, of course, be no doubt so long as the lands remained under control of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. These lands were now to be transferred to the Provincial Government. An effectual way of protecting at one and the same time the interests of these gentlemen as well as the interests of Heinze was to provide that the title acquired by the Crown should be charged with the obligations that had been entered into by Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy.\nI think the passages quoted above from the agreement of 1912 do sufficiently declare that the title of the Crown is burdened with these obligations and that paragraph 6 is intended to be a specific declaration that the Crown assumes that burden. The purpose of the parties being to protect the interests mentioned it would be a singular thing if they had set about doing it by means of contractual declarations and stipulations of which neither Heinze on the one hand nor Messrs. Angus and Shaughnessy on the other, not being parties to the contract, could avail themselves.\nI think the proper inference is that the statute is intended to take effect according to the literal meaning of the words used.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hamilton & Wragge.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott, Maclean & Shandley.\n[1] 20 B.C.

Cole, (1915) 52 S.C.R. 176\nDate: 1915-11-02\nHamilton Read (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJoseph Cole (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1915: October 18; 1915: November 2.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nOn Appeal From The Court of Appeal For British Columbia.\nSolicitor and client\u2014Fiduciary relationship\u2014Transfer of lands\u2014Joint negotiations\u2014Agreement to share profits\u2014Intervention of third party\u2014Solicitor's separate advantage\u2014Bonus from third party\u2014Obligation to account to client.\nThe Government of British Columbia had unsuccessfully attempted, through the agency of A., to obtain a transfer of the rights of a band of Indians in the Kitsilano Reserve. About a year afterwards C. became interested in the matter and arranged with R., a solicitor, that they should undertake to obtain the required transfer on the understanding that any profits made out of the transaction should be equally divided between them. Long negotiations with the band took place without any definite result, when, without the consent of C., through the intervention of A. at the request of R., the transfer was obtained and R. received a sum of money from A. as a share of the profits realized on carrying the transaction through. In an action by C. to recover one-half of the amount so received by R.,\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (20 B.C. Rep. 365), that throughout the whole transactions the fiduciary relationship of solicitor and client had continued between R. and C. and, consequently, that R. was obliged to account to C. for what he had received from A. as remuneration for services in connection with the business which they had jointly undertaken in order to obtain the transfer of the title from the Indians.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head\u2014note and the questions in issue on the appeal are referred to in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie for the appellant.\nJ. W. deB. Farris for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was an action brought by the respondent against the appellant (defendant) for a share of a commission received from the sale of lands. The plaintiff alleged an agreement with the defendant to use his influence with certain Indians to secure their consent to a sale of their reserve to the Provincial Government, and if successful he was to receive $20,000 as his commission. The defendant denied the alleged agreement and denied that he ever received any commission from the Government for services rendered in connection with the sale. The trial judge found in favour of the defendant. The case turned apparently upon the question whether a third party named Alexander, who received a commission from the Government, was an alter ego of Read. The trial judge held that this was not established. This judgment was reversed by the full court, Martin J. dissenting. The defendant now appeals.\nThe case for the appellant is that, accepting the version of the transaction as given by witness Alexander, the deal was off on the Saturday, and that he, Alexander, took it up again on the Monday following at the direct request of the Indians and independently of all that had previously transpired. When it was subsequently put through Alexander, being then alone interested in the transaction, paid out of the profits which he made not a commission but a bonus to the defendant. It is urged that whatever may have been the previous relations between Read and the Government they had ceased on the Saturday.\nIn my opinion Read should be held as a trustee in view of his professional relations with Cole. He would never have been brought into the transaction were it not for Cole, and on the whole evidence I am satisfied that the sale effected by Alexander, who had previously failed to secure a surrender of the Indian title, was the consequence of the previous negotiations carried on by Read and Cole in respect to which Read was bound to pay Cole $20,000. I entirely agree with the Court of Appeal that judgment should go for that sum.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. concurred with Duff J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014A perusal of the evidence herein and careful consideration thereof and especially the admitted facts and circumstances presented therein do not lead me to the conclusion that respondent entirely failed, as pretended by appellant, in accomplishing what they had jointly agreed upon attempting but, on the contrary, that he had practically succeeded in bringing about all but the formal conclusion of the bargain with the Indians; and that formal part he was prevented from assisting in by the curious conduct of appellant.\nAny other view must imply that the lavish com- mission the Government allowed to be included in the price was little short of scandalous in light of the marvelous celerity and unanimity with which the Indians got through with the pow-wow and the signing of their surrender.\nIt seems inconceivable that such an afternoon's work alone could be so handsomely compensated for unless upon the hypothesis that much labour had preceeded it.\nAppellant was confessedly ignorant of the Indians and everything relating to them till respondent sought him out as a solicitor in a position to be possibly helpful to pave the way for respondent's efforts being made to bear fruit, and instructed him accordingly.\nAlexander seems to have been brought into the matter as a person who had tried and failed a year previously but apparently of necessity had to be conciliated.\nHe has been compensated accordingly. Securing him as an assistant or instrumental agent was only a step in the pursuit of that at which the parties hereto aimed.\nDisagreeable surmises may arise in one's mind in surveying the unpleasant features of the whole transaction, but I cannot see how we can well do otherwise than assent to the reasoning upon which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Irving have proceeded in the court below.\nIf the parties hereto and Mr. Alexander, magnifying their importance, or the importance of their services, have misled the Crown by making misrepresentations to the Attorney-General as to the value of their services, then it might well be that none of them are entitled to anything in law. The appellant has not presented, indeed could not present with hopes of success for himself, such a defence. If it turns out as the result of this litigation that such a surmise is well founded and the Crown imposed upon, the remedy lies with the Attorney-General. On this case as presented we are helpless in that regard.\nI think, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have no difficulty in this case in concluding that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is right and that the present appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIndeed, there is considerable reason to think that the appellant is fortunate in not having been compelled to account for the whole sum received by him after deducting a reasonable allowance for professional services. The respondent approached the appellant as solicitor, exposed to him, as his solicitor, the business in respect of which the appellant's professional assistance was required. At the appellant's suggestion the respondent consented to an arrangement by which they became jointly interested in that business. That was an arrangement which it was the appellant's duty not to permit the respondent to conclude with him, his professional adviser, without insisting upon independent advice being obtained. The respondent has not impeached the arrangement on this ground, but the relation of the parties has a most important bearing when the reciprocal rights and the duties of the parties under the arrangement come to be considered. The relation between the parties being such as it was, and the appellant having allowed the respondent to leave his interests entirely in the appellant's hands, the appellant could not be heard to say that he failed to do what the most rudimentary notions of professional duty required him to do; namely, to include in the arrangement between him and the respondent every stipulation which reasonable prudence might suggest for the respondent's protection.\nHe cannot be allowed to say that the agreement in fact permitted him to act so unfairly towards the respondent as he now pretends he is entitled to do, to appropriate the entire profit of the business into which he was introduced as the respondent's solicitor to the entire exclusion of the respondent.\nI do not think the respondent's claim can properly be treated as resting merely upon an agreement to pay a commission on a certain result being obtained, but, even on that basis, the appellant manifestly fails when the facts are looked at broadly. The conception of the respondent's rights put forward by the appellant is absurdity itself, the conception, that is to say, that the appellant's rights rest upon the condition that the Indians should be induced to execute an agreement with the appellant, eo nomine, for the \"sale of their rights.\" The so-called \"option\" in itself (as any reasonably intelligent person who had taken the slightest trouble to inform himself of the status of the Indians must have known) could not be a thing of any legal substance; such a document could possess importance only as evidencing the terms by which the Indians were willing to consent to a transfer of the reservation. Its value consisted in the fact that the persons desiring to purchase the reservation were willing to pay a reward for obtaining it. The thing of substance was to get the consent of the Indians in order to earn this reward. Whether the consent was given in the form of an option granted to the appellant, eo nomine, or an option granted to somebody else (so long as it should be accepted as sufficiently evidencing consent and giving the appellant a title to the expected reward) was a matter of absolute indifference. The condition in substance was performed, the consent was obtained, the reward was paid and the sum received was no less than the sum that would have been received if the so-called option had been taken in the appellant's own name instead of the name of Mr. Alexander.\nThe respondent's title to relief, even on this basis, is thus complete.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I think the correct conclusion from the whole evidence is that which the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal appears to have reached, namely, that the sale effected nominally through Alexander was in reality the very sale in respect of which Read admits that he had agreed to pay the plaintiff Cole $20,000. Read's course of conduct in this matter, having regard to his professional status and his relations to the plaintiff, was indefensible. But still more amazing, if the story told by both parties to this action be true, was the assurance said to have been given by a member of the Government of British Columbia that if the twenty Indians interested in the Kitsilano Reserve could be got to give options for the acquisition of their rights in it for a payment to them of $10,000 apiece the Government would purchase such options for the sum of $300,000.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action for commission concerning the sale of Kitsilano Indian Reserve.\nCole, the plaintiff respondent, was trying to induce the Indians, owners of that reserve, to sell their rights. He had an interview with Mr. Bowser, Attorney-General of British Columbia, at his legal office in British Columbia, who intimated that the Government was prepared to purchase.\nCole wanted to have an option prepared in connection with the proposed sale of the reservation. He was directed by Mr. Bowser to confer with Hamilton Read, an employee in his office, who took his instructions. The option, however, was not prepared immediately; but some other interviews took place between Read and Cole and it was agreed that they should share the profits which would be made if the deal went through. Formal meetings of the Indians were called, and at one of those meetings some of the Indians wanted to consult with Mr. Alexander, a prominent citizen of Vancouver, who had always entertained friendly relations with them.\nThe appellant Read came back from that meeting, put himself in communication with Mr. Alexander, and it was understood between the two that they would divide the profits of the sale. An option was then prepared in Mr. Alexander's name which was signed by the Indians. The lands were sold to the Government and after the amount was paid a sum of about $80,000, representing the profits of the transaction, was divided between Mr. Alexander and Read. Cole now sues to have his share in the profits which Read realized.\nRead became connected with this matter as Cole's solicitor, and their relations are those of solicitor and client, relations which have never been terminated. If Read has thought fit to make a deal with some other persons he has acted contrary to the mandate which it was his duty to execute.\nThe Court of Appeal found that he should give to Cole a share of the profits which he made on the sale of those lands. I cannot see how he could escape from being condemned to pay that share.\nIn these circumstances, the judgment condemning him to pay that share should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper, Kitto & Wightman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Farris & Emerson.\n[1] 20 B.C.

VII., c. 24, s.s. 7 (Alta.); 4 Geo. V., c. 2, s. 9; 5 Geo. V., c. 2, s. 25 (Alta.)\u2014Retrospective legislation\u2014Illegality of contract\u2014Remission\u2014Recovery of money paid\u2014Right of action\u2014Practice\u2014 Pleading\u2014Appeal. The effect of the amendment to the Alberta \"Land Titles Act,\" 6 Edw. VII., ch. 24, by 1 Geo. V., ch. 4, sec. 15(25), adding the seventh sub-section to section 124 of that Act, is to prohibit sales of lands subdivided into lots according to plans of subdivision until after the registration of the plans in the proper land titles office and also to render any sales made in contravention of the prohibition inoperative.\nThe vindicatory sanction imposed by the statute is directed against the vendor and where there is no presumption of knowledge of the invalidity on the part of the purchaser he cannot be deemed in pari delicto with the vendor and is not deprived of the right of action to set aside the agreement and recover back moneys paid thereunder.\nAfter the judgment appealed from had been rendered the statute was further amended (5 Geo. V., ch. 2, sec. 25) by the addition of sub-section 8(a) providing that the seventh sub-section could not be pleaded or relied upon in any civil action or proceeding by a party to any such agreement when the plan in question had been registered before the action or proceeding was instituted or where it was the duty of the party pleading to make such registration. Held, that, as the last amending Act was not a statute declaratory of the law as it stood at the time when the judgment appealed from was rendered, and as appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada are not of the nature of re-hearings to which the principle of the decision in Quitter v. Mapleson (9 Q.B.D. 672) applies, the restricting provisions can have no effect upon the decision of the present appeal.\nJudgment appealed from (8 West. W.K. 440) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Walsh J., at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the appellants.\nM. B. Peacock for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Alberta. The action was brought for return of moneys paid on account of a contract for the purchase of lands and for a declaration that the contract was rescinded. The judgment at the trial was in favour of the plaintiff. This judgment was affirmed by the full court and I can see no reason to interfere with the conclusion reached below.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an action to rescind an agreement for the sale of lots in a subdivision, and the appeal must turn upon the meaning to be given to the section of an Alberta Act, which reads as follows:\u2014 No lots shall be sold under agreement for sale or otherwise -according to any townsite or subdivision plan until after the same has been duly registered in the land titles office for the registration district in which the land shewn on said plan is situate; providing that this section shall not apply to any plan now in existence and approved by the Minister.\nThis was in force at the time when, the agreement in question was entered into. It seems, therefore, to be the very thing which the Act prohibits, for, admittedly, there was no plan registered when it was entered into.\nThe respondent was ignorant of that fact and brought this action for rescission the next day after his discovery thereof.\nThe purpose of the Act may primarily have been the convenience of those having to deal with registrations, but the court of appeal suggests another purpose had in view by the legislature was to protect intending purchasers from possible fraud by manipulation of unregistered plans. I think we must feel bound to give due weight to that view resting upon knowledge of local conditions which we may not as clearly apprehend as the local courts.\nIt is by accepting that view that the respondent is entitled to succeed herein.\nHe comes, thus, within a class of whom each person is entitled, when acting in ignorance of an illegality tainting a contract he has entered upon, to recover from the other party to the contract, notwithstanding the illegality.\nHad he known the fact when entering into the contract, or possibly when acting under the contract in a way to ratify it, he could hardly claim to recover.\nThe Act was amended after judgment was given herein by the court of appeal, and the amendment, it is urged, does away with his right therein.\nWhatever might be said in the ease of such an amendment as appears, enacted before the hearing in appeal, cannot, I think, help the appellant now.\nThat judgment was right when given. We can only give the judgment which the court below appealed from should have given. To go further would be to exceed our jurisdiction.\nI think, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that, apart from the enactments discussed below, the respondent is entitled to rescind the agreement in question on the ground of misrepresentation, on the principle of Redgrave v. Hurd[3]; and this, of course, would entail the consequence that he is entitled to recover back the moneys paid under the agreement.\nIt is necessary, however, to notice the points upon which the argument chiefly proceeded (touching certain legislation), and which are dealt with in the judgments, of the other members of the court. I entertain no doubt that sub-section 7 of section 124 of the \"Land Titles Act,\" which is in the following words:\u2014\nNo lots shall be sold under agreement for sale or otherwise according to any townsite or subdivision plan until after the same has been duly registered in the land titles office of the registration district in which the land shewn on said plan is situate; providing that this section shall not apply to any plan now in existence and approved by the Minister, does prohibit any agreement for the sale of \"lots\"\u2014\"according to any townsite or subdivision plan until after the same has been duly registered\"; and that, consequently any such agreement, made in the circumstances mentioned, though de facto complete, is by reason of this enactment legally inoperative.\nIt does not, however, necessarily follow, where moneys have been paid under such a transaction in professed and intended performance of the obligations supposed to be thereby created, that such moneys can be recovered back by the party paying them on discovering that the transaction was illegal. The law of England as touching the right to recover back moneys paid or property delivered under an unlawful agreement or the right to set such an agreement aside was fully discussed in the case of Lapointe v. Messier[4], and, for convenience, I quote from my own judgment, at pages 287, 288 and 289:\u2014\nThe general rule of the English law is stated in the judgment of Lord Mansfield, in Holman v. Johnson[5].\n\"The objection that a contract is immoral or illegal, as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed, but it is founded in general principles of policy, which defendant has the advantage of contrary to the real justice as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may say so. The principle of public policy is this: ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or illegal act. If from the plaintiff's own stating or otherwise the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of the country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So, if the plaintiff and the defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both are equally in fault, potior est conditio defendentis.\"\nThere are, however, apparent exceptions to this rule and the question is whether or not the present case comes within any of those exceptions. These exceptions have been stated in two text books of high repute and in two comparatively recent judgments. And, before considering the scope of them in their application to this case, it will be convenient to reproduce the passages: 1st Pollock on Contracts, pages 404, 405: \u2014\n\"Money paid or property delivered under an unlawful agreement cannot be recovered back, nor the agreement set aside at the suit of either party\u2014unless nothing has been done in the execution of the unlawful purpose beyond the payment or delivery itself (and the agreement is not positively criminal or immoral);\n\"Or unless the agreement was made under such circumstances as between the parties that, if otherwise lawful, it would be voidable at the option of the party seeking relief.\u2014Note (b).\u2014This form of expression seems justified by Harse v. Pearl Life Assurance Co.[6]. \"Or in the case of an action to set aside the agreement, unless in the judgment of the court the interests of the third persons require that it should be set aside.\"\nSecondly, Anson on Contracts, pp. 253-4: \u2014\n\"But there are exceptional cases in which a man may be relieved of an illegal contract into which he has entered; cases to which the maxim just quoted does not apply. They fall into three classes: (1) The contract may be of a kind made illegal by statute in the interests of a particular class of persons of whom the plaintiff is one; (2) the plaintiff may have been induced, to enter into the contract by fraud or strong pressure; (3) no part of the illegal purpose may have been carried into effect before it is sought to recover the money paid or goods delivered in furtherance of it.\"\nThe first of the judgments is in Kearley v. Thomson[7], where Lord Justice Fry says (pp. 745-6): \u2014\n\"To that general rule there are undoubtedly several exceptions, or apparent exceptions. One of these is the case of oppressor and oppressed, in which case usually the oppressed party may recover the money back from the\" oppressor. In that class of cases the delictum is not par, and, therefore, the maxim does not apply. Again, there are other illegalities which arise where a statute has been intended to protect a class of persons, and the person seeking to recover is a member of the protected class. Instances of that description are familiar in the case of contracts void for usury under the old statutes, and other instances are to be found in the books under other statutes, which are, I believe, now repealed, such as those directed against lottery keepers. In these cases of oppressor and oppressed, or of a class protected by statute, the one may recover from the other, notwithstanding that both have been parties to the illegal contract.\"\nIn the present case it may be suggested that the respondent (brings himself within either one of two of the exceptions mentioned. First (and as I have intimated this is sufficient for disposing of the appeal), that the agreement was made under such circumstances that if otherwise lawful it would have been voidable at the option of the respondent, Secondly, that the enactment was intended to afford protection to a particular class of persons of whom the respondent is one. It is open to doubt, I think, whether the respondent does in truth bring himself within this last mentioned exception. I am disposed to think the better view to be that this enactment is intended to serve the general public interest in the security and certainty of title which is one of the main objects of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nAssuming, however, as some of my learned brothers think, that the respondent has a status to set aside the agreement on the ground of illegality alone, then it become necessary to consider the contention of Mr. Clarke that the rights of the parties are governed by sub-sections 8(a) and 8(b) of section 124, which subsections were enacted on the 17th of April, 1915, after the judgment of the Appellate Division of Alberta now appealed from was delivered; (5 Geo. V., ch. 2, sec. 25). If we are governed by these amendments in the decision of this appeal, then the respondent must fail in so far as his case rests upon the illegality of the agreement of sale.\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that if these amend- merits had been enacted before the hearing of the appeal by the Appellate Division of Alberta, that court would have been governed by them in the disposition of the appeal. Quilter v. Mapleson[8]. The question Ave have to consider is another question. The Legislature of Alberta has no authority to prescribe rules governing this court in the disposition of appeals from Alberta; and the enactments invoked by Mr. Clarke, which do not profess to declare the state of the law ait the time the action was brought, or at the time the judgment of the Appellate Division was given, can only affect the rights of the parties on this appeal to the extent to which the statutes and rules, by which this court is governed permit them so to operate.\nIn my judgment, the appeal to this court is an appeal strictly so called, not an appeal by way of rehearing. The \"Supreme Court Act\" (sec. 51), expressly declares that this court should give the judgment which ought to have been given by the court below, and there are no words corresponding to those of Order 58, Rule 2, of the Judicature Rules, which enable the court of 'appeal to\nmake any further or other order as the case-may require.\nSpeaking generally, subject to some special provisions of the Act which have no present application, and to some exceptions established for the purpose of preventing the abuse of the right of appeal, it is the duty of this court to give the judgment which the court below ought to have given according to the state of the law on which it was the duty of that court to base its judgment. ANGLIN J.\u2014The contract under which the payments that the plaintiff claims to recover back were made was, in my opinion, unquestionably in contravention of sub-section 7 of section 124 of the \"Land Titles Act\" of Alberta (2 Geo. V., ch. 4, sec. 15, sub-sec. 25). I cannot assent to Mr. Clarke's contention that what this statute forbids is not the making of an agreement for the sale of lots on an unregistered plan, but the conveyance or transfer of lots sold under such an agreement. It is the sale under an agreement (or otherwise) which is prohibited and that is effectuated by the agreement itself which vests in the purchaser the equitable title to the lots agreed to be sold. The agreement was, therefore, illegal and void.\nThe amending -statue of 1915, although made applicable to pending litigation, is not declaratory of the law as it stood at the time of the contract in question or at any subsequent period anterior to its enactment. It became law only after the judgment of the Appellate Division in this case had been delivered. This court is bound by statute to render the judgment which the court appealed from should have given \u2014of course upon the law as it was when that court delivered judgment. The appeal to this court is upon a case stated and it is not a re-hearing such as would render applicable the principle of the decision in Quilter v. Mapleson[9]. It is impossible to say that the provincial appellate court should have given effect to an amendment of the statute law which was not in force when it rendered judgment. Nor can an amendment not declaratory in its nature, such as was that dealt with in Corporation of Quebec v. Dunbar[10], cited by Mr. Clarke, enable us to say that the law was at the date of the judgment appealed from what the subsequent amendment has made it. I express no opinion as to how far such a declaratory amendment enacted by a provincial legislature after a right of appeal to this court had arisen would be binding on us.\nOrdinarily, a party to an illegal contract cannot recover back moneys paid under it. But to this rule the law admits of an exception in favour of a plaintiff whom it does not regard as in pari delicto with the defendant. In the present case it is the sale, not the purchase, of land according to an unregistered plan which is forbidden. The penalty provided by sub-section 8 of section 124 of the \"Land Titles Act\" (4 Geo. V. (2nd Sess.), ch. 2, sec 9, sub-sec. 4), is, as I read it, imposed on the vendor. He is the \"offender\" who sells. The seller may be presumed to know whether the plan according to which he is selling is or is not registered. There is no ground for a presumption of like knowledge on the part of the purchaser. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the statute was passed for the protection of purchasers. These are circumstances which, upon the authorities, suffice to relieve the present plaintiff, as a party not in pari delicto, from the operation of the rule which would, otherwise, disentitle him to sue for the recovery back of money paid under an illegal agreement.\nIt is unnecessary to consider the other grounds on which the respondent claimed to be entitled to rescission.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and must be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action in rescission of an agreement for sale based upon three grounds:\u2014\n1. Illegality of the contract;\n2. Defendant's inability to make title;\n3. Misrepresentation of the vendors.\nThe illegality of the contract is invoked by the purchaser who claims that it was made in contravention of a statute passed in 1912 (sub-sec. 7, of sec. 124, \"Land Titles Act\"), declaring that\nno lots shall be sold under agreement for sale, or otherwise, according to any townsite or subdivision plan until after the same has been duly registered in the land titles office.\nThe lots of land in question in this case were shewn on a subdivision plan that was not registered as required by that statute.\nThe trial judge and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the agreement for sale should be rescinded in view of that prohibitory law. I concur in the reasons given by the trial judge, Mr. Justice Walsh.\nBut, since the judgment of the court of appeal was rendered, on the 12th of March, 1915, the Legislature of Alberta has amended the \"Land Titles Act,\" on the 17th of April, 1915 (5 Geo. V., ch. 2, sec. 25), and has enacted sub-sections 8(a) and 8(b) of section 124, which provide as follows:\u2014\n8(a). No party to any sale or agreement for sale shall be entitled in any civil action or proceeding to rely upon or plead the provisions of sub-section 7 of this section, if the plan of subdivision by reference to which such sale or agreement for sale was made was registered when such action or proceeding was commenced, or if, pursuant to the arrangement between the parties, it was the duty of the party who seeks to rely upon or plead the provisions of such sub-section to himself register such plan of subdivision or cause the same to be registered. 8(b). The costs of pending proceedings to which sub-section 8(a) applies shall be disposed of as if the said sub-section had not been passed.\nThe question which is raised as a result of that new legislation is whether we should give effect to it or not in this case.\nBy the \"Supreme Court Act,\" section 51, this court may dismiss, an appeal or give the judgment which the court whose decision is appealed against should have given.\nAt the time the court below was considering this case, the statute now invoked had not been passed. It could not be then acted upon by that court. Our duty is to render the judgment which the court below should have rendered.\nThe Legislature of Alberta could not pass any legislation that could interfere with the powers vested in and restrictions imposed on this court by the Federal Parliament.\nIf it was a declaratory law that had been passed by the provincial legislature, of course we would be bound by it.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 8 West.

It was proved that in 1818 the original grantee had leased a part of the land and the privilege of erecting a boom for securing timber on the river in front of it; that his successors in title had, by leasing and devising it, dealt with the foreshore as owners; that for over forty years from about 1840 the boom in front of it was maintained and used by the owners of the land; and that at low tide the logs in the boom would rest on the solum.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court (15 Ex. C.R. 177), Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that there was sufficient evidence of adverse possession of the foreshore by the owners of the adjoining land for more than sixty years to give the present holder title thereto.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014From a continuous user for more than forty years, which is proved, a prior like user may be inferred. Moreover, from the evidence of assertion of ownership and possession since 1818 a lost grant might, if necessary, be presumed.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ.\u2014The placing and use of the boom was only incidental to the lumber business carried on at this place and the consent of the riparian owner thereto cannot be regarded as a claim of adverse possession. The presumption of lost grant was not pleaded and cannot be relied on; moreover, a lost grant could not be presumed in the circumstances.\nOn application by the Minister of Justice for a disclaimer of damages for the taking of the foreshore the Government of New Brunswick passed an order in council stating that the owner of the adjoining land taken claimed title to said foreshore; that it had been used by the owners for booming purposes and otherwise for more than sixty years; that the Attorney-General was of opinion that whatever rights the province may have had were extinguished and that no claim should be made by it to said foreshore.\nHeld, per Duff J.\u2014This is an admission touching the title to the foreshore by the only authority competent to make it and is evidence against the Dominion Government in the expropriation proceedings; that it is prima facie evidence of title by possession in T.; and that there is nothing in the record to impair the strength of this prima facie case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], awarding compensation for land expropriated for purposes of the Intercolonial Railway.\nThe Attorney-General for Canada filed an information in the Exchequer Court for assessment of compensation to the defendant Tweedie for the land expropriated. The Crown had tendered $2,150 as its full value.\nThe defendant claimed compensation for the foreshore of the Miramichi River in front of his land. This was refused by the Exchequer Court and he appealed to have the award increased by the value of his interest in said foreshore, claiming to be the owner or, in the alternative, to have an easement on it for lumbering purposes.\nTeed K.C. and Lawlor K.C. for the appellant. A subject may acquire title to the foreshore by possession under the Statutes of Limitations. Hall on the Seashore (2 ed.), pages 23 and 154; Moore on the Seashore (3 ed.), pages 690-1 and 830. But the extent and character of the user must depend on the circumstances of each particular case. Lord Advocate v. Young[2], at page 553; Lopez v. Andrew[3].\nThe principle as to possession in ordinary cases is stated in Lord Advocate v. Lovat[4], at page 288; Kirby v. Cowderoy[5], at page 603.\nTo acquire title to the foreshore such full and actual possession as is proved in this case is not necessary. See Moore, pages 511, 658, 660; 28 Halsbury, 368-70; Attorney-General for Ireland v. Vandeleur[6].\nBaxter K.C., Attorney-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent, referred to The King v. Cunard[7]; Wood v. Esson[8]; Hall on the Seashore, page 387; Rose v. Belyea[9]; Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Ganada[10].\nTeed K.C. and Lawlor K.C. for the appellant.\nBaxter K.C., Attorney-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent,\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The pleadings and evidence are so fully dealt with by my brother judges that it will not be necessary for me to do more than state briefly the conclusion I have reached.\nThe grant to the appellant of lot 37 did not include the adjacent foreshore, but I think appellant has established a possessory title to it. The evidence shews sufficient continuous use of the boom extending over the foreshore for the purpose of retaining the floating logs. The only other question that arises is as to the nature of this use of the foreshore and its consequences. It seems to me that it is strictly analogous to the common practice of mooring vessels to the bank in such a way that rising and falling with the tide they rest at extreme low tide on the soil of the foreshore. This is the right or privilege known as groundage and in respect of which dues are payable. It is recognized that this right like that of anchorage is one directly affecting the soil and its use raises a presumption of ownership of the soil. See the judgment of Chief Justice Erle in Le Strange v. Rowe[11].\nIt seems to me that this floating of logs that ground at every tide upon the soil of the foreshore affords a strong instance of such possession as can be had of lands covered by water at the flow of the tide; it is incompatible with any ordinary use to which the foreshore could be put by another as owner.\nThe case must be referred back to the Exchequer Court to fix the additional compensation to which the appellant is entitled in view of the fact that he is the owner not only of lot 37, but of its adjacent foreshore.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of this appeal.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court awarding the appellant, as explained in the learned judge\u2019s reasons for judgment, the sum of $2,100 \u201cas a just and liberal compensation\u201d for the upland expropriated by the Crown from the appellant,\nand for all damages resulting therefrom, including such rights held by the defendant as a riparian owner as distinguishable from those held by the public at large as are mentioned in the case of Lyon v. The Fishmongers Co.[12], covering all rights whatsoever the defendant may have in respect both of the upland and the water lots. The appellant, however, contended both in the Exchequer Court and in this court that he had acquired a title to the water lot in front of his upland, either under the grant of his upland or by possession and that any rate he had acquired an easement in and over such water lots beyond his riparian right which had been injuriously affected by the Crown\u2019s expropriation.\nWith regard to the claim of ownership of the soil of the foreshore of the water lot it was not vigorously pressed, but at the same time was not abandoned. The argument mainly relied upon was that the plaintiff had acquired an easement in and over the water lot to boom logs therein appurtenant to the upland grant and that the easement had been improperly denied by the judgment below and not considered in the assessment of damages.\nSo far as this claim to an easement based upon the presumption of a lost grant is concerned, it was not pleaded by the appellant in the Exchequer Court and under the authorities it would seem that this appeal court should not entertain it.\nIn the view, however, I take of the evidence and the proved facts I do not think the appellant has succeeded in establishing any claim to the water lot in question other than that of a riparian owner and for his damages as such he has been awarded ample compensation.\nNow, what are the controlling facts of the case? The appellant claims title under a Crown grant to one Thomas Loban of a lot called No. 37, fronting on the Miramichi River (a tidal river) dated 4th May, 1798. The lot in question is one of the number of lots granted to different parties in severalty by the same grant and the whole tract is particularly described by metes and bounds. It begins at the specified point at the \u201cnortherly bank of the said river\u201d and after running by defined courses and distances to embrace the 37 lots, returns by a line\nto the northerly bank or shore of the said river, thence along the said northerly bank or shore of the said river following its several courses upstream to the bounds first mentioned.\nIt seems clear beyond all argument that under this grant the several lots were bounded by the bank of the river and that no part of the foreshore was embraced within the lands granted. The several grantees were riparian owners of their several lots. They had rights of uninterrupted access from their respective lots to the river, and if they gained a prescriptive right to any part of the foreshore it could only be by reducing such part into actual exclusive and notorious possession and maintaining that possession for the statutory number of years,\nNow, what acts of possession did the plaintiff or his predecessors in title ever exercise over the foreshore in question? So far as the soil of the foreshore is concerned, absolutely none. It is true that Loban and perhaps others of the appellant\u2019s predecessors, leased to some lumbermen or millowners for a number of years a part of this upland lot. Two of these leases were in evidence. The one to Young was dated in 1818 and the other to Muirhead was dated 1873. That to Young, after describing the upland leased, contained the following words:\u2014\nAnd also the privilege of erecting a boom for the purpose of securing timber, etc., in front of the said lot 37. The lease to Muirhead after describing the upland leased continued as follows:\u2014\nWith the full privilege of the water in front of the said piece of land above described and also the privilege of keeping and erecting a boom for the purpose of securing timber and other lumber in front of said lot 37.\nNo mention is made of any part of the foreshore being leased nor is there any pretence of leasing any part of it. The upland leased is particularly described as running down to the river and bounded by a line following the courses of the river bank or shore, and the privilege is given the lessees of keeping and erecting a boom in the waters in front of the land leased.\nThe facts shew that this booming privilege so called was exercised by fastening a line of logs to a post or pillar driven in the upland and running out to the \u201cboom block\u201d which had been erected by someone in the bed of the river beyond the foreshore or low water mark and again from the block to a wharf some distance further up and running out beyond the foreshore. In this way the logs were protected from being carried away by the tides or storms. There is no evidence whatever of any post or pillar having been placed in the foreshore to retain the boom. As a matter of fact, for many years back, the appellant in his evidence says about twelve, other witnesses say much longer, more than twenty, there has been no boom maintained there at all.\nIt does seem to me clear that the placing of these booms where they were placed must be considered only in connection with the general conduct of the lumber business on the river at the time. They were necessary to the proper carrying on of that great and extensive business, but no doubt without the consent or acquiescence of the riparian owner they could not foe legally maintained by a third party as against him if they interfered with his right of access to and from the river. His consent or permission, whether appearing in a lease or otherwise, could not be construed as evidence of a claim of adverse possession of the foreshore as against the Crown. It was, it seems to me, such a concession as a riparian owner as such might for a consideration fairly make of his riparian rights. The boom would naturally interfere with his right of access to the river and so far as he could he conceded to the lessee the right to erect and maintain the boom. But I cannot see in such an act a claim to either an adverse possession of the foreshore or of an easement in it beyond the riparian owner\u2019s rights therein. And as. I have before said, the leases contain no language shewing a claim to the soil of the foreshore, or authorizing the lessee to interfere with it. Nor does it appear that at any time the appellant or his predecessors in title or their lessees ever disturbed or interfered with that soil. All that was done was by means of a line of logs fastened at one end to the owners\u2019 ripa and at the other to the boom block in the river beyond low water mark to make a boom to save and keep logs. A ease instructive on the point now under discussion as to the extent of a riparian owner\u2019s rights is that of Booth v. Ratte[13], where it was held\nthat a riparian owner is at liberty to construct and moor to his bank a floating wharf and boathouse, the same not being an obstruction to the navigation, and is entitled to maintain an action for damages in respect thereof caused by any unauthorized interference with the flow and purity of the stream. In delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, Sir Richard Couch says, at page 193:\u2014\nSo far from being an obstruction to navigation, the maintenance of a floating wharf of that kind, is, in the circumstances stated by the learned Chancellor, a positive convenience to those members of the public who navigate the river with small craft. As a riparian owner, the plaintiff would be at liberty to construct such a wharf and would be entitled to maintain an action for the injuries to it which are complained of.\nApplying that language to the booms maintained on the Miramichi River at the place in question, I would say that no question arose as to there having been any obstruction to the navigation of the river. On the contrary, they were essential to the carrying on effectively of the great lumbering and logging business on that river. They did not, in my judgment, affect the title to the soil of the foreshore which always remained in the Crown, nor in the circumstances which surrounded them, would they appear to the Crown to have been maintained by the riparian owners or their lessees animo habendi, possidendi et appropriandi which would be necessary to enable their owners or users to gain a title as against the Crown by possession or an easement in the foreshore appurtenant to the upland owned by them beyond their ordinary riparian rights.\nFor these reasons and without entering upon the question of the New Brunswick \u201cPrescription Act\u201d I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant claims in three or four alternative ways a title to part of the land over which the Miramichi, a tidal navigable river, flows. The origin of the claim rests in a grant in 1798, made by the respondent to one Thomas Loban of lot thirty-seven and other lands. In some way which I cannot understand it is claimed this grant carried with it dominion over part of said land upon which said lot thirty-seven fronted.\nAs the said lot is defined in the grant by metes and bounds of which that next the river is stated to be\nthence along the southerly hank or shore of the said (Miramichi) river following its several curves down stream.\nthe grant thereof could not carry with it any part of the land overflowed by said river.\nIt is further claimed that a lease, which is produced, was made 28th August, 1818, to one Robert Young by the executors of the last will and testament of Thomas Loban, deceased, Jane Loban, his widow, and Alexander Loban, his son, of a part of the said lot thirty-seven described by metes and bounds\nand also the privilege of erecting a boom for the purpose of securing timber, etc., in front of the said lot number thirty-seven down stream until it comes to the distance of fifty feet from the upper part of the boom now occupied by Francis Peabody, Esq..\nand also another part of said lot thirty-seven as described.\nThe lease was to run for fifteen years from said date and was made renewable for fifteen years or at the option of Jane Loban or her assigns, or in the event of her death, of said Alexander Loban, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, to continue it for a further term of fifteen years or to pay \u201cfor the buildings and improvements made thereon\u201d at a valuation.\nWe are not enlightened as to what happened pursuant to this lease. We are told of a boom existing in the locality in question for a number of years and it might be possible to infer that it existed before the time of the recollection of the oldest witness speaking thereto. Giving credit to all such witnesses tell us, I cannot find therein anything upon which a title to the soil in question could be acquired by virtue of the Statute of Limitations as against the Crown. Indeed, that ground of claim was not pressed as strongly as the next alternative of an alleged easement acquired by prescription.\nThis sort of claim seems rather indefinite. If we accept the high authority of Lord Cairns speaking in the case of Rangely v. Midland Railway Co., in 1868[14], relative to the definition of an easement, we would be puzzled to find in the evidence herein exactly what he defines an easement to be, or if the land in question is the servient tenement, what land the easement was appurtenant to.\nOr if we should attempt to treat the rights claimed (whatever legal definition we may give them) over this part of the Miramichi River by virtue of the creation and use of the boom in question as the subject of acquisition by prescription, as claimed, against the Crown, we find that there was no Act in force in New Brunswick enabling such prescription till 1st of January, 1910.\nAdmittedly there was no use or enjoyment of this so-called boom for a number of years before that date. And according to my reading of the evidence there had been no use or enjoyment possessed by anybody thereof for over twenty years before that date.\nThere was apparently no necessity for it, much less actual use of it, after some time not actually fixed, but I think some time twenty years before this proceeding, though occasionally logs or loads of lumber were to be found thereabout.\nThe timbers forming the boom had, however, disappeared.\nIn short, I do not think the appellant brings his claim within the meaning of the statute, section 1, chapter 139, Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, 1903, which is as follows:\u2014\nNo claim for lands or rent shall be made, or action brought by His Majesty, after a continuous adverse possession of sixty years.\nThe kind of possession that was ever had at any time of the water in question was what every-day experience exhibits in any river used by lumbermen. The possession never could have been conceived as adverse to His Majesty, but in the exercise of a right permitted to those taking such possession in common with others of the public using navigable waters in the like way for the promotion of trade and commerce. Nor was the possession of that continuous character which would lay a foundation for a prescriptive title. The alternative of prescription also must fail.\nThen it was suggested that we must presume a lost grant. There are two answers to this. It has not been pleaded, and in the next place, I hardly think the evidence warrants such presumption.\nAs to the necessity for pleading a lost grant if relied upon see Smith v, Baxter in 1900[15], at foot of page 146 and top of page 147. That case was tried without pleadings under an order directing the issue and as no point made of the alleged lost grant theory on getting such direction, the claim, started on the trial, of lost grant instead of prescription it was held by Sterling J. could not be set up; for as such it must be pleaded. And that holding was followed by Parker J. in trying the case of Hyman v. Van Den Bergh[16], and maintained in appeal[17], and the Smith v. Baxter case[18] was specifically approved of foy Cozens-Hardy M.R. in giving judgment on said appeal.\nThis seems to dispose of the claim to rest on presumption of lost grant, for it is not pleaded.\nThere is not sufficient in the length of time which elapsed and in that which transpired before the Act, 8 Will. IV., ch. 1, came into effect, to give any efficacy to the presumption before that.\nThat statute by its terms seems to forbid any presumption of a grant thereafter such as we are asked to presume. The grants; thereafter must be of the open kind susceptible of proof from the records that must exist.\nThe maxim omnia pr\u0153sumunter, etc., relied upon cannot help. There is no basis shewn upon which it could operate. To so apply it would be irrational. In short it would to do so be to presume the advisors of the Crown had acted against rather than in accordance with law.\nAs to the claim that a sufficient sum was not allowed for expropriation of that for which appellant was entitled to be compensated, I think the weight of evidence against him is such as to forbid our interference.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The lands that are the subject matter of this controversy were taken for the purposes of the Intercolonial Railway under the provisions of chapter 143, R.S.C., on the 21st September, 1910.\nOn the 16th of July of the same year the following minute had been passed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of New Brunswick:\u2014\nMemorandum and report of the Honourable Attorney-General for the information of the Committee of the Executive Council. The Attorney-General reports, that it is proposed to make a diversion of the line of the Intercolonial Railway from. Nelson to Loggieville in the County of Northumberland, in the Province of New Brunswick, and the Minister of Justice of Canada has through his agent, Warren C. Winslow, Esquire, K.C., of Chatham, N.B., applied for a disclaimer of damages on account of taking for use of the said Intercolonial Railway, certain lands covered with water, situate below highwater mark on the Miramichi River, at a point called Walsh\u2019s Cove, the particular lots being described as follows:\u2014\nLot number eighty-six, beginning at station 290-77 on the centreline of the right of way of the new diversion at its intersection with the eastern side line of the Russell Wharf, so called; thence northwesterly by the said line seventy-five (75) feet, more or less, to a point distant seventy-five (75) feet at right angles north-westerly from the centre line; thence easterly parallel to the centre line and distant therefrom north-westerly seventy-five (75) feet at right angles four hundred and thirty (430) feet, more or less, to the prolongation of the western boundary of the property of Walsh Brothers at a point distant seventy-five (75) feet, north-westerly at right angles from the centre line, thence by the said western boundary and prolongation south-easterly, crossing the centre line four hundred and seventy (470) feet, more or less, to a point on the southerly shore of the river Miramichi, so called, at highwater mark;. thence, north-westerly by the shore at highwater mark, four hundred and ten (410) feet, more or less, to the eastern side line of the Russell Wharf aforesaid; thence by the said eastern side line fifty (50) feet, more or less, to the place of beginning, containing 154,330 square feet, more or less.\nLot number eighty-four, beginning at the intersection of the centre line of the right of way of the new diversion with the western boundary of the property of the said Dominion Government; thence by the said boundary north-westerly seventy-five (75) feet, more or less, to a point distant seventy-five (75) feet at right angles northwesterly from the centre line; thence easterly parallel to the centre line one hundred and fifty (150) feet, more or less, to the eastern boundary of said property at a point distant seventy-five (75) feet at right angles north-westerly from the centre line; thence southeasterly by the said boundary crossing the centre line, and the shore of the river Miramichi, so called, at the original highwater mark, three hundred and ninety (390) feet, more or less, to the eastern boundary of the property of Walsh Brothers; thence north-westerly by the said eastern boundary four hundred and ten (410) feet, more or less, to the place of beginning, containing 48,350 square feet, more or less, and containing in both lots 202,680 square feet, more or less.\nThe Attorney-General having carefully inquired into the matter has ascertained that the owners of the lands above mentioned along the shore, claim that they are entitled to the land covered by water in front of their said lands to the channel or to a line drawn from the north-easterly corner of the Russell Wharf, to the north-westerly-corner of the Loggie Wharf, with the exception of the property claimed by the Walsh Brothers, and that the said land covered by water has been used for over sixty years by the owners of the said lands for booming purposes and otherwise, and that blocks have been built in front along the channel for said booming purposes for over sixty years. He is, therefore, of opinion that whatever rights the province may have formerly had in the said lands covered by water, that said rights have become extinguished, and that it would be inadvisable to set up any claim to the same. He, therefore, recommends that upon His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor approving of this minute, that the Minister of Justice be informed that the said Province of New Brunswick lays no claim to the said lands covered by water and situate below highwater mark, and that the Department of Railways must deal with the parties claiming said lands and lands covered by water.\nAnd the Committee of the Executive Council concurring in the said recommendation.\nIt is accordingly so ordered.\nCertified: Passed July 16th, 1910.\n(Sgd.) Joe. Howe Dickson.\nClerk of the Executive Council of N.B.\nThis instrument constitutes an admission touching the title to the lands in question made by the only executive authority competent at the time to make admissions on that subject on behalf of the Crown; and, therefore, as an admission on behalf of the Crown it is admissible in my opinion in evidence against the plaintiff in this proceeding. This admission, of course, does not operate as a conveyance; but it is prima facie evidence of title by possession. And it is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal to say, (applying the well settled principle that enjoyment of \u201call the beneficial uses of the foreshore\u201d for sixty years,\nwhich would naturally have been enjoyed by the direct grantee of the Crown\nLord Advocate v. Young[19], at page 553, is sufficient to establish a case of title by possession) that the evidence as a whole (while it cogently supports) contains little or nothing to detract seriously from the strength of this prim\u00e2 facie case.\nThere should be a reference back to ascertain the amount of compensation to which the appellant is entitled in respect of the parts of the foreshore and solum taken. I should not disturb the finding in respect of the value of the upland taken or in respect of compensation for injurious affection of the upland.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the construction of a line of railway, known as the Chatham Diversion of the Intercolonial, the Crown has taken a portion of lot 37, admittedly the property of the defendant. In respect of this piece of upland, including riparian rights, he has been awarded in the Exchequer Court as compensation the sum tendered by the Crown, $2,150. The Crown has also utilized for its railway a portion of the foreshore in front of lot 37 to which the defendant has hitherto in this litigation unsuccessfully asserted title. On the present appeal he seeks to have his title to the foreshore established, or, in the alternative, his right to an easement over it for the booming of logs, and to receive compensation in respect thereof, and he also claims increased compensation for the upland taken and injuriously affected.\nIn regard to the latter claim I have not been satisfied that the amount allowed by the learned trial judge is inadequate.\nI also agree with the learned assistant judge of the Exchequer Court that the grant to the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title of lot 37, bounded by the waters of a tidal river, did not carry to the grantee title to the foreshore. It should scarcely be necessary to say that the order in council passed by the Provincial Government disclaiming any interest in the foreshore in question does not vest title to it in the appellant. But if he was in possession when the expropriation proceedings were instituted, his inchoate holding title, though short of the statutory sixty years duration, would avail as a defence against everybody but the true owner, and inasmuch as, if the defendant is not the owner, the title would be in the Crown in right of the Province of New Brunswick and not in right of the Dominion, the disclaimer of the former may be of importance. Moreover, if the defendant had possession when the expropriation proceedings were commenced and the Crown had been out of de facto possession for twenty years, the statute 21 Jac. I., ch. 14, may be an obstacle in the plaintiff\u2019s path. Doe d. Watt v. Morris[20]; Emmerson v. Maddison[21]. But in the view I take of the defendant\u2019s claim of title by possession it is not necessary to dwell upon these aspects of the case.\nIn so far as the defendant\u2019s claim to a prescriptive easement rests upon the \u201cPrescription Act\u201d (C.S., N.B., 1903, ch. 156), he encounters the difficulty that the alleged right of booming logs had not been exercised for several years before this action was brought (section 3). His claim to an easement apart from the operation of the statute need be considered only if his claim of title by possession to the solum cannot be supported. After hearing the evidence in support of this latter claim the learned trial judge deemed it insufficient. The question is one of fact, and the judgment in favour of the Crown should be interfered with only if upon a careful consideration of the evidence it is clear that the conclusion reached is erroneous.\nIn order to establish title by possession to a portion of the foreshore it is not necessary to prove the same exclusive possession of it which would be requisite in a case of uplands. A grantee of foreshore holds it subject to the jus publicum of navigation and fishing and a similarly restricted title to it by possession may be established by proof of such beneficial enjoyment as a grantee holding subject to this jus publicum might have exercised. Lord Advocate v. Young[22]; Moore on Foreshore (3 ed.), pp. 658, 660, 779, note (u), and 830, note (s); 28 Halsbury, pp. 368-9. In Johnston v. O\u2019Neill[23], at page 583, Lord Macnaghten, quoting from the speech of Lord O\u2019Hagen in Lord Advocate v. Lord Lovat[24], said:\u2014 As to possession it has been said in this House that \u201cit must be considered in every case with reference to the peculiar circumstances * * * the character and value of the property, the suitable and natural mode of using it, the course of conduct which the proprietor might be expected to follow with due regard to his own interests\u2014all these things, greatly varying as they must under various conditions, ought to be taken into account in determining the sufficiency of a possession.\u201d\nThis same passage was quoted with approval in Kirby v. Cowderoy[25]. This restriction upon the nature of the possession requisite must be borne in mind in considering the sufficiency of the case made out. What is that case?\nThe upland lot No. 37 was granted to Thos. Loban in 1798. We have no evidence of any dealing with the foreshore by him. He died in 1817. By a lease dated August 29th, 1818, his executors and his devisee demised to Robert Young for fifteen years from the 1st of July, 1817, inter alia,\nthe privilege of erecting a boom for the purpose of securing timber, etc., in front of the said lot No. 37, from the upper line of the said lot 37 down stream until it comes to the distance of 50 feet from the upper part of the boom now occupied by Francis Peabody, Esq.\nThere is no evidence of actual occupation under this lease and it may be contended that the lease itself is as consistent with a claim by the Lobans to an easement of the right to boom logs as it is with an assertion of a title to the solum of the foreshore. But see Van Diemen\u2019s Land Co. v. Table Gape Marine Board[26], and Le Strange v. Rowe[27]. The next piece of documentary evidence is not subject to this observation. It is the will of Jane Loban, widow and devisee of Thos. Loban, made in 1852, whereby she devised to her son, John Loban, the foreshore in front of lot 37 \u201cto the outside of the boom in front.\u201d Meantime the evidence of the actual presence and use of the boom itself commences.\nHis Honour Judge Wilkinson, aged 89 years, and a resident of Chatham for 75 years, formerly County Court Judge of the County of Northumberland, deposed to the existence and use of the boom for storing logs from 1850 for a number of years down to a period some \u201c20, 30 or 40 years ago.\u201d\nJas, Curran, aged 78, who resided in Chatham all his life, cannot remember when the boom was not in front of the Loban lot. His memory goes back to 1846. The boom was first used to his knowledge by Joseph Cunard, then by Johnston and MacKay, and later by Ritchie and by Muirhead. He remembers constant user of the boom down to about 27 or 28 years ago and a subsequent user some eight or nine years ago.\nJas. Mowatt, aged 81, knew the Loban property for sixty years. He had a shop on part of it for 25 years prior to 1880. The boom was maintained during that period.\nJos. Synott knows of the existence of the boom since 1850. He and Mowatt, however, state that they think the user of it for storage purposes ceased about 1884 or 1885.\nAlexander Fraser, aged 81, came to Chatham in 1846. He remembers the block to which the boom was attached from about that time, and that the Rainnies used the boom from about 1847 to 1850.\nIn 1862 John Loban devised to his widow, Jane Grey Loban, the foreshore \u201cto the outside of the boom in front.\u201d Allan Ritchie deposed that the firm of D. & J. Ritchie made payments of rent for the use of the boom in question first to John Loban and afterwards to Jane Grey Loban from 1855 to 1873, when it was leased to Muirhead.\nJas. Robinson deposed to the use of the boom from 1861 down to about ten years ago.\nThe defendant Tweedie, 65 years of age, gives evidence of the constant use of the boom from his earliest recollection down to 1886 by lessees or licensees of the Lobans and to subsequent intermittent use of it down to about ten or twelve years ago. He acted as solicitor for Jane Grey Loban and drew a lease of the boom from her to Muirhead in 1873. He also proves payment of rent for the boom by Muirhead to Jane G. Loban and the user of it by Muirhead down to 1886 and subsequently by Richards.\nJohn Johnson, a witness called by the Crown, says that sixty years ago the boom was an old established boom and that it was used for many yeans until some time, he cannot say how long, after the burning of the mill in 1873.\nThere is also evidence from Alexander Fraser that he had heard that the boom existed long previous to 1845, but this I treat as inadmissible.\nIn 1892 Muirhead\u2019s interest as lessee of the boom was sold by the sheriff and bought by the defendant. In 1895 Jane G. Loban demised to the appellant inter alia the boom privilege for a term of thirty years. This he assigned to Helen Russell. In 1906 Jane G. Loban conveyed to the defendant her reversion in the property, including the block and boom, and assigned to him her rights under the existing leases. In 1909 Helen Russell surrendered her rights to the defendant. There is no contradiction of the oral evidence of occupation and there is no suggestion that all the documents mentioned were not executed and delivered for substantial consideration and in good faith, no question of title having then arisen. They leave no room to doubt the character of the right to the foreshore which the Lobans asserted and make clear the intention with which the acts of occupation were performed. Duke of Beaufort v. Aird[28]. While the storage of logs at high tide may not have involved any actual possession of the solum of the foreshore, at and for some time before and after low tide the logs undoubtedly lay upon the solum itself. Le Strange v. Rowe[29], at pages 1052-3. Moreover, the block to which the booms were attached, though perhaps outside the foreshore, was a permanent structure and the booms were themselves secured by pickets. They would not otherwise have held in place. These were, in my opinion, acts indicative of an assertion of ownership such that those interested in disputing the title asserted by the. Lobans would so understand them. Coulson & Forbes, Law of Waters (3 ed.), 29-39.\nHaving regard to all these circumstances I think the user of the foreshore shewn to have been made by the predecessors in title of the defendant and their lessees or licensees was of the character necessary to support a claim of possessory title. Continuous user of this kind from 1840 to 1885 or 1886 is clearly shewn by the evidence and it indicates that the Loban boom was well known and established for years prior to 1840 or 1845, beyond which the memory of living witnesses does not go. There is no reason to suppose that the booming privilege demised in 1818 to Robt. Young was not exercised or that the assertion of ownership of the foreshore by the Lobans and occupation of it under them do not date at least from that time. Rogers v. Allen[30]; Attorney-General v. Emerson[31]. The reference in the lease of 1818 to the fact that an adjacent part of the foreshore was then occupied by a boom held by Francis Peabody, Esq., is significant in this connection. If the later user of the Loban boom has been intermittent it would appear to have been only because owing to the burning of mills and other causes permanent tenants for it were not available. There is no evidence of anything to suggest abandonment of the foreshore or of the right to use it for booming purposes.\nFrom a continuous user of upwards of forty years (such as has been actually proved in this case) an earlier like user may readily be inferred. Chad v. Tilsed[32]. This, coupled with the lease of 1818 and subsequent documents indicative of the character of the right asserted (Re Alston\u2019s Estate[33]), in my opinion suffice to support the defendant\u2019s claim to a possessory title under the New Brunswick statute, 6 We IV., ch. 74 (now C.S.N.B., eh. 139, sec. 1).\nIf it were necessary for him to invoke the doctrine of lost grant, even a shorter user than has been proved might warrant the presumption of such a grant; 28 Halsbory, 371 (g); Moore\u2019s Foreshore (3 ed.), p. 598; Duke of Beaufort v Mayor of Swansea[34]; Re Alston\u2019s Estate[35]. Although the statute of 8 Wm. IV., ch. 1, probably precludes a presumption of a grant made subsequently to 1837, it presents no difficulty in presuming a grant prior to that date. The evidence proves actual possession from 1840 at least to 1886, if not 1902, and warrants an inference of assertion of ownership and possession consistent therewith since 1818 and there appears to be no reason why a lost grant of a date earlier than 1837 should not be presumed. Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), 138; Turner v. Walsh[36].\nAlthough in most instances the courts have, no doubt, dealt with ambiguous and equivocal grants of upland, and the question presented has been whether the proof of user of the adjacent foreshore was such as warranted its inclusion in the grant of the upland, such cases as Lord Advocate v. Young[37], and Mulholland v. Kitten[38], would seem to be authorities for the view that, although the description of the riparian lot cannot be said to include any part of the adjacent foreshore, a grant of the latter may be presumed from long user. That title to foreshore may be acquired against the Crown by occupation for the statutory sixty years in cases where the grant of the upland clearly does not include it, is, I think, not open to doubt. 6 Encyc. Laws of England, 199.\nThe evidence adduced by the defendant in support of his possession is as satisfactory as could reasonably be expected, having regard to all the circumstances, and it should, in my opinion, be held that he has established title to the foreshore in question.\nIt is quite clear that the compensation which has been allowed him is confined to the damage sustained by deprivation of and injury to his upland property and riparian rights incident thereto. Nothing has been allowed for his interest in the foreshore, it having been held that he had none. As already indicated that interest is subject to the jus publicum of navigation and fishing, and it is quite possible that any user of the foreshore such as the defendant alleges he contemplated was out of the question. Any possibility of obtaining a license to so use it he is entitled to have taken into account. Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[39]; but its remoteness must also be considered. Cunard v. The King[40]. The value of the foreshore in question in former years for booming purposes may perhaps be estimated from the rental paid for the privilege, but the revenue which would have been derivable from this or any other available source, now or in the future, had the Chatham Diversion not been undertaken, may be greater or smaller than formerly. It must also be borne in mind that in the $2,150 already allowed as compensation there is included a substantial sum for riparian rights, and it may be that the situs of the pier or block to which the boom was attached and of part of the boom itself is not included in the property to which the defendant\u2019s title has been established. Fithardinge v. Purcell[41].\nOn the whole, while the appellant is entitled to some additional compensation in respect to his interest in the foreshore, I think we are not in a position to fix the amount which should be allowed him, and that the case must be referred back for that purpose to the Exchequer Court.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: M. & J.

Price Bros. v. Tanguay (42 Can. S.C.R. 133), and City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co. (38 Can. S.C.R. 239), referred to. Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water and Power Co. (43 Can. S.C.R. 650), distinguished.\nThe appeal was quashed but without costs as the respondent had neglected to move for an order to quash the appeal within the time limited by Supreme Court Rule No. 4.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of McCorkill J., in the Superior Court, District of Quebec, whereby the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nWhen the case come on for hearing on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, counsel for the respondent drew attention to the fact that there was no question of title to real estate involved on the appeal and the amount of damages claimed by the action was insufficient to give the court jurisdiction under section 46 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d Counsel for the appellant contended that the effect of the order declaring the injunction absolute was to restrict his rights in the use of the quarry upon his land, and, incidentally, might subject him to a fine of $2,000 as provided by article 971 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nMarchand for the appellant.\nGelly for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of King's Bench affirming a judgment of Mr. Justice McCorkill which declared perpetual an interlocutory injunction and condemned the appellant to pay $50 for damages and the costs of the suit. The proceedings began by way of a petition for an injunction alleging that the defendant was the proprietor of a quarry situated in the Village of Ch\u00e2teau Richer, and the plaintiff had his home upon a lot of land a short distance from the quarry. The petition alleged that the quarry was owned by defendant Lachance and operated by defendant Baker, that the work was dangerous to the life and property of the plaintiff through blasting, etc., setting out various occasions upon which rocks had been thrown upon his property and had endangered the life of members of his family and of the public. The petitioner claimed damages of $100 and asked for an interlocutory injunction enjoining defendants and their officers and agents from carrying on their dangerous operations.\nThe order made by Mr. Justice McCorkill sets out the facts shewing that the interlocutory order had been made, that a writ had been issued and served with a certified copy of the judgment granting the interlocutory injunction. He says that the plaintiff moved for a rule nisi ordering the defendants to shew cause why they should not be held in contempt for having violated the injunction, that this motion was granted, that the defendants pleaded separately to the said interlocutory order on the merits. He held that the defendants had failed to prove the material allegations of their defence and that the plaintiff had proved the material allegations of his petition. He maintained the plaintiff's action, made absolute and permanent the interlocutory injunction, and ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs $50 damages. The Court of King's Bench confirmed this judgment and the defendant Lachance now appeals to the Supreme Court.\nThis appeal coming from the Province of Quebec is, of course, governed by the provisions of section 46, which say that no appeal shall lie\u2014\n(a) Unless it involves the validity of an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n(b) Relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to His Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\n(c) Amounts to the sum or value of two thousand dollars.\nThis case clearly does not fall within any of the above sub-sections.\nIn a number of cases an appeal has been attempted to be brought to this court where the remedy asked has been an injunction, but in all of them there was some foundation for the contention that titles to land were involved.\nIn Price Bros. v. Tanguay[2] the plaintiffs complained that they were impeded in the right to drive logs down the course of a river and asked for the removal of a boom placed across the river by the defendants. This court held that there was no jurisdiction.\nIn City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co.[3] the plaintiffs asked for a declaration that certain municipal by-laws were illegal and for an injunction restraining the defendants from levying or collecting certain water-rates. In this case also the court held that they had no jurisdiction.\nThe case of Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water and Power Co.[4] does not assist the appellant because there the action was to set aside a by-law and an injunction prohibiting the carrying into effect a contract of sale made pursuant to the by-law and involving property worth $40,000. The majority of the court held that the matter in dispute was the $40,000 provided for in the contract.\nIn the present case there appears to be nothing upon which the appellant can rely to support the jurisdiction of the court.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, Rivard, Chauveau & Marchand.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gelly & Dion.\n[1] Q.R. 24 K.B. 421.\n[2] 42 Can.

Grand Trunk Railway Pacific Co., (1915) 52 S.C.R. 227\nDate: 1915-11-15\nMary E. Lewis, Administratrix of Edwin E. Lewis (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1915: October 21, 22; 1915: November 15.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nNegligence\u2014Operation of railway\u2014Unsafe roadbed\u2014Speed of trains\u2014Disobedience to orders\u2014Answers by jury\u2014\u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d\u2014Injury sustained outside province\u2014Right of action in Manitoba.\nAt a curve in the permanent way there was a sink-hole, over which the roadbed had been recently constructed, where the weight of passing trains caused the tracks to be depressed, but trains running slowly had been safely operated across the unsafe spot for several months. Orders had been given that no trains were to be run over this place at greater speed than 5 miles per hour. The husband of plaintiff was engine-driver of a train which was run over the dangerous spot at a rate exceeding that indicated in the order and was derailed, causing injuries which resulted in his death. The accident happened in the Province of Ontario and the action to recover damages was instituted in Manitoba. In answer to the question, \u201cIn what did such negligence consist,\u201d the jury answered, \u201ca defective roadbed, and not having provided a watchman for same.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (24 Man. R. 807), Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the answer returned by the jury was insufficient and vague; that there was no reasonable evidence to support a finding that, assuming the order regulating speed of trains to be observed, the permanent way at the place in question was so dangerous as to make it negligence on the part of the railway company, vis-\u00e0-vis deceased, to operate trains thereupon or that the cause of the accident was the state of the roadbed rather than the running of the train at excessive speed.\nPer Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014A legal obligation ex delicto, arising in consequence of a fatal accident which happened beyond the territorial limits of the Province of Manitoba, may be enforced in the Manitoba courts where, according to the law in force in Manitoba, a similar right of action would have arisen if the accident had occurred within the province. Phillips v. Eyre (L.R. 6 Q.B. 1) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] setting aside the judgment entered by Galt J., on the verdict of the jury, and entering nonsuit.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the headnote.\nC. R. Bethune and W. M. Crichton for the appellant.\nH. J. Symington for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The jury found that the death of Edwin R. Lewis was caused by the negligence of the defendant company, and to the question:\u2014\nIn what did such negligence consist?\nanswered:\u2014\nA defective roadbed, and not having provided a watchman for same.\nNow negligence is denned in many ways, but perhaps for general use the best definition is that\u2014\nNegligence is the absence of such care as it was the duty of the defendant to use.\nIt is clear that \u201ca defective roadbed\u201d is no real answer to the question: \u201cIn what did such negligence consist?\u201d A railway company may be negligent either in constructing or maintaining its railway and perhaps the answer of the jury is to be interpreted as a finding of one or other of these causes of negligence, though it is at any rate exceedingly vague.\nIt does not appear from the evidence that there is anything to support a charge of negligent construction of the railway. What are known as \u201csoft spots\u201d or \u201csink-holes\u201d are necessarily encountered more or less frequently on a long line of railway; they are simply places where owning to the loose or shifting nature of the subsoil it is impossible to get a firm foundation on which to rest the railway track. It may be possible to overcome the difficulty, as has often to be done for buildings, by sinking piles, putting in concrete foundations or by other costly expedients. As long, however, as a railway is made reasonably safe, it is impossible to say that there is negligence if it is not constructed in the most perfect manner; a railway is never perfect, it is always being improved, and a new line of enormous length like the one in question in this case must necessarily embrace a number of weak and more or less dangerous places which can only be eliminated gradually after long experience of working the line. Such dangers are found not only in the track itself, but in its surroundings, for instance, the liability to land slides in cuttings where it is impossible to remove sufficient earth to ensure perfect safety.\nAs to the maintenance of the roadbed, it is shewn that the arrangements made for the watching of this particular spot necessitated the sectionmen going over it at least twice every day, and a gang of men were constantly employed keeping up the level of the track by filling up with gravel the depression caused by the passage of trains. Though trains had been constantly passing there had been no previous trouble at this place and an inspection after the accident shewed no unusual conditions in the track.\nIt would seem to me that this disposes of any negligence which could properly be covered by the verdict \u201ca defective roadbed.\u201d There is no finding of negligence in the operation of the road, but it may be pointed out that though no negligence is to be attributed to the respondent company in the construction and maintenance of the railway, the company was bound to exercise due diligence in endeavouring to protect the public and its own employees from known dangers which required to be guarded against at particular places.\nIt is not suggested the company was not alive to its duties in this respect or that it failed to take precautions. We find that the engineer and conductor were each furnished with a copy of an order directing that speed was to be reduced at this sink-hole to 5 miles per hour. It is in evidence that the rule is that such an order is to be understood as meaning that the speed is not to exceed 5 miles an hour. Further, there was a \u201cslow sign,\u201d that is, a board about 3 feet wide, standing out 15 feet from the right-hand side of the track on the engineer\u2019s side and that sign said: \u201cslow.\u201d\nLewis, the engine-driver, had passed over this place dozens of times and knew the conditions perfectly; so had other men and always with safety. How then did the accident happen? It seems to me, in the absence of better explanation, that it is impossible to disregard that offered by the respondent that it was caused by the train proceeding at a rate of speed that in the circumstances was too high. I do not propose to examine the evidence to try and ascertain what that rate of speed was, because it seems indisputable that it was over 5 miles an hour. The excessive speed of the train at this dangerous spot is, I think, the only plausible explanation of the accident, and for that excessive speed the deceased himself was responsible.\nThe presence of a watchman could not have had the slightest effect in preventing the accident since at the time there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the road and no reason for holding up the train; the engine-driver knew all that a watchman could have known.\nAs I have said before I do not think that the answer \u201ca defective roadbed\u201d was any statement of an act of negligence on the part of the defendant; but any negligence there was could, I think, only have been that of the deceased engine-driver himself.\nI agree with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Perdue in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, and I think that this appeal should be dismissed and judgment entered for the respondents (defendants), the whole with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Many interesting points were discussed at bar in this appeal raising the question of the right of a party to bring an action in one province of the Dominion to recover damages for injuries received in another province for which damages, if sued for in the latter province, the defendants would be liable. The questions debated covered alike the common law liability and that created under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation tor Injuries Acts,\u201d and, if under the latter Acts, whether the language declaring that the action must be brought within a fixed time after the accident with a proviso\nthat in case of death the want of notice should be no bar to the maintenance of such action if the judge should be of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for such want of notice,\nextended to another province than the one legislating.\nIt seems to be conceded that such question must depend largely upon whether the question of notice required and the excuse for its not having been given is or is not of the essence of the right of action created by the statute.\nIn the view, however, which I take of the facts as proved and of the jury\u2019s findings upon them, I do not find it necessary to discuss or decide any of these questions.\nAssuming the appellant\u2019s contentions to be sound\u2014that she had the right to sue in the Manitoba courts\u2014and that the judge of that court was competent to determine the question of there having been a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for the want of the statutory notice, the question to be determined is whether the defendant company had failed in its duty to provide a railway track or roadbed which could be safely used for the purpose of operating a locomotive thereon and in not having provided a watchman at the soft spot or sinkhole where the accident occurred.\nThe answer of the jury to the question:\u2014\nIn what did the negligence of the defendant consist?\nwas:\u2014\nA defective roadbed, and not having provided a watchman for the same. The evidence shewed that at the time of the accident there was nothing unusual in the condition of the roadbed at that point which would have attracted a watchman\u2019s attention, if he had been there. A watchman in such circumstances could only have signalled to the deceased if there was anything unusual or symptomatic of danger in the conditions. The evidence is clear beyond question that there was nothing of the kind when the engine in question passed the spot, and, in view of the order to slow at the point in question to five miles an hour given to the deceased engineer, and the slow-board some distance back to indicate when and where he should begin to slow, the finding as to negligence in not having a watchman seems superfluous and without any grounds or evidence to support it.\nThen as to the defective roadbed the finding is general and in no sense specific as to negligence on defendant\u2019s part.\nThe deceased engineer had been running over this spot every day for several months. The soft spot had been in existence ever since the construction of the road. Its length was about 50 feet and the depression of the rails as the trains passed over it at times was from two to four inches. There was a section gang looking after the spot and they had crossed it once or twice on that day. An examination of the track after the accident shewed that it was in proper alignment and some eight hours afterwards, on the train being hauled away, there was no depression of the track over the sink-hole or soft spot. This soft spot was protected by a slow-order of five miles an hour and by a slow-board sign some 2,000 feet from it. There was no evidence to shew that the depression in question was dangerous when the speed of the passing trains was confined to five miles an hour. A railway roadbed may be quite safe for a speed of five miles an hour, but be dangerous for a speed of eight or twelve miles or more.\nThe evidence, however, was conclusive that the commencement of the accident, where the front pony-wheels of the engine first left the tracks, took place before the engine reached the depression and that it completely passed over the depression, some 200 or 300 feet, before it left the roadbed and fell down the embankment. Some cause for the derailment there must have been, happening at the place it did, other than the depression or any defect in the roadbed at the depression. The only reasonable suggestion offered is the deceased engineer\u2019s disobedience of his express orders as to speed and his continuance of a speed beyond the prohibited rate up to the time the pony-wheels of his engine left the track. As to the actual rate of speed he was running, there is the usual discrepancy between the evidence of the different witnesses. Most of them put it from 6 to 8 miles; one of them 12 miles. But not a single witness puts it as low as five miles an hour, the limit of speed he was ordered to run at.\nAfter listening to the able arguments of counsel and the careful analysis of the evidence made by them and reading all the evidence called to our attention on the crucial point of the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence, I have reached the conclusion that there was no evidence to justify the jury\u2019s finding of negligence on the defendants\u2019 part \u201cin a defective roadbed and want of a watchman for same\u201d and that the real cause of the accident arose from the excessive and prohibited speed at which the deceased was running his train. It was argued that the finding of the jury that the deceased by the exercise of ordinary care could not have avoided the accident amounted to a finding that the speed of the train was not beyond the five miles an hour his orders prescribed. But I think that is asking too much of the court. No witness ventured the statement that the speed was as low as five miles, while the facts proved did not admit of any reasonable inference being drawn to that effect. I do not think the jury intended in this indirect way to find that the rate of speed was in accordance with the orders.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action for damages by the widow and administratrix of a locomotive engine-driver, for damages suffered by reason of his having been killed in an accident on the respondent\u2019s road on the 19th July, 1911, claimed by her to have been caused by the negligence of respondent.\nThe action was tried at Winnipeg by Mr. Justice Galt, with a jury, who rendered a verdict of $5,000 for the plaintiff, now appellant.\nUpon that verdict judgment was entered for appellant. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba reversed it. Chief Justice Howell and Mr. Justice Cameron dissented from the judgment of reversal, holding that there was evidence of negligence as charged which must be submitted to the jury.\nThe negligence charged was that there was a sinkhole over which the track had been laid, by reason of which the track, or at least one of the rails, was liable to sink from two to four inches as the trains passed over it. It was in that condition in October, 1910, and had continued so up to the time of the accident. Meantime the respondent\u2019s men from time to time had been putting in material to try and solidify the track. It never seems to have occurred to the respondent that such a continued series of failures from October to July demonstrated the necessity for more vigorous methods of rendering that part of the track safe for travel; unless indeed the existence of a heap of gravel deposited recently before the accident at the spot indicated an intention to do so.\nIt is proven other methods such as bridging the hole or avoiding it might have been adopted.\nNo precaution was taken to avoid any accident except the issuance of a general order in October to engineers to reduce speed of travel to five miles an hour in passing over this sink-sole and a notice merely to slow down posted at some distance from the spot. Copies of this order were issued to each engineer making the trip over this part of the road. No watchman was appointed to warn approaching trains in case of any danger. No sectionmen were called to shew any one had seen it that day, or when any one had seen it, though sectionmen had, about fifteen hundred feet distant therefrom, a station for operating from. It is said sectionmen had general instructions to look after the repairing. Prom two to six trains a day passed over it.\nIf that condition of things does not constitute such a case of negligence on the part of the defendant as should be submitted to a jury, I am at a loss to know what would. If some passengers had got killed as the result thereof and those responsible for the continuance of such a condition of things, from October to 19th July, had been put on trial for manslaughter, I think the jury trying them would have been justified in finding a verdict of guilty.\nIt never occurred to able counsel at the close of the trial to move for a nonsuit on the ground of want of proof of negligence. There was a motion of nonsuit on other grounds and a hope that respondent could prove to the satisfaction of the jury that the deceased had disobeyed the order to reduce his speed to five miles an hour.\nIn that the respondent failed; and I think, considering the evidence as presented in the analysis thereof in the appellant\u2019s admirable factum, which I have found most helpful, that the jury properly refused to find that deceased had neglected his duty.\nIt was quite competent for the jury to have disbelieved the evidence, and some of it certainly was not entitled to much credit. As to those speaking of the rate of speed being six to eight miles an hour, between the slow-down post and the place of the accident, they were at best making a guess about something in respect of which they had no duty to observe anything, whilst the deceased had bis mind solely directed to the matter in discharging his duty. And it is to be observed that the order was\nto reduce speed to five miles an hour over sink-hole half a mile east of Farlane.\nThe man who issued this order asserted on the witness stand the sink-hole proper was only twenty feet in length.\nTo apply the like illustration I have given relative to the negligence of respondent, had the deceased been put on trial for manslaughter caused by neglect of this peculiarly worded order, could he have been convicted thereof on evidence resting upon such a guess?\nI repeat this defence had to be established to the satisfaction of the jury and their verdict is conclusive, but by reason of the theories put forward (to demonstrate rate of speed and not the respondent\u2019s negligence as the cause) resting upon the appearance of things as found after the accident being coupled with this evidence, I think it well to point out how little that can be depended upon. So far as the theories themselves, quite independent of such support, are concerned they are equally matters which the jury could reject, especially as not supported by any positive expert evidence and are not based upon accurate representation of the facts.\nThe question thus comes back to the primary one of whether or not the respondent can in law be permitted to maintain in such condition for such a length of time such a dangerous condition of things without more drastic means to remedy them and without more protection to those whose duty or business might call them to venture across so treacherous a spot.\nI concur in the main in the reasoning adopted by the judges dissenting in the court below from the judgment of the court. I need not repeat same here.\nI think the action lies at common law. The negligence was that of the respondent.\nAs to the point, taken by Mr. Symington, that the action would not lie in Manitoba, I think as the law of England, including the \u201cFatal Accidents Act\u201d was introduced into Manitoba in 1870, and a like law in force in Ontario, that the action would lie in Manitoba where the appellant lived, and respondent had property. See Dicey on Conflict of Laws, pages 645 to 647\u2014Rule 178.\nIn my view of the case it is neither necessary nor desirable that I should express any opinion upon the many questions raised relative to the possibility of the claim being rested upon the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the trial judgment be restored.\nDuff J. \u2014 This appeal should be dismissed. There is not in my opinion any reasonable evidence to support a finding either:\u2014\n(1) That the track and roadbed at the place in question were, assuming the order as to speed to be observed, so dangerous as to make it negligence on the part of the company, vis-\u00e0-vis the appellant, to operate for traffic; or\n(2) That it was the state of the roadbed rather than excessive speed which was the real cause of the most unfortunate and distressing accident in which the husband of the plaintiff met his death.\nI refer to the argument on the question of jurisdiction for the reason only that silence might be construed as implying some doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Manitoba courts to entertain the action. The effect of the provincial and Dominion legislation [chapter 12 of the Statutes of Manitoba, passed in the year 1874 (38 Vict.) and section 6 of chapter 99, R.S.C. (51 Vict, ch. 33)] is that prima facie the law of England as it existed in the year 1870 is, for the purposes of this appeal, to be regarded as the law of Manitoba. By the law of England, speaking generally, a legal obligation ex delicto (where the res gest\u0153 giving rise to the obligation have occurred outside the territorial jurisdiction of the English courts) may be enforced in those courts if, according to the law of England, a like obligation would have arisen had the scene of the res gest\u0153 been within that jurisdiction; Phillips v. Eyre[2], at pages 28 and 29. Nothing has been suggested to create a doubt that this is the law of Manitoba to-day. The argument founded upon the limited legislative jurisdiction of the province misses the mark. If there could be anything in it in the absence of the Dominion legislation above mentioned the argument would be disposed of by reference to that legislation. It follows, therefore, that if a right of action by common law (the law of England) became vested in the plaintiff in Ontario the obligation to which that right of action was attached would be enforceable in Manitoba., The fact that the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue in Ontario rests upon \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d is really no objection because \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d is in force in Manitoba: and it is literally true to say that if the scene of the res gest\u0153 had been in Manitoba the right to redress independently of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d would not have been any less there than in Ontario. As to the enforceability of any obligation imposed upon the respondents by the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d I have formed no opinion upon the point whether the provisions of that Act relating to notice and to dispensing with notice are of the essence of the employees\u2019 rights to such a degree as to make that right enforceable in Ontario only. I think it is proper to add that acknowledgments are due to counsel on both sides for the very admirable way in which the appeal was argued.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014This is the case of a railway accident which occurred on that part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway which runs through the Province of Ontario.\nThe action was instituted in Winnipeg, the place of destination of the train on which the accident occurred. Winnipeg is also the centre of operations of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company and was in that respect the place where, for the convenience of the respondent, the suit could be best tried.\nThe accident having occurred in the Province of Ontario was necessarily to be decided according to the laws of that province. \u201cLex loci actus\u201d must furnish the rule to dispose of the case, as Cockburn C.J. decided in Phillips v. Eyre[3].\nThe company respondent has property in the Province of Manitoba and it could have been sued in the latter province although the cause of action had not arisen there.\nThe jury found that the accident was clue to the negligence of the company.\nThat judgment, however, was reversed by a majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal.\nThe deceased, in consequence of whose death the present action was instituted, was operating as a locomotive engineer. On the line of the defendant company, there was a soft spot or sink-hole over which the trains of the defendant company ran. On the 19th of July, 1911, as the deceased was driving a freight train over this soft spot the engine was turned over and he was killed.\nAn order had been given that the trains should not run, at that place, at a speed exceeding five miles. It was claimed by the company that this order had not been carried out and that the accident was due to an excessive rate of speed.\nThe evidence is very conflicting with respect to that, and a jury could reasonably infer that the order had not been violated. With that verdict of the jury it is not within our province to interfere.\nThe jury has also found that the accident was due to a depression of the track caused by the weight of the engine and by a defect of construction in the road. That was also a matter for the jury to decide and the evidence is also on that point somewhat conflicting. But the jury having come to the conclusion that there was negligence on the part of the company, we should not interfere with that verdict.\nIn those circumstances, I think that the verdict of the jury should stand and that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which has rejected that finding, should be reversed with costs of this court and of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Crichton, McClure & Cohen.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Joseph Yates.\n[1] 24 Man.

Jeffrey (Defendant) Respondent\n1915: October 26; 1915: November 29.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nBuilders and contractors\u2014Materials supplied\u2014Order for money payable under contract\u2014Evidence\u2014Estoppel\u2014Lien\u2014Enforcing equitable assignment\u2014Practice. A building contractor gave a written order upon the owner directing him to pay the sum of $800 to the plaintiff on account of the price of materials supplied for use in the building which was being erected. The order was presented to the owner and, although not accepted in writing, was held over to await the time for making payments under the contract. The contractor failed to complete the work, and 'it was finished by the owner at an outlay which left the balance of the contract price insufficient to meet the full amount of the order.\nHeld, the Chief Justice and Idington J. dissenting, that the order was effective as an assignment of money payable under the contract, but, as there was no evidence of a promise to pay the amount thereof out of the fund, or of facts precluding the owner from denying the sufficiency of what ultimately was payable to the contractor, it could not be enforced against the owner as an equitable assignment.\nPer Duff J.\u2014As the equitable relief sought could be granted only upon a consideration of all the circumstances and no claim therefor was made in the courts below nor was the evidence directed to any such claim, the claim came too late on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J., dissenting.\u2014As the conduct of the owner respecting the order was equivocal and misleading and induced the materialman to abstain from filing a lien to protect himself, the owner ought to be held liable for the full amount of the order as an equitable assignment.\nThe appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division (8 West. W.R. 729) was dismissed with costs.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Ives J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case appear from the head-note.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nGerald V. Pelton for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am satisfied on the evidence that the appellant failed to file a lien under the Act because of the defendant's promise to pay Horn's order. J. W. Ritchie, when examined as a witness, says that he did not file a lien because he trusted Mr. Jeffrey would pay the order given by Mr. Horn and again on his re-examination he testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. Did you actually at any time have any intention of filing a lien against Mr. Jeffrey's property ?\nA. We would have, if he hadn't given us the assurance that he was going to pay it.\nAnd again:\u2014\nQ. Had you consulted your solicitor about your right to file the lien ?\nA. Yes.\nThe same witness also says that he accomplished the shipment of lumber on that understanding. If the appellant had filed his lien he, as material man, under the Act would have been entitled to precedence over Haugen, the sub-contractor, who was subsequently paid $558.10. To say the least, Jeffrey's conduct at the time Horn's order in favour of appellant was presented to him was shifty and ambiguous, and if in the result he led the appellant into error and induced him by his conduct and representations not to file a lien, he should be held liable.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The only question of any difficulty in this appeal is whether or not the order upon respondent for $800 by Horn, a contractor, engaged in building for him a shop for which, When completed, Horn was to be paid $3,000, can, with the attendant facts and circumstances, be held as furnishing sufficient evidence to maintain the appellant's claim of an equitable assignment of part of the said $3,000.\nThe shop was being erected in Jasper Park. The appellant furnished lumber therefor to an amount greater than $800, as respondent well knew. Horn, in order to give security to appellant therefor to the amount of $800, gave the following order:\u2014\nJohn Ritchie Lumber Co.,\nEdmonton, Alta., Jan. 27, 1914.\nW. S. Jeffrey, Esq.,\n2005 Jasper W.\nPlease pay to John Ritchie Lumber Co. the sum of $800 on account of material delivered and shipped to Jasper Park.\nC. R. Horn.\nThis order is not as unambiguously worded as was that in question in the case of Brice v. Bannister[2]. In that case the order expressly said it Was to be \"paid out of moneys due or to become due from you to me,\" and thus within its very terms fulfilled the exact requirements of an equitable assignment.\nBut we must bear in mind that it is not necessary that such an equitable assignment as in question need to be reduced to writing.\nThe language of Mr. Justice Chitty in the case of Brown, Shipley & Co. v. Rough[3], as quoted by Mr. Justice Beck herein, so accurately defines what is required that I think we may accept it, coupled with what Lord Macnaghten said in the case of Tailby v. The Official Receiver[4], in 1888, as our guide herein. The quotation I refer to in the former case is as follows:\u2014\nAn agreement, to pay out of the fund is a good equitable charge. It matters not whether it (the agreement) be to pay an existing debt or a sum of money advanced at the time or whether it (the money to be paid) be (the amount of) a bill of exchange; but it must be shewn on the part of those who assert an equitable charge that they have obtained it (the charge) by agreement. The agreement may be shewn by producing a written document which is clear, or the agreement may be fairly derived from the course of dealing, and where there is a contest as to an oral agreement, the court must decide whether there is such an oral agreement or not and the plaintiffs have to make out in this case one or other of the things I have mentioned before they can succeed in establishing an agreement amounting to an equitable charge or an equitable assignment of part, of the fund. An agreement- may be shewn by the terms which the parties came to with reference to the supposed course of dealing and derived also from the course of dealing itself relating to transactions that have been entered into or transactions which it is proposed should be entered into, or it may be shewn by the special terms agreed to at the time when the transaction takes place.\nTo apply the law as laid down by Mr. James Chitty in this extract we need not go further than consider the course of dealing between the parties. That alone has not been relied upon herein for Ave have an order and the course of dealing illuminating, as other considerations I am about to advert to, the meaning to be given the order.\nIt is beyond dispute that the respondent was building 'a shop in Jasper Park which was being built by Horn, who gives the order; that the appellant had delivered and shipped to Jasper Park material for said building far exceeding in value the amount of the order; that the material so shipped and delivered was at the date of the order being used and ultimately was all used to the knowledge of the respondent by Horn for the purposes of the construction of said building; that respondent knew and recognized such facts and his consequent benefit therefrom and liability upon his contract as the basis upon which Horn proceeded in giving the order; that the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" gave him supplying such material to the contractor for such purpose a lien upon the material till used, and upon the building itself when used in the construction thereof, and that in priority to all other liens\u2014unless possibly wage-earners for their labour\u2014and that the parties thereto were entire strangers to each other yet the respondent had no difficulty in understanding why the order was given, and no difficulty in recognizing that it was intended and expected to be paid out of the fund which consisted of the contract price.\nThe order should be read, if ambiguous, in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances. So read and illuminated thereby, can there be a doubt as to what the order meant and that it did mean that it was to be paid out of the fund in respondent's hands to pay for said building and to be a charge thereon and that the fund was to be administered according to the legal rights of the parties concerned in its distribution and that respondent was entitled to discharge pro tanto his obligation to Horn by payment of said order ? I think not.\nTo put beyond doubt the knowledge of the respondent I may refer to the following from his own evidence:\u2014\nQ. Correct, I know, but the order which was presented to you was an order for the payment of a certain sum of money in connection with the sum of $800 on account of material delivered and shipped to Jasper Park?\nA. Yes, that is what the order was for I suppose.\n* * * * *\nQ. You knew that they were expecting payment from you of the amount of that order?\nA. I don't know hardly how to answer that; I presume Mr. Horn had told them that I would pay it without any question.\nQ. And you also certainly led them to understand that it would be paid?\nA. I told them that it would be paid after the building was done if it was coming to Mr. Horn.\nQ. Did you always put in that \"If it was coming to Mr. Horn\"?\nA. I think so, as near as I can remember.\nQ. Beg pardon?\nA. I think so.\nQ. The Court: What I don't understand is why in your dealing Mr. Ritchie should be the only creditor to have to wait or lose if any one was to lose and you pay everybody else ?\nA. Well, Mr. Horn agreed to furnish all these materials.\nQ. But you knew they were coming from Ritchie?\nA. I supposed they were, yes; Mr. Horn said he was getting a lot from them; I don't know where the cement and the\u2014\nQ. Mr. Grant: You knew that Mr. Ritchie did expect to get the money from you ?\nA. I know they wanted it from me; they asked me; there is four occasions when they came to me for it.\nQ. Now will you answer my question. You knew that Mr. Ritchie expected to get the $800 from you?\nA. Why, I suppose he did. There is much more needless to quote on the same point.\nHe hedges about paying it by saying he told appellant's agent if that much were coming to Horn when he had completed his contract, he would pay it. As he was under no liability to pay a single dollar till the time had arrived, I cannot see how that helps him. If he had paid no one else till then there would have been no trouble.\nIf labourers had gone unpaid and, what was highly improbable, their unpaid wages had eaten up the fund in liens therefor the appellant might have been left unpaid. No such thing happened.\nA sub-contractor named Haugen got far more than required to pay this appellant. In short, he, whose claim was in law and equity subject to be postponed to the claims of the material-men was paid. Respondent quibbles about this being for labour, pretends that at first and later on shews at least as to one item of $500 alone it was for a sub-contract.\nThe learned trial judge had no difficulty once he arrived at the conclusion that appellant had an equitable assignment then respondent was bound to answer for the whole amount of the order.\nAnd the position taken in the court of appeal proceeds entirely upon the ground that there was no equitable assignment\u2014and indeed only a bill of exchange.\nFor the reasons already indicated I most respectfully say I cannot accept that view.\nIt is quite true there is a decision (Shand v. Du Buisson[5]) that a mere bill of exchange, evidently intended as such, is not of itself an equitable assignment, and another that a cheque on a banker cannot be so held. The parties concerned herein never supposed they were dealing with either such thing, but something different.\nWhat we have to pronounce upon herein is not of that simple character in form or intention when we try to understand what the parties were about.\nThe case of Percival v. Dunn[6], relied upon below, is clearly distinguishable, for the order was not even addressed to the party who had to pay and was not accompanied, so far as appeals, by any attendant circumstances that helped to explain or form an independent arrangement.\nThe argument presented by counsel here endeavoured to shew that the court in Brice v. Bannister[7] was divided, but it has ever since stood as good law and been, I venture to think, extended in principle as the equitable doctrine became more familiar to the profession than it was when Brice v. Bannister7 was decided, shortly after the \"Judicature Act.\"\nThe case of William Brandt's Sons & Co. v. Dunlop Rubber Co.[8], though not exactly covering this case, shews how in recent times the court is disposed to treat such claims as rest upon the doctrine relative to equitable assignment.\nI agree with the court of appeal that the bargaining between the respondent and the agent of appellant standing alone has little to do with the matter, yet that does not do away with the knowledge the respondent had of the plain purpose of the order to have it paid out of the fund in existence or to come into existence.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and -below.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have no doubt that the order in question was a good and effective equitable assignment of the fund over which the contractor should ultimately prove to have the power of disposition as between himself and the respondent. To give the appellant the right he now claims, the equitable assignment must be supplemented by something additional, that is by some act or acts of the respondent himself raising a right against him; such, for example, as a promise founded upon legal consideration or conduct precluding the respondent from disputing the existence of an equitable charge for the amount claimed. For such equitable relief no claim was made in the courts below and as such relief could only be granted as the result of an examination of the circumstances as a whole\u2014which it cannot be said the evidence places before us\u2014it is too late now to consider it.\nAs to promise\u2014the finding at the trial is against it. On the whole I am constrained to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Except in so far as he questioned the sufficiency of the order given by Horn to the plaintiff as, under the circumstances, a good equitable assignment, I am in accord with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Beck in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division. There is nothing in the record which warrants extending the fund upon which that assignment should operate beyond moneys in the defendant's hands over which Horn had the right of disposition. The evidence does not warrant a finding of a promise by the defendant to pay upon the order in question more than this amount\u2014and there has been no such finding. Neither does it establish a representation that the fund to which the order attached would be sufficient to meet, it, or would amount to any specific sum. It may be that the plaintiff in refraining from registering a mechanic's lien relied upon his equitable assignment and the defendant's acceptance of it, but it has not been shewn that the defendant said or did anything Which would warrant an inference by the plaintiff that he had relinquished in his favour his undoubted right to make out of the moneys payable to his contractor such payments as might be necessary to protect his property from liens and to ensure the completion of the building contract and to deduct payments so made from the moneys which would otherwise be payable to the contractor. The plaintiff has failed to make out a case either of a promise to pay the amount of his order or of an equitable estoppel precluding the defendant from denying the sufficiency of the fund in his hands to meet it.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The defendant Jeffrey was erecting a building and a man named Horn had a contract in connection with that construction. Horn, having purchased materials from the plaintiff Ritchie, gave, on the 27th January, 1914, the following order:\u2014\nW. S. Jeffrey, Esq.,\n2005 Jasper W.\nPlease pay to John Ritchie Lumber Co. the sum of $800 on account of material delivered and shipped to Jasper Park.\nC. R. Horn. At the time this order was given and was notified to the respondent no money was due upon the Horn contract by Jeffrey. Horn seems to have been unable to carry out his contract and the proprietor had to pay money to third parties to finish the building. He had to pay some wages of labourers and when the building was finally completed $296.99 remained due to Horn, which he deposited in court for the plaintiff Ritchie.\nIt is clear from the evidence that the respondent Jeffrey never undertook to pay the full amount of the order. He was willing, however, out of the amount which would ultimately remain owing to Horn on the completion of the contract, to pay that amount to the plaintiff. It would have appeared ridiculous that he would have formally agreed to give an absolute and unconditional promise to pay when he did not know whether Horn would carry out his contract and when some liens could have been registered by wage-earners or others.\nThe trial judge held that this order constituted an equitable assignment; but it is necessary, in order to constitute such an assignment, that the fund should be specified (Percival v. Dunn[9]); and, besides, this order was valid subject to any claim under the contract which would have been good against the assignor.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 8 West.

V., c. 9, s. 76.\nUnder the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 20, any description by which the goods affected by a bill of sale can be identified is formally sufficient, as the Act does not require specific description of the chattels comprised therein.\nA bill of sale given as security for the payment of a promissory note contained recitals shewing particulars of the note and that interest was payable on the amount thereof, but the rate of interest was not mentioned and the note was not annexed thereto nor registered with the bill of sale.\nHeld, per Davies, Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ. that the recitals stated the consideration in a manner which substantially conformed to the requirements of section 19 of the \"Bills of Sale Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 20, and the omission to annex the note to the instrument as registered was, in this regard, immaterial. Credit Co. v. Pott (6 Q.B.D. 295) followed.\nPer Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. (Idington J. contra.)\u2014As the assurance was embodied in two documents, the bill of sale and the note, and one of these documents, the note, was not registered as required by section 19 of the B.C. \"Bills of Sale Act,\" the absence of a complete statement of the terms of defeas- ance in the bill of sale rendered it void as a security to the bank. Cochrane v. Matthews (10 Ch. D. 80n) ; Ex parte Odell (10 Ch. D. 84) ; Counsell v. London and Westminster Loan and Discount Co. (19 Q.B.D. 512); Edwards v. Marcus ((1894) 1 Q.B. 587), and Ex parte Collins (10 Ch. App. 367), referred to.\nAs part of the consideration of an agreement by which the bank acquired the office site and business of a trust company the bank became responsible for the claims of persons who had deposited money with the company and, to secure the bank in respect to this liability and form a fund to meet payments to depositors, the company gave the bank a promissory note for the amount of the deposits and assigned assets to the bank which included, amongst other securities, the bill of sale above mentioned.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. (Idington J. contra), that the transaction was not a loan of money or an advance made by the bank in contravention of section 76, sub-sec. 2 (c), of the \"Bank Act,\" 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 9, but a legitimate exercise of the powers conferred by the Act.\nPer Duff J.\u2014If the transaction were to be considered as a loan it would, nevertheless, be unobjectionable because it would be a loan upon the security of an \"obligation\" of a corporation within the meaning of clause (c) of the first sub-section of section 76 of the \"Bank Act,\" and it is immaterial that the \"obligation\" was secured by a charge upon the property of the corporation.\nThe judgment appealed from (22 D.L.R. 647; 8 West. W.R. 734) was reversed, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of Murphy J., at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head\u2014note.\nJ. W. deB. Farris for the appellants.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The claim in this case is under a bill of sale, a form of security beset with difficulties and a fruitful source of litigation. In the case of Thomas v. Kelly[3] Lord Chancellor Halsbury said:\u2014\nMy Lords, I cannot say that any construction of this obscure statute (the \"Bills of Sale Act\") seems completely satisfactory or gives an adequate solution to all the difficulties suggested in the argument,\nand Lord Macnaghten used even stronger language, saying the Act was beset with difficulties which could only be removed by legislation. The difficulties presented by the British Columbia statute are, I think, no less and, as it differs from the English Act, we have not so much assistance from decided cases.\nThe defendant, the present appellant, raised many points but, at the argument before this court, two were, I think, mainly relied on; the first being the alleged insufficiency of the description of the goods and chattels covered by the bill of sale and the second that the transaction by which the respondent acquired the chattel mortgage is void under the provision of the \"Bank Act,\" ch. 29, R.S.C. 1906, sec. 76, sub-sec. 2, par. (c).\nThat the description is quite inadequate for a proper bill of sale must, I think, be conceded; neither the nominal enumeration of the three items in the schedule nor the general words afford any satisfactory means of identification of the goods and chattels intended to be covered by the bill. There is granted, first, the three enumerated items of which the identification is not sufficient; I refer to the similar cases of Carpenter v. Deen[4], and Davies v. Jenkins[5].\nSecondly, the goods on the farm at the time of the making of the instrument; these are, of course, not identified so that it can be said that they are still on the land at the time when the mortgage is put in force.\nAnd thirdly, after-acquired property which may be brought on the farm.\nIn truth a grant such as this is not so much a bill of sale as a floating charge, that is a charge on whatever happens to be on the farm at the time when it is called into operation.\nUnder the English \"Bills of Sale Act\" no such charge can be given, as section 5 of the Act of 1882 (45 and 46 Vict. ch. 43) makes void, except as against the grantor, a bill of sale of any personal chattels of which the grantor is not the true owner.\nIn the case before the House of Lords of Tailby v. Official Receiver[6], at page 540, Lord Fitzgerald said:\u2014\nIn a case recently before the House, Your Lordships considered that the policy of the \"Bills of Sale Act\" of 1882 was to prohibit, in cases coming within its provisions, bills of sale of property not in existence, but which might be acquired thereafter.\nEven if permissible in British Columbia, it is only equitable title that the grantee can obtain in such after-acquired property.\nIn the case of Jones v. Roberts[7] (in 1890), Fry L.J. said that this question of specific description in bills of sale was perpetually re-appearing and was always embarrassing. The necessary description varied according to the circumstances of each case.\nThe question always was\u2014Was the description one which could reasonably be required to assist in identifying the particular property in question? The description (in the particular case) was sufficient to diminish the difficulty of identifying the property in case an execution were put in.\nThough, as Will appear from the above remarks, I have some hesitation in holding that the description of the goods and chattels is sufficient, I do not on the whole think there is occasion for this court to avoid the bill of sale on the ground of its being insufficient.\nBoth the trial judge and the judges of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia have declared themselves satisfied of the identity of the goods and chattels covered by the bill of sale with those sold by the appellant and that being so, I think the judgment should not be disturbed.\nI have not thought it necessary to examine into the validity of the registration of the sale. Under section 19 of the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act,\" a bill of sale is not void for failure to comply with its requirements. It is only the registration that is void. The British Columbia Act is taken apparently from the Imperial Act of 1878 which did not require registration in all cases for the validity of a bill of sale; this is only provided by the amendment Act of 1882, sec. 8.\nIn the \"Bills of Sale Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1897, sections 11 to 14 are under the caption \"Effect of Registration,\" and section 15, \"Result of non-Registration.\"\nIn the British Columbia Court of Appeal, McPhillips J.A. insists\nthat the appellant Ball was in no way a purchaser for value or otherwise entitled to the goods and chattels sold by him * * * The appellant in making the sale of the goods was selling not his goods, but the goods of the defendant Whieldon. If it is true that the grantor of the bill of sale remained the owner of the goods, there is an end of any question, because the bill of sale certainly could not be void as against the grantor.\nIf, however, this is not the effect of the deed of the 11th August, 1913, it is still necessary for the appellant to shew that he is one of the persons as against whom the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act\" provides that an unregistered bill shall be void.\nSection 7 of the Act is set out at page 6 of the respondent's factum, but he does not hazard any suggestion as to which of the class of persons therein enumerated he belongs.\nAs regards paragraph (a) in this section it may be noted that the Imperial statute reads:\u2014\nAs against all trustees or assignees of the estate of the person whose chattels or any of them are comprised in such bill of sale under the law relating to bankruptcy or liquidations, etc.\nThe words italicized are omitted in the British Columbia statute.\nEven without such assistance as the comparison gives for reading the British Columbia provision, it does not seem possible that the appellant can be within any of the classes enumerated.\nAs for paragraph (d) the appellant cannot be considered a purchaser. He was entitled to hold neither the goods nor the purchase money.\nI am not disposed to attach much importance to the point of a suggested contravention of the \"Bank Act.\" The transaction was one of legitimate banking business and the taking over of this security was a small incident such as in no way brings it within the purview of the provisions of section 76 of the \"Bank Act.\" The opinion that the taking by the respondent of the mortgage security is an infringement of the prohibition contained in section 76 of the \"Bank Act\" appears to be based on the assumption that \"the company did not sell its business to the bank.\" I venture to suggest that this is not borne out by the facts and the agreement of the 13th January, 1913. It is not, of course, the opinion of the judges of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. The trial judge says \"the agreement was for the purchase of a banking business\"; and McPhillips J.A.:\u2014\nThe People's Trust Company had engaged in business\u2014in some respects analogous to that engaged in by a bank subject to the \"Bank Act,\" but not in contravention of it\u2014and to acquire the business so carried on was, in my opinion, the doing of something by the Royal Bank appertaining to the business of banking.\nTurning to the agreement of the 13th January, 1913, whatever its effect, it certainly purported to dispose of the business of the trust company because it recites (inter alia) that the company had been carrying on business as agents and trustees and as the receivers of moneys paid on deposit at South Hill and various other places in British Columbia and that the company was desirous of selling the said business at South Hill to the bank and had agreed with the bank, for the consideration thereafter appearing, to transfer to the bank the business together with the office, etc. And it was witnessed (inter alia), by paragraph 9, that the company should hand over to the bank all documents relating to all business carried on by the vendors at South Hill aforesaid except as there mentioned and, by paragraph 10, that the company should in no wise attempt to procure or induce any of the depositors to thereafter continue their business with the company or any of its other branches. It would seem that one must naturally arrive at different conclusions concerning the effect of the agreement of 13th January, 1913, and its legality according as the transaction is considered as being only a sale of the property, and a separate arrangement for discounting the company's note, or as one transaction for transferring to the bank the whole business of the company of which these are two incidental terms specially provided for. In the former case it might be contended that there was an advance on security prohibited by the \"Bank Act,\" but in the latter case the transaction is proper banking business, the loan is not made on the security of goods and the taking over of the security is merely incidental to the transaction, no evasion of the Act, and not to be considered as even technically within its prohibition.\nI may add that I very much question whether the appellant was entitled to plead this as a defence to the action.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014There were several substantial questions argued upon this appeal. First, it was contended that the bill of sale in question did not contain a true statement of the note or debt for the payment of which it was given as collateral security and that the note itself or, at any rate, a true copy of it should under the statute have been annexed to the bill of sale.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that the question is concluded by the case of Credit Company v. Pott[8], and that the recitals in the bill of sale in question in this appeal state with substantial accuracy, though perhaps not with strict or technical accuracy, the facts of the indebtedness due from the grantor to the grantee which the bill of sale was given to secure. It is true that neither the note nor a copy of it was attached to the bill of sale, but the recitals contain the date and the amount of the note, the time when it became payable and that it carried interest. No question was or could be raised as to the bona fides of the transaction and it seemed to me the objection was reduced to this that the omission to state, in the recital of the note in the bill of sale, the rate of interest it carried, although all other particulars were correctly recited, was fatal as not complying with the statute. But in my judgment, if the case of Credit Company v. Pott[9] is good law, and I must say it commends itself to me as such, the objection cannot prevail.\nIt is a question whether the recitals contain with substantial accuracy a true statement of the consideration for which it was given so as to satisfy the requirements of the \"Bills of Sale Act\" of British Columbia.\nIn that case of Credit Company v. Pott[10] the bill of sale recited that B. had agreed to lend A. \u00a37,350, and the consideration for such bill of sale was stated to be \u00a37,350 then paid by A. to B. It was held that although no such money was then actually paid by A. to B., it being a balance due on accounts stated between the parties, and by such bill of sale was to be paid by A. to B. with interest on demand in writing, nevertheless the bill of sale \"truly set forth\" the consideration for which it was given so as to satisfy the statute. Brett L.J. (afterwards Lord Esher), says, at page 299:\u2014\nNow I am inclined to agree that such facts are not strictly accurately stated, but then it will suffice if they are accurately stated either as to their legal effect or as to their mercantile and business effect, although they may not be stated with strict accuracy.\nWhat took place was this:\u2014An account was stated between the parties, and it was agreed that a certain sum should be taken as the amount due to the company, and that, in consideration of the debtor giving the security of a bill of sale, the sum so due. and which might have been demanded at once of the debtor, should be held over until it was demanded in writing. That arrangement was carried out by the bill of sale in question. Then what is the effect? Why the old debt which was payable at once was wiped out, and a new debt constituted which was payable only after a demand in writing. A new credit was thus given, and the effect is the same as if after taking the accounts, \u00a37,350, the sum found to be due, had been put into the hands of the creditors, and then handed back by them to the debtor to be repaid by him on demand in writing. Therefore, both the legal effect and the mercantile and business effect of the transaction was as if there had been an actual advance in money of the \u00a37,350, and consequently the consideration is, I think, truly described in this bill of sale, both according to its mercantile and business effect and its legal effect.\nThe next objection was that the transaction between the People's Trust Company and the bank, as evidenced by the agreement of January 13th, was, so far as this bill of sale was concerned, a violation of section 76 of the \"Bank Act.\"\nScrutinizing the transaction between the People's Trust Company and the bank as a whole, I have had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that it was one with respect to which, as said by Chief Justice Macdonald, neither party had any intention of evading the \"Bank Act,\" I think that it was within the permissive sections of that Act and I do not think it can be held to be a transaction violating any of the prohibitory sections of that Act.\nI cannot for a moment believe that, in taking the assignment of the People's Trust Company's assets and making the advance to that company it did on the security it took, the bank could be held to be \"lending money upon the security of any goods, wares or merchandise\" within the prohibition of sub-section (c), para. 2, of section 76.\nThe mere fact that for one of the many notes transferred to the bank as collateral security for its advances the trust company held a bill of sale as collateral which also passed to the bank does not create such a condition as is covered by this prohibitory section. We must ascertain and scrutinize with care the real transaction, and if and when one finds that to be within the bank's general powers he will be slow to hold that the inclusion and transfer as a part of the larger transaction of a trivial debt and its collateral security upon goods and chattels would necessarily make that security void in the hands of the bank. I venture to say that the existence of this bill of sale as collateral security to one of the many promissory notes transferred to the bank never entered into the calculations of any one and I cannot hold that in taking an assignment of it under the circumstances it did the bank was guilty of any violation of the section of the Act referred to prohibiting the \"lending of money upon the security of goods, wares and merchandise.\"\nThen as to the last point taken, namely, the identity of the goods sold, I think there was evidence justifying the inference of the trial judge as to such identity and that his conclusion and that of the Court of Appeal was correct.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent recovered judgment against appellant for the sum of $1,136.30, being the amount of a promissory note secured by a chattel mortgage upon certain goods and chattels of which appellant became possessed and disputed respondent's right to enforce the chattel mortgage against him.\nOf the several objections taken by appellant arising out of the alleged invalidity of the chattel mortgage itself, I agree with the courts below that he must fail therein.\nThe consideration is truly set forth within the meaning of the \"Bills of Sale Act\" according to what was held by the Court of Appeal in England in the case of The Credit Co. v. Pott[11], when construing the English Act using substantially the same language.\nThe omission (if there was in fact such) to annex to the registered instrument a copy of the promissory note which was to be secured thereby seems of no consequence in face of the full description thereof in the document itself. The allusion therein to its being annexed, if in fact it never was annexed, may well be treated as surplusage, having under such circumstances no meaning.\nIf, in fact, there was a copy of the promissory note annexed to the instrument, it was quite competent for the appellant to have not only shewn that fact, but also to have made of it anything found arguable by shewing that it substantially varied from that described in the instrument.\nIn default of his having done so I think it must be presumed that the certified copy of the instrument contains all that was registered, and that treated in the way already suggested.\nRather changing, I suspect, the ground taken in the court below reliance is put by appellant upon the provisions in section 19 of the Act, providing\nif the bill of sale is made or given subject to any defeasance or condition or declaration of trust not contained in the body thereof, etc.,\nthen that is to be written out and registered under pain of nullity of the instrument.\nIt seems to me quite clear that this promissory note is within the plain ordinary sense of the words \"contained in the body\" of the instrument, and the defeasance clause therein expressly provides that it is upon payment\nof the aforesaid promissory note at maturity or any renewal thereof, and all interest in respect thereof, etc.,\nthat these presents shall cease and be utterly void.\nI fail to comprehend where any other defeasance or condition has been found. I cannot conjure it up, unless something more to rest upon than my imagination, which is too inactive to supply the obvious requirement of the section to give vitality to the objection.\nThis is not the case of a mortgage given for a debt and a promissory note given for same debt is outstanding but never referred to in the mortgage. Nor is it a case of two promissory notes for same thing or different things intended to be covered by the same mortgage.\nThe only formidable objection, as it appears to me, set up by appellant to the respondent's right of recovery is, that its title to the mortgage rests upon what is an infringement of the prohibition contained in section 76 of the \"Bank Act,\" which reads:\u2014\n76. Except as authorized by this Act, the bank shall not either directly or indirectly:\n(c) lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements or immoveable property, or of any ship or other vessels, or upon the security of any goods, wares and merchandise.\nIt is to be observed that this is such an absolute prohibition as to render such a transaction as within its terms illegal. To apprehend correctly what was done a brief statement of the facts is necessary.\nThe People's Trust Company seems to have been engaged in a quasi-banking and insurance business, when the respondent, desirous of acquiring its place of business at South Hill, in South Vancouver, in which to establish a branch bank, made a bargain with it for the purchase of the building and its contents, excepting the safe and its contents, for the price of $12,500. That was a perfectly legitimate transaction and was, I assume, the chief motive leading up to what followed. But the chief motive does not cover all that was done.\nThe company had in course of its business obtained money from its customers, by way of deposits earning four per cent, per annum interest, to the total amount of $30,341.31 and acquired, presumably by using said moneys in way of so loaning, and obtained in course of doing so, promissory notes and bills of exchange and other securities for the re-payment thereof to the amount of $25,578.50.\nThe assignment upon which the respondent's right to maintain its action and uphold the judgment now in question must rest, recites said facts and further recites as follows:\u2014\nAnd whereas the company is desirous of selling the said business at South Hill to the bank and also of providing for the payment to the said depositors at the branch at South Hill aforesaid of the amounts due to them with interest, and for the transfer of the various securities held by the company as collateral security for the payments to the said depositors by the bank.\nAnd whereas the company has agreed with the bank for the consideration hereinafter appearing to transfer to the bank the business carried on by the company at South Hill aforesaid, together with the office and office premises and the contents thereof, and also the moneys deposited by various depositors through the said branch of the said company at South Hill aforesaid, and the securities, bills of exchange, and promissory notes hereinafter mentioned.\nAnd whereas the company has agreed to pay to the bank the difference between the amount of such deposit accounts and the total amount of such promissory notes and bills of exchange in cash upon the completion of this agreement.\nSuch is the scope and purpose of the agreement relied upon by which, in its operative part, the company agrees to transfer to respondent all the premises of the company as described, and all goods therein as described in a schedule, and the said deposit accounts (whatever that may mean) enumerated in a schedule.\nIt then proceeds as follows:\u2014\nThe company shall forthwith upon the transfer of the said accounts pay to the bank a sufficient sum to pay in full the total amount of ($30,341.31) so deposited with the company by any depositor in accordance with the said schedule, which said sum shall be realized by the discounting by the bank of the promissory note referred to in clause 5 hereof, and the deposit of the proceeds with the bank:\n5. The company shall execute and deliver to the bank its promissory note for the said sum of thirty thousand three hundred and forty-one and 31\/100 *($30,341.31) dollars payable to the bank on demand, with interest at eight per cent. (8%) per annum as well after as before maturity, which said promissory note shall be indorsed by R. D. Edwards, E. H. Mansfield, W. A. Pound J. B. Springford, H S. Rashleigh, Musgrave Norris, A. A. Falk, Charles C. Kilpin, A. Smith and J. K. Burden, the directors of the company.\n6. The company shall also forthwith upon the execution of the agreement transfer and deliver to the purchaser the various promissory notes and bills of exchange in the hands of the company made by the customers of the said company in accordance with the third schedule hereunto annexed, together with all securities for the payment thereof, held by the company, which said promissory notes, bills of exchange, and securities shall be dealt with in the manner hereinafter appearing.\nIt further provides:\u2014\n11. The said sum of thirty thousand three hundred and forty-one and 31\/100 ($30,341.31) dollars, to be paid to the bank as herein before set forth, shall be deposited to the credit of the company with the said Royal Bank of Canada in a special account to be opened as the People's Trust Company account in trust for depositors of South Hill branch, the said sum being derived from the proceeds of the promissory note to be given by the company and indorsed by the directors of the company as hereinbefore set forth, and neither the said company nor the said directors shall be at liberty to withdraw any portion of the said sum until the whole of the said depositors have been paid in full and the liability of the said company and the said directors to the bank, and the said depositors is completely discharged, and thereafter such sum as remains to the credit of the said company shall be repaid by the bank to the company.\n* * * * *\n13. The bank shall pay upon the said promissory note for thirty thousand three hundred and forty-one and 31\/100 ($30,341.31) dollars, hereinbefore mentioned, the amount which may be collected by the bank on account of the promissory notes and bills of exchange due to the company and by the securities collateral thereto transferred to the bank pursuant to clause 6 hereof.\nThere are provisions for working out the scheme thus provided for protecting the depositors and for the application of the payments received from said bills, promissory notes and other securities, upon said promissory note for $30,341.31 to be given by the company and indorsed by the directors and also for returning any of said bills, promissory notes or other securities within six months if the bank should so elect, but if it did not so elect within that time they shall, as to all not so returned, at expiration thereof\nbe deemed to be and shall be taken over by the bank as and for its own use and benefit and the company shall thereupon become entitled to credit therefor.\nThere is then the following clause:\u2014 In consideration of the premises and upon the due transfer of the various property, real and personal, to be transferred by the company to the bank as hereinbefore set forth, the bank shall pay to the company the sum of twelve thousand five hundred ($12,500) dollars.\nThere follows a clause of indemnity of company and directors who, by the way, were not parties to anything except to the note.\nThe contention set up is that this was an agreement providing for the advance of money upon the \"security of goods, wares and merchandise.\"\nThere can be no doubt surely that the promissory note of the company, indorsed by the directors, was in the very language of the instrument discounted to raise the desired and needed sum set apart to meet a class of the company's obligations.\nThere can surely be no doubt that, pro tanto, the amount of this chattel mortgage was a substantial part of the security upon which the advance was made. The company evidently was in deep water at the time. Its directors as indorsers had a right on the face of the agreement, and leaving aside for the moment all question as to the effect of section 76, to look to that as part of their protection. If not illegal the bank could not discard, if it would, save under the six months' option, that part of the transaction, and insist upon the sureties so indorsing paying up and being disentitled to assert the ordinary rights of a surety and receive a transfer of that given the bank in way of security.\nIn passing I may say that the security of this chattel mortgage was, in one sense, so clearly severable from the rest of the transaction that its relation thereto may, in some aspects of the matter, be arguable as not tainting the entire obligation; especially in view of the provision that it was not scheduled or specifically named in the agreement and that the bank had a right for six months for any reason it saw fit, or without reason, to reject it.\nDoes that make any difference herein? It may well be that the bank could say it was through an oversight this was not rejected within the six months and that it never would have deliberately accepted a chattel mortgage \"on goods, wares or merchandise\" or mortgage on real estate as part of the security presented and in view at the time of agreeing to the advance upon which it made same.\nAssuming that, which I think quite probable, I am not disposed to think in such a peculiar case the consequences of a violation of the Act must necessarily taint the whole transaction.\nThe rule is that any part of the consideration of a contract being illegal, renders the whole void.\nCan it be said with this right of rejection of the evil part that it vitiated the whole?\nHowever that may be it is the question of the title of respondent that we must pass upon herein. And when it asserts the title it sets up it can only rest it upon the security having been part of the original consideration which never can within the law form part of the security, given contemporaneously with the agreement to make the advance which is made to rest thereon.\nIt so happens that there is no other title possible here for the bank to rely upon. It got an assignment later, but that was too late as an assignment for creditors had intervened. Hence, it comes back to the question of its possibly forming part of the original consideration or nothing. It is only the comprehensive language of paragraph 6 of the agreement and others in accord therewith which carry an equitable assignment of the mortgage in question.\nAnd if we give this a fair construction can we impute to the respondent the intention to bargain thereby for that which would by the taking thereof vitiate the whole? I incline to think not.\nIf anything had transpired later between the parties, say at the end of six months, when the taking of the mortgage then might have been interpreted as taking an additional security for a past debt, that would have been quite legal. I can find nothing in the case to rest such a holding upon.\nIt is said the motive of the whole transaction was the purchase of the property and the business of the company, but it is distinctly a contract of a two\u2014fold character. One relates to the purchase of the property and the other to the discounting of the company's note secured by the indorsement of the directors for a purpose entirely separate from the purchase.\nIf the company had chosen to go to another chartered bank and there discount the note indorsed by its directors, with the same collaterals including this chattel mortgage as security, and made same arrangement relative to the fund in every way, could there be any doubt of the invalidity of such a transfer of the chattel mortgage?\nIt is not true that the company sold its business to the bank. It sold its business site and furniture for $12,500. It recites the absurdity of selling its indebtedness to the depositors, but can that be treated seriously? I think not. The cases cited and relied upon do not seem to me to have much bearing upon the point raised herein.\nThe case of Bank of Toronto v. Perkins[12] is distinctly against the respondent.\nIt has occurred to me possibly the indorsers as sureties might have an equity to have the mortgage applied, but that I imagine would be only by way of subrogation, and I fail to find any equity on the part of the respondent through them in face of the express terms of the contract, which I interpret as excluding any intention to cover this mortgage. Indeed, no such argument was put forward.\nThe suggestion that the transaction was in fact a purchase of the securities including this chattel mortgage, seems to me at variance with many provisions and stipulations in the agreement. If it had provided at the expiration of six months it might take over the securities and give up the company's note indorsed by the directors, such an argument might have been tenable and, at all events, what we should have expected to find if a sale and purchase of securities had been its purpose.\nIt might be arguable that the phrase \"goods, wares and merchandise\" does not cover farm stock. No such argument was hinted at, but I have considered such a possible argument and concluded that the word \"goods\" does cover farm stock though it certainly does not cover every kind of personal property.\nStandard dictionaries such as \"Murray,\" the \"Century\" and the \"Imperial\" have nothing to enlighten us in regard to the meaning of the word \"goods.\" The various definitions given by Stroud certainly indicate that it does not cover every kind of personal property, and as defined by Bouvier I find the following:\u2014\nGoods, wares and merchandise. A phrase used in the \"Statute of Frauds.\" Fixtures do not come within it: I. Cr. M. & R. 275. Growing crops of potatoes, corn, turnips and other annual crops, are within it; 8 D. & R 314; 10 B. & C. 446; 4 M. & W. 347; contra, 2 Taunt. 38. See Addison, Contr. 31; Blackb., pp. 4, 5; 2 Dana 206; 2 Rawle 161; 5 B. & C. 829; 10 Ad. & E. 753. As to when growing crops are part of the realty and when personal property, see 1 Washb. R.P. 3.\nThe rest of the definition in Bouvier evidently relates to the sense in which the word is used by local legislatures. I think we must take it that coupled with the other words as in the phrase quoted it cannot mean personal property in the wide sense of the term such as promissory notes, bills of exchange or the like securities. Experience teaches us that bankers who have never hesitated in advancing upon collaterals of the latter description would certainly hesitate to take a chattel mortgage upon goods such as those now claimed herein.\nI regret to have to come to the conclusion I have, but the long-standing policy of the \"Bank Act\" is so distinctly against countenancing loans by a bank on real or personal (so far as defined by the term \"goods, wares and merchandise\") property, that I think it should be adhered to and the appeal allowed and the judgment below reversed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014 (1) As to the chattel mortgage.\n(a) The description and identification of the goods. The description is formally sufficient, the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act\" not requiring a specific description of the property comprised in the bill of sale; any description by which the goods can be identified being admissible. Of the identification of the goods I think there was evidence.\n(b) As to the statement of consideration. point is covered by Credit Co. v. Pott[13].\n(c) The objection from which at present I see no escape is based upon the fact (which I must, I am afraid, unavoidably find) that the \"assurance\" was embodied in two documents, one of which was not registered.\nIt is possible that the copy of the promissory note recited as being annexed and marked \"B\" was in fact annexed at the time of the execution; but, if so, the whole document was not registered because the registrar's certificate is conclusive that the document put in evidence is a true copy of the document registered. If there was no such copy then the \"assurance\" was embodied in the two documents executed, the bill of sale, so called, and the promissory note. Whether the \"assurance\" was embodied in these two documents or only in the document executed and registered is, of course, a question of fact; but I do not see how I can find otherwise than as above indicated. The purport and intent of the \"assurance\" is to charge the goods with the payment of the principal and interest of the promissory note. The extent of this charge could only be ascertained by an examination of the note; and the two documents being executed at the same time, I think, having regard to the circumstances, I must hold as a fact that the note was part of the \"assurance.\" This is consonant with the general effect of the earlier decisions upon the Act of 1854. See the judgment of Lindley J. in Cochrane v. Matthews[14], and the judgment of James L.J., Ex parte Odell[15], in the same volume, and the judgment of Lord Esher in Counsel v. London and Westminster Loan and Discount Co.[16], at page 515.\n(2) As to the objection based upon the \"Bank Act.\"\nIt was intended no doubt that in certain eventualities the bank should be entitled to assume the position and exercise the rights of a lender holding the promissory notes, etc., * * * of the trust company as collateral security for an advance. Assuming this to be so, I am inclined to think that the provisions enabling the bank to assume that position ought to be regarded as merely subsidiary to the main purpose of the contract which was a sale and purchase of assets and as such quite unobjectionable.\nBut taking the most extreme view as against the bank, the loan was a loan upon the security of an \"obligation\" of a corporation within the meaning of section 76, sub-section 1, para, (c) of the \"Bank Act\" and that being the case it is quite immaterial that this obligation was secured by a charge on the property of the corporation.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Reluctantly, because a chattel mortgage taken with unquestionable good faith to secure an honest debt will be avoided on what may be regarded as a technical ground, I have reached the conclusion that the omission of the rate of interest from the recital in it of the promissory note of the mort- gagor thereby collaterally secured, which was not otherwise registered, is fatal to the validity of the mortgage under section 19 of the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act.\" Without a statement of the rate of interest, the mortgage did not \"contain\" the entire terms of defeasance. These could only be learned by referring to the promissory note. No doubt upon registration of the mortgage everybody was put on inquiry as to the contents of the promissory note and, had that met the requirements of section 19, the mortgage might be upheld. Winchell v. Coney[17]. But, in order to prevent fraud, the scheme of the statute is that the extent of the interest both of the creditor and of the debtor in the property should appear upon the registered document itself.\nIf the words in the mortgage recital, \"at interest,\" conclusively imported the statutory rate of interest and if the mortgage would be defeasible on payment of the principal secured with interest at that rate, regardless of the rate stipulated in the promissory note, the latter might possibly be regarded as an add. tional security such as was held not to require registration in Ex parte Collins[18]. But see Edwards v. Marcus[19], which seems to be, if anything, a stronger case than that now before us and much in point.\nHere it is clear from the defeasance clause in the mortgage that it is redeemable only on payment of the promissory note according to its terms. It would, therefore, seem clear that the parties committed their contract to two instruments, that its whole tenor and effect could be ascertained only from both, and that, unless the full terms of the note were inserted in the chattel mortgage, it was necessary that the note itself should be registered. It was only by payment of the note that the mortgage could be satisfied. I cannot distinguish this case in principle from Counsell v. London and Westminster Loan and Discount Co.[20], relied on by the respondent. See, too, Re Odell[21].\nWhat I have written suffices for the disposition of the appeal, but, having regard to the great importance of the question raised on the \"Bank Act,\" I think I should express the view which I entertain upon it.\nThe substance of the transaction between the People's Trust Company and the Royal Bank was as follows. Its purpose was the taking over by the latter of the business of the former at South Hill. This entailed the assumption by the bank of the liabilities of this branch of the trust company's business as well as the acquisition of its assets. As to the latter the bank was prepared to take and pay for only such of them as it should, upon investigation, find to be worth purchasing. This involved the allowance of a period of time within which the bank might elect to take or to reject any of the assets. On the other hand, in order that the good will of the business to be taken over should be preserved, it was necessary immediately to provide for the payment of the liabilities assumed, especially for the claims of depositors. These latter amounted to $30,341.31. The assets in outstanding book debts and securities to be taken over had a face value of $25,578.50 which, if all the securities should be accepted by the bank, would be the amount to be paid in respect of them to the trust company. The company agreed immediately to transfer all the book debts and securities to the bank and to pay it a sum which, added to their face value, would make up $30,341.31, which amount the bank on its part agreed to put to the credit of a special account to meet the claims of the company's depositors. To further secure itself the bank took the company's note for the whole $30,341.31. The company and its directors further bound themselves to immediately replace with its cash equivalent at face value any security which the bank should reject during the period of six months allowed for election. Book debts and securities not so rejected were to be deemed, after the expiry of that time, the unconditional property of the bank, and the company was to be entitled to credit for the face value thereof.\nThis was, in my opinion, a legitimate banking transaction and, while the agreement no doubt refers to the advance of the $30,341.31 as made upon the company's promissory note and the transaction took that form, its substance was the setting aside by the bank of that sum as the contingent purchase price of the assets handed over to it.\nAs to $4,764.81 paid in cash by the company to the bank contemporaneously with the taking over of the assets, the note was the merest form. It represented neither a loan nor a liability of the makers. As to the balance of $25,578.50 the note in fact served as security to the bank for the re-payment to it of the face value of such assets (if any) as it should reject. The transaction, in my opinion, was not within the mischief aimed at by section 76(c) of the \"Bank Act\" and should not be held to contravene it.\nBRODEUR J. concurred with Duff J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Affleck & Mclnnes.\nSolicitors for respondent: Tupper, Kitto & Wightman.\n[1] 22 D.L.R. 647; 8 West.

Where, from the amount of the damages awarded and the circumstances of the case, it does not appear that the jury took into consideration matters which they should not have considered, or applied a wrong measure of damages, the verdict ought not to be set aside or a new trial directed simply because the amount of damages awarded may seem excessive to an appellate court. Duff J. dissented on the ground that a jury appreciating the evidence and making due allowance for the risk of accident, apart from negligence, in the hazardous pursuit in which the plaintiff was employed, could not have given the verdict in question.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014The evidence of a witness testifying in regard to estimates based on mortuary tables in use by companies engaged in the business of annuity insurance is admissible, quantum valeat, notwithstanding that he may not be capable of explaining the basis upon which the tables had been prepared.

Blackstock for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent, an engine-driver in the employ of the appellant company, was severely injured whilst in the performance of his duty. The jury found the appellant\nguilty of negligence, from the fact that the mail crane was in faulty condition and that the plaintiff was injured by it in the performance of his duty.\nThey awarded the plaintiff $27,000 damages.\nI have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion the amount of the damages is too large. There is, however, a general consensus of authority that it is for the jury alone to fix the amount of damages to be awarded in an action and that under ordinary circumstances the verdict should not be set aside merely on the ground that the damages appear excessive. Where the damages are manifestly so unreasonable that no body of twelve men could have honestly given such a sum, or where it is shewn that in arriving at the amount the jury took into consideration something which they ought not to have taken, or failed to take into consideration something which they ought to have taken, there may be ground for the court to set aside the verdict. It is not, however, a ground for interference that the damages seem to the court too large and more than would to most people have seemed ample.\nOne might assume that the jury have not sufficiently taken into account the accidents of life, and that they probably misapprehended the effect of the figures in the actuarial tables produced, but, with all respect, I do not think that is sufficient to justify us in granting a new trial on the ground that the jury have gone beyond a figure which any jury of reasonable men properly informed as to the question which they were to decide could have reached.\nIn Thorns v. Caledonian Railway Co.[2], Lord Kinnear said:\u2014\nNow it is impossible to read the account of this man's history and his present position without seeing that no amount of damages could ever be considered as real compensation for the personal injury he has suffered. It is obvious that that is not a consideration which can be pressed to any logical conclusion because the result of it would be that the defender, in a case of personal injury, might be ruined, and yet the pursuer not compensated. And, therefore, that cannot be treated as a ground for any exact or logical estimate of damage, but I think it is a consideration which may fairly lead us to think that, upon a question of this kind a larger latitude, within the bounds of reason, is to be allowed to a jury than upon matters which are capable of anything like exact calculation.\nThe same might well be said of the respondent in the ease as it comes before us.\nThis court held in Fraser v. Drew[3], that where a case has been properly submitted to a jury and their findings upon the facts are such as might be the conclusions of reasonable men, a new trial will not be granted on the ground that the jury misapprehended or misunderstood the evidence, notwithstanding that the trial judge was dissatisfied with the verdict. The case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy, decided in this court in November, 1913, might be consulted with advantage. On that appeal the only question pressed was as to the amount of the damages.\nThat the damages were excessive, was the only ground for setting aside the judgment that was urged by the appellant at the argument before us. I do not think the damages, though undoubtedly high, are so excessive as to warrant the interference of this court on that ground. I do think, however, that the trial judge did not direct the jury as fully as was desirable as to the measure of damages which the plaintiff was entitled to recover. True, he told them that they were not to award punitive damages, but the instruction would, I think, have been more intelligible to lawyers than to a jury of laymen. I cannot help thinking that the amount of the damages awarded indicates that the jury did not properly appreciate the considerations on which they had to assess these damages.\nThere is yet another serious objection to this judgment being allowed to stand. Although, as I have said, the amount of the damages was the only question discussed, on the hearing before this court, the notice of appeal by the defendants; to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta claims that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants.\nNow there was, I think, misdirection by the learned judge at the trial. After referring to the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, dated the 20th November, 1908, which provides that\nsuch crane must be erected at a distance of not less than 7' 1\u00be\" * * * in position,\n(i.e., from the centre of the track), he continues\u2014\nthat briefly is the allegation of negligence on the part of the plaintiff that this crane was erected or allowed to be closer to the track than the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners provided. That question I must leave to you, whether or not that crane was permitted to be closer to the centre of the track than the order provides for. That is the question which you must determine.\nAnd further on he says:\u2014\nThe defendants in this case would be liable for the acts of their servants or workmen if they did construct this crane closer to the track than the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners provided.\nIt may perhaps be assumed that the order was passed for the protection of railway employees in the position of the plaintiff, though, of course, unless this were so, he could advance no claim founded upon it. The judge, however, did not instruct the jury that they must not only find a breach of the statutory duty, but also that this was the cause of the accident.\nThe failure to give such a necessary instruction was the main reason why the Privy Council directed a new trial in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McAlpine[4]. At page 846 the judgment read's:\u2014\nWhere a statutory duty is imposed upon a railway company in the nature of a duty to take precautions for the safety of persons lawfully travelling in its carriages, crossing its line, or frequenting its premises, they will he responsible in damages to a member of any one of these classes who is injured by their negligent omission to discharge, or secure the discharge of, that duty properly, but the injury must be caused by the negligence of the company or its servants.* * *\nIn the last passage quoted from the charge of the learned judge in the present case, he did not point out to the jury that it was necessary, in order that the plaintiff should recover, that the omission to whistle or to give the warning, or both combined, and not the folly and recklessness of the plaintiff himself, caused the accident. For all that appears, the omission to whistle might not have contributed in any way to the happening of the accident. The jury, instructed as they were, may well have been under the impression that the two alleged breaches by the company of its statutory duties\u2014the two faults of which the jury found them guilty\u2014rendered them liable whether or not those faults caused to any extent the injury to the plaintiff or the contrary.\nThese are, in the main, the reasons which led their Lordships to the conclusion that a new trial should be directed.\nIn precisely the same way in the present case the jury, instructed as they were, may have concluded that the breach by the defendants of the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, of the 20th November, 1908, rendered them liable whether this fault caused the injury to the plaintiff or the contrary.\nThough, for these reasons, I am of opinion that there was misdirection of the jury, yet as the appellant has not raised the point I do not thank this court should send the action for a new trial on this ground. The respondent ought to have had an opportunity to argue that the verdict shews, as perhaps it does, that the jury were not misled by the misdirection and that no substantial injustice has been- caused thereby.\nThough I find much that is unsatisfactory about the conduct of this trial and its results, I cannot say that there is sufficient ground for setting aside the judgment. I have not come to this conclusion without much hesitation, and I think it would be unfortunate if the case were to be regarded as any precedent for awarding such enormous damages in similar actions an the future.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal on the ground of excessive damages. There is nothing else put forward to support it except the untenable objection to evidence admitted to shew how much an annuity might-be purchased for. This practice of using such evidence to help a jury in arriving at a reasonable estimate has been in daily use for many years in our courts.\nThe objection, that because a man called to testify what his company held to be the market price could not vouch for the 'accuracy of the tables upon which it and such life companies proceed, therefore the evidence was inadmissible, seems to me as unsound as it would be to object to the evidence of actuaries resting their estimate upon, the basis of the \"Carlisle Tables,\" for example, because none of them can vouch personally for the accuracy of the figures upon which such tables rest. The truth is the evidence which was adduced was of little value and made nothing of by the learned trial judge or the jury so far as we can see, but that is quite another thing and furnishes no ground for setting aside the trial, which seems to have been eminently fair.\nIt is impossible to say there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of anything connected therewith.\nTo come to the real ground of appeal resting upon excessive damages it may be admitted the damages are large and possibly larger than we as a jury would have assessed.\nBut can we say they are such as to demonstrate that the jury must necessarily have proceeded upon an erroneous basis or been moved by some indirect motives in arriving thereat?\nThe almost uniform course of this court has been to refuse to interfere with the mere assessment of damages when maintained by the local court having usually an immense advantage over us in the way of fairly appreciating the damages which must be measured in light of many local conditions.\nBut I must respectfully decline to accept the suggestion of counsel for appellant, and apparently some of the judges below, that the possibilities of a permanent investment producing eight per cent. per annum forms a proper basis of estimating the value of this verdict simply because that may be a fair rate of interest at the present moment.\nWe all know, if we can recall the economic history of other provinces, that this will not continue. And some other arguments put forward by counsel and in a measure countenanced in the court of appeal seem to me untenable.\nIt seems, for example, assumed, as matter of course, that the earnings of the respondent at the time of the accident must be taken as basis for life. They are properly taken in ordinary cases as basis of estimating pecuniary loss of a temporary character. But in the case of a young man only thirty-two years of age, when probably earnings would increase, being disabled for life, there is no rule of law preventing the jury from contemplating the possibilities of the future in that regard.\nAgain, it was even suggested that the pain and suffering of him injured could not enter into the basis of the estimate of compensation. I dissent entirely from any such proposition. Physical and mental pain and suffering have always, by law, entered into the basis of such estimates, and when these must endure for a lifetime, or the victim be reduced to the deplorable condition of the respondent, it is hard to place the limit of an adequate compensation therefor. And the possible need of attendance to help and comfort him in decay may also be considered.\nIt is quite true that in cases resting upon the \"Fatal Accidents Act,\" pain and suffering are excluded from the basis of the estimate for damages. In such cases the estimate must be confined to the mere monetary considerations bearing upon the case of survivors who have suffered in a monetary sense as well as otherwise by the death of him upon whom they were dependent for the deprivation of what they might reasonably have hoped to enjoy.\nNo such rule obtains in the case of him suffering and suing for such damages as caused thereby.\nWe may yet hear it urged that a man reduced to the impotent condition in which respondent, a young man with the prospects before him of increasing his earnings and savings and thereby adding to the comfort of his life and enjoyment thereof, when so reduced ought to be treated as a helpless creature who can enjoy life no longer and hence might as well be kept, or keep himself in some asylum or house of refuge for a few cents a day, and thereby ameliorate the sad condition of the unfortunate offender in the like position the appellant is now in.\nI prefer resting as usual upon the broad common sense of an intelligent jury as being more likely to fix justly the amount which the wrongdoer should pay than to look for justice in anything which might be determined in a very logical way either thus or otherwise.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014With respect I am unable to concur in dismissing the appeal. While the charge of the learned trial judge is not in any way open to exception I have been unable to satisfy myself, after considering the whole of the evidence, that a jury appreciating the evidence and making due allowance for the risk of accident (negligence apart) in a hazardous pursuit, would have given the verdict now before us.\nThere is, of course, no difference of opinion as regards the principle; which is well settled. The facts are carefully considered in the judgment of Mr. Justice Beck and it is unnecessary to repeat what he has said.\nI think there should be a new trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having regard to all the circumstances of this case\u2014the plaintiff's earning capacity prior to his injury, his comparative youth, the pain and suffering to which he was subjected, his probable total incapacity for work in the future, and the inconvenience, discomfort and unhappiness which his condition is likely to entail during the rest of his life\u2014it is, in my opinion, not possible to say that the verdict in this case is so excessive that it is apparent that the jury must have been influenced by views and considerations to which they should not have given effect; Johnston v. Great Western Railway Co.[5]; Cox v. English, Scottish and Australian Bank[6]. If the only element of damage were the plaintiff's actual pecuniary loss, it might be argued with great force that an attempt had been made to award him full and complete compensation; and when the loss to be compensated for has a money value capable of precise ascertainment there is no good reason why that should not be done. But with such other elements of damage, as I have indicated, present, which must be taken into account, while the jury should not attempt to give full compensation, it is almost impossible to say that an amount awarded short of what would distinctly shock the conscience, is so great that a new trial should be ordered purely on the ground of its excess,\nThe admission of evidence as to the expectation of life of a person of the plaintiff's age and as to the cost of an annuity equal to his income is made a ground of appeal. The objection is based on the alleged lack of qualification of a witness who gave this evidence and the misleading character of the evidence itself.\nStandard mortuary tables shewing the expectancy of life and the cost of an annuity at given ages are admissible in evidence; Rowley v. London and North Western Railway Co.[7]; Vicksburg and Meridian Railroad Co. v. Putnam[8]. The appreciation of the value to he put upon such tables in any particular case may always be affected by appropriate cross-examination and by directing the attention of the jury, by other relevant evidence and by argument, to considerations calculated to lead to the conclusion that the plaintiff's expectation of life should be regarded as less than the\" average and that his continued receipt during the full period of his expectation of life of the income which he enjoyed when injured was subject to many contingencies.\nIf a witness called can verify a mortuary table pro- duced in evidence as one in actual use by a company dealing in that class of business I do not understand it to be the law that he must possess knowledge sufficient to enable him to explain the basis on which the table was prepared or to give an opinion worth something as to its reliability or correctness in order to render his evidence, quantum valeat, admissible. No doubt such tables are not conclusive and the jury should be warned to take into account the contingencies to which the continued receipt of his income by the plaintiff would have been subject had he not met with the injury for which he sues. In the present case those contingencies were called to the attention of the jury by the learned trial judge by reading a passage from a judgment in which they were referred to. He was not asked further to emphasize them or specially to warn the jury against attaching too much weight to the evidence now objected to. No doubt its value had been fully discussed by counsel for the defendant in his address. No objection was taken either at the trial, in the notice of appeal to the Appellate Division, or in the appellant's factum in this court to the accuracy or sufficiency of the charge itself. At bar counsel suggested non-direction only; Creveling v. Canadian Bridge Co.[9]. Misdirection upon any aspect of the case was not even hinted at.\nThe verdict is, no doubt, large, but a case has not been made for interfering with it or for ordering a new assessment of damages, which, if an experience not uncommon should be repeated, might not result favourably to the defendants.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014The only question in this case is whether a new trial should be granted because the amount granted by the jury for damages is excessive.\nIt is a railway accident. The plaintiff (respondent) was a locomotive engineer, an employee of the appellant company. He seems to have been incapacitated for life. He was earning a sum of about $2,100 a year. There was not much evidence given as to the damages which should be granted and the verdict was for the sum of $27,000.\nI am inclined to think that the amount is excessive, and if I had been on the jury I would certainly not have given so large a sum. But the charge to the jury seems to have been fair and it was for them to decide as to the amount.\nI am sorry that we have to accept their verdict. It is to be expected that some day legislation will be passed in the provinces, where it does not exist now, by which those verdicts could be reduced by the courts of appeal.\nIn the circumstances, I cannot do otherwise than to dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 8 West.

On application by plaintiff, through an insurance broker, the company insured her house and furniture against loss by fire, the premises being described as a \"sporting house\" (a house of ill-fame), and, soon afterwards, the local general agent of the company received notification from the head-office that the policy had been cancelled. On being notified the broker wrote to plaintiff informing her of the cancellation, but his letter was not delivered and was returned through the mails. In an action on the policy,\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (9 Alta. L.R. 47), Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that on the face of the policy of insurance it appeared that the effect of the contract was to facilitate the carrying on of an illegal or immoral purpose and, therefore, it would not be enforced in a court of justice. Pearce v. Brooks (L.R. 1 Ex. 213), applied; Clark v. Hagar (22 Can. S.C.R. 510), Johnson v. Union Marine Fire Insurance Co. (97 Mass. 288), and Bruneau v. Lalibert\u00e9 (Q.R. 19 S.C. 425), referred to.\nPer Davies J.\u2014In the circumstances of the case the broker through whom the plaintiff effected the insurance became her agent for all purposes in connection therewith and he was also constituted the agent of the company for the purpose of giving notice of the cancellation of the policy.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The mere description of the premises insured as a bawdy house is not sufficient evidence to justify the inference that the contract had the effect of promoting illegal or immoral purposes. Clark v. Hagar (22 Can. S.C.R. 510); Lloyd v. Johnston (1 Bos. & P. 340); Bowry v. Bennett (1 Camp. 348); Hamilton v. Grainger (5 H. & N. 40), and Pearce v. Brooks (L.R. 1 Ex. 213), referred to. Bruneau v. Lalibert\u00e9 (Q.R. 19 S.C. 425), discussed.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ.\u2014The broker, who was handed the policy for delivery to insured and collection of the premium, became the agent of the company for those purposes. He, however, had no authority from the insured to receive notice of cancellation of the policy on her behalf nor to waive the requirements of statutory condition 19 of the \"Northwest Territories Ordinance,\" ch. 16 (1st sess.), 1903, as to notice of cancellation of policies of insurance and return of premiums paid.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Beck J., at the trial, maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nHamilton Cassels K.C. for the appellants.\nC. T. Jones K.C. for the respondent\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have come to the conclusion, with some hesitation, that this appeal must be allowed. This is certainly not from any desire to assist the appellants, for I think, as Lord Mansfield says in Holman v. Johnson[2].\nthe objection that a contract is immoral and illegal as between plaintiff and defendant sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant.\nThe objection is allowed on principles of public policy which the defendant has the advantage of contrary to the real justice as between him and the plaintiff.\nIn the appellants' factum it is said:\u2014\nIt must be clearly borne in mind in dealing with this appeal that this is not one of those too frequently occurring cases of an attempt by an insurance company to escape by means of some technicality a liability deliberately assumed by it and for the assumption of which it has received its stipulated recompense.\nThese are brave words, but unfortunately are not borne out by the facts. The factum proceeds:\u2014\nThe plaintiff is a foreigner of bad character.\nI do not think it is particularly creditable for the appellants to allege as one of the grounds for trying to escape liability that the respondent is a foreigner, and, as to the fact that she is of bad character, it appears on the face of the policy, issued under the corporate seal of the company and the signature of its president, that the premises were kept by the insured as a disorderly house.\nThe law, I think, is stated in. Phillips on Insurance, (5 ed.), in chapter III., section 2, on the legality of the insurable interest. We read sub-section 210:\u2014\nInsurance upon a subject is void if the interest insured is illegal or if the contract contemplates an unlawful use of it;\nand this is carried further in sub-section 211,\nthough there is no express prohibition in respect to a subject, still if insurance upon it is contrary to the spirit and general principles, or what is called \"the policy\" of the law, the owner cannot make a valid insurance upon it.\nAgain, sub-section 231, after referring to cases partly legal and partly illegal where a valid insurance may be made for the legal part, continues:\u2014\nIn the preceding cases no illegality appeared on the face of the contract of insurance. Where such does appear, the whole contract is void, as in the case of an agreement to employ a ship in an illegal trade. In Pearce v. Brooks[3], at page 218, Chief Baron Pollock said:\u2014\nNo distinction can be made between an illegal and an immoral purpose; the rule which is applicable to the matter is, ex turpi causa non oritur actio, and whether it is an immoral or an illegal purpose in which the plaintiff has participated it comes equally within the terms of that maxim and the effect is the same; no cause of action can arise out of either the one or the other.\nIn the notes to the case of Collins v. Blantern[4], in Smith's Leading Cases (ed. 1915), it is said:\u2014\nContracts made for immoral purposes are simply void. * * * The illegality is equally fatal when created by statute.\nMany cases are cited in support of this latter proposition. By section 228 of the Criminal Code the keeping of a disorderly house is an indictable offence and the purpose for which this house is used, being expressly stated in the policy, there can be no doubt of the illegality of the purpose for which it was used.\nIn Scott, v. Brown[5], at page 728, Lindley L.J. said:\u2014\nEx turpi caus\u00e2 non oritur actio. This old and well known legal maxim is founded in good sense and expresses a clear and well-recognized legal principle which is not confined to indictable offences. No court ought to enforce an illegal contract or allow itself to be made the instrument of enforcing obligations alleged to arise out of a contract or transaction which is illegal. * * * If the evidence adduced by the plaintiff proves the illegality the court ought not to assist him.\nIn his judgment in the case in this court of Clark v. Hagar[6], Mr. Justice Gwynne refers to a number of cases as establishing that the true test whether a demand connected with an illegal transaction is capable of being enforced at law, is whether the plaintiff requires any aid from the illegal transaction to estab- lish his case. In the present action the plaintiff, now respondent, could not, of course, succeed without proving the policy bearing on its face evidence of illegality. Such proof is offensive to the court and cannot be received.\nThat we find in the English reports no case exactly in point is not, I think, a matter of surprise. English insurance companies, it is well known, rarely dispute their liabilities, never except in gross cases. Further, I should think it probable that respectable companies would be unwilling to state in their policies an immoral purpose. Few people, one may suppose, are willing to advertise their own turpitude unnecessarily.\nThere is a case in the Circuit Court of Quebec of Bruneau v. Lalibert\u00e9[7], in which Mr. Justice Andrews held that\ninsurance upon the furniture in a house of ill-fame is an illegal and immoral contract and will not be enforced by the courts.\nI do not think it is necessary for me to dissent from anything said, in the judgment above referred to of Clark v. Hagar[8]. It is relied on in the decision of Morin v. The Anglo-Canadian Fire Insurance Co.[9], in the court of appeal for the Province of Alberta, which the decision now under appeal professes to follow, and also in the later case of Trites Wood Co. v. The Western Assurance Co.[10], in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. It is, however, unnecessary to examine, this judgment particularly, as I am unable to find in it anything to support the decisions in these cases in which, as in the present case, the illegality appears upon the face of the contract sued upon.\nFor the French law on the subject, see Planiol (6 ed.), vol. 2, para. 1009 et seq., and cases there cited. The modern tendency of the Cour de Cassation would appear to be, however, to maintain the validity of contracts such as the one here in question on the ground that the reciprocal obligations which the parties assume relate exclusively to the payment by the insured of the agreed premium and to the payment by the company of the stipulated indemnity in the event of the destruction of the thing insured. Vide Sirey, 1904, 1, page 509; but see S.V. 1896, 1, 289; Appert's note; S. V. 1913, 1, 497, note, and S. & P. 1909, 1, 188.\nThere is no provision in the Code Penal which corresponds with section 228 of the Canadian Criminal Code.\nThe appeal will be allowed and judgment entered for the defendants, the present appellants, but without costs,\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed upon the grounds submitted by Mr. Cassels.\nIn the first place, I think Carr was the agent of Nakata for the purpose of procuring the policy of insurance in question.\nThe insured was the keeper of a \"sporting house\" which Mr. Jones, for the respondent, candidly admitted was well understood to be a bawdy house or house of ill-fame.\nThe husband of the plaintiff applied to Carr, an insurance broker, to obtain the insurance and was told by him that he could not take it in the insurance company for which he was agent, but would apply to other companies and was instructed to do so. He applied to the general agent in the province of the appellant company, who agreed to take it. The applicant paid to Carr a part of the insurance premium and shortly afterwards returned to Carr to obtain the policy when he was told it was subject to cancellation at any time. He then paid Carr the balance of the premium and Carr handed over to him the policy.\nCarr says that at that time he asked them whether in case of cancellation he would return the money or put the insurance in some other company\u2014and he was told to put it in some other company.\nThe same afternoon Carr received notice that the head-office had cancelled the policy, whereupon he wrote and sent by registered post a letter to the plaintiff telling her the policy was cancelled. Carr had received the premium from the applicant, and on receiving notice of the cancellation of the policy made, as instructed, efforts to obtain insurance elsewhere, but was unsuccessful and the premium remained in his hands.\nThe trial judge was of the opinion that\nthe whole thing depended upon the question of the agency of Carr for the insured upon which there is much to be said upon both sides.\nThe learned judge was not satisfied that Carr was an agent to receive notice of cancellation and this view prevailed in the court of appeal.\nI am of opinion, however, that Carr was such an agent and that the premium having been left with him in case of cancellation to obtain insurance in some other company, that he was the agent of the insured for receiving notice of such cancellation. On the other ground also, that the contract was one for facilitating the carrying on of an illegal and immoral object, I think the appeal should be allowed. The trial judge and the court of appeal felt themselves concluded by the case of Morin v. Anglo-American Fire Insurance Co.[11]. I am not able to accept that authority or the reasoning upon which it was founded. I think the principle upon which the case of Pearce v. Brooks[12] was decided the proper one to apply in this case.\nThat principle is that one who makes a \"contract for sale or hire with the knowledge that the other party intended to apply the subject-matter of the contract to an immoral purpose cannot recover on the contract. As Pollock C.B. said in that case if an article was required and furnished \"to facilitate the carrying on of the immoral purpose\" that is sufficient. The courts would not lend their aid to carry it out. It seems to be that the facts of the case now before us are Stronger against the enforcement of the contract than those in the case of Pearce v. Brooks12, which the Exchequer Court refused their aid to enforce. In that 'case, the plaintiffs sued for the hire of a brougham by a woman known by them to be a prostitute and who used the brougham to their knowledge for the purpose of making a display favourable to her immoral purposes.\nIn the case of Johnson v. Union Marine and Fire Insurance Co[13]., the court followed a previous decision of their own in Kelly v. Home Insurance Co[14]., and held that if a person engaged in the unlawful business of selling intoxicating liquors without a licence at the time of the making and acceptance of a policy of insurance on his stock in trade and a month afterwards, the policy does not attach, although he made application for a licence immediately after he began such business.\nThe grounds on which the decision was placed in Kelly v. Home Insurance Co.[15] above referred to were that the object of the assured in obtaining the policy was to make their illegal business safe and profitable and that the direct and immediate purpose of the contract of insurance being to protect and encourage an unlawful traffic the contract was illegal and never attached.\nThe same principle was held by Andrews J. to govern in the case of Bruneau v. Lalibert\u00e9[16].\nI think this principle should apply to this case, the contractual obligation of the company being in case of loss either to pay the same up to the amount insured or to \"replace the property damaged or lost.\" Could it be fairly argued that the replacement of the property would not be an aiding or facilitating of the immoral purpose for the carrying on of which the house and furniture were used? I think the courts of this land should not lend their aid to enforce contracts made to facilitate the keeping of houses of ill-fame, which, in my judgment, this insurance policy was calculated to do.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action upon a policy of insurance against fire on a house in Calgary owned by respondent and used as a bawdy house, in modern slang phrase described, as it was in the said policy, as a \"sporting house,\" and on furniture therein.\nThe chief ground of defence set up was that, pursuant to a statutory condition indorsed thereon, the policy had been cancelled long before the fire.\nIt is quite clearly established, indeed not seriously disputed, that the policy was duly issued by the general agents of the appellant and the premium therefor paid.\nIt was procured by a local broker from the said general agents. A good deal of what was, I respectfully submit, needless discussion, has taken place as to the details of how this payment and its alleged return was dealt with. I assume, upon the facts in evidence, that the general agents received the premium, but failed to return same in any way for more than six weeks after the date of the policy, although the alleged cancellation is claimed to have taken place within ten days after said date.\nThis alleged re-payment is only material in considering the contention set up by appellant that Mr. Carr, the broker, was the respondent's agent to receive the return of the money.\nThe power of cancellation relied upon is that contained in the condition, No. 19, of the statutory conditions in force in Alberta.\nI think it is necessary for any company seeking to avail itself of the power therein contained to follow the very simple and clear terms of that condition.\nI cannot find in what was done anything even resembling what the power requires. Nor can I find that what the respondent's husband said to Carr could entitle him, as her agent, to set aside or waive that condition and all implied therein.\nThe details of all that have been so fully dealt with by the learned judges in the courts below that I do not think I can serve any good purpose by setting forth an additional elaboration thereof.\nThe appellant stoutly maintains Carr was not its agent, though appearing on the policy as agent. I accept its contention in that regard.\nThe doing so relieves me of the necessity for considering the possible effect of his sending her a notice. The only notice alleged to have been given the insured was one mailed to her by Carr, but never received by her, or heard of by any one acting for her as her agent for that purpose.\nThere never was, unless Carr was appellant's agent, anything done, I repeat, resembling what the statutory condition imposes upon the insuring company to be done by it in such cases, but not by some one else.\nAgain, it is contended that the policy was illegal upon the ground that the owner of a bawdy house cannot insure himself, or herself, against loss thereof by fire.\nWe have all heard of leases made of a house to be used for such like purposes being illegal, either because it obviously promotes the illegal purpose had in view, or because the consideration for such a lease may be tainted thereby and, hence, the contract is void.\nI am unable to understand how the policy of insurance can, as of course, in itself promote the carrying on of such a traffic, or in law be held to fall within the principles upon which I suggest a lease, for example, may be illegal and be thereby void. It is urged the house had become vacant and that change of condition so increased the risk as to violate the condition. The learned trial judge upon the facts found against the appellant, and no appeal was made against that finding.\nThough neither set up in the pleadings, nor urged at the trial, nor presented to the court of appeal, counsel for the appellant 'Seeks now, for the first time, in this court to set up the further defence that there was an undisclosed encumbrance on the property and some false statement of proof of loss in that regard.\nThe manifest injustice of allowing such an issue of fact to be raised at this stage for the first time has always been held a sufficient answer here to permitting any such course.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting) \u2014 The first question is whether the policy was in force at the time of the fire and that subdivides itself into: (a) Did the appellant company receive payment of the insurance premium ? and (b) Was the power of cancellation with which the insurers were invested by the terms of the policy effectively put into operation ?\nThe answer to the former question must be in the affirmative or the negative according as the appellant company is held or not held to be precluded from disputing 'both that payment to Carr and that payment to Tavender & Co. would be payment to themselves, As to Carr\u2014for some purposes he no doubt was the agent of the respondent, but it does not necessarily follow that he was not also the agent of the appellant company for the purpose of receiving payment of the premium. The policy was delivered by Carr to the respondent's husband and on the policy there was a declaration to the effect that Tavender & Co. were the general agents of the company and there was also a statement that Carr was the company's agent. In the appellant's factuam it is said that the designation of Carr as agent was adopted as a matter of office procedure in recognition of Carr's right to a commission for the introduction. For our present purpose we are not concerned \"with the appellant's office procedure.\" Carr held the policy for delivery to the respondent on payment of the premium and the designation of him as agent correctly describes the character in which he had possession of the policy which he unquestionably held for the company and delivered to the respondent on their behalf; the description of him as agent and his possession of the policy for the company together constituted a representation upon which the respondent was entitled to act on paying the premium. Counsel for the respondent did not, of course, dispute, it would have been Hopeless to do so, that if a loss had occurred immediately after the delivery of the policy and before the transmission of the premium by Carr and before any steps had been taken looking to cancellation, that it would have been impossible to deny that the risk had attached. As to Tavender & Co.\u2014the premium was in fact paid by a set off of the accounts between Tavender & Co. and Carr\u2014the repudiation of Tavender & Co.'s action by the company could have no effect upon the rights of the respondent, who, having no notice of any limitation of authority was entitled to assume that Tavender & Co. were acting within the scope of that conferred upon them. As to cancellation. It is not disputed that notice of cancellation was not received by the respondent. The appellant's contention rests upon the proposition that Carr had been constituted the respondent's agent for the receipt of such notice. The 'Contention breaks down on the facts, there being simply no evidence to support a conclusion that the parties intended that the policy should be subject to cancellation without notice to the respondent personally. The direction alleged to have been given to Carr to retain the premium in the event of cancellation cannot fairly be held to imply authority to receive notice of cancellation. The learned trial judge found against agency in fact and I entirely agree with his view on this point.\nWe now come to the difficult question: Was the policy invalid as tainted with illegality by reason of the purported contract being a contract entered into for the purpose of assisting the respondent in carrying on an illegal business by securing her indemnity against loss of property by fire while the property was being employed for an illegal purpose?\nThe facts are that the house and personal effects, the subjects insured, were at the time of the application in the possession of the respondent who carried on in the house and used the furniture for the purpose of carrying on the business (as it is described in the application) of a \"sporting house,\" in other words, a house of ill-fame. This fact, being stated in the application, was, of course, known to the company. At the time the fire occurred the house was not occupied by the respondent, but was in the care of a caretaker who slept there at nights. The usual premium was charged, there being no augmentation because of any special hazard that might be supposed to exist by reason of the character of the occupation, and there is no suggestion that this last mentioned circumstance in itself, according to insurance practice, would be regarded as entailing any special hazard or as affecting the character of the risk from the actuarial point of view. It appears further that the appellant company was unwilling to accept the risk and directed the cancellation of the policy as soon as they became aware of the facts. The point, however, upon which the appellant company based its objection was a rather narrow one. The officials of the company appear to have had no objection to accept a risk of this character if the place was situated within what was described as a \"licensed district,\" in other words, if the place was permitted to flourish by the openly understood sanction of the police. The house in question not being as I have said within a \"licensed district\" these officials decided to put an end to the risk.\nThe argument for the appellant is now put in this way. The respondent, it is said, sought insurance to enable her the more safely to carry on a business which is not only a violation of the law itself, but is a public trading in immorality. It is said that the performance of such contracts of indemnity by the insurer has a tendency directly to encourage illegality and immorality and such contracts are, therefore, in such circumstances, within one of those classes which the courts refuse to enforce, as being in the traditional phrase \"tainted with illegality.\" I have come to the conclusion that this view does not furnish the governing rule for the decision of this appeal; tout I am far from suggesting that there is not a great deal of force in the strictly legal considerations that may be ad- duced in support of it, however little one may be disposed to look with anything but impatience upon the posture of this company whose interest in the public morals finds adequate expression in a distinction between bawdy houses protected by the police, according to clearly understood convention, and bawdy houses whose toleration is more irregular and precarious.\nThe question is, of course, a dry question of law. This contract of insurance is not in itself illegal in the sense that it is a contract directly forbidden by law or in the sense that it is intended to create an obligation to do anything forbidden by law. If the appellant company had paid the respondent's claim, nothing in the making or the performance of the contract could be described as illegal. A contract, however, on the face of it collateral to an unlawful act or to an unlawful course of business or to an unlawful design may be so connected with the illegality as to be vitiated by it; the question as Marshall 'C.J. said in Armstrong v. Toler[17] very often is a question of considerable nicety whether the connection is or is not of such a character as to have that effect.\nThere is a number of decisions in cases similar to this in which the insurance contract is treated (1) as an agreement to indemnify against the consequences of an illegal course of action or (2) as a mere incident in the carrying on of some transaction or business forbidden by law.\nThe former is the interpretation which has been given to marine policies insuring a voyage illegal in its inception, such policies being held void as attempts to contract for indemnity against the loss suffered by reason of carrying out an unlawful enterprise. See Wilson v. Rankin[18]; Ocean Insurance Co. v. Polleys[19]. The latter is the interpretation upon which rest certain decisions in the American courts, notably in the courts of Massachusetts in which policies of insurance effected upon stocks of liquor held for sale by unlicensed dealers in violation of the law have been thought void as transactions in reality constituting in part the carrying on of an unlawful business.\nThese interpretations cannot, I think, be said to fit the case before us. The fact that in accordance with settled practice an applicant for insurance, is required to state the business, if any, carried on on the premises proposed for insurance, and the fact that the business named is illegal and the fact that this statement with other statements in the application constitute the basis of the contract do not justify the interpretation of the contract as a contract to indemnify against loss incurred by reason of the carrying on of an illegal business; the policy being in the usual form, the risk insured against being the risk of fire from causes usually insured against in a policy in that form, the premium, as I have already said, being the usual premium. One would not think of describing a policy of insurance upon his office furniture taken out by a promoter whose chief business was to effect mergers obnoxious against the provisions of the Criminal Code as an agreement to indemnify against loss incurred in the course of his illegal business; and yet the parallel if not exact is approximate. Neither ought the latter of the above mentioned views (which has been given effect to in Massachusetts in the cases referred to) to govern in this case. It would be a quite unreasonable interpretation of the intentions of the parties to this contract to hold that the terms of the bargain in any way turned upon the character of the business carried on. One could better interpret their intentions by saying that the contract was made in spite of the fact rather than because of the fact that the occupation was of the character mentioned.\nA distinction suggested by a series of English cases dealing with the enforceability of contracts made with persons of the respondent's class may, I think, well serve as a key to the solution of the question before us. In Lloyd v. Johnson[20] Mr. Justice Buller, in Bowry v. Bennett[21] Lord Ellen-borough, and in Pearce v. Brooks[22] the Court of Exchequer had such contracts before them and the net result, I think, of the authorities of which these are typical examples, is summed up with accuracy in the treatise on contracts by Mr. Manisty, in Halsbury Laws of England, vol. 7, p. 400, in these words:\u2014\nAn action lies to recover the price of goods sold or work done even though that the plaintiff knew that the person with whom he was dealing was a prostitute (Lloyd v. Johnson20; Bowry v. Bennett21), unless it appears that the goods were sold or the work was done for the purpose of enabling her to exercise or assisting her in the exercise of her immoral calling. (Hamilton v. Grainger[23]; Pearce v. Brooks22.\nIn Pearce v. Brooks22 Baron Bramwell, who had tried the action, says:\u2014 I told the jury that, in some sense, everything which was supplied to a prostitute is supplied to enable her to carry on her trade, as, for instance, shoes sold to a street walker; and that the things supplied must not merely be such as would be necessary or useful for ordinary purposes, and might be also applied to an immoral one; but that they must be such as would under the circumstances not be required, except with that view.\nThis insurance company, no doubt invites us to hold that when they do enter into contracts for the insurance of such places (being, of course, let it be well understood, within a \"licensed district\") they do so with the object of enabling the proprietors to exercise and to assist them in the exercise of their immoral calling. In fact, of course, it is not so and it would be ridiculous to say that they ever thought of assisting the respondent in the exercise of her trade or of supplying her with anything that had any special reference to her trade or of contracting with her in any other character than that of the proprietor of a furnished dwelling simply.\nThe above mentioned cases were applied in this court in the case of Clark v. Hagar[24], and the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, who spoke for the majority of the court, contains an exhaustive but luminous exposition of the effect of the decisions and his conclusions are substantially in harmony with the passage quoted above from Mr. Manisty's treatise.\nMr. Justice Gwynne's judgment was applied in a case similar to the present by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Trites Wood Co. v. Western Insurance Co.[25].\nI must not omit a reference to Bruneau v. Lalibert\u00e9[26] (Mr. Justice Andrews), in which it was held that a policy of insurance on the furniture of a house of ill-fame was an illegal and immoral contract and non-enforceable. The decision is, in part, based on an interpretation of Pearce v. Brooks[27], which is not, I think, an admissible interpretation; and upon certain French authorities which were supposed to support the conclusion at which the learned trial judge arrived. In France, however, the jurisprudence is by no means uniformly in favour of the learned judge's view as is shewn by the following passages from Carpentier, Rep. Supplement, 2 Assurance contre l'incendie, Nos. 64 and 207(2), giving the effect of two comparatively recent decisions of the Cour de Cassation:\u2014\n64. Le contrat d'assurance contre l'incendie pass\u00e9 par le tenancier d'une maison de tol\u00e9rance ne pent \u00eatre annul\u00e9 comme ayant une cause immorale, alors que, dans ce contrat, les prestations que les parties se sont mutuellement promises consistaient, d'une part, dans le paiement de l'assur\u00e9 des primes convenues, d'autre part, dans le paiement par la compagnie d'une indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire, ou, \u00e0 son choix, dans la reconstruction ou la r\u00e9paration des batiments incendi\u00e9s et le replacement en nature des objets d\u00e9truits; ces prestations licites.en elles-memes, n'ont pu devenir illicites par cela seul que les risques assur\u00e9s d\u00e9pendaient d'une maison de tol\u00e9rance, et elles ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant eu en vue la cr\u00e9ation, le maintien ou l'exploitation d'un \u00e9tablissement de cette nature. Cass., 4 mai, 1903.\n207. (2) Y a-t-il fausse d\u00e9claration de la part du tenancier d'une maison de tol\u00e9rance qui se qualifie de loger en garni? La question s'est posee devant la cour de cassation. Le pourvoi soutenant l'affirmative par les motifs suivants: L'exploitation d'une maison de tol\u00e9rance, disait-il \"pr\u00e9sente des risques consid\u00e9rables. Le danger d'incendie, en effet, est plus grand que par tout ailleurs dans une maison fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e la nuit par des gens souvent avin\u00e9s, o\u00f9 l'orgie est quotidienne, le drame fr\u00e9quent, et dont le personnel par sa profession m\u00eame, est une perp\u00e9tuelle menace d'imprudence sinon d'actes malveillants. Ces risques considerables entrainent les compagnies, quand elles consentent \u00e0 assurer les tenanciers de maisons de tol\u00e9r- ance, \u00e0 exiger d'elles le paiement de primes fort ch\u00e8res.\" Mais les juges du fond avaient refus\u00e9 d'accueillir le moyen de nullit\u00e9, par la raison que la compagnie ne pouvait se m\u00e9prendre sur le sens et la port\u00e9e des expressions \"logeur en garni\" dans les circonstances ou elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es. C'est la solution qu'a fait pr\u00e9valoir la Cour de cassation. Cass., 4 mai, 1903, Comp. d'assur, terr. Le Monde (S. & P., 1904, D. 1906,5,33).\nThe appeal -should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The first question in this case is whether the contract of insurance was valid.\nIn the application for insuring the premises, it was stated that the plaintiff (respondent) was keeping a \"sporting house,\" which was understood as being a house of ill-fame.\nThe policy was procured through the appellants' agents in Calgary. They had the power to accept risks, subject to cancellation by the head-office, as is the usual insurance practice. The head-office of the insurance company refused to maintain the policy and a notice of cancellation was given.\nThe agents of the appellant company in Calgary immediately notified the broker through whom the application had been made. This broker, Carr, on the, same day, wrote to the plaintiff telling her the policy was cancelled and asking for its return. He did not enclose the premium because, as instructed by the plaintiff, he intended to try and get insurance elsewhere.\nThis letter was not received by the plaintiff and was subsequently returned to Carr.\nA fire having taken place on the premises, the present action has been instituted for the purpose of recovering the amount of the insurance. The company claims that the contract was illegal because it facilitates immorality.\nIt has been decided in a case of Bruneau v. Lalibert\u00e9[28], by Mr. Justice Andrews that an\ninsurance upon the furniture in a house of ill-fame is an illegal and immoral contract, and will not be enforced by the courts.\nAddison, on Contracts, p. 72, summarises the matter in stating\u2014\nContracts tending to promote fornication and prostitution are void.\nAnd Beach on Contracts, p. 2019, says that\nany contract auxiliary to the keeping of a bawdy house is void.\nHalsbury, Laws of England, vol. 7, No. 829, p. 400, relying on the case of Pearce v. Brooks[29], says that if it appears that a work was done for the purpose of enabling a prostitute to exercise or assisting her in the exercise of her immoral calling, no action would lie.\nPollock on Contracts (7 ed.), p. 370, in speaking of transactions where there is an agreement for a transfer of property for a lawful consideration, but for the purpose of an unlawful use being made of it, says that:\u2014\nThe later authorities shew that the agreement is void not merely if an unlawful use of the subject-matter is part of the bargain, but if the intention of one party so to use it is known to the other at the time of the agreement.\n* * * * * *\nIf goods are sold by a vendor who knows that the purchaser means to apply them to an illegal or immoral purpose he cannot recover the price.\nI find in Dalloz, Repertoire Pratique, vo. \"Contrats et Conventions en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\" Nos. 398 and 401, that the contract whose consideration is the maintenance of a house of ill-fame is illicit and the action for the price of the service of a domestic in a house of ill-fame should not be accepted. 1 must say, however, that this latter decision has been severely criticized by some authors. Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 11, No. 313, says:\u2014\nC'est l'obligation sur cause illicite que l'art. 1131 declare sans effet. Il en est autrement de l'obligation dont le motif seulement est illicite. Ici done appara\u00eet encore l'utilit\u00e9 de la distinction entre la cause et le motif. Cette distinction est nettement \u00e9tablie dans quelques d\u00e9cisions judiciaires. Mais beaucoup d'autres Font perdue de vue et la confusion a engendr\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions vraiment fantastiques. N'a-t-on-pas vu le tribunal de commerce de la Seine, refuser sur le fondement de la cause illicite, tout effet a l'obligation contract\u00e9e par le directeur d'une maison de tol\u00e9rance pour acquisition de vins de champagne destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre consommes dans son \u00e9tablissement ?\nOn that first ground, I would be of opinion that the contract of insurance was illegal and that it should be set aside. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\n[1] 9 Alta. L.R. 47.\n[2] Cowp. 341.\n[3] L.R. 1 Ex. 213.\n[4] 1 Sm. L.C. (12 ed.) 412.\n[5] (1892) 2 Q.B. 724.\n[6] 22 Can.

V., ch. 56 (Que.)), and the general powers conferred by the city charter the municipal council passed a resolution authorizing the corporation of the municipality to enter into a contract granting a joint stock company the exclusive privilege of operating autobus lines on certain streets in the city and charging fares for the carriage of passengers. An action was brought by a shareholder in a tramway company (which held similar privileges), who was also a municipal ratepayer attacking the validity of the by-law and of a contract made by the municipal corporation in pursuance of the resolution on the grounds that there was no authority for the granting of such exclusive privileges, that such powers, if they existed, could only be exercised by means of a by-law, and that a provision in the contract whereby the municipality became entitled to certain shares in the stock of the autobus company was ultra vires of the municipal corporation.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 23 K.B. 338), Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that in the absence of evidence\nNote.\u2014Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused on the 18th of December, 1915. of special injury sustained by the plaintiff, he had no status entitling him to bring the action.\nPer Idington J., dissenting.\u2014The plaintiff was entitled to institute the action by virtue either of his quality as a shareholder in the tramway company, the privileges of which might be injuriously affected, or as a ratepayer of the municipality.\nPer Anglin J., dissenting.\u2014The plaintiff could bring the action in his capacity as a ratepayer of the municipality.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014An appropriate remedy in such a case would be by action prosecuted by the Attorney-General of the province under article 978 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Such an action might be prosecuted either by the municipal corporation itself or by an authority representing the general public.\nValidity of the by-law, resolution and contract in question discussed by Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Demers J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and R. Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.\nAtwater K.C., Bisaillon K.C. and J. A. Archambault K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In my opinion, the appellant is not qualified to bring suit. A ratepayer who has not suffered any special injury, but only such as is public in its nature and affects all the inhabitants alike, has no interest entitling him to bring action against the city. It is against public policy that he should be permitted to do so. It is undoubtedly the law in England that such a suit can only be brought with the permission and in the name of the Attorney-General representing the Sovereign, the parens patri\u0153. Apart from any presumption to which this fact may give rise in favour of the principle the grounds on which it is based seem clear. Rule in France, Garsonnet, vol. I., No. 376.\nIt would be difficult for public business to be carried on at all if every individual in a city with a population of half a million persons could sit in judgment on all the actions of the civic authorities and any crank were at liberty to drag them at any time before the courts. The city would never be free from litigation with its attendant expense when, as would probably be often the case, the complainants were men of straw.\nBut there is more than this. That which is for the general benefit of all the ratepayers may cause an injury to the private interests of any particular ratepayer which would far outweigh any advantage which he might gain simply as one of the body of ratepayers. This injury may or may not be actionable. If, for instance, his property is taken for the common purposes he will have a right of action, but if it is merely in his capacity as a rival trader that he suffers loss this may well give rise to no cause of action.\nThe appellant is the private secretary of the Montreal Tramways Co. and, as found by the trial judge, is only the \u201cpr\u00eate-nom\u201d of a rival company. He originally claimed qualification as holder of a few shares in the company transferred to him for the purpose of the action. This clearly gave him no title to sue and in the course of the proceedings he abandoned the claim. His claim as a ratepayer is not bon\u00e2 fide as such. The contract is not against the interest of the ratepayers generally, but in their favour and the appellant is using his interest as a ratepayer not for the benefit of the whole body of ratepayers, but in the interests of his private business. This claim as a ratepayer is an attempt to do indirectly what he cannot do directly.\nNevertheless, it is necessary to consider carefully what is the law, since if it permits the bringing of such actions, the courts have to give effect to it whatever inconvenience may result from such a course.\nArticle 77 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that\nno person can bring an action at law unless he has an interest therein.\nThis is merely a formal statement of a rule that is elementary in every system of law. The difficulty that may arise is in determining what is an interest in the particular case.\nIn a Scotch case recently before the House of Lords (Dundee Harbour Trustees v. Nicol[2]), Lord Dunedin in his judgment said:\u2014\nBy the law of Scotland a litigant must always qualify title and interest. * * * I am not aware that any one of authority has risked a definition of what constitutes title to sue. I am not disposed to do so.\nThere is, I think, similarity as to this between the Quebec and the Scotch law and I do not myself propose to attempt any definition of what constitutes an interest within the meaning of article 77, C.P.Q.\nIt seems clear that there must he some limitation placed upon the word. Farmers in the west of Canada whose produce is all sent to be shipped from the Port of Montreal must certainly have an interest of a kind in the affairs of the city. Indeed, every Canadian might be said to have an interest in the good government of the commercial metropolis of the country.\nWhen the interest which the individual has is no greater or other than that of the rest of the public he has not, in my opinion, an interest in the action within the meaning of article 77, C.P.Q.\nBut no one is on this account without remedy. An individual can always inform the Attorney-General who can, and, in a proper case, must, take action thereon (art. 978, C.P.Q.). If the Attorney-General does not consider the case a proper one for him to intervene in he can permit the complainant to use his name and the action is then brought in the name of the Attorney-General on the relation of the individual informant. There is in this practice the advantage that the Attorney-General can impose such terms for security for costs being given as in the circumstances of the case he may deem proper.\nThen it must not be forgotten that section 304 of the charter of the City of Montreal (62 Vict. ch. 58) provides a special remedy in favour of any individual ratepayer. In the manner provided in this section\ntout contribuable peut, par requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, en son nom, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure, demander l\u2019annulation d\u2019un r\u00e8glement pour le motif d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nThis provision does not necessarily imply either that there would be otherwise no remedy or that any previous right of action is superseded. There might, however, be some presumption that the latter alternative was the intention of the legislature. It is common where the intention is otherwise for the legislature to state explicitly that the remedy it provides is to be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any existing remedies. I do not doubt, however, that but for this provision individual ratepayers would have had no right to take action such as this section expressly confers upon them.\nWhen we come to examine the jurisprudence on the subject, I think it is doubtful whether the courts have given any decisions that conflict with the principle under consideration.\nI do not wish to enter at tedious length into a discussion of any that may be supposed to do so; most of them, at any rate, can, I think, he distinguished. There is, however, one class to which the majority probably belong to which I must call attention. There are cases in which property is involved on which the courts fastening a trust have held that fiduciary relations existed between the parties. It is on this ground that a corporation in the capacity of a trustee is allowed to be sued by an individual inhabitant as one of the cestuis que trust.\nIn the United States this right and the doctrine on which it is based are distinctly recognized. Thus, in Dillon, on Municipal Corporations (5 ed.), vol. IV., p. 2763, sec. 1579, it is said that in the United States the right of property holders or taxable inhabitants to resort to equity to restrain municipal corporations under such circumstances is established; the origin of the equitable doctrine is explained in the following sections. In the much quoted judgment of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Crampton v. Zabriskie[3], it was said:\u2014 Of the right of resident taxpayers to invoke the interposition of a court of equity to prevent an illegal disposition of the moneys of the county or the illegal creation of a debt which they in common with other property holders of the county may otherwise be compelled to pay, there is at this day no serious question.\nIt will be observed that in the United States the proceeding is one in equity. Whether the courts in this country would in like cases assume to exercise a similar equitable jurisdiction need not be too closely inquired into. The present case offers no occasion for the raising of any trust or the jurisdiction flowing therefrom.\nTo this class of cases belongs the case to which I have already referred, of the Dundee Harbour Trustees v. Nicol[4], though the principle on which it depends may not be so expressly recognized. In that case the appellants had been constituted by statute a body of trustees to be elected in part by the shipowners and harbour ratepayers of Dundee, and the Act vested in them certain property and rights. They made a use of part of their property for purposes not authorized by the Act and which involved the risk of its loss. It was held that they could be restrained from so doing and that the respondents, who were shipowners and harbour ratepayers, had a good title to maintain the proceedings. The Lord Chancellor said:\u2014\nReading the sections together I think that the effect of the statute is to establish a trust comprising a fund made up of rates, ferry dues and other sources of income as well as of sums authorized to be borrowed. * * * It appears to me that the respondents have an interest as beneficiaries in the fund so constituted and in the undertaking. * * * I see no reason in point of principle to doubt that this beneficial interest in the trust funds and undertaking, which are vested in the appellants as a corporation with limited powers, is sufficient to enable the respondents individually to claim to restrain dealings which are ultra vires with the trust funds and undertaking.\nAnd, after referring to the usual and proper practice in England to invoke in such a case the assistance of the Attorney-General, he said that he thought it probable that even in England a harbour ratepayer in such a case\nwhose interest in the undertaking and funds is apparent ought to be treated as within the analogy of the principle, which enables a single shareholder to sue in his own name to restrain an ultra vires action.\nLord Dunedin, who delivered the principal judgment on the point, insists on the argument that the respondents being persons for whose benefit the harbour is kept up have a title to prevent an ultra vires act of the appellants which directly affects the property under their care.\nSo that it was really as trustees of the property to which the respondents had contributed and in which they were beneficially interested that the appellants were sued, and it was to prevent the loss of that property through their improper acts.\nThere can be no analogy between such a case and that of a ratepaper suing to prevent acts which neither involve any property in which the ratepayers are interested as cestuis que trust, nor impose any taxation or burdens upon them, but on the contrary are for their common advantage.\nIf I have dealt more fully with this case than its concern with the present case calls for, it is because it is the most recent case on the subject and has the authority of the final Court of Appeal for the United Kingdom. It illustrates well, moreover, the character of the class of cases in which a single individual can sue as one amongst a number of beneficiaries a corporation in whom property is vested in trust for all such beneficiaries.\nAs regards cases in the Canadian courts, particularly those of the Province of Quebec, I do not desire to say more than that I think the foregoing remarks apply with force to them. Perhaps, however, it must be admitted that there is difficulty in reconciling all the decisions in the Quebec courts.\nUnder these circumstances I think the matter must be treated as one that, in view of its importance, has not yet been sufficiently discussed and, at any rate, not conclusively decided. I think on all grounds it is open to this court to give a clear and final decision upon this point.\nSince for the above reasons I consider that the appellant was not qualified to bring suit I express no opinion upon the merits of the questions raised in the suit.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent, the City of Montreal, a municipal corporation, entered into a contract with the other respondent whereby an exclusive franchise was attempted to be given the latter to establish and operate lines of autobusses to be operated over certain streets of said city in the way of carrying passengers for hire for the period of ten years.\nThe contract rests upon a by-law of the city, which it is said delegates the power to the city council to enter by way of resolution into such a contract, and upon such a resolution passed by the said council. The contract is dated 22nd August, 1912, and is expressly made in virtue of the authority conferred upon the city hy 2 Geo. V., ch. 56, sec. 12, sub-sec. 137, as well as all the municipal regulations of said city which can relate to the exploitation of autobus lines of the company.\nThe appellant is a ratepayer of the city and claims that the whole proceeding is illegal.\nThe questions thus raised must be determined by the consideration of a few sections of the city charter as amended by some of the numerous amendments that exist and of a few elementary principles of municipal law.\nThe amending sub-section 137, being that alone upon which the parties could have proceeded and must have supposed their proceedings rested, is as follows:\u2014\n137. To permit, under such conditions and restrictions as the city may impose, the circulation of autobusses and the establishment, maintenance and operation of autobus lines in the City of Montreal; to prescribe on which streets they may circulate and be established and from what streets they may be excluded; subject to the provisions of arts. 1388 to 1435 of the Revised Statutes, 1909, governing motor vehicles, respecting speed limits, the registration of vehicles and the licences of owners and chauffeurs.\nTo understand this we must observe in what connection it is used and how intended by the amendment to be applied. We find in tracing back the matter thus that it is made supplementary to sections 299 and 300 of the charter as consolidated in A.D. 1899 by 62 Vict., ch. 58, which enabled the city council to enact by-laws for the purposes defined and specified.\nIn the schedule of subjects contained in section 299 there is specified item, No. 17, which is as follows:\u2014\nThe granting of franchises and privileges to persons or companies. Section 300, so far as bearing upon this subject, is as follows:\u2014\n300. And the city council, for the purposes and objects included in the foregoing article, but without limitation of its powers and authority thereunder, as well as for the purposes and objects detailed in the present article shall have authority: * * * 74. To regulate and control, in a manner not contrary to any specific provisions on the subject contained in this charter, the exercise, by any person or corporation, or any public franchise or privilege in any of the streets or public places in the city, whether such franchise or privilege has been granted by the city or by the legislature.\nLet us read sub-section 137, introduced and put in Connection with the foregoing by 2 Geo. V., ch. 56, above referred to and quoted, as if it followed this, and we see what gives it vitality, and upon and subject to what conditions the power which it contains is given.\nIt is a power to enact a by-law and nothing less and does not authorize the council to act by a mere resolution.\nSurely, it is elementary that any one given a power to do a particular thing, in a strictly specified way, must follow the allotted path and is not at liberty to try to accomplish what he believes to be the same result by some other method, and then claim he is exercising the powers given.\nI find, therefore, that the power given to do that contemplated by the amendment quoted above, whatever may be the scope and purpose thereof, must be exercised by by-law.\nThere was no by-law adopting the contract in question and, hence, it cannot rest upon this amending section; for the mere resolution of the council cannot maintain anything dependent thereupon.\nIt is argued that the amended powers of the commissioners enable this contract to be entered into by a resolution of the council. Sub-section 3 of section 21, enacted by 1 Geo. V., ch. 48, as follows:\u2014\nIt shall devolve upon the council, on the commissioners\u2019 report, to grant franchises and privileges, by by-laws, resolutions or contracts, as the case may be; to issue debentures and to effect loans,\nis relied upon.\nWith great respect I cannot see how such an interpretation can be placed upon this sub-section.\nIt clearly indicates that where \u201cas the case may be\u201d a by-law is the appropriate method, then a by-law must be adopted, and where a resolution is a suitable mode of executing the proposals of the commissioners, that may be adopted.\nIt would surprise some people to be offered debentures resting merely upon a resolution of the council even if the commissioners had recommended such an issue.\nAgain, it has been argued that, as there may be a general power given municipalities relative to franchises for running cars for the conveyance of passengers, and, as clause 4650(a) and following sections, restraining the like grants beyond ten years, unless sanctioned by a vote of the municipal electors, use the phrase \u201cby-law or resolution\u201d in dealing therewith, it may he implied first, that an exclusive franchise for the ten years can be granted and that when the term of any such contract is less than ten years, then the use of a resolution may be resorted to.\nSuch far-fetched reason for resting an implication of any kind upon hardly deserves serious consideration in relation to the matter now in hand.\nThese general provisions are intended to be comprehensive and to cover not only the actual, but also the possible by virtue of any existing, or by way of anticipation of any future regulation, enabling the use of either by-law or resolution in the cases referred to. How can the suggested implication rest thereupon unless and until legislative authority had been given to use resolutions as such basis of action?\nMoreover, I venture to think that a municipal corporation bas only such powers as are expressly given it by statute or as may arise from the necessary implication involved in the obligation to discharge some statutory duty imposed upon the corporation. And in the discharge of any such duty the usual methods appropriate to the execution of such business must be adopted.\nWhen such corporations find they cannot, by acting within these limitations, efficiently promote the supposed purposes had in view in their creation, they usually apply to their legislative creators to confer further powers.\nSuch, I take it, was the origin of the amendment above quoted and relied upon. It never was, I imagine, supposed that there existed any such implication till the hard exigencies of arguing to maintain this contract suggested a resort thereto.\nStarting out in any direction to solve the problems involved herein we are always driven back to the realization of the hard legal facts that the only semblance of power ever given in relation thereto was to enact a by-law relative to\nthe circulation of autobusses and the establishment, maintenance and operation of autobus lines in the City of Montreal.\nAnd this has not been adhered to.\nAgain, the contract proposed was to constitute an exclusion of others than the respondent company from operating upon the streets selected. No such power is given in this section or elsewhere.\nTo begin with the streets are open to use by everyone for travelling over with suitable vehicles and whether carrying either passengers or freight for hire, or only for private business or comfort. An express enactment is required to take away any part of this public right.\nIn the next place the mere regulation of the traffic on the streets which is vested by the charter of the city in its authorities seems to have been the purpose of, and at least is clearly the nature of, what this amendment is provided for, and it cannot he extended by by-law, or otherwise, to the creation of an exclusive right in any man or firm or corporation to use the streets for any specific purpose. All must be treated alike unless by virtue of some express legislation taking away such right.\nThe section enables the council to prescribe the streets on which autobus lines may circulate, but does not enable the preference of one line over another.\nI think it may be well, respectfully, to point out that those depending upon the argument of implication in legislation, would do well to consider the chapters in Hardcastle on Statutes dealing with implications and enabling statutes, and the many authorities collected therein.\nThe respondent being a ratepayer and constituted by the city charter a member of the corporation is entitled to take this action. It is one sort of security the law gives (as it does to each member of a corporate body) for keeping the municipal authorities in their acts within the limitations of the law, or often municipal government would be quite intolerable.\nThe statute gives, it is true, a summary method for attacking by-laws, but that is not inconsistent with the right each member of a corporate body has by law. And the provision does not purport to exclude any other remedy, though giving a summary method.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, the contract declared illegal and void, and the by-law and resolution also, so far as designed and, if possibly valid, capable of being applied to support such a contract.\nThere are a number of the paragraphs in the bylaw which are general and in themselves complete and inoffensive as they trench upon no man\u2019s right.\nI had written the foregoing opinion before the re-argument, which recently took place, touching the right of the appellant to institute such proceedings as presented herein, was directed.\nThat right of appellant must depend upon whether or not he falls within article 77 of the Code of Civil Procedure for Quebec, which is as follows:\u2014\n77. No person can bring an action at law unless he has an interest therein.\nSuch interest, except where it is otherwise provided, may be merely eventual.\nThe new part indicates (whatever else it may have been intended for) as fairly arguable the proposition that the shareholders of the Montreal Tramways Company having an eventual interest in the decision of such a question as agitated herein, may be qualified to sue. The value of the interest is immaterial. It might happen to be, in any case, either that of the owners of almost the entire shareholding property, or of only a single share.\nThe probably tenable answer is that generally speaking the shareholders are not as such entitled to apply to the courts unless and until shewing that by reason of the existing conditions of the company or its directorate, who should act but will not, there is no means left to any number of shareholders to obtain justice, or that the company is doing, or attempting to do, that which is ultra vires.\nThat brings the matter back to the other ground taken in this action by the appellant as an inhabitant and ratepayer, in other words as a corporator, that the contract he attacks is ultra vires of the corporation of which he is a member and that in having it so declared he has an interest entitling him to sue. English practice might suggest or require the suit to be on behalf of all the ratepayers. Passing that minor point not raised in argument, I return to the proposition just enunciated, which I maintained in what I have already written, and still maintain (more confidently) as result of the re-argument,\n\u201cThe inhabitants and ratepayers of the City of Montreal and their successors\u201d were, by section 4 of the charter, incorporated.\nThe charter, by section 304, specifically recognizes a ratepayer as having the right to apply to the Superior Court to annul any by-law. And a similar provision is made in the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d para. 5623 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, and article 698 of the Municipal Code.\nAll these provisions indicate that the legislature considered ratepayers to be in fact persons interested.\nI think these enactments merely provide a summary remedy by petition, in addition to such remedies as already were existent, for the enforcement of the legal right thus, apparently as matter of course, assumed to exist and to be grounded upon obvious interest.\nAnd the almost entire abstention on the part of the Attorney-General from interference in such matters would seem to indicate that reliance is not to be placed as in England upon such officer, but upon the vigilance of the ratepayers for the purpose of protecting the members of municipal corporations against attempts on the part of those in authority to act ultra vires.\nThen why should we assume under such a condition of things that an article of faith, as it were, which anciently existed in England must prevail in Quebec?\nSurely in the absence of English faith and practice there, and where reason alone is our guide, it is expressive of our common sense to hold that every \u201cinhabitant and ratepayer\u201d has a direct interest in keeping his municipal rulers within their legal boundaries. It is not a question of every such man having a right to interfere with the acts of the class of men whom the legislature has designated, and from whom the people have chosen those to transact the business of the corporation. It is simply the question of restraining such men from misrepresenting those who put them there going beyond the line of their authority that is now in question.\nWhy, for example, should shareholders of a corporate company impliedly have this right and it be denied to the municipal corporator?\nWhy should a shareholder be told, as he was by Bacon V.C. in Hope v. The International Financial Society[5], at page 332:\u2014\nBut he is a shareholder also, and, as a shareholder, it is his right, and it is also his duty, to see that the moneys of the company are applied to their legitimate purpose.\nThis seems to me sound law and sense and so was upheld in appeal. The plaintiff there had an interest as a creditor, but that was expressly discarded. The case is cited in Buckley on Companies, etc. (9 ed.), at page 613, where the legal distinctions applicable to cases in which a shareholder may, and those in which he may not, have a right to invoke the action of the courts to control a company, are dealt with.\nOr take the doctrine as laid down by Sir George Jessell in Russell v. Wakefield Waterworks Co.[6], at pages 479 and 480, and especially foot of latter page, when quoting with approbation the language of Sir J. Wigram in Foss v. Harbottle[7], where he ends by attributing to Lord Cottenham the saying that\nthe claims of justice would be found superior to any difficulties arising out of technical rules respecting the mode in which corporations are required to sue.\nWhat is dealt with there is not exactly what we have to deal with here, but the mode of thought and speech touches what may well have been had in mind by those amending the article 77 of the Code of Civil Procedure already quoted.\nIt all comes back to what that article covers and enables or impliedly denies.\nIf the attitude taken in England towards the supposed needs of resorting to the Attorney-General as sole repository of the right and duty to invoke the powers of the court to restrain corporations from transgressing the limits of their powers, has been correctly reflected in these dicta as what obtained half a century ago, can we rely much upon the merely technical doctrine transmitted thence as a guide to interpret said article 77?\nThe Attorney-General of Quebec has, by article 978 of the Code of Civil Procedure, imposed upon him the respective duties, therein expressed, either absolutely or conditionally, as the case may be. Does that take away from the interest, right or duty of the \u201cinhabitant and ratepayer\u201d?\nI do not find therein any such necessary implication.\nThen in articles 713, 714, 715, and 716 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, there is defined his legal functions, duties and powers.\nAmongst these article 716 gives him the functions and powers which belong to the office of Attorney-General and Solicitor-General of England, in so far as the same are applicable to this province, etc.\nWhen we fail to find an active use of such powers in relation to such subject matters, should we not conclude that the same have not been found in that respect applicable to the province?\nIf he is supposed to act only upon the application of some one indemnifying against costs under article 978, then who has the right to so demand?\nIf the ratepayer or inhabitant has no interest, how can he demand such action? It seems over refinement to say he has an interest which entitles him to set the law in motion, yet no interest entitling him to sue. Let us turn to article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows:\u2014\n50. Excepting the Court of King\u2019s Bench, all courts, circuit judges and magistrates, and all other persons and bodies politic and corporate, within the province, are subject to the superintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court and of the judges thereof in such manner and form as by law provided.\nWho is to move the court to invoke the exercise of this visitorial power? If intended to limit it to those moving by and through the Attorney-General, the article likely would have said so. We do know that such has not been the interpretation given it in many cases. Even before this legislation the power was exercised apparently as if inherent in the court, though not as accurately defined.\nThe courts have continually acted upon the application of those interested and the only difference of opinion has been as to the interest a ratepayer, merely as such, may have. We find many cases in which the objection has been taken that he applying had no interest, and that often answered by shewing he had some possible financial interest more or less remote. From this counsel for the company seems to ask us to infer those cases are the limit. I fail to find in the very numerous cases of that sort any such doctrine as he argues for to be necessarily implied.\nI do find, however, something to warrant the inference that a confusion of thought has often existed in the minds of those pressing such objections, between the right of a member of the corporation to restrain it acting ultra vires and that of a member of the general public in such cases as arise out of what is intra vires the municipal authority. For example, some obstruction may exist on a highway, obnoxious to the safety or general sense of propriety, and a member of the public may complain. Unless, however, he is able to shew he suffers particularly beyond the rest of the public same injury therefrom, he is held not entitled to bring a suit therefor. The subject is within the administrative powers of the municipal authorities. No private right is invaded is the answer to the action. I do not think the cases are at all analogous in law.\nWe find, however, a line of cases where the suitor had obviously no interest but that of a ratepayer or other member of the corporate body.\nThe following cases have been cited to us by counsel for appellant, in the recent argument, as some of those in which the element of interest other than simply as a ratepayer or otherwise, as member of the corporation, clearly did not exist, or was in effect eliminated, by the view taken by the court, as to such right and interest.\nThe case of Allard v. La Ville de Saint-Pierre et al.[8], is one where the question arose of the right of a ratepayer to bring an action before the Superior Court to have a by-law quashed which had been passed ultra vires which was maintained in appeal. All the questions involved herein relative to the right of a ratepayer to sue in the Superior Court instead of proceeding by way of petition as an elector were dealt with therein.\nThen in the case of Aubertin v. La Ville de Maisonneuve[9], it was first decided by Mr. Justice Curran that the action should be dismissed purely on the ground that there was no right in the plaintiff to sue in his quality of proprietor of immovables situated within the limits of the municipality defendant; and that he did not shew any grievance not suffered by other proprietors and electors. In appeal to the court of appeal the judgment was reversed, the majority of the court holding distinctly that there was error in the said holding of Mr. Justice Curran. Many cases are cited in the notes thereto; some relevant to the point in question, others not so relevant.\nIn the case of Lennon v. La Cit\u00e9 de Westmount[10], the exception was taken, that the plaintiff should have proceeded by way of petition and it was held that where the by-law was ultra vires the ratepayer need not proceed by way of petition.\nIn the case of Corporation of Arthabasca v. Patoine[11], the right seems to have been recognized although the Chief Justice, Sir A. Dorion, dissented from the result, holding that in that case proceedings were not open to he taken by anybody, because it was a matter for the administration of the municipality in which there might be a mere irregularity. He expressly distinguishes that case from the case where the council has acted beyond its jurisdiction and seems to have recognized that then any party injured could proceed in virtue of the provisions of the Code, or, in certain cases, by direct action in the ordinary form. Unfortunately the exact question of whether the individual ratepayer would in such a case necessarily be injured, was not by him touched upon. The case is valuable for the consideration given therein to the general principles which ought to govern those managing municipal affairs, and govern the court in supervising their conduct and rectifying wrong, if any.\nIn Guay v. The Corporation of Malbaie[12], the court seemed to recognize the right of an elector or ratepayer as having sufficient interest in certain cases.\nIn Jacob v. La Cit\u00e9 de St. Henri[13], Judge Pagnuelo clearly holds the ratepayer had sufficient interest.\nThe case of Tremblay v. The City of Montreal[14] proceeds on article 304 of the charter, but St. Pierre J. distinguishes between that which is intra vires and that which is ultra vires, as to the extent of this remedy.\nIn Trudel v. Git\u00e9 de Hull[15], the right of a ratepayer to have a mandamus to compel the corporation to observe the law was clearly recognized. That case concerned the finances of the city, but turned on the question of the plaintiff having an interest to bring the suit therefor. The plaintiff clearly had no such right as where given expressly the power as in the last mentioned case. Yet he was held entitled to sue. The form thereof or kind of relief sought or got cannot affect the question of his right or interest. If he had no interest he could not sue in any form.\nThe case of Farwell v. Corporation of Sherbrooke[16] clearly lays down the law that the ratepayer is not confined as to his right to relief to the provisions contained in specific articles enabling him to sue, but may have a by-law passed ultra vires quashed by taking the proceeding in an ordinary action. Many of the leading cases in Quebec are discussed in the judgment.\nI may also refer to the case of Pich\u00e9 v. La Corporation de Portncuf[17], where the Court of Review confirmed, for the reasons given by Routhier J., the judgment given by him granting relief against the action of the council in regard to roads, where he relied upon article 2329 of Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, which gives very wide powers Over all courts, magistrates and judges, and circuit courts and corporations in the province, and now appears as article 3085 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909.\nI do not think we should discard and overrule such a mass of authority simply because we find in some other cases a different rule has been observed.\nI have examined all such cited and many others, for the subject is an interesting one. I think, however, when we have under consideration any branch of the law where there has been a development, indicating a process of discarding that which is no longer serviceable, and substituting therefor that which tends to the furtherance of justice and judicial control over those who are determined to exceed the limits of their authority, we should at least lend a sympathetic ear to such decisions as tend to aid and promote such beneficent development.\nIn this instance it turns upon the meaning to be given the \u201cinterest\u201d of him who, if he has regard to what is going on about him, must be most deeply interested in seeing that the bounds of authority in his local rulers are not exceeded.\nIt does not occur to me that the term can only relate to financial interests. In the ultimate result, assuredly, misgovernment always tends to affect even those interests. In this case there are financial provisions dealt with in the contract proposed. If the contract is ultra vires it is void and the corporation may run many merely financial risks of which the end may be difficult to see. Is such a thing to be tolerated?\nIn the case of Paterson v. Bowes[18], the Court of Chancery in Upper Canada held a ratepayer entitled to sue as plaintiff therein did, and we in this court in the case of MacIlreith v. Hart[19], followed that and other like cases.\nThe principle involved in the latter was the ultra vires nature of the act of payment complained of. Here it involves money and much else that concerns the right and duty of the citizen.\nThere is nothing peculiar to French law in the doctrine that a man who has no interest in the subject matter giving rise to litigation shall have no right to bring an action. That doctrine is common to all legal systems. It has been unduly pressed by its application to a condition of things arising out of the development of corporate activities, both of an industrial and municipal character.\nThose fond of technicalities may approve of so doing. Those caring less for technicalities, seeing the trend of events and having more regard for the useful application of the principles of law than the form or mode of such application, should find no difficulty in discovering that he who has as the result of such development a very real interest in restraining those he has placed in power from exceeding the limits thereof.\nCounsel for the city urged that the business of the city would be hampered by permitting the exercise of such a right. The contrary seems to me to be the correct way of looking at it. If the municipal authorities keep within their powers they have nothing to fear. If they exceed them the sooner it is so determined the better. For what is done by such excess leads only to confusion and loss of efficiency and money.\nAn obiter dictum of Lord Watson in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. City of Montreal[20], at middle of page 642, was referred to in argument. He said there, referring to some legislative provisions enabling any municipal elector to attack by-laws:\u2014\nThey confer upon each and every municipal elector the right, which he had not at common law, to challenge, on the score of illegality, any corporate appropriation of money to meet the expenses of the current year, subject to the condition that the right shall prescribe, if not exercised within three months from the time when the appropriation comes into force.\nWhat he had in mind is made to appear at foot of page 643, where he says:\u2014\nTo begin with the first of these pleas, it is true that an incompetent resolution must be illegal; but it does not follow that an illegal resolution must be beyond the competence of the council. In this case, the resolution sought to be impeached was plainly within their competence, seeing that it exclusively relates to matters committed to the council by statute. Even if it had been incompetent, that circumstance could not enable the appellant to bring a petition for its annulment after the expiry of the three months. After the lapse of that period, the right conferred upon a municipal elector by 42 & 43 Vict. ch. 53, sec. 12, is at an end; though the incompetent resolution remains open to challenge, at the instance of persons who have a proper title. Who the persons having a proper title might be is not stated. An elector might be a corporator or not according to the statute incorporating.\nAs against this dictum we have the recent decision (in 1915) in the case of Dundee Harbour Trustees v. Nicol and others[21], holding that appellants, who were constituted a board of trustees under the \u201cDundee Harbour and Tay Ferries Consolidation Act,\u201d 1911, to be elected in part by the shipowners and harbour ratepayers of Dundee, were liable to be restrained by proceedings, taken at the suit of shipowners and ratepayers, from acting ultra vires. And the neat point was raised as to the right of those parties to complain without the necessity of the Lord Advocate being made a party to take the proceeding.\nLord Haldane, mindful of the analogy according to English practice which might suggest the single shareholders\u2019s right upon which I have relied alone, instead of the Attorney-General who, in a like English case might be a proper party to so act, said:\u2014\nIn England it may well be that it would be in accordance with the usual and proper practice to invoke, in a case such as this, the assistance of the Attorney-General, who, as representative of the Sovereign the parens pa trice, has the capacity to interfere. But even without invoking the Attorney-General I think it probable that, in a case such as the present, a harbour ratepayer in the position of the respondents, whose interest in the undertaking and funds is apparent, ought to be treated as within the analogy of the principle which enables a single shareholder to sue in his own name to restrain an ultra vires act.\nIt is not necessary to decide this question of English law, and the judgment in the present case will leave it open; yet I have thought it right to say what I have said in order to shew that I do not overlook the analogy. But whatever would be the position in England, the case for recognition of the individual title to sue of a person in the situation of the respondents is materially stronger in Scotland, inasmuch as the Lord Advocate does not, under the law and practice which obtain there, usually intervene as representing the parens patrice excepting when some statute casts on him the duty of doing so. I have come to the conclusion that the respondents had a good title to maintain these proceedings.\nThen in the same case we have (if I might be permitted to say so) a most instructive judgment by Lord Dunedin citing many cases and shewing the development of judicial thought in regard to the very question we have in hand.\nIf the ratepayers can be upheld by the House of Lords in maintaining such a right as involved herein in Scotland, where so much of the mode of legal thought depends on the principles of the civil law, surety the Province of Quebec need not dread the adoption of what, as shewn by the cases cited above, so many of their able judges have held to be law.\nIn the United States opinion seems to have been much affected by the local condition of things relative to the exercise of the powers of supervision by the Attorney-General. Where by statute or otherwise that officer continuously undertook to see to the enforcement of law and order, he often was looked to as the proper party to bring the action, but in states where that officer has ceased to act, the tendency seems to have been to hold the ratepayer had the right, in other words, the interest, qualifying him to act.\nIn the case of Crampton v. Zabriskie[22], at page 609, the Supreme Court of the United States held that at that day (1879), no serious question existed of the right.\nOf course, all this is predicated upon the hypothesis that the contract in question is ultra vires and the mode or condition of doing anything like thereunto has not been adopted.\nIf I am mistaken in the opinion of its being ultra vires, this supplementary opinion has no bearing on the appeal.\nDuff J.\u2014On the 10th of June, 1912, the council of the City of Montreal passed a by-law containing the following provisions:\u2014\nSec. 2. Les autobus destin\u00e9s \u00e0 transporter des \u201cpassagers\u201d seront exclus de toutes les rues, avenues et autres voies publiques qui ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s dans la c\u00e9dule ci-annex\u00e9e.\nSec. 16. Aucune personne ou compagnie ne devra faire circuler des autobus ou \u00e9tablir, maintenir ou exploiter des lignes d\u2019autobus dans la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, dans les rues mentionn\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement, sans avoir pr\u00e9alablement obtenu un permis \u00e0 cet effet de la cit\u00e9.\nOn the 22nd of August of the same year the mayor on behalf of the municipality made a contract with the Canadian Autobus Co. Ltd. in pursuance of a resolution passed by the council on the 14th of the same month, by which (inter alia) the Autobus Co. was given the right to run autobusses for the transportation of passengers for hire on certain parts of the public highways mentioned in these two sections. The contract contains the following provisions:\u2014\nLa Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al s\u2019engage durant une p\u00e9riode de dix ann\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de la mise en exploitation des lignes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans les articles 1, 26, et 27, du pr\u00e9sent contrat, \u00e0 n\u2019accorder aucun autre permis pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, le maintien et l\u2019exploitation de lignes d\u2019autobus sur ces dites lignes,\nthe effect of this contract, if valid, being that for the period of ten years following \u201cla mise en exploitation\u201d the Autobus Co. acquires the right to run its vehicles as above mentioned, while the municipality disables itself from granting permits under the by-law of the 10th of August to possible competitors for any of the same routes. On the same assumption it is also probable that the council is disabled from abrogating the regulation contained in the 16th section of the by-law. It is not necessary, however, in the view I take, to consider that point.\nThe validity of the contract is attacked upon three grounds:\u2014\n(1) That the City of Montreal has no authority to grant an exclusive right to run autobusses in the city streets.\n(2) That assuming such a power to be vested in the municipality it is a power which can only be exercised under the authority of a by-law and admittedly no by-law was passed authorizing the contract of the 24th of August.\n(3) That the contract provides for a transfer to the municipality of shares in the Autobus Co., and the taking shares in such a company is ultra vires of the municipality.\nThe first ground raises, among others, the important question of how far the council can by contract bind its successors in respect of regulating the use of the city streets; Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald[23]; Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Proprietors v. Proprietors of Birmingham Canal[24], but I think the appellant has no title to impeach the resolution of the council or the contract upon either the first or the second of these grounds. I shall state my reasons for this as briefly as possible, but a summary reference is unavoidable to the powers and authorities with which the municipal corporation of the City of Montreal is invested by its present charter\u2014of the year 1899 (62 Vict., ch. 58). By section 4 it is provided (inter alia) that the inhabitants and ratepayers of the City of Montreal and their successors shall continue to be a municipal corporation under the name of the City of Montreal,\nand as such shall have * * * all the powers of legislation control and administration commonly possessed by municipal corporations and in addition thereto all the powers specially granted to the said city by-law and by the provisions of this Act.\nThe description of these \u201cpowers of legislation\u201d and \u201ccontrol,\u201d in so far as they are material for the present purpose is found in sections 299 and 300 of the charter and in an enactment, passed in 2 Geo. V., and specially referred to in the contract by section 12, sub-sec. 137, ch. 56, of the statutes of that year. Section 299 of the charter which is the general provision on the subject of \u201cpowers of legislation\u201d had better be quoted substantially in full, and is as follows:\u2014\n299. It shall be lawful for the city council to enact, repeal or amend, and enforce by-laws for the peace, order, good government and general welfare of the City of Montreal, and for all matters and things whatsoever that concern and effect, or that may hereafter concern and effect the City of Montreal as a city and body politic and corporate, provided always that such by-laws be not repugnant to the laws of this province or of Canada, nor contrary to any special provisions of this charter.\nAnd for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the scope of the foregoing provision or of any power otherwise conferred by this charter, nor to exceed the provisos herein above mentioned, it is hereby declared that the authority and jurisdiction of the said city council extends, and shall hereafter extend to all matters coming within and affecting or affected by the classes of subjects next hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\u2014\n3. Streets, lanes, and highways, and the right of passage above, across, along or beneath the same;\n6. Licenses for trading and peddling; 8. Health and sanitation;\n12. Nuisances;\n14. Decency and good morals;\n17. The granting of franchises and privileges to persons or companies.\nThe provisions of section 300 are more specific; sub-sections 1, 29, and 74 have some bearing upon the question before us. They are as follows:\u2014\n300. And the city council, for the purposes and objects included in the foregoing article, but without limitation of its powers and authority thereunder, as well as for the purposes and objects detailed in the present article, shall have authority:\u2014\n1. To regulate the use of and prevent and remove encroachments into, upon or over streets, alleys, avenues, public grounds and public places, municipal streams and waters, and to prevent injury thereto and prohibit the improper use thereof;\n29. To license and regulate hackmen, draymen, expressmen, porters, and all other persons or corporations, including street railway companies, engaged in carrying passengers, baggage or freight in the city, and to regulate their charges therefor, and to prescribe standing places or stations within the streets or near railway stations, where the same may remain while waiting for business, and to prohibit the same from standing or waiting at any other places than the places so prescribed;\n74. To regulate and control, in a manner not contrary to any specific provisions on the subject contained in this charter, the exercise, by any person or corporation, of any public franchise or privilege in any of the streets or public places in the city, whether such franchise or privilege has been granted by the city or by the Legislature.\nThe statute of 2 Geo. V. is in these terms:\u2014\n137. To permit under such conditions and restrictions as the city may impose, the circulation of autobusses and the establishment, maintenance and operation of autobus lines in the City of Montreal; to prescribe on which streets they may circulate and be established and from what streets they may be excluded; subject to the provisions of arts. 1388 to 1435 of the Revised Statutes, 1909, governing motor vehicles, respecting speed limits, the registration of vehicles and the licences of owners and chauffeurs.\nIt is evident that in passing the by-law of the 10th of June and the resolution of the 14th of August the council was attempting to exercise one or more of the \u201cpowers of legislation\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d described in these enactments. The soil of highways within the municipality is declared, it is true, by another enactment to be vested in the municipality (Municipal Code, art. 752); but as \u201chighways they are dedicated to a public use and the municipality holds its title subject to the public right. The municipal council in professing to regulate the exercise of the public right (as in prohibiting the running of autobusses for hire without licence) is not acting as proprietor in the administration of the private property of the corporation. In Mr. Dicey\u2019s phrase, it acts herein as a \u201csubordinate law-making body\u201d in a matter which concerns not only the ratepayers or the inhabitants, but all persons who as the subjects of His Majesty are prim\u00e2 facie entitled to use the highways. And the \u201claw-making\u201d function it thus exercises may be assumed to have been committed to it in the interests of the whole public understood in that sense.\nI have been unable to convince myself that, apart from special enactment, the relation between the municipality and a ratepayer or an inhabitant as such imports in itself the possession by each of them of an \u201cinterest\u201d within the meaning of article 77, Code of Civil Procedure, entitling each of them as an individual to call the council of the municipality to account in a court of law for excess or abuse of authority in the exercise or professed exercise of functions of this description.\nAlthough the phrase has perhaps countenance from the highest judicial authority (see Bowes v. City of Toronto[25], at p. 524), it is only in a broad sense that a municipal council exercising such powers can be said to act as \u201ctrustee\u201d for the inhabitants or for the ratepayers as individuals. Between them as individuals, and the council, there is no fiduciary relation in the legal sense; but it is urged that since the inhabitants and ratepayers are constituted the Corporation of the City of Montreal by section 4 of the charter the law confers upon each of them a status to maintain such an action as this as a member of the corporation and the analogy of the shareholder in a joint stock company and his right to attack ultra vires acts of the corporation is invoked. J think that is straining the analogy. The governing body of a municipal corporation exercising law-making powers affecting the rights of all His Majesty\u2019s subjects presents a very different hypothesis from a corporation administering private property only. For excess of power in the first case (which is a wrong against the corporation or against the public as a whole) the appropriate remedy seems to be by way of some proceeding at the instance either of the corporation itself or of an authority representing the public. The law of Quebec provides the machinery. Article 978, C.P.Q.\nWhat I have said has, of course, no necessary bearing upon any right a ratepayer might be supposed to have to impeach proceedings of the council to impose a tax or rate exigible from such ratepayer.\nThe decisions relied upon give little help to the appellant. The ratio of Dundee Trustees v. Nicols[26] is stated in this passage of the judgment of Lord Dunedin, at pages 568 and 569:\u2014\nI now turn to the circumstances of this case. As I said at the outset. I do not think any general pronouncement can be made as to when there is title and when there is not. But when I find that the respondents in the capacity of harbour ratepayers are members of the constituency erected by the Act of Parliament to elect the trustees, and as such, are also persons for whose benefit the harbour is kept up, I cannot doubt that they have a title to prevent an ultra vires act of the appellants, which ultra vires act directly affects the property under their care. It is not only that loss of that property through improper acting may have the effect of imposing heavier rates on the respondents in the future, but, in the words of Lord Johnston in the Stirling County Council Case[27], at p. 1293, as they have contributed to the funds which bought the property, \u201cthey have an interest in the administration of a * * * fund to which they have contributed,\u201d and a title flowing from that position and interest.\nThis passage, of course, has no application to the present case. The Lord Chancellor, at page 558, suggests an analogy between the ratepayers whose rights were being considered and that of a shareholder in a joint stock company under the English law. His Lordship\u2019s language makes it plain that he has in mind a case where the right which is being asserted is in the nature of a \u201cbeneficial interest in trust funds\u201d; and I think I am not misreading his Lordship\u2019s judgment in interpreting it as giving no countenance to the proposition that the analogy of the shareholder in a joint stock company extends to a case in which the act complained of is not an act dealing with or directly affecting corporate property, but an act done in professed exercise of law-making powers exercisable in the interests of the public as a whole. In Bowes v. The City of Toronto[28] the action in the form in which it ultimately succeeded was an action by the municipality and the complaint was that certain city officials had made a profit out of business transacted for the municipality and for this they were compelled to account. McIlreith v. Hart[29] was a case of ultra vires payments to members of the council. I concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies, but I must admit I have always had my doubts about the decision.\nThere is, moreover, the observation of Lord Watson in Dech\u00e8ne v. City of Montreal[30], which, as I read it, affords an argument of considerable weight in favour of the respondents. In that case the appellant sought to attack the annual appropriation as illegal. The charter of Montreal as it then stood (37 Vict., ch. 51, amended by 42 & 43 Vict, ch. 53), gave a right to any municipal elector in his own name to impugn by-laws, resolutions and appropriations on the ground of illegality within a delay of three months. At pages 642 and 643, Lord Watson explicitly says for the Judicial Committee that in his view a municipal elector, as such, would have no title to atack the resolution even if incompetent except under the authority of this provision. The provisions of the charter then in force in relation to the qualification of voters seem to shew that all classes of persons qualified to vote would fall within the category of \u201cratepayers\u201d as that term is used in the charter of 1899. It would not be easy to reconcile the positions (1) that a voter (necessarily a ratepayer) has no status to attack even an incompetent resolution or by-law authorizing an appropriation except by special enactment, and (2) that a ratepayer as such has such a status even where the resolution or by-law does not directly affect the municipal property or impose a tax or rate.\nIt should be noted that this observation by Lord Watson was made in 1894 and that the present charter which is a revision and consolidation of the statutes relating to the City of Montreal was passed five years later. A comparison of the enactment under review by the Privy Council in 1894 in Dech\u00e8ne\u2019s Case[31], with section 304, which was substituted for it in the present charter, would hardly support a suggestion that the law as stated by Lord Watson had been intentionally changed. There is, therefore, some ground for saying that, having regard to the course of legislation and the discussion in the judgment referred to, section 304 ought not to be read as a regulation or a limitation of an existing right, but as conferring a new right which would not otherwise have existed even as regards incompetent resolutions dealing directly with corporate property.\nAs to the second ground, namely, that the council proceeded by resolution and not by by-law. If a bylaw was strictly required, the objection, assuming as it does the power to act by by-law, must, I think, be rejected on the additional ground that as the council may be assumed to have been ready to pass a by-law had they been advised that a by-law was necessary, and as the corporation itself as represented by the council stands by the resolution and the contract entered into pursuant to it the nature of the procedure followed by the council is not a matter in which the courts ought to interfere at the suit of an individual ratepayer. The resolution on this same assumption is not ultra vires in the sense of the rule which enables an individual shareholder to attack the ultra vires acts of a joint stock company. If the analogy of the shareholder is to be appealed to I can see no good reason why the principle of Foss v. Harbottle[32] should not be put into effect.\nI have had more difficulty with the third ground of objection, but I have come to the conclusion that, assuming the transaction otherwise competent, section 4 read together with these words of section 299, namely:\u2014\nIt shall be lawful to enact by-laws for all matters and things whatsoever that concern and effect or that may hereafter concern and effect the City of Montreal as a body politic and corporate\nand with the statute of 2 Geo. V., are sufficient to invest the municipality with authority to take shares in such a company as that in question here which are fully paid up and in respect of which the municipality can incur no liability on account of the conduct of the company\u2019s affairs. If it be said there is no by-law then that objection has just been answered. I reserve my opinion on the question whether assuming the taking of such shares to be ultra vires, the transaction would on that ground be open to attack at the instance of a ratepayer after the expiration of the delay prescribed by section 304.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014I am, with great respect, of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed.\nUnder the alleged authority of a by-law and of a subsequent resolution of its council, the corporation of the City of Montreal entered into a contract purporting to give to its co-defendant the Canadian Autobus Company, Ltd., an exclusive privilege to operate lines of autobusses on certain named streets in the city. The by-law prohibited the operation of lines of autobusses on any other of the city\u2019s streets on the ground that they were not suitable for such traffic. The effect, if the contract were valid, would be to confer a monopoly upon the respondent company.\nThe appellant, a ratepayer of the city, attacks the by-law, resolution and contract on the grounds that\n(1) The defendant corporation has not the power to grant such an exclusive privilege;\n(2) If the defendant corporation has that power, it can only be exercised by by-law;\n(3) The by-law in question does not purport to authorize a contract conferring such an exclusive privilege.\nThe status of the plaintiff to maintain this action as a ratepayer has been the subject of much controversy. The numerous authorities cited to us indicate some uncertainty on this question in the jurisprudence of Quebec. The proceedings of the municipal corporation are attacked in the present action not merely as being illegal, but as beyond its competence. I do not think that section 304 of the city charter (62 Vict., ch. 58), excludes any common law right of action which a ratepayer may have to prevent abuse of its powers by the municipal corporation of Montreal. (Compare 42 & 43 Vict, ch. 53, sec. 12; and see Dech\u00e8ne v. City of Montreal[33]; Comt\u00e9 d\u2019Athabasca v. Patoine[34]; Coriveau v. St. Valier[35]; Aubertin v. Ville de Maisonneuve[36]; Lennon v. Cit\u00e9 de Westmount[37]; and Farwell v. Corporation of Sherbrooke[38].) The weight of authority seems to me rather to favour the view that the ratepayer\u2019s interest is sufficient under article 77, C.P.Q.; Allard v. Ville de Saint-Pierre[39]; Tremblay v. City of Montreal[40]; Quay v. Corporation of Malbaie[41]; Jacob v. Cit\u00e9 de St. Henri[42]; and Trudel v. Gift of Hull[43]. No doubt there are not a few cases in which the contrary opinion has been expressed. Although the contract in question does not involve a direct expenditure of municipal funds, it deals with and ties up municipal property and the control of the city streets in a manner that may result in serious loss of revenue to the municipality in future years, and may thus materially affect to their detriment the interests of the ratepayers in the finances of the city. The case would, therefore, seem to fall within the ratio of the judgment in Paterson v. Bowes[44], and of the decision of this court in MacIlreith v. Hart[45], as stated in the judgment of Maclennan J.A., concurred in by my Lord, the Chief Justice, although it would have been more clearly within these authorities had the plaintiff sued on behalf of himself and all the other ratepayers and inhabitants of the city. See, too, Black v. Ellis[46]. But this objection to the form of action was not taken in the courts below or at bar in this court and should not at this stage be allowed to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim. I express this opinion in favour of the plaintiff\u2019s status with some hesitation induced by respect for my learned colleagues from the Province of Quebec, who hold the contrary view. I should, however, deem it a misfortune if such an action as this could not be maintained by a ratepayer. Having regard to the many difficulties in the way of securing intervention by Attorneys-General, a very useful, if not in many instances, the only practical safeguard- in this country against improper exercise of their powers by municipal corporations would be taken away.\nA careful examination of the provisions of the charter of Montreal has not disclosed to me anything in them which empowers the municipal council to confer such an exclusive privilege as that here in question. In this country the power to grant exclusive privileges on its public streets does not exist in a municipal corporation unless it is conferred by legislative authority, either expressly, or by necessary implication. Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5 ed.), pars. 1215-8, 1234, 1308; 28 Cyc. 874; see, also, Ottawa Electric Co. v. Hull Electric Co.[47]. This restriction is due to the public interest in the user of the streets and exists whether the ownership of the land they occupy is vested in the Crown, the riparian proprietors, or the municipality itself.\nThe subject of the licensing of autobus lines (art. 300, sub-sec. 137) and the granting of franchises and privileges (art. 299, item No. 17) having been expressly provided for in the charter of the City of Montreal, I rather incline to the view that art. 4650 (a) of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (7 Edw. VII., ch. 48), relied on by the respondents, is not applicable to such matters in that municipality. But, if it is, I fail to find in its terms warrant for the implication that the municipal corporation has the power to grant an exclusive privilege such as that under consideration, assuming it to be, as I think it may be deemed (at res magis valeat quam pereat), limited in duration to ten years notwithstanding the provisions of the seventeenth clause of the contract and their apparent conflict with the first clause.\nBy sub-section 137 of article 300 of the charter, the municipal council is empowered to license and regulate autobus traffic in the streets of the city. The impeached by-law was passed under that provision as appears upon its face. The by-law is general in its provisions. It provides for the licensing and regulating of autobus lines. Nothing in it purports to authorize the granting of any exclusive privilege. The subsequent resolution approving of the contract made between the respondents, in so far as that contract purports to hind the municipal corporation not to grant autobus privileges to any other autobus proprietor, is not based upon and cannot be supported by the by-law. Having regard to the provisions of articles 299 and 300 of the chapter, I have no doubt that, if the municipal corporation had power to grant such an exclusive privilege as the contract in question purports to confer, it could exercise that power only by by-law. There is nothing in the statutory provisions creating the Board of Control and defining its powers which dispenses with the necessity of a by-law in such a case. On the contrary, as I read those provisions, by article 21 of the Act of 62 Vict., ch. 51, as replaced by the statute 1 Geo. V., ch. 48, the requirement of a by-law in such a case is expressly continued.\nIt follows that, in my opinion, although the by-law is unobjectionable, the subsequent resolution authorizing the contract in question and that contract itself are ultra vires of the defendant corporation and should be set aside and vacated.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs throughout.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Deux questions se pr\u00e9sentent dans cette cause-ci: la premi\u00e8re est de savoir si le demandeur a un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour lui permettre d\u2019instituer la pr\u00e9sente poursuite; et par la seconde on soul\u00e8ve la validit\u00e9 de certaines ordonnances municipales et d\u2019un certain contrat.\nLa conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en suis venu sur la premi\u00e8re question, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire sur le droit de poursuite du demandeur, me dispense de discuter la seconde.\nLe demandeur veut faire annuler par action directe:\n1\u00b0.

Dans la cause actuelle le demandeur aurait pu proc\u00e9der par la voie exp\u00e9ditive de la requ\u00eate en cassation (motion to quash); mais il a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019action directe afin de contester en m\u00eame temps la r\u00e9solution et le contrat.\nJe consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour lui permettre de r\u00e9us.sir dans sa poursuite.\nIl ne d\u00e9montre pas qu\u2019il soit personnellement affect\u00e9 par le r\u00e8glement, la r\u00e9solution ou le contrat en question.\nIl avait d\u2019abord all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait actionnaire dans une compagnie rivale de celle qui a eu le privil\u00e8ge de faire circuler ses autobus mais lors de l\u2019audition devant nous il a abandonn\u00e9 ce point.\nSon int\u00e9r\u00eat est celui de tous les contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9.\nCette question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat a fait l\u2019objet de plusieurs d\u00e9cisions.\nNous avons d\u2019abord le Conseil Priv\u00e9 qui, dans les causes de Brown v. Gugy[48], et de Bell v. Cit\u00e9 de Quebec[49], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le droit d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire riverain de poursuivre pour des obstructions plac\u00e9es dans une rivi\u00e8re ne pourrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 qu\u2019au cas o\u00f9 il souffrirait des dommages sp\u00e9ciaux.\nIl est bien vrai qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une affaire municipale; mais la distinction est tout de m\u00eame faite entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat personel et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nEn 1879, dans une cause de Bourdon v. Benard[50], la cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le droit de faire dispara\u00eetre des obstructions et empi\u00e9tements sur les chemins appartient exclusivement aux municipalit\u00e9s et que les particuliers ne poss\u00e8dent pas ce droit d\u2019action \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne leur en r\u00e9sulte des dommages r\u00e9els et sp\u00e9ciaux.\nIn 1892, 1893 et 1894, le m\u00eame principle a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi par l\u2019Honorable juge Doherty, aujourd\u2019hui ministre de la justice, dans les causes de S\u00e9n\u00e9cal v. Edison Electric Go.[51], et de B\u00e9lair v. Maisonneuve[52], et par l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant Archibald dans la cause de Bird v. Merchants Telephone Co.[53].\nEn 1907, la Cour de Revision, compos\u00e9e des Honorables juges Tellier, Lafontaine et. Hutchison, a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de l\u2019Honorable juge Mathieu dans la cause de Emard v. Village du Boulevard St. Paul[54], qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019action en nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e9solution du conseil municipal ne peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e trente jours apr\u00e8s la mise en force de cette r\u00e9solution que par un contribuable ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct et sp\u00e9cial.\nEn 1909, dans la cause de Allard v. Ville de Saint Pierre[55], quatre honorables juges de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure se sont \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s sur cette question, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour de Revision \u00e9tant d\u2019opinion que tout contribuable peut demander par action directe la cassation d\u2019un r\u00e8glement ultra vires nonobstant le recours sp\u00e9cial par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9vu dans l\u2019acte.\nDans une cause de Aubertin v. La ville de Maisonneuve, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en 1905[56], les juges se sont aussi l\u00e0 \u00e9galement, divis\u00e9s sur la question de savoir si l\u2019action directe pouvait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e par un contribuable qui n\u2019avait pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial. Enfin dans la cause actuelle l\u2019hon. juge Lavergne, qui a rendu le jugement de la cour, dit dans ses notes que\u2014\nRobertson ne pouvait faire maintenir son action sans d\u00e9montrer un pr\u00e9judice personnel et sp\u00e9cial. Les moyens de nullit\u00e9 au d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 qu\u2019il pourrait peut-\u00eatre faire valoir comme requ\u00e9rant ne peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s par lui dans une instance ordinaire o\u00f9 il se porte demandeur.\nLa jurisprudence des cours provinciales dans ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es est donc assez incertaine.\nLes d\u00e9cisions du Conseil Priv\u00e9, que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9es plus haut, et de la cour d\u2019appel dans la cause de Bourdon v. Benard[57], d\u00e9montrent clairement que les droits d\u2019un particulier de poursuivre n\u2019existent en vertu de la loi que s\u2019il est personnellement et directement int\u00e9ress\u00e9.\nC\u2019est la principe suivi en France et je rel\u00e8ve da,ns Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, les passages suivants: Vo. action\nNo. 39. C\u2019est un principe fondamental qu\u2019on ne peut exercer une action qu\u2019en autant qu\u2019on y a int\u00e9r\u00eat. * * * L\u2019absence d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat exclut la recevabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019action.\nVo, Commune,\nNo. 505. Pendant longtemps le Conseil d\u2019Etat a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qu\u2019un contribuable n\u2019a pas en l\u2019absence de tout int\u00e9r\u00eat direct et personnel qualit\u00e9 pour demander au pr\u00e9fet de d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration.\nDalloz, 1887-3-72; Dalloz, 1889-3-68; Dalloz, 1892-5-128; Dalloz, 1902-3-33.\nMais des arr\u00eats plus r\u00e9cents ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un contribuable d\u2019une commune a int\u00e9r\u00eat en cette qualit\u00e9 de faire d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration par laquelle le conseil a inscrit une d\u00e9pense au budget de la commune.\nJe comprends la raison de ces arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents dont parle Dalloz. Le contribuable a un int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel \u00e0 ce que le budget d\u2019une municipalit\u00e9 ne soit pas ill\u00e9galement augment\u00e9 parce qu\u2019alors il sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer un plus fort montant de taxes.\nAu No. 506 Dalloz, vo. Commune, ajoute qu\u2019:\u2014\nUn contribuable n\u2019est pas recevable \u00e0 demander que les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9rection d\u2019une statue et \u00e0 la d\u00e9nomination d\u2019une rue soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es nulles alors qu\u2019il ne justifie d\u2019aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel et que les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations attaqu\u00e9es n\u2019engagent pas les finances municipales.\nLe droit pour un contribuable de demander l\u2019annulation d\u2019ordonnances municipales sort des bornes ordinaires de la loi commune.\nOn ne peut avoir recours aux tribunaux en principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que pour la conservation de nos droits personnels. Mais dans le cas d\u2019une demande en cassation de r\u00e8glements municipaux, le contribuable exerce une action populaire et s\u2019il r\u00e9ussit ils seront cass\u00e9s et annul\u00e9s non-seulement quant \u00e0 lui mais aussi quant \u00e0 tous les autres contribuables. On plaide alors non-seulement pour soi-m\u00eame mais aussi pour autrui. Il est d\u2019ordre public que ce droit de poursuite ne soit exerc\u00e9 que conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles prescrites par la loi qui l\u2019a cr\u00e9\u00e9.\nOn dira peut-\u00eatre que ces restrictions pourraient avoir pour effet de faire perdre aux tribunaux le contr\u00f4le que l\u2019art. 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure leur donne sur les corps municipaux.\nCette objection ne saurait \u00eatre fond\u00e9e car si une corporation municipale adoptait une r\u00e9solution ou\u2019ex\u00e9cutait un contrat enti\u00e8rement ultra vires le contribuable pourrait alors avoir recours au Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral sous l\u2019article 978, C.P.Q., pour avoir un redressement de ses griefs.\nPour toutes ces raisons j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le demandeur n\u2019avait pas le droit dans les cir- constances de prendre une action directe. Son appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Genest, Billette & Plimsol\nSolicitors for the City of Montreal, respondent: Laurendeau, Archambault, Lavall\u00e9e, Damphousse, Jarry, Butler & Saint-Pierre.\nSolicitors for the Canadian Autohus Co., respondent: Bisaillon, Bisaillon & Pepin.\n[1] Q.R. 23 K.B. 338.\n[2] (1915) A.C. 550.\n[3] 101 U.S.R. 601, at p. 609.\n[4] (1915) A.C. 550.\n[5] 4 Ch.

C.R. 252), Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that in order to determine such a lease it is essential that the cancellation should be effected by a notice in writing from the Minister which actually reaches the lessee.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014The notice should declare the intention of the Minister to make the cancellation on account of breach of the conditions, and the lessee should be given an opportunity to remedy the breach in question or, at least, to be heard before forfeiture. No proposed cancellation can be effective against the lessee unless such a notice has been given to him before the forfeiture is declared.\nPer Duff J.\u2014In the absence of special authority, solicitors employed by the lessee in respect of his business with the Department cannot be deemed agents to whom such notice of cancellation could be given on his behalf.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Section 6 of the regulations has not the effect, upon default in performance of the nominated conditions, of terminating the lessee\u2019s interest ipso jure, but only on the election of the Crown manifested as provided for in the lease. Davenport v. The Queen (3 App. Cas. 115) applied.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The lease in question was determinable at the election of the Crown upon the mere fact of breach of conditions and, the Crown having so elected, the Minister was not competent to revive it or to waive the consequences of default.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014By notification to his solicitors and the effect of the correspondence with the Department, which took place thereafter, it must be taken that the lessee had actual notice of the intention of the Minister to cancel the lease for breach of conditions.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] whereby it was declared that a certain lease by the Crown to the defendant, of mining lands in the Province of Alberta was properly forfeited and cancelled.\nThe circumstances of the case fully appear in the judgments now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and J. F. Smellie for the appellant.\nR. G Code K.C. for the respondent, His Majesty The King.\nLafleur K.C. and Falconer K.C. for the respondents, The International Coal and Coke Company.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant obtained from the Crown a mining lease dated the 8th August, 1904, of coal under Dominion Lands in the then Provisional District of Alberta. He did not fulfil the conditions of the lease. It is unnecessary to enter into the correspondence between the parties which ensued until we come to the letter addressed on the 13th September, 1909, by the assistant-secretary of the Department of the Interior to the lessee, the present appellant. That letter is as follows:\u2014\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, 13th September, 1909.\nSir,\u2014I am directed to inform you that as you have failed to comply with the provisions of clause 12 of your lease for coal mining purposes of the east half of section 29, township 7, range 4, west of the 5th meridian, by commencing active mining operations on the land within the time required by the said section of the lease, the Department has been obliged to cancel your lease, and it will, therefore, now make such other disposition of the land as may seem advisable.\nI am to add that a refund cheque for $96 paid by your solicitors, Messrs. Lewis & Smellie, as rental for the year ending the 15th July next, will be forwarded to them on your behalf in the course of a day or two.\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) L. Pereira,\nAssistant-Secretary.\nPaul A. Paulson, Esq.,\nColeman, Alberta.\nThe envelope containing this letter was addressed in the same way as the letter itself. It appears to have remained in the post-office of the Town of Coleman some two months and was then returned from the dead letter office marked \u201cno address \u2014 not called for.\u201d\nThis communication was no doubt intended to be a notice pursuant to the 16th and 17th conditions in the lease, which are as follows:\u2014\n16. That any notice, demand, or other communication which His Majesty or the Minister may require or desire to give or serve upon the lessee, may be validly given or served by the secretary or the assistant-secretary of the Department of the Interior.\n17. That in case of default in payment of the said rent or royalty for six months after the same should have been paid or in case of the breach or non-observance or non-performance on the part of the lessee of any proviso, condition, term, restriction or stipulation herein contained and which ought to be observed or performed by the said lessee and which has not been waived by the said Minister, the Minister may cancel these presents by written notice to the said lessee and, thereupon, the same and everything therein contained shall become and be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever and it shall be lawful for His Majesty or His Successors or assigns into and upon the said demised premises (or any part thereof in the name of the whole) to re-enter and the same to have again, re-possess and enjoy as of His or their former estate therein anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding.\nProvided nevertheless that in case of such cancellation and reentry the lessee shall be liable to pay and His Majesty, His Successors or Assigns shall have the same remedies for the recovery of any rent or royalty then due or accruing due as if these presents had not been cancelled but remained in full force and effect.\nThe notice was incompetent to cancel the lease for two reasons:\u2014\n1. It was not such a notice as is called for by condition 17.\n2. It was not given to nor served on the lessee.\nAs to the first reason, it would be necessary, in order to hold the notice of any validity, that the condition should be construed to mean that the Minister may cancel the lease, but must then give notice to the lessee that he has done so. This is in terms what the letter of the 13th September, 1909, does. There can be no doubt that this is not such a notice as is called for. The notice must be to the effect that it is the intention of the Minister to cancel the lease for breach of the conditions of the lease, thus giving the lessee an opportunity of remedying the breach or at any rate of being heard before his lease is forfeited. There can be no object in a notice that the lease has been already irrevocably cancelled without notice. In the most extreme view, the notice should state that the Minister cancels the lease for breach of condition and not that he had already done so without notice which he had no power to do.\nIt has been represented to us that the provision for re-entry was a cumulative requirement for putting an end to the lease; there can be no doubt that frequently in leases the proviso for re-entry stipulates that notice shall be given before a forfeiture is enforced.\nThe courts lean against a forfeiture and a condition like this should be strictly construed. It is most reasonable to suppose that notice should be given before the forfeiture is enforced because the power to cancel the lease by notice only arises on breach of any of the conditions. If there had been no breach of condition a notice could not have rendered the lease void and there would, therefore, be uncertainty whether the lease was still subsisting or not.\nThe Imperial statute, 44 & 45 Vict. ch. 41 (\u201cThe Conveyancing Act, 1881\u201d), provides by section 14, subsection 1, as follows:\u2014\nA right of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso or stipulation in a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in the lease, shall not be enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless and until the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach complained of, and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach, and in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the breach.\nA similar provision is to be found in the Ontario statute (R.S.O., ch. 155, sec. 20(2)) and perhaps in the statutes of others of the provinces.\nSecondly, the notice such as it was, was neither given nor served on the lessee. It was simply mailed to him at the Town of Coleman and, as he did not happen to inquire at the post-office if there was such a notice there for him, which he was certainly not bound to do, it never came to his hands at all.\nWhatever the effect of a proper notice would have been, this notice was clearly insufficient for any purpose.\nThe next document calling for attention is the letter of the 28th January, 1910, addressed by the secretary of the Department of the Interior to the lessee\u2019s solicitors. It is as follows:\u2014\nOttawa, 28th January, 1910.\nGentlemen,\u2014With further reference to the Departmental letter of the 11th instant, I. am directed to say that, in view of your representations, it has been decided to reinstate the lease in favour of Mr. Paul Paulson for the coal-mining rights of the east-half of section 29, township 7, range 4, west of the 5th meridian.\nThe re-instatement is, however, granted on the express condition that Mr. Paulson will fyle evidence in the Department, shewing the nature and progress of the work it is understood he has now commenced on the land, giving full particulars as to the extent and depth of the shaft, as well as the necessary works connected therewith.\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) P. G. Keyes,\nSecretary.\nMessers. Lewis & Smellie,\nBarristers,\n7 Trust Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThis letter was written on the erroneous assumption that the lease had been cancelled, but that it was in the power of the lessor to allow it to hold good, as the letter says, to reinstate the lease.\nIt is clear that, if the lessor was willing to continue the lease notwithstanding the breaches of condition, he must be taken, on the true fact that the lease was still existing, to have consented to waive the forfeiture of the lease for breach of condition. This waiver disposes of any necessity for inquiring into the question whether the subsequent lease of the 28th June, 1910, to the International Coal and Coke Co., Ltd., constituted a sufficient re-entry by the lessor. Having waived the breaches of condition the lessor had no right to re-enter for a forfeiture.\nI desire to add that I concur in what I understand was the view of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that the remedy pursued by the Crown in this case was entirely unsuitable.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the information of the Attorney-General dismissed. The defendant Paulson is entitled to be paid by the Crown his costs of the action and of this appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is a remarkable case. The appellant so long ago as 8th August, 1904, obtained from the Crown a coal-mining lease or licence over half a section of school lands held by the Crown. The lease or licence professed on its face to be pursuant to and in conformity with a statute providing for the administration of such school lands, and the regulations made thereunder, of which latter the sixth is as follows:\u2014\n6. Failure to commence active operations within one year and to work the mine within two years after commencement of the term of the lease, or to pay the ground rent or royalty as before provided shall subject the lessee to the forfeiture of the lease and to resumption of the land by the Crown.\nThe regulations provided that such a lessee should pay in half-yearly payments thirty cents an acre annually and in addition a royalty of ten cents per ton on all coal taken out of the mine and furnish sworn statements relative thereto. No less than 160 acres, nor more than 640 acres, could be leased under said regulations to one person.\nThe appellant, when this case was tried in December, 1913, had never mined on said land a pound of coal. It is admitted, or at all events alleged and not denied, that any coal existent within the area in question is at least two thousand feet below the surface and thus, in competition with that more easily available, commercially speaking, an impossibility.\nOn the 30th April, 1906, the secretary of the Department having the matter in charge wrote appellant calling his attention to the regulation above quoted, and copying it for him to read, and reminding him that the Department had no evidence that he had commenced active mining operations on the land in question and that the year within which the clause in question required active operations to be commenced had expired on the 1st August then last.\nThis was answered by his solicitors in a letter of the 18th of May, 1906, quoting instructions from him as follows:\u2014\nReferring to your letter of the 30th April last addressed to Mr. Paul A. Paulson, we have to-day received a letter from Mr. Paulson, which we submit explains the situation. In part Mr. Paulson\u2019s letter to us reads as follows:\u2014\n\u201cEnclosed please find a letter which I have just received from the Department of the Interior, relating to the mining of coal on the east half of section 29, township 7, range 4, west of 5th meridian.\n\u201cWill you be good enough to go to the Department for me and explain to them that I was the original purchaser of a lot of coal land adjoining this half-section, which has been transferred to the International Coal and Coke Company, in which company I am a large stockholder; that coal is being mined on the land to the north of section 29, and that the tunnels are being steadily extended southward toward this land, and that all coal unerlying section 29 will have to be mined through the tunnels now being pushed forward to the south toward section 29 by the International C. & C. Co. The coal, under section 29, cannot be mined or gotten out any other way, except by the tunnels above referred to, and these tunnels will tap the coal seam in section 29 at great depth. As a matter of fact there are no outcrops of coal on section 29, and it is many hundred feet underlying the surface of that section. The outcroppings are all on section 28, to the east of section 29. When the present tunnels are extended to the north limits of section 29, the coal on it will be mined and come through the tunnels 2\u00bd miles to the International Company\u2019s works on the railway in section 8, township 8, range 4, west of 5th. I trust there will be no trouble about this, and that the Department does not intend to force me to mine the coal just now, when it is impracticable to do so.\nUpon this he was given an extension of time to 1st August, 1907.\nOn the 21st of August, 1907, his solicitors were reminded of this extension and told\nso far no advice has been received of the mining operations having been commenced.\nOn the 4th of September, 1907, his solicitors wrote the secretary of the Department explaining the slow progress of tunnels for other mines likely to reach this land and need of another year\u2019s extension for appellant.\nIn this letter they say:\u2014\nIt is absolutely impossible to mine the coal from this section until the tunnels reach it from the north, as all the coal has to come through these tunnels to the railway.\nOn the 28th September, 1907, the secretary answered:\u2014\nI beg to say that before the extension asked for can be granted it will be necessary to file here a definite statement by the applicant as to the extent of the operations already undertaken and the expenditure incured so far in developing the mines from which these lands will be reached.\nTo this they reply on the 15th October, 1907, as following extract shews:\u2014\nThe International Coal and Coke Company which owns the coal lands to the north, south and east of the above half-section, have approximately spent $1,000,000 and upwards in the development and improvement of its property, and are now engaged in running tunnels from the north in the southerly direction toward the above-mentioned half-section.\nThe said tunnels were started from section 8, township 8, range 4, W. 5th, and extended through section 5 into sections 32 and 33, 7-4. and will in due time be extended into the east half of section 29.\nOn the 25th November, 1907, in view of the representations so made, appellant was granted an extension to the 1st February, 1909.\nOn the 27th November, 1908, the respondent company applied for a mining lease of the land in question and were told by letter of 14th December, 1908, that the application could not be entertained as the land was under lease to appellant for coal mining.\nOn the 11th March, 1909, the appellant\u2019s solicitors wrote reciting part of the foregoing and reiterating the story of the respondent company having expended a million dollars and its tunnels being needed to enable mining on land in question.\nThey parenthetically remark as follows:\u2014\n(Mr. Paulson was the original owner of the properties owned by the company and is now a large holder of its shares.)\nAnd they state further as follows:\u2014\nThe coal from the east half of 29 would have to be hauled through the above mentioned tunnels down to the railway on section 8-8-4.\nThey conclude by asking an extension to 15th July, 1909.\nOn 9th March, 1909, the manager of the respondent company writes the Minister pointing out that appellant\u2019s lease has existed for years and nothing has been done thereunder to fulfil the conditions; that there is no work done on the land and that it is located right in the centre of the company\u2019s property and is being held solely with the object of holding us up for a bonus or for royalty on the coal we might at any time make arrangements to mine therefrom.\nHe further pointed out that the company were working in the next section adjacent to this land in question and will have to go through it to reach sections 28, 21 and 16 of same township and range, and asks, under these conditions, if the lease now in question cannot be cancelled and the company\u2019s application for a lease thereof reconsidered. He explained appellant had no other land in the vicinity and recognizes that if he had there might be a legitimate excuse and assumes the Minister\u2019s investigation will shew appellant has none.\nThe Minister replies promising an investigation.\nThe secretary then answers the solicitor\u2019s letter of 11th March informing them an inspector has been instructed to visit the land and report fully.\nOn the 14th July, 1909, he wrote to the solicitors of appellant acknowledging receipt of a cheque to cover rental for year ending 15th July, 1910, and in forms them it is only\naccepted conditionally pending a decision in regard to the extension of time asked for by Mr. Paulson, which cannot be settled until the Minister\u2019s return.\nI enclose receipt No. 20239 for $96.\nIt may be observed this was tender of rent for a year in advance not yet due.\nOn 13th September, 1909, the assistant-secretary writes the appellant\u2019s solicitors that\nin view of the inspector\u2019s report in the matter, and after careful consideration of the circumstances, it has been decided that it would not be in the public interest nor in that of the School Lands Endowment Fund to grant Mr. Paulson the extension asked for, and I am, therefore, to inform you that he is being advised that his lease for coal mining purpose of this half section has been cancelled. The Department will now make such other disposition of the land as may seem advisable.\nA refund cheque will be forwarded to you within the course of a day or two in favour of Mr. Paulson for $96 paid as rental for the current year ending the 15th July, 1910, which, as you were advised by letter of the 14th July, was only accepted conditionally.\nThe appellant was notified accordingly by letter directed to same address as a former one (evidently received), but it was returned as uncalled for.\nIt is quite clear from the foregoing recital of the facts that the appellant never intended to do any mining on the lands in question except by means of using the tunnels which the respondent company was making and did make; that he hoped by means of his influence as a leading shareholder therein to acquire the right to use the said tunnels; that he obtained such extensions as he got by representations relative thereto; that the mining of coal under said lands otherwise was as he instructed his solicitors to represent, and they on his behalf did represent, to the officers of the Crown, an impossibility; that assurances thus given and the expectations thus raised of his acquiring the right to use such tunnels, was the only reason why his long continuing defaults in complying with not only the terms of the lease, but also the obvious scope and purpose of the statute, and regulations by which all within the lease must be governed, was tolerated; that but for those representations and consequent expectations the neglect of the Minister in charge to declare the lease forfeited and recover possession would have been such a disregard of the duty cast upon him by the statute and regulations as to render his doing so unjustifiable; and that the attempt of appellant to maintain on foot the said lease was not with the expectation of developing, as the interests of the Crown demanded, a profitable mine productive of coal, and the consequent production of revenue to be derived therefrom for the support of schools, and all implied therein, but for the unworthy purpose of making merchandise of the lease itself at the expense of his fellow shareholders in respondent company and of the Crown; unless, indeed, his representations are to be taken as false, which it does not lie in his mouth now to set up.\nIt seems, however, that despite the reiterated statement by the secretary of the Department so late as 11th January, 1910, of adherence to the forfeiture of the lease and its termination thereby, the Department unfortunately was induced to write appellant\u2019s solicitors a letter of 28th January, 1910, that in view of their representations it had been decided to reinstate the lease in favour of appellant. But even that concludes as follows:\u2014\nThe reinstatement is, however, granted on the express condition that Mr. Paulson will fyle evidence in the Department, shewing the nature and progress of the work it is understood he has now commenced on the land, giving full particulars as to the extent and depth of the shaft, as well as the necessary works connected therewith.\nThis, I admit, is somewhat ambiguous, but must be read in light of the solicitors\u2019 letter of the 21st January, 1910, which induced that of the 28th just now referred to as a reply thereto.\nIt is as follows:\u2014\nReferring to the correspondence and interviews between yourself and our Mr. Smellie, we now beg to inform you that Mr. P. A. Paulson, the lessee of the east half of section 29, township 7, range 4, west of the 5th principal meridian, in the Province of Alberta, under Departmental lease No. 3, reference No. 730,279, dated 8th August, 1904, having endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a further extension of time, has commenced active operations on the land and has started mining on the property. We are instructed that Mr. Paulson is sinking his shaft from the surface with all possible speed. I take it to refer to operations between August and the said date.\nSo read any one in the position of the Minister would have expected to have heard from the appellant with a report of what, up to the 28th of January, had been done, shewing something to justify the reinstatement.\nNothing came so far as I can find till after the 14th of April when the same solicitors are told by a letter from the secretary that the law officers of the Crown had advised that it was not within the competence of the Minister of the Interior to revive the lease which was properly cancelled for non-compliance with the conditions, and refusing to consider his application therefor.\nThe appellant relies upon the conditional acceptance of rent which was returned and the foregoing conditional reinstatement as an answer to the forfeiture of the lease which the learned trial judge finds as a fact took place within the terms thereof.\nWith the reasons he assigns for so holding I agree and need not repeat same here.\nHowever, if there be any doubt as to the correctness of his findings resting upon the lease alone as such, I think a full consideration of the provisions of the statute and of the regulations thereunder which are themselves of statutory force and effect, must lead to the conclusion that under same the Minister in charge of the trust thus created for school purposes was given authority only to grant such leases as contemplated thereby.\nIf the lease and its provisions carry in them such pitfalls as the elaborate argument addressed to us implies, it was not, I submit, in conformity with the scope and purpose of the statute and regulations.\nIn so far as the lease and implications therein conflict with the due operation of the statute, and the regulations pursuant to which it purports to have been made and beyond which it cannot be extended either by its terms or implications resting on the language used the statutory authority must prevail.\nI cannot read the statute and regulations as being capable of permitting such consequences as implied in the argument supporting an appellant whose whole course of conduct as evidenced in the facts and circumstances which I have outlined above was productive of the nullification thereof.\nTo do so would, I submit, frustrate the purposes of the statute and that which set apart these school land sections for administration for the public trust created in support of education.\nIt has been also argued that the lease so called is but a licence and the cases of Roberts v. Devey[2]; Doe d. Bryan v. Bancks[3], are relied upon. In addition thereto the cases of James v. Young[4], In re Brain[5], and the remarks of Sir Montague Smith in delivering the judgment in the case of The Attorney-General of Victoria v. Ettershank[6], at page 371, would seem to indicate a mining lease, so called, may be considered from a different point of view from ordinary leases in regard to the application of the law governing same.\nThe latter case was brought to my notice by my brother Duff, since the argument, as having relation to the question I had raised in argument and have just re-stated above relative to the statute governing the right of the parties rather than what by acts or language they had expressed when acting under a statute. The matter has not been fully argued from either point of view.\nI, therefore, content myself with stating what I conceive to be law which cannot be got rid of in the way attempted herein.\nOf course, I recognize that there must be on the part of the Crown an election to repudiate and a repudiation of the appellant\u2019s rights, but deny more is needed under this statute and that it has not incorporated therein the technical doctrines as to re-entry and all implied therein.\nThat repudiation was clearly and effectually made and a judicial declaration thereof and effects to be given it under the statute is all that is involved in the decision appealed from.\nThe case of Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[7], relied upon in appellant\u2019s factum, but not pressed in argument, turned upon a statute which expressly required a judicial decision on the part of the Minister and hence is clearly distinguishable.\nI may add also that appellant has put himself beyond the pale of these cases relied upon, which entitle a lessee to be relieved against forfeiture.\nIf he has any right to be indemnified for expenditure incurred in reliance upon the apparently inadvertent suggestion of reinstatement he may have some right, upon which I express no opinion, to assert in another way than he attempts herein.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014In my view of this appeal two questions only require discussion. One of these was raised, I think, for the first time during the course of the argument and touches the construction of the order-in-council under the authority of which the appellant\u2019s lease purports to be granted. The suggested construction which, if adopted, would be conclusive against the appeal is not consistent with the interpretation followed by the department charged with the administration of the lands affected by the order-in-council and the working of the order-in-council itself; but nevertheless it must be considered.\nThe exact point is this:\u2014Has section 6 of the order-in-council the effect of causing the lessee\u2019s interest to come automatically to a termination, without the exercise of any election on behalf of the Crown, on failure to perform any of the conditions thereby prescribed, namely: (1) the commencing of active mining operations on the demised property within one year after the commencement of the term, or (2) the working of a mine or mines within two years after that date, or (3) the payment of the reserved ground rent or royalty?\nThe words of the section are as follows:\u2014\nFailure to commence active operations within one year and to Work the mine within two years after the commencement of the term of the lease, or to pay the ground rent or royalty as before provided, shall subject the lessee to the forfeiture of the lease and to resumption of the land by the Crown.\nDoes this section merely vest in the Crown the right, at its election, to free its title from the lessee\u2019s interest on default of performance of the nominated conditions; or, does it operate on such default to terminate that interest ipso jure irrespective and independently of any election on behalf of the Crown? The question is a question of construction simply. There can be no doubt that under section 47 of the \u201cDominion Lands Act\u201d the Governor-in-Council has power to pass a regulation having the force and operation of statute and having the meaning it is now suggested Ave should ascribe to section 6. The question is:\u2014 What is the meaning of section 6? In examining that question it will be convenient to apply some of the usual aids to construction\u2014the traditional interpretation of similar provisions by the courts, the language and the tenor of the order-in-council as a whole, the administrative interpretation of this order-in-council and of similar regulations passed by the Governor-in-Council under the authority of the \u201cDominion Lands Act,\u201d and providing schemes for the administration of various classes of public land by the same Department, the Department of the Interior.\nThe manner in which the courts have dealt with such provisions, whether found in contracts or in statutes, is described by a very eminent judge in the following passages taken from a judgment of final authority. (Sir Montague Smith speaking for the Privy Council in Davenport v. The Queen[8], at pages 128, 129 and 130.)\nIn a long series of decisions the courts have construed clauses of forfeiture in leases declaring in terms, however clear and strong, that they shall be void on breach of conditions by the lessees, to mean that they are voidable only at the option of the lessors. The same, rule of construction has been applied to other contracts where a party bound by a condition has sought to take advantage of his own breach of it to annul the contract: see Doe v. Bancks[9]; Roberts v. Davey[10], and other cases in the notes to Dumpor\u2019s Case[11].\nIn Roberts v. Davey10 the words were that the licence \u201cshould cease, determine, and be utterly void and of no effect to all intents and purposes.\u201d As far, therefore, as language is concerned, it was stronger in that case than in the present.\nIt is, however, contended that this rule of construction is inapplicable when the legislature has imposed a condition. But in many cases the language of statutes, even when public interests are affected, has been similarly modified. Thus, where the statute provided that if the purchaser at an auction refused to pay the auction duty, his bidding \u201cshould be null and void to all intent\u2019s and purposes,\u201d it was decided that the bidding was void only at the option of the seller, though the object of the Act was to protect the revenue. In that case Mr. Justice Coltman said: \u201cIt is so contrary to justice that a party should avoid his own contract by his own wrong that, unless constrained, we should not adopt a construction favourable to such a view.\u201d Malins v. Freeman[12].\nThere is no doubt that the scope and purpose of an enactment or contract may be so opposed to this rule of construction that it ought not to prevail, but the intention to exclude it should be clearly established.\nThe question arises in this, as in all similar cases, whether it could have been intended that the lessee should be allowed to take advantage of his own breach of condition, or, as it is termed, of his own wrong, as an answer to a claim of the Crown for rent accruing subsequently to the first year of his tenancy. The effect of holding that the lessee himself might insist that his lease was void, would, of course, be to allow him to escape by his own default from a bad bargain, if he had made one. It would deprive the Crown of the right to the future rents, although circumstances might exist in which it would be more to the interest of the Crown, representing the colony, to obtain the money than to re-possess the land, as, indeed, in the present case, it was thought to be.\nSee also Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[13].\nSuch being the way in which the courts have looked at similar provisions, is it capable of being \u201cclearly established\u201d that the intention of section 6 was to exclude this \u201crule of construction,\u201d as Sir Montague Smith calls it? The order-in-council provides for the \u201cissue\u201d of \u201cleases\u201d and it is indisputable that the word \u201clease,\u201d as designating an instrument creating a term of years in the public lands, \u201cissued\u201d by the Department of the Interior, means, in common understanding and usage, a contractual instrument recording in the form of contractual stipulations\u2014covenants, provisoes for re-entry and the like\u2014the terms of the agreement between the Crown and the lessee by which their reciprocal rights and obligations are to be governed touching the subject-matter of the lease. The phraseology of section 6 contains nothing to suggest that the section was framed with a view to excluding the ordinary rule of construction. \u201cShall subject the lessee to the forfeiture of the lease,\u201d while certainly not unambiguous points rather to a penalty exigible from the lessee at the will of the lessor rather than to a consequence decreed by the law itself independently of the will or choice of either. The words \u201cresumption of the land by the Crown\u201d even, less disputably seem to point in the same direction.\nAmbiguity in such instruments as this order-in-council entitles us by the settled practice of the British and American courts to seek the assistance of any settled administrative interpretation which is clear and unmistakable m its effect for arriving at the more probable intention of the authors of the law. The only actual evidence now formally before us as to administrative interpretation is the lease itself upon which the proceedings are taken coupled with the conduct of the Minister and the Department of the Interior and the attitude of the Crown in the course of this litigation; but there can be no shadow of question that, down to the moment of the hearing of the appeal, the construction of section 6, upon which the Government has deliberately acted, as regards the matter now under discussion, is the construction for which the appellant contends.\nIt is common knowledge that the \u201crule of construction\u201d of Davenport v. The Queen[14] has usually governed the departmental construction of similar regulations.\nI think the proper conclusion is that the lease contemplated by the order-in-council is a contractual instrument and that the form of covenant made use of for the purpose of binding the lessee in the lease before us to perform the conditions of section 6 and the clause of forfeiture employed for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of section 6 are proper clauses to which it was within the power of the Minister to assent and that the reciprocal rights and duties of the Crown and the lessee in respect of the matters to which these clauses relate are in this litigation to be determined by giving effect to the clauses according to their proper construction as stipulations in an instrument inter partes.\nI do not find it necessary to decide the question raised by the learned Judge of the Exchequer Court whether or not the phrase \u201cexcused from so doing by the Minister,\u201d in the 12th clause of the lease, applies to the covenants to commence active operations within a year and to work a mine within two years. There is no doubt much could be said in favour of the view of the learned judge, if I may say so respectfully. But the acceptance of that view must, I think, lead to the dismissal of the information for this reason. The judgment of Lord Cozens-Hardy M.R. in Stephens v. Junior Army and Navy Stores[15], cited at length in the factum of Mr. Smellie, is a sufficient authority for holding that the covenant to commence operations within a year and to work a mine or mines within two years (which I take to mean to open a mine or mines within two years) is not a continuing covenant but a covenant that can only be broken once, and consequently that a waiver of the right of forfeiture (which undeniably took place) arising from the breach of this covenant was an election by the Crown not to avail itself of that right, which election once made, of course, is final.\nAs to the covenant to continue to work any opened mine\u2014that obviously only comes into effect upon a mine being opened; and the waiver of the forfeiture, or rather the election not to exercise the right of forfeiture accruing for non-performance of the first two mentioned covenants, necessarily imports, or rather necessarily is, an election against exercising that right in respect of any breach of any of the covenants expressed in the clause. The only suggestion that could be made against this view, the suggestion, namely, that a covenant to work continuously any mine or mines that might be operated implies a general covenant to open mines. That suggestion is negatived in the decision referred to as putting forward an interpretation of the clause which is far fetched and unreasonable. I am not satisfied that this conclusion as to the consequences of the waiver of forfeiture arising from the breach of the first two covenants in clause 12\u2014a conclusion difficult to escape if we accept the learned judge\u2019s construction\u2014would rest upon quite so satisfactory a foundation under the construction put upon that clause by the appellant; but I shall not consider this point further, it being unnecessary to do so in consequence of the opinion I have formed that the right of cancellation vested in the Minister by the provisions of the lease has not in fact been effectively exercised.\nThe clause (17) is in the following terms:\u2014\nThat in case of default in payment of the said rent or royalty for six months after the same should have been paid or in case of the breach or the non-observance or non-performance on the part of the lessee of any proviso, condition term, restriction or stipulation therein contained and which ought to be observed or performed by the said lessee and which has not been waived by the said Minister, the Minister may cancel these presents by written notice to the said lessee and, thereupon, the same and everything herein contained shall become and be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever and it shall be lawful for His Majesty or His Succesors or Assigns into and upon the said demised premises (or any part thereof in the name of the whole) to re-enter and the same to have again, re-possess and enjoy as of His or their former estate therein anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.\nProvided, nevertheless, that in case of such cancellation and reentry the lessee shall continue to be liable to pay and His Majesty, His Successors or Assigns shall have the same remedies for the recovery of any rent or royalty then due or accruing due as if these presents had not been cancelled, but remained in full force and effect.\nThe acts upon which the Attorney-General relies as constituting the exercise of the power of cancellation given by this clause are set out in paragraph 4 of the information, which is as follows:\u2014\nThat the Minister, by memorandum, under date of September 1st, 1909, directed the cancellation of the said lease and pursuant to such direction, the assistant-secretary of the said Interior Department, on September 13th, 1909, by letter addressed to said defendant, Paulson, advised said defendant, Paulson, that he (Paulson) having failed to comply with the provisoes of clause twelve (12) of said lease, the Department had been obliged to cancel his said lease, to which memorandum and letter the plaintiff will on trial hereof crave leave to refer.\nThe letter there referred to admittedly in fact never reached Paulson, and that it should reach him, was, I think, essential to its taking effect as a cancellation. The words\nthe Minister may cancel these presents by written notice to the said lessee and, thereupon, the same and everything therein contained shall become and be absolutely null and void,\nimport a written notice to the lessee as a condition of the valid exercise of the forfeiture as, indeed, the mode appointed exclusively for exercising it. It required no argument to shew that the paper deposited in the post-office, addressed to the lessee but not received by him, cannot be treated as a written notice within either the letter or the spirit of this stipulation. The learned trial judge appears to have thought that a letter addressed to the lessee\u2019s solicitors and admittedly received by them informing them that the Minister had by notice to Paulson cancelled the lease was either by itself sufficient to satisfy the condition or that, as supplementing the letter addressed to Paulson, it completed and perfected the notice thereby initiated.\nWith great respect, to my mind, this reasoning is not convincing. In the first place there is no allegation in the pleadings that the gentlemen who, in their capacity as solicitors, were conducting a correspondence with the Department of the Interior on behalf of the appellant in relation to this lease, had any authority to receive notice under clause 17 as agents for the appellant. It hardly requires authority to shew that the fact that they were employed in this non-litigious business did not necessarily in itself invest them with such capacity.\nIn the next place the letter does not profess to be sent on behalf of Minister and in exercise of the power reserved to him by clause 17 and, indeed, evidently was not so sent. It was, therefore, neither actually nor constructively a notice of cancellation by the Minister, and it cannot be regarded as constituting any essential element of such a notice. Then, if it had been intended to rely upon the correspondence which subsequently passed as constituting notice within the clause, the information should have been framed in such a way as to apprise the appellant that such was the case he would have to meet at the trial. In the absence of anything of the kind in the pleadings, the Crown could only take such a position if it were clear that all the facts were before us so that the appellant could not be prejudiced by the frame of the allegations in the pleading. After analyzing the correspondence I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that there is no evidence entitling us to say judicially that the conditions of the forfeiture clause were complied with in respect of written notice. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the other points raised in the argument presenting, what appeared to me upon superficial examination of them only, rather formidable difficulties in the way of the Attorney-General\u2019s success, I pass no opinion upon them.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the information dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The regulations (11th June, 1902) empower the Minister of the Interior to make leases of school lands for coal-mining purposes, and provide that failure of the lessee to commence active operations within one year and to work the mine within two years shall subject him to forfeiture of his lease. The lessee clearly made default. Under the regulations his lease, thereupon, became not ipso facto void, but voidable. The lease itself provided that upon default under the regulations\nthe Minister may cancel these presents by written notice to the lessee.\nThere is nothing in this provision inconsistent with the regulations. It was within the power of the Minister, to whom the statute (R.S.C. 1886, ch. 54, sec. 24) entrusted the administration of the school lands, to stipulate as to the manner in which the power of cancellation vested in him by the regulations should be exercised.\nProfessedly in the exercise of the power conferred by the provision of the lease, a letter from the Department of the Interior, dated the 13th September, 1909, signed by \u201cL. Pereira, assistant-secretary,\u201d and addressed to the appellant at Coleman, Alberta, informing him that \u201cthe Department has been obliged to cancel your lease,\u201d was placed in the post-office. It never reached Paulson and was subsequently returned to the Department from the dead letter office. Concurrently with the mailing of this letter, Paulson\u2019s solicitors were notified that their client\nis being advised that his lease * * * has been cancelled.\nAssuming the sufficiency of a notice that the Department has cancelled the lease, if duly given (I think it was clearly insufficient because it does not purport to be the act of, or even to have been authorized by the Minister himself, and because it signifies past and not present action), the notice so mailed was not given to the lessee. That the notice to which he was entitled should actually reach him is what the lease contemplated. There is nothing in it which constituted the post-office his agent to receive the notice for him\u2014nothing which dispensed with its actual delivery to him.\nBut it is contended that the stipulation for a written notice was waived by the subsequent steps taken on Paulson\u2019s behalf to secure a re-instatement of the lease. I do not find in what was done anything amounting to such a waiver. There is no evidence of intention on the part of the lessee, with full knowledge of the facts on which his rights depended, to forego or abandon those rights.\nMoreover, the Minister subsequently decided\nto re-instate the lease in favour of Mr. Paul Paulson.\nHis solicitors were so notified by letter of the 28th January, 1910. This step clearly involved a waiver by the Minister (who was competent to waive them) of any grounds of forfeiture existing up to that date. It is true that the re-instatement is said to be made on condition that Paulson should file certain evidence with the Department. No time was specified within which that should be done. Whether this condition had been already complied with was perhaps doubtful when, on the 14th April, 1910, not at all for failure to comply with it, but because the Minister had been advised by the law officers of the Crown that it was\nnot within his authority to revive the lease in Mr. Paulson\u2019s favour,\nthe appellant\u2019s solicitors were informed by letter that the Department would treat the lease as having been cancelled from the 13th September, 1909.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that the lease was not terminated in the manner in which the Minister was empowered to effect cancellation. The conditions of a clause of forfeiture in its favour must be observed by the Crown with the same care and precision which is exacted from a subject.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014This is a declaratory action on the information of the Attorney-General of Canada to have a lease of the 8th of August, 1904, made by the Crown to the appellant, Paulson, declared duly cancelled and terminated; and, in the alternative, that the lease to the respondent company of the 28th of April, 1910, be declared to have been issued in error.\nThese two leases cover the same mine.\nBy the lease of the 8th of August, 1904, a yearly rent of $96 was stipulated and by section 12 it was declared\nthat the lessee shall commence active operations upon the said lands within one year from the date of the commencement of the said term and shall work a mine or mines thereon within two years from that date and shall thereafter continuously and effectually work any mine or mines opened by him unless prevented from so doing by circumstances beyond his control or excused from so doing by the Minister;\nand, by clause 17 of the agreement, it was covenanted that in case of non-performance of any condition not waived by the Minister, the Minister may cancel the lease by written notice to the lessee and, thereupon, the lease shall become absolutely null and void and the Crown may re-enter and re-possess the property leased.\nThe lessee Paulson is described in the lease as residing in the Town of Coleman, Alberta. His solicitors were Messrs. Lewis & Smellie of the City of Ottawa.\nThe lessee was also in possession of several mining rights adjoining the property in question in this lease and he organized the respondent company to carry out his mining operations. His shareholders, however, refused to take over the mining rights which he had in virtue of his lease of the 8th of August, 1904. The operations on mines acquired by the respondent company were carried out with very extensive and successful results.\nThe appellant failed to commence operations on the mine in question in this case, as provided in the contract. He obtained from time to time from the Minister extensions of time for the beginning of the carrying out of his operations.\nOn the 11th of March, 1909, his solicitors, Messrs. Lewis & Smellie, made a new application for an extension of time until the 15th July, 1910, to begin operations under this lease.\nOn the 9th July, 1909, Messrs, Lewis & Smellie sent to the Department a cheque for $96 in payment of the rental for the year ending 15th July, 1910. The secretary of the Department acknowledged receipt of that letter but stated that the amount\nwas accepted conditionally pending a decision in regard to the extension of time asked for.\nOn the 1st of September, 1909, the Minister directed the cancellation of the lease and a letter notifying Mr. Paulson accordingly, dated the 13th September, 1909, was addressed to him at Coleman.\nAt the same time and on the same day, a letter was sent to Messrs. Lewis & Smellie telling them that it had been decided not to grant Mr. Paulson the extension which they asked for him and they were informed that his lease had been cancelled.\nMessrs. Lewis & Smellie continued to correspond with the Department, urging that the cancellation should not be carried out, and as a result of their representations they were informed by letter of the 28th January, 1910, that it had been decided to re-instate the lease in Mr. Paulson\u2019s favour, subject to the condition that evidence should be filed shewing the nature and progress of the work.\nLater on, on the 14th of April, 1910, the Department of the Interior wrote Paulson\u2019s solicitors that they had been advised by the law officers of the Crown that it was not within the authority of the Minister to revive the lease, which lease\nwas properly cancelled for non-compliance with the conditions thereof.\nThe appellant, who had been instructed by the letter of the 28th January to give evidence of the work which he claimed having done, did not produce that evidence before the latter part of April. He continued to offer his rent, which was refused.\nOn the 25th April, 1910, the respondent company gave an undertaking to the Department to indemnify the Crown for any damage which might result from the refusal of the Department to revive the Paulson lease and, on the 28th of June, 1910, the mining rights in question were leased to the respondent company.\nOne point has been raised as to the meaning of clause 12 of the Paulson lease.\nThat clause, as I already stated, provided that the work should begin within a year, that the mine or mines thereon should be operated within two years and that thereafter the mine would be continuously and effectively worked, unless excused by the Minister.\nThree different covenants are provided in that clause:\u2014 1. The beginning of operations within a year;\n2. The working of a mine within two years;\n3. Its continuous working.\nIt is contended that the waiver of the Minister could apply only to the working of the mine, but could not affect the beginning of operations and the opening of mining.\nI am unable to accept that contention. It seems to me that the Minister had the right to excuse the lessee not only with regard to the continuous working of the mine, but also with regard to the beginning of operations and the opening of a mine. In other words, this clause empowering the Minister to interfere should cover the three different operations covered in that section. It is a well established rule that where a section contains distinct covenants and there are words of restriction either in the prefatory or concluding part, those words must be extended to every part of the section. Beal, Interpretation (2 ed.), p. 185; 1 Saunders, p. 60.\nThe main question is as to the validity of the cancellation. The lease provided that the Minister\nmay cancel these presents by written notice to the said lessee * * * and it shall be lawful for His Majesty * * * to re-enter.\nAs I have already said, the notice addressed to the lessee\u2019s residence, mentioned in the contract, was not delivered. But, at the same time, his solicitors, who had been carrying out all the correspondence with the Department, were notified that the Department could not grant the extension of lease they had asked for Mr. Paulson and that he was being advised that his lease has been cancelled and that\nthe Department will now make such other disposition of the lands as may seem advisable.\nThe correspondence which followed shews conclusively that Mr. Paulson knew of the cancellation of the lease and that, if the formal written notice did not reach him, he had been advised through his solicitors of the cancellation, since he took steps to counteract the decision of the Department and begged of the Minister to be reinstated in his rights as lessee. The Minister acceded to his request and, by a letter of the 28th January, 1910, he informed him through his solicitors that the lease had been reinstated, but on the condition that certain evidence should be given as to the extent of the work he claimed to have done.\nSeveral months passed before this condition was fulfilled and, at last, the Minister on the advice of the law officers of the Crown informed Mr. Paulson\u2019s solicitors that the lease should be considered as duly cancelled, since he had not the right to revive it.\nAll those circumstances disclosed by the correspondence in the case shew to me conclusively that the appellant knew of the cancellation of the lease. He may have, however, on the strength of the letter of the 28th of January, performed some operations and incurred liabilities in connection with the working of the mine. I would recommend that he be compensated for the damages which he has suffered in connection there with.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lewis & Smellie.\nSolicitors for the respondent, His Majesty the King: Code & Burritt.\nSolicitors for the respondents, The International Coal and Coke Co.: Fleet, Falconer, Phelan & Bovey.\n[1] 15 Ex.

The defendants contended that, on account of delay in the delivery of the machinery in question, they were entitled to deduct from the amount of the, purchase price the sum of $14,550, either as preestimated liquidated damages or as a reduction in price stipulated in the contract, but, being willing to effect an amicable settlement, of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that in some measure the delay was to be attributed to the defendants themselves, they had tendered to the plaintiffs, before action, $3,000 in full settlement of their claim, and they renewed the tender with their plea. In the trial court, Mr. Justice Charbonneau gave effect to the contentions of the defence and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs. This decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nF. W. Hibbard K.C. and G. H. Montgomery K.C. for the appellants,\nA. Chase-Gas grain K.C. and Errol M. McDougall for respondents. The Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment in this case is right. It is unnecessary for me to go into the facts of the case; the only point that was pressed upon us at the hearing of the appeal was the legal effect of the provision in the contract that\nthe sum of $25 per day for each motor, each generator and a complete switchboard shall be deducted from the contract price as liquidated damages and not as a forfeit for every day\u2019s delay in the delivery of the apparatus as specified in the delivery clause.\nThe contract is in English, relates to a purely business transaction and uses terms well recognized in English law. The words \u201cliquidated damages\u201d and \u201cforfeit or penalty\u201d are commonly to be found in similar contracts and, as judicially interpreted by the courts, have a perfectly well understood meaning in English and French law.\nA penalty is the payment of a stipulated sum on breach of the contract, irrespective of the damage sustained. The essence of liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damage.\nI think any difficulty the case may present has arisen from the fact that similar terms have not perhaps quite the same meaning in English and in French law. In the latter the word \u201cpeine\u201d does not correspond to the word \u201cpenalty\u201d as construed by the English courts. Whilst the exact amount of the former may be recovered irrespective of damage, it is only so much of the latter as represents the actual damage sustained that the party in default can be made liable for. To some extent, therefore, the word \u201cpeine\u201d corresponds more nearly to \u201cliquidated damages\u201d than to a penalty. See Planiol (6 ed.), vol. II., pp. 90 and 91. I think it must be some confusion of these terms which caused Mr. Justice Tellier to dissent from the judgment of all the other judges, before whom the case has come. He seems to think that as the contract provides that the agreed sum payable in lieu of damages is declared not to be a forfeit, the respondent can only recover the damages which he is able to prove he has sustained.\nMais il n\u2019y a pas lieu de rechercher si le cr\u00e9ancier souffre ou non un dommage par suite de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation. La convention faite \u00e0 forfait a justement pour but de supprimer tout examen de ce genre. La clause p\u00e9nale est due (et c\u2019est l\u00e0 un de ses grands avantages) d\u00e8s que le d\u00e9itur est responsable de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution. Planiol, loc. cit.\nThe first paragraph of article 1229, C.N., is not reproduced in the Quebec Civil Code.\nThere are innumerable cases in which it has been necessary, in particular cases, to decide whether the parties intended that the payment provided for by the contract should be in the nature of a penalty or liquidated damages. The principles on which such cases are determined are well established. It is only necessary for me to refer to the recent case in the House of Lords of Dunlop Pneumatic Tire Co. v. New Garage and Motor Co.[2], in which they are very clearly laid down. The English rule seems to be in accord with that laid down by Pothier, Obligations No. 345:\u2014\nWhere the payment of a smaller sum is secured by a larger, the stipulation will be relieved against as penal, but where the agreement is for an act other than the payment of money and the injury that may result from a breach is not ascertainable with exactness, depending upon extrinsic circumstances, a stipulation for damages, not on the face of the contract out of proportion to the probable loss, may be upheld, the difficult cases turning mainly upon the interpretation of the language of the particular contract. Harvard Law Review, vol. 29, p. 129, and cases there cited. In the contract in the present case there is a clear agreement for the deduction from the contract price for delay in delivery; there is no objection to such an agreement being entered into and no reason why effect should not be given to the agreement by the courts. As Sir George Jessel puts it:\u2014\nCourts should not overrule any clearly expressed intention on the ground that judges know the business of the people better than the people know it themselves.\nWallis v. Smith(1882)[3], at page 266.\nArticle 1076, C.C.:\u2014\nWhen it is stipulated that a certain sum shall be paid for damages for the inexecution of an obligation, such sum and no other, either greater or less, is allowed to the creditor for such damages.\nAs far back as 1849 it was said by Cresswell J., in the case of Sainter v. Ferguson[4]:\u2014\nIf there be only one event upon which the money was to become payable and there is no adequate means of ascertaining the precise damage that may result to the plaintiff from a breach of the contract, it is perfectly competent to the parties to fix a given amount of compensation, in order to avoid the difficulty.\nThis ruling has been approved in many cases ever since. Halsbury, vol. 10, Damages Nos, 604 et seq. It appears to me that it entirely covers the stipulation in the present contract. It could not have been possible to ascertain the damage in advance; the amount fixed is not alleged to have been an extravagant one; and the provision was in every respect a reasonable and proper one which both parties may perfectly well be supposed to have intended.\nI may add that the contract is for delivery of an apparatus consisting of the things therein specified, for which apparatus the purchaser agrees to pay $33,000. The delivery clause provides for the delivery of the apparatus not later than May 1st, 1911, and the contract provided that\nthe sum of $25 per day for each motor, each generator, and a complete switchboard shall be deducted from the contract price (1) for every day\u2019s delay in the delivery of the apparatus.\nIt might perhaps foe contended that until the whole apparatus was delivered, $25 per day should be deducted for each motor, etc., whether delivered or not. The contract does not say for each motor undelivered. It is not necessary, however, to decide this as the respondents advanced no claim on such a construction of the contract. I mention it because the appellant has certainly suffered no hardship in the deduction made from the contract price and perhaps is fortunate in not having to submit to a larger deduction. But one cannot entirely overlook that possible construction of the contract because of the second paragraph of article 1076 C.C. However, the parties are presumed to be the best judges of the object they had in view when this provision was inserted in the agreement and neither has chosen to raise the question as to whether the obligation to deliver was performed in part.\nIt may possibly be useful to observe that article 1076 C.C. is new law. See Report of Codifiers for the reasons why they reject the rule as laid down in Pothier, \u201cObligations,\u201d No. 345.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Review of the Province of Quebec affirming a judgment of the Superior Court as to the proper construction of a contract made between the parties for the manufacture and delivery toy the electric company to the rubber company of certain apparatus comprising direct and alternating current motors and a large switchboard in the wiring.\nThe controversy turned upon the proper construction of a clause in the contract providing for the damages to be paid by the electric company to the rubber company in case default was made in the delivery of the apparatus within the time contracted for.\nThe clause reads as follows:\u2014\nThe sum of twenty-five dollars ($25) per day for each motor each generator and a complete switchboard shall be deducted from the contract price as liquidated damages and not as a forfeit for every day\u2019s delay in the delivery of the apparatus as specified in the delivery clause herein, and this sum shall be over and above the cost of any extra inspection.\nThe rubber company, on being sued for the price of the apparatus manufactured and supplied, claimed the right under this clause to deduct from the contract price as genuine pre-estimated liquidated damages $25 per day for 582 days the plaintiff electric company was in default in delivering the motors and generators less 122 days which it conceded should not be charged because they were or might be attributable to the defendant company\u2019s own fault, thus reducing the number of days for which damages were chargeable to 460, and fixing the damages at $11,500.\nBoth courts below maintained the defendants\u2019 contentions alike as to its legal rights under the above clause of the contract and as to the actual number of days for which it was entitled to deduct the $25 per diem as genuine pre-estimated liquidated damages.\nOn the question of fact as to the actual number of days chargeable owing to fault in the delivery of the apparatus, after listening to the lengthy argument of counsel for the respective parties, I felt myself quite unable to say that the findings of the trial judge concurred in by the Court of Review should be disturbed.\nAs to the legal question, the principal objection raised was that it was not competent for the defendants, respondents, to plead in answer to an action for the recovery of the stipulated price of these motors and generators the liquidated damages agreed upon in the contract for delays in the delivery of the articles, unless and until damages of some kind and amount had at least been first alleged and proved.\nI have not been able to understand on what principle such a contention can be maintained.\nOnce it is established that the damages are genuine pre-estimated liquidated damages, and are not unconscionable, I cannot see why they should not be pleaded in answer to a plaintiff\u2019s demand for the price of the article sold.\nBut in the case at bar the parties expressly provided that these damages should \u201cbe deducted from the contract price\u201d and so the courts below properly held that the defendant was entitled to deduct them for the number of days he established the vendors\u2019 default.\nIt has been suggested as a possible construction of the contract that a failure to deliver even a fractional part of the \u201capparatus\u201d might make the vendor liable for the $25 per diem even on the motors and generators he had delivered until the entire apparatus was delivered.\nI think, however, this is not the true construction of the clause which only makes the vendor liable for the per diem damages pre-estimated for each motor and each generator undelivered on time and for the days only there was default in the delivery of each such motor and generator.\nIf the suggested possible construction was the true one there would certainly be strong ground for holding the $25 per diem for each motor and generator not a genuine pre-estimated damage, but an unconscionable amount which was really a penalty.\nOn the whole, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant seeks to recover from the respondent the balance due for certain machines to be made at the factory of appellant in Peterborough, in Ontario, and delivered to respondent in Montreal for the contract price of $33,000 and for some other supplies and work incidental to the contract.\nThe differences between the parties are confined to a claim made by the respondent, and so far sustained by the courts below, to deduct $25 a day from the contract price in the event of a failure to comply with certain alleged terms of the contract.\nThe frame of the contract is in some regards ambiguous, and as the claim to these reductions must rest upon the correct interpretation and construction of the contract which is somewhat complicated, I purpose analyzing it.\nIt consists of three parts. The first is briefly the operative part and therein contains the respective obligations of each party as follows:\u2014\nThe contractor will manufacture, deliver and erect and operate the apparatus contracted for herein, consisting of four direct current motors\u2014two motor generator sets\u2014four alternating current motors, and a large switchboard with wiring, etc., all as herein specified. The purchaser agrees to accept and pay for the apparatus the sum of thirty-three thousand dollars ($3\u20193,000) under the terms and conditions set forth herein, provided that the apparatus complies in every respect with the general conditions and the specifications herein contained.\nThe next part consists of the conditions referred to in the foregoing. In one of these conditions is the following somewhat ambiguous expression:\u2014\nThe contractor will begin work immediately upon signing the contract and complete the same as per the delivery clause, free of all liens and charges within the time specified herein, etc.\nAnother condition provides as follows:\u2014\nThe sum of twenty-five dollars ($25) per day for each motor, each generator and a complete switchboard shall be deducted from the contract price as liquidated damages and not as a forfeit for every day\u2019s delay in the delivery of the apparatus as specified in the delivery clause herein, and this sum shall be over and above the cost of any extra inspection.\nIt is upon this clause coupled with the delivery clause thus referred to and what that delivery clause contains that the claim of respondent to reductions must rest.\nThis condition is immediately followed by another which says:\u2014\nIn the event of the purchaser ordering the work in connection with this contract to be discontinued, or in any manner whatsoever delays the work, it is hereby agreed that such delay caused by purchaser shall be added to the delivery date, mentioned herein, and such delivery date extended by the number of days that will be equal to the delay caused by the purchaser.\nUpon this condition the appellant rests a number of claims to reduction from what respondent might otherwise be entitled to. With these I shall deal presently in detail.\nThe respondent, however, alleges it has made due allowance for all such counterclaims as well founded.\nThese delays it estimated at one hundred and twenty-two days in all and tendered a sum to cover same which the learned trial judge has found sufficient and in that has been sustained by the court of appeal.\nThe \u201cdelivery clause\u201d above referred to I find under the heading \u201cDelivery and Erection\u201d and under that appear the following provisions:\u2014\nThe apparatus shall be delivered on purchaser\u2019s foundations, free of cost to the purchaser in his power house in the City of Montreal, Province of Quebec, not later than May 1st, 1911.\nIn case the contractor should fail to deliver the apparatus by May 1st, 1911, the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25) per day for damages as provided for herein shall apply.\n* * * * *\nThe purchaser agrees to have the power house foundations, etc., ready for the apparatus. If the purchaser causes any delay to the contractor thereby preventing the installation of the apparatus, or the delivery of the same, the damages of $25 per day provided for herein shall not apply for the number of days delay caused by the purchaser.\nIt is herein I find the ambiguity I first mentioned. Clearly there is in this latter clause a confusion between delivery and installation.\nTrue, there are between these just quoted, two provisions I omit, of which one provides appellant shall provide men to erect without delay and have same complete and ready for service not later than May 20th, 1911. But as there is no reduction of price or provision for liquidated damages or anything specifically bearing thereon I find none can by any possibility be claimed in that regard. Indeed, respondent in argument renounced any such claim save in respect of failure to deliver within the time agreed upon.\nNotwithstanding that, can appellant, by virtue of the clause lastly quoted, exonerating the appellant for delays caused by respondent, take any benefit therefrom in way of reduction of respondent\u2019s claim, by reason of the peculiar expression therein which reads: Thereby preventing the installation of the apparatus, or the delivery of the same,\nfollowed by the words:\u2014\nThe damages of $25 per day provided for herein shall not apply for the number of days\u2019 delay caused by the purchaser?\nI am of opinion it cannot. It is restricted to the damages provided therein, and they are only provided for in respect of default in delivery. And that default must be computed from the date, after the 1st of May, when the delays caused by the purchaser have been duly credited, and thus appellant given a later day for delivery.\nNow let us consider the bearing of these clauses, thus interpreted and construed, upon the respective claims of respondent to make the reductions allowed, and the appellant to be relieved therefrom by virtue of what the purchaser has thus agreed to excuse.\nBeginning with the latter which is chiefly in question herein, I shall take them in the order presented.\nThe first claim so set up is a delay alleged by the respondent\u2019s failure, for nearly a month, to execute the contract, after the appellant had duly signed same and sent it to respondent to be executed. I cannot understand how it can be claimed that such a delay can be held as one of those which was caused by the purchaser within the meaning of the contract. It is clearly a hindering the progress of the work which is aimed at and nothing else.\nThe appellant had the remedy in its own hands by refusing, if it could justify such a course under the attendant circumstances, to go on, unless and until a modification of the terms had been made, but the contract cannot permit of such a mode of construction. Indeed, the appellant in fact did go on meanwhile with the work. It was, as I read the contract in the expression I quote above, clearly contemplated by the parties that it should do so as soon as it had signed it; and everything must be treated as if the contract, which has no date, became operative from the date when the appellant signed it.\nI have no doubt that, not only was that the purpose of the peculiar expression used, but also that it was the understanding of the parties.\nThe next item of claim is a change in three of the 175 h.-p. motors.\nInasmuch as the specifications forming part of the contract provided for terminals as follows:\u2014\nThe motors shall be provided with terminals located suitably for connecting to the switchboard leads; the terminals, will be provided with approved insulating couplings. The switchboard location and wiring may call for the terminals to be on top of the motor,\nit does not appear to me as self-evident that the respondent was to blame for asking that they should be placed as at first asked.\nIt was competent for the engineer to have insisted, as some stubborn, self-sufficient men might have done, that what he had written must stand. If he had I cannot see anything appellant could have done but submit.\nBecause the engineer was gracious enough to try and meet the appellant\u2019s urgent petition to save it expense I do not think his company can be bound to bear the burden thereof. Moreover, I suspect there was ample work for appellant\u2019s men, working on these machines, to keep going steadily on.\nThe next is in respect of the test on those 175 h.-p. motors. The evidence bearing upon this item illustrates, by the slip-shod methods of those in the appellant\u2019s employment, in charge of its business, how very provoking they could be.\nThe appellant had been warned by a letter of the 5th May, in the nature of a personal appeal to its vice-president, and by a formal letter of 9th May to the company, that full deductions for delays for non-delivery would be insisted upon. Yet in face of these appeals neither business energy nor ordinary despatch, much less the urgency that a possible loss of a hundred dollars a day should have evoked, was used. And there is no proof which can excuse them at the expense of the respondent.\nThe next item is in regard to three 175 h.-p. motors and one 20 h.-p. motor. The fault in part admittedly was on the part of appellant, and the requirements of the engineer in way of change were within the contract and no proof is adduced that the entire work was held up by any such cause as assigned.\nThe next cause of delay by respondent, if any, rests upon what transpired relative to some sub-bases which formed no part of the contract in question, yet were to be so used in connection with the work done under the contract that it might reasonably have been considered by the appellant as due to the respondent that the work done or to be done in Peterborough, pursuant to the contract, should be so fitted there as to be ready when erected to operate upon the sub-bases.\nWith every desire to give effect to this reasonable suggestion I am unable to discover wherein the parties concerned provided in the contract for the due execution thereof.\nWhatever relief appellant is entitled to herein must rest within the terms of the contract as expressed in that condition above quoted providing for the extension of the date of delivery by reason of the purchaser causing delay to the contractor.\nThe reasonableness of the suggestion made in the letter of 1st April, upon which and what followed appellant\u2019s claim rests, cannot be gainsaid. But how far does that carry us in relation to the business in hand?\nIt, when coupled with what preceded and followed it, seems to disclose only this, that some one had blundered.\nThe contract itself does not seem to have provided for the contingencies involved in anything relating to the sub-bases. If the appellant\u2019s men had paid careful attention to the matter they should have seen to it earlier than this letter of 1st April to Sheldon\u2019s Ltd., indicates.\nThe fact is the fitting of the machines to be made by the appellant to serve sub-bases must have been patent to all concerned if heed paid to the business in hand and the means of doing so or anticipating same, ought to have been provided for in the contract. So far as I can discover this was not done.\nIn such a situation, what, within the contract, should have been done?\nClearly the only alternative in law was to have gone on with the completion of the work according to contract so far as it reached, and shipment of the machines so that the terms regarding delivery might have been fulfilled. If shipped in that condition a new difficulty would have been presented no doubt. The installation would have been delayed but for that no damages per diem for delays could have been claimed. Another difficulty would have arisen relative to the extra expense of having the work of fitting done in Montreal instead of in Peterborough for which due compensation no doubt would have had to be made by respondent.\nIndeed, the parts which needed fitting to the sub-bases might have had to be shipped to Peterborough. But for any such event the respondent would only have itself to blame. It need not have concerned appellant.\nIt is impossible now for us to re-mould the contract and provide for all this. It is, I repeat, within the lines of the contract as framed that we must determine the rights of the parties and not by something we can presume to have been inserted and assume to have been contemplated as within same when it is clearly not so provided.\nA letter of 13th February from respondent to the appellant made clear what was; wanted. And therein appellant is asked for a tender for these sub-bases and it ought to have dawned upon some one in appellant\u2019s employment that unless this unprovided for feature of the contract was duly provided for, there was trouble ahead.\nIt may be excusable to overlook the need of this provision in a contract which covers twenty-eight printed pages of the case before us, but doing so furnishes no basis for us to allot the shares to be borne of the burden of a joint blunder.\nIt was possibly a case for an application within the terms of the contract for an extension of time or for a direct appear to respondent.\nInstead of adopting either such course there was correspondence between appellant and the sub-contractors\u2014Ross & Greig and Sheldons\u2014and needless waste of time at that, without a direct communication (and probable understanding) with respondent. The only direct thing appellant has from respondent to shew, and rely upon, is the ambiguous letter of the 4th May. It passes my understanding why that should be relied upon, for nothing preceding that letter had been done in any way approaching business methods so far as these sub-bases were concerned. Standing alone as it does, the letter is worthless for appellant\u2019s present purpose.\nThere certainly is fair ground for an appeal in regard to this item to the sense of justice respondent should have. It may or may not have taken that into consideration in arriving at the total of the hundred and twenty-two days it allows for.\nBut I can see no ground in law upon which to rest the claim made by the appellant in this regard.\nI think it might have been possible for the appellant in a contract of this magnitude to have made the templets as requested in the letter of respondent of 13th February at, say, a couple of hundred dollars expense, even without an appropriation.\nThe next claim is one arising out of the admitted error made by the engineer in connection with the starters for the synchronous and induction motors. It seems well founded, but its consequences, in my opinion, are grossly exaggerated, and amply covered by allowances made.\nThe last claim relative to the motor generator sets may be disposed of by the like considerations.\nI confess, notwithstanding the argument presented, I was disposed at its close to think the claims made by respondent were somewhat harsh and possibly unfounded in law, but the examination I have made leads to the conclusion that appellant has only itself to blame for the result.\nThere remains only the question of law striking at respondent\u2019s entire claim as presented for consideration.\nIn the first place it is to be observed that the terms of the contract raise a most formidable obstacle in the way of the appellant. It sues upon a contract for a price agreed upon which it is stipulated, in certain contingencies which have taken place, shall be reduced to another price. What can it matter in such a case that the reduction of price is called \u201cliquidated damages\u201d?\nIt is not for the law, unless such stipulation is against law, to act upon the name given or name assigned the amount of reduction, but to give effect to the contract.\nOf course, if the law clearly expressed such a stipulation to be null, or subject to medication, then the contract could be of no avail.\nI do not think the article 1076 of the Civil Code governing the parties\u2019 rights in the premises does so interfere with the efficacy of what the parties have contracted for.\nThe case of Ottawa Northern and Western Railway Co. v. Dominion Bridge Co.[5], does not help the appellant. It would be very difficult to extract from the decision in that case anything to help any one. For there was such a difference of opinion in the court as to render its decision unlikely to be ever applicable to another case unless that other should happen to be, as this is not, exactly the same. I had the misfortune, in common with my then brother, Mr. Justice Nesbitt, to differ from the result reached by the majority. But each member of that majority took different grounds for the conclusion reached.\nThere were two contracts involved therein; and in no way could one, by construction of the contract fixing the price, as may be held herein, be able to say that as the result of an application of the damages then and there in question, the price was thereby determined. The case chiefly turned, so far as the majority of those expressing opinions held, upon the point of whether there could be held to be an application of article 217 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The question of whether or not the party seeking there compensation or set-off based in liquidated damages or, as here, such a reduction of price as claimed herein must shew actual damages could only arise in a very incidental manner therein. And as I viewed it then my opinion would be against the appellant. If this court had by the majority clearly expressed a view in conflict therewith upon the exact point involved, I should cheerfully bow thereto, but unfortunately it did not.\nThe neat point raised herein, that, of necessity, in law the party claiming the reduction of price must allege and prove damages before he can apply the estimate fixed by the contract, does not seem to me tenable in this case.\nIn the first place the contract does not permit of such a holding. And in the next place the fact is that such proof as was adduced seems to answer the contention.\nI can conceive of such a case arising as might give place to such a contention as raised herein, but not in this ease, or in the way it is presented.\nI find in respondent\u2019s factum, article 1076 C.C., quoted as follows:\u2014\n1076. When it is stipulated that a certain sum shall be paid for damages for the inexecution of an obligation, such sum and no other, either greater or less, is allowed to the creditor for such damages.\nThis is not the whole of that article. The part quoted is followed by this:\u2014\nBut if the obligation have been performed in part, to the benefit of the creditor and the time for its complete performance be not material, the stipulated sum may be reduced unless there be a special agreement to the contrary.\nThis gives an entirely different aspect to the article as a whole and provides for such cases as I have just indicated may possibly arise. In such a case this second part of the article should be availed of by pleading the facts applicable thereunder, which was not done or pretended to be claimed herein.\nIn concluding I may say that the parties are both agreed that the Quebec law must govern their rights. But there are many features in the case arising from the execution of the contract by appellant in Ontario, and the form of contract, which not only contemplated the work of constructing the machines in Ontario but also the right given respondent incidentally thereto to interfere with the expedition of the work there and the shipment thence and only a delivery at Montreal being provided for, before the clauses in question should become operative, which might suggest the law of Ontario was intended to govern. For the later work of installation, in respect of which nothing arises herein, different considerations might apply.\nI express no opinion. I merely suggest there is room for argument and should not feel bound in that regard by this decision in any case presenting the like features and any different submission as to the law of the place by which the contract should be interpreted.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant submits three distinct grounds of appeal:\u2014\n(1) That the contract in question must be interpreted and effect given to it according to the civil law of Quebec and not according to English law; and that, under the former, the provision fixing the amount of damages to be paid by the vendors for delay in delivery, installation, etc., is not \u201ca penal clause\u201d within articles 1131 et seq., of the Civil Code, but a pre-determination of the amount of damages under article 1076, and that the purchasers, therefore, cannot recover under it without alleging and proving that the delay complained of had actually caused them some damage, the appellants conceding, however, that upon proof of any damage, more than merely nominal, regardless of its extent, the purchasers would be entitled to recover the full sum stipulated for in the contract.\n(2) That damages under the clause in question are not a proper subject of compensation or set-off, but recovery of them can be had only in a cross-action.\n(3) That the number of days\u2019 delay charged to the vendor is excessive.\nBefore considering the character and legal effect of the clause in the contract upon which this litigation has arisen, a word should be said as to its scope. It has been suggested that it might render the vendors liable for the sum of f 25 per day in respect of each of the eleven distinct articles which they undertook to supply so long as any one of them should remain undelivered, because until all had been delivered there was delay in the delivery of the \u201capparatus\u201d contracted for. But both the parties, by their conduct before action and by their attitude in the litigation itself, have made it clear that they understood that the right to recover the stipulated sum for delay in respect of each of the eleven specified articles should be limited to delay in its delivery. That this is the real purview of the agreement seems to be at least equally probable. As the panties have acted upon this view of its scope land have suggested no other, it would appear to be contrary to sound construction to give to the clause in question an effect different from what they seem to have contemplated (art. 1013, C.C.) more onerous, and possibly calculated to render its enforceability doubtful.\nThe first point made by the appellants is, based upon the words \u201cas liquidated damages and not as a forfeit.\u201d Only a very cursory examination of the clause in question is required to make it practically certain that it was prepared from the point of view of the English jurist. It is in a form familiar to every English lawyer who knows anything of commercial contracts. It was no doubt taken from some similar contract framed for use in one of the provinces where English law prevails. The obvious purpose of the parties was to prevent the application of the equity rule, under which courts administering English law relieve from penalties and forfeitures, by inserting a provision that it would be difficult to regard as anything else than \u201ca genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damages\u201d (Dunlop Pneumatic, Tire Co. v. New Garage and Motor Co.[6], at p. 86), in a case in which \u201cit was impossible to foresee the extent of the injury which might be sustained\u201d by the purchasers should the vendors make default. Webster v. Bosanquet[7], at p. 398. The circumstances are such that it cannot be said that the sum agreed upon is extravagant or unconscionable; it is made to depend upon the number of articles undelivered and the duration of the delay in the delivery of each; and a precise estimate of actual damage either before or after the default would have been so difficult to arrive at as to be impracticable. Clydebank Engineering and Shipbuilding Co. v. Yzquierdo y Castaneda[8], at pp. 16, 19.\nThe apparent intention of the parties, therefore, was to provide for the payment by the vendors, on default, of a sum agreed upon as pre-estimated damages in such a manner that the courts would not relieve from or modify the stipulation and to dispense with what would possibly be very expensive proof of the actual loss to which the delay bad subjected the purchasers. Such an intention is conformable to the policy of the civil law of Quebec quite as much as it is to that of English law. Under both systems alike their contract is the law of the parties. It is the duty of the courts to ascertain as best they can from what the parties have expressed, read in the light of the surrounding circumstances proper to be considered, the nature and extent of the engagements to which they intended to commit themselves, and to give effect to them. In English law the term \u201cpenalty\u201d may bear a meaning and may import incidents which differ somewhat from those attached to it by the Civil Code of Quebec. Yet where it is clear, as it seems to be in the present case, that it was the intention of the parties to contract according to English law, although their agreement was partly made and was partly to be carried out in the Province of Quebec, the courts of that province, giving effect to such intention, will put upon its language the interpretation which it would receive in an English court rather than defeat the real purpose of the parties by giving to the terms they have used the significance which they ordinarily bear in contracts governed by the civil law of Quebec when there is no sufficient indication that they should receive any other interpretation. The present contract was partly made in Ontario, where one of the contracting parties had its chief place of business. That fact may account for its having taken the English form. But, however that may be, effect must be given to the manifest intention of the parties that their contract should be construed according to the rules of English law. Hamlyn & Co. v. Talisker Distillery[9]; The \u201cIndustrie\u201d[10], at pp. 72, 73. In doing so we are but carrying out the provisions of article 8 of the Civil Code.\nIn this view it is unnecessary that I should consider the points suggested by the appellants as to the differences between the cases provided for by article 1076 C.C., and those dealt with under articles 1131, etc., or whether, if the present case falls under the first mentioned article, it would be necessary for the respondents to allege and to prove that they had sustained some actual damages. I may, however, observe that I would have difficulty in placing a construction on the clause in question which would require the purchasers to prove some actual damage, more than merely nominal, but would upon any such actual damage being shewn, regardless of its extent, entitle them to recover the entire amount stipulated for. I think the first ground of appeal fails.\nThe term of the contract that the purchasers shall deduct from the contract price any sum payable by the vendors for damages for delay in delivery is an express provision for set-off or compensation which must prevail, the contract being the law of the parties. The effect of this clause must have escaped the notice of Mr. Justice Tellier. But for lit I should be prepared to accept his conclusion that, in view of the provisions of article 1188 C.C., and article 217 C.P.Q., there could not be compensation in such a case as this. Ottawa Northern and Western Railway Co. v. Dominion Bridge Co.[11].\nA study of the record has satisfied me that there has been no overcharge against the vendors for the several periods of delay in delivery and that they have had the full advantage of any reduction in damages to which defaults of the purchasers entitled them. In every case where there was any room for doubt they have not been charged with delay. Only in a very clear case could we interfere on this branch of appeal with the concurrent judgments of the Quebec courts.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Les appelants sont manufacturiers de pouvoirs moteurs \u00e9lectriques et ils s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9s envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e de lui livrer certaines machines le 1er mai, 1911, avec obligation de leur part de payer $25 par jour de dommages pour livraison tardive. La convention portait que ces dommages seraient d\u00e9duits du prix du contrat\nas liquidated damages and not as a forfeit for every day\u2019s delay in the delivery.\nIl s\u2019agit de savoir si la compagnie intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e d\u2019all\u00e9guer et de prouver qu\u2019elle avait souffert des dommages.\nEn principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le d\u00e9biteur est tenu de payer des dommages quand il n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas son obligation (article 1065 C.C.) et le cr\u00e9ancier est alors tenu de justifier de la perte qu\u2019il a \u00e9prouv\u00e9e et du gain dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 et il doit aussi \u00e9tablir le quantum des dommages. (Article 1073 C.C.) Cette preuve est parfois extr\u00eamement difficile \u00e0 faire et donne lieu \u00e0 des frais d\u2019enqu\u00eate consid\u00e9rables et alors les parties conviennent d\u2019une certaine somme pour tenir lieu des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. (Article 1076 C.C.) C\u2019est la loi qu\u2019elles se font et qu\u2019elles doivent, par cons\u00e9quent, observer.\nIl y a eu \u00e9videmment dans la cause actuelle in\u00e9x\u00e9cution de son obligation de la part de l\u2019appelante. Elle n\u2019a pas livr\u00e9 les machines dans le d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9 au contrat. Alors, comme la convention portait que le prix de vente serait reduit dans la proportion de $25 par jour de retard dans la livraison de chacune des machines, la defenderesse avait le droit par sa defense d\u2019invoquer cette r\u00e9duction (article 196(3) C. P.Q.).\nMais l\u2019appelante dit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait d\u00fb tout de m\u00eame, malgr\u00e9 cette stipulation, prouver qu\u2019elle avait subi des dommages.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion que la convention dispense le cr\u00e9ancier de faire aucune preuve du pr\u00e9judice qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9.\nMarcad\u00e9 et Pont, art. 1153, p. 421; Larombi\u00e8re Obligations, vol. 4, p. 32, art. 1231; 26 Demolombe, No. 663; 17 Laurent, No. 451, p. 448; McDonald v. Hutchins[12].\nLes parties avaient en vue \u00e9videmment qu\u2019il \u00e9tait essentiel pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019avoir ses machineries \u00e0 une date fixe et, \u00e0 raison, je suppose, de certains contrats qu\u2019elle aurait eu elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 remplir, il \u00e9tait absolument n\u00e9cessaire pour elle qu\u2019elles fussent livr\u00e9es \u00e0 cette date-l\u00e0, afin de pouvoir \u00e0 son tour remplir les obligations qu\u2019elle avait contract\u00e9es envers d\u2019autres personnes. Comme ces dommages auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement difficiles \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos par les parties de d\u00e9terminer imm\u00e9diatement par convention le quantum de ces dommages et dans quelles conditions ils deviendraient d\u00fbs. Le quantum a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $25 par jour et la condition est que si la marchandise n\u2019est pas livr\u00e9e le 1er mai cette somme de $25 par jour pourra \u00eatre d\u00e9duite du prix de vente.\nSi nous interpr\u00e9tons m\u00eame litt\u00e9ralement la convention nous pouvons dire qu\u2019une certaine somme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e pour le prix des marchandises si elles \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es le 1er mai mais que cette marchandise commanderait un prix moindre si elle \u00e9tait livr\u00e9e plus tard.\nJe ne vois pas comment l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e, dans les circonstances, de prouver qu\u2019elle a souffert des dommages.\nL\u2019appelante cependant aurait pu \u00e9tablir que si le temps pour l\u2019enti\u00e8re ex\u00e9cution avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de peu d\u2019importance la somme stipul\u00e9e aurait pu \u00eatre r\u00e9duite (articles 1076. 1135); mais le fardeau de la preuve retombait sur elle; et, comme elle n\u2019a pas rempli cet onus, nous ne pouvons pas faire autrement que d\u2019appliquer la convention des parties et dire que l\u2019appelante est tenue de subir une reduction de prix.\nUne preuve volumineuse cependant a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sur la question de savoir si l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de la convention n\u2019\u00e9tait pas due \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Une clause de la convention comportait que si l\u2019acheteur causait quelque d\u00e9lai au vendeur, qui aurait pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019installation des machineries ou leur livraison, la reduction de prix ne pourrait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e pour le nombre de jours de d\u00e9lai qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par l\u2019acheteur.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame admet dans ses plaidoiries qu\u2019un certain nombre de jours de d\u00e9lai devaient lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9s et elle donne cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de ce chef pour une somme d\u2019environ $3,000.\nIl s\u2019agissait de savoir si les autres d\u00e9lais n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9galement d\u00fbs \u00e0 la faute ou \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019un des premiers chefs imput\u00e9s \u00e0 la Canadian Rubber Company \u00e9tait que le contrat n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par elle qu\u2019un mois environ apr\u00e8s que l\u2019appelante elle-m\u00eame e\u00fbt sign\u00e9.\nIl aurait fallu dans ce cas-l\u00e0 pour la demanderesse \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle avait au moins protest\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e; mais elle n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire cette proc\u00e9dure. Elle a re\u00e7u le contrat d\u00fbment sign\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et d\u2019ailleurs il est en preuve que les parties s\u2019\u00e9taient entendues longtemps auparavant sur la nature des travaux \u00e0 faire et que m\u00eame la demanderesse avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter son contrat. Le contrat formel qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait que dans le but de coucher dans un document formel leurs conventions qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien arr\u00eat\u00e9es et bien connues.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de la preuve que la demanderesse a sign\u00e9 cette convention d\u2019une mani\u00e8re bien impr\u00e9voyante. En effet, nous avons au dossier une lettre du surintendant de sa manufacture lui disant, peu de jours apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait absolument impossible de fabriquer les machines dans le temps stipul\u00e9. Il me semble alors qu\u2019avant de s\u2019obliger formellement, comme elle l\u2019a fait, la demanderesse aurait d\u00fb s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir du surintendant de la manufacture s\u2019il \u00e9tait en position de fabriquer ces machines dans le temps stipul\u00e9. Elle me para\u00eet n\u2019en avoir rien fait et alors elle n\u2019a pas raison d\u2019imputer ce delai \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019il est bien \u00e9vident que c\u2019est elle qui est en faute.\nElle se plaint \u00e9galement d\u2019autres d\u00e9lais, concernant, par exemple, les bases sur lesquelles les machines devaient \u00eatre assises.\nCes bases devaient \u00eatre faites par la Canadian Rubber Company. Elle les a fait faire par un fabricant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al; mais comme les machines avaient \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9es sur ces bases-l\u00e0, il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s important qu\u2019elles fussent essay\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avance pour que ces machines qui demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre install\u00e9es avec beaucoup de soin fissent les travaux qu\u2019on attendait d\u2019elles. L\u2019appelante a fait transporter ces bases \u00e0 sa manufacture \u00e0 Peter boro pour faire ces essais.\nIl y a divergence d\u2019opinion dans la preuve \u00e0 ce sujet. Quelques t\u00e9moins disent que ces essais \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires; d\u2019autres disent que c\u2019\u00e9tait inutile.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour de Revision, sur ce point aussi bien que sur les autres, qu\u2019il est inutile de discuter, sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que sur ces faits l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait r\u00e9ussir.\nIl est bien difficile pour nous de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ces d\u00e9cisions concurrentes des deux cours inf\u00e9rieures. Il s\u2019agit, comme on le voit, d\u2019une question de faits; et, suivant la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie de cette cour, nous ne devons intervenir que lorsqu\u2019il y a une injustice bien flagrante et bien \u00e9vidente.\nDans ces circonstances, je suis d\u2019opinion que le jugement de la Cour de Revision doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nOn a dit que le contrat en question en cette cause-ci, \u00e9tant un contrat commercial, devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant la loi anglaise.\nJe ne puis pas accepter ce principe.

The city corporation accepted the tender, but only on the condition that the steel and iron work should be purchased by the defendants from another firm.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 24 k.B. 389), Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that, on a proper construction, the agreement contemplated a contract to be entered into on terms consistent with whatever contract might have to be made with the city; that the nature of the condition imposed by the city corporation made it impossible for the defendants to purchase the necessary steel and iron work from the plaintiffs, and that, without fault on the part of the defendants, the agreement never became operative and both parties were liberated from obligation thereunder.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], whereby the judgment of Dorion J., in the Superior Court, District of Quebec, in favour of the plaintiffs, was varied by reducing the amount of the judgment entered for them from $1,982 to $1,482, with costs against the defendants in the Superior Court and costs against the plaintiffs on the appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIn the circumstances stated in the head-note, the plaintiffs brought the action for breach of the agreement to enter into the contract therein mentioned and claimed damages as follows, viz., $182 for their expenses incurred in taking measurements and preparation of the plans in order to enable them to make a tender; $3,100 for profits expected from the execution of the works in question, and $2,330 for damages resulting from being deprived of the benefit of being contractors for the construction of works of an important public character in such a prominent situation and the loss of the advantages that they would thereby have obtained in the way of (advertisement of their capability in matters of construction of that nature. The trial judge allowed the first item in full, also 10% profit on the estimated cost of the works contemplated to be done by the plaintiffs, amounting to $1,300, and $500 for loss of advertisement, thus making $1,982 for which judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiffs with costs. On the appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the trial court judgment was reduced by the disallowance of the item of $500 for loss of advertisement and affirmed as to the balance, $1,482, with costs as stated above.\nFrom the latter judgment the defendants appealed to have the action dismissed with costs and the defendants, by cross-appeal, sought to have the judgment of the Superior Court restored. L. A. Taschereau K.C. for the appellants and cross-respondents.\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the respondents and cross-appellants.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellants are general contractors and, as such, made, in competition with others, a tender for the reconstruction of the Dufferin Terrace in the City of Quebec. After consideration, the Road Committee decided to recommend the appellants\u2019 tender for acceptance by the council as the most advantageous, but on the condition that they\u2014the appellants\u2014would purchase the steel and iron required for the execution of their contract from the Eastern Canada Steel Company, a local concern engaged in the manufacture and erection of steel and iron structures. The respondent company also carried on the same business at Quebec. The council, adopting the recommendation of the Road Committee, awarded the contract to the appellants.\nA letter purporting to set forth an agreement theretofore made between the appellants and the respondents was written about the time the tender was being considered by the council; but this letter, although drafted by the respondents on August 21st, was not signed until the 24th August by the appellants. That letter is in these words:\u2014\nQuebec, August 21st, 1914.\nObject: New Dufferin Terrace.\nMessrs. Sharpe Construction Company,\n109 Fleurie Street, Quebec.\nGentlemen,\u2014This will confirm our verbal agreement to the effect that you hereby bind yourself to sign a contract with us for furnishing and erecting complete the structural steel work for the New Dufferin Terrace for the sum of $11,400 (eleven thousand four hundred dollars), as soon as your contract with the City of Quebec for the work is executed, it being understood that this price covers a structure comprising columns, beams, ties with fittings complete, capable of supporting wooden joists and wooden floor consistent with the requirements of the specifications for Steel Superstructures of Bridges and Viaducts of the Department of Railways and Canals of Canada, and it being further understood that this structure be subject to the approval of the City of Quebec.\nThis also confirms our verbal agreement that in case the City of Quebec does not approve of a structure as above mentioned, that immediately following the signing of your contract with the City of Quebec, you hereby bind yourself to sign a contract with us for the furnishing and erecting of the structural steel work completely erected in place for the New Dufferin Terrace, for the sum of $13,000 (thirteen thousand dollars). Said structure to comprise columns, beams, ties and fittings and to be capable of supporting a uniformly distributed live load of 140 lbs. per sq. ft., floor construction to be of wooden joists and planking.\nIt is further understood and agreed that either of the contracts mentioned above will be consistent with the conditions in your contract with the City of Quebec.\nYours very truly,\nMasson, Limit\u00e9e,\nAccepted: E. D. Kellogg,\nSharpe Construction Co., Ing. in charge.\nA. Laurent.\nW. Sharpe.\nIt will not be necessary to consider the legal effect of the vague and ambiguous language used in the first two paragraphs. This appeal turns upon the meaning attributable to the last paragraph and more particularly to the governing word \u201cconsistent.\u201d To properly appreciate the effect of the language used, it is important to consider the circumstances under which the letter was written. It is apparent upon the evidence that the paragraph now directly in question was added to the letter at the instance of the appellants and for their protection and, in view of the then existing situation, it was a very elementary precaution to take because, at the date the letter was signed, not only did both parties know that the appellants\u2019 tender was accepted subject to the condition that the steel required should be purchased from the Eastern Canada Steel Co., but a contract containing that condition was actually prepared by the city notary and ready for appellants\u2019 signature. One should not lightly assume that in those circumstances the appellants would give an absolute undertaking to sublet the same work to the respondent company.\nLet us now analyze the language used, because, of course,\nall contracts must be construed according to the primary and natural meaning of the language in which the contracting parties have chosen to express the terms of their mutual agreement.\nEvidently the appellants must not be presumed to have intended to bind themselves to do more than to give the contract to the respondents if they could do so consistently with the terms of their own contract with the city. It is not to be assumed that their intention was to obligate themselves without consideration to give a contract which it was impossible for them to carry out. The respondents, who drafted the letter and are, therefore, responsible for the choice of words, say:\u2014\nIt is further understood and agreed that either of the contracta mentioned above will be consistent with the conditions in your contract with the City of Quebec.\nBearing in mind that the dictionary meaning of the word \u201cconsistent\u201d is \u201ccompatible with,\u201d \u201cnot contradictory of,\u201d the sentence must be read to mean that the appellants obligate themselves to enter into a contract with the respondents only if such a contract would be compatible with and not contradictory of the conditions in their own contract with the city. And could anything be more incompatible with or more contradictory of that condition of the contract with the city by which they bound themselves to give the preference to the Eastern Canada Steel Company than an undertaking to give the respondent company the steel work for the terrace? And that it was not intended when the letter was written to enter into a binding agreement such as is now relied upon is made absolutely clear by the evidence of Masson, one of the chief officials of the respondent company. Speaking of the letter, he says:\u2014\nQ. Maintenant, subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture des soumissions, avez-vous rencontr\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentants de la Sharpe Construction Company, lors de la signature du document produit comme exhibit P. 3?\nR. Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 les rencontrer a l\u2019instance de Monsieur Laurent et nous avons discut\u00e9 cette question-la justement et de la faire accepter par \u00e9crit.\nQ. Alors pour quelle raison, pour quel motif votre premier prix a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit \u00e0 treize mille piastres ($13,000)?\nR. Par le fait, il y avait dans le temps des pourparlers justement, qui pouvaient nous causer des embarras, et nous avons dit \u201cs\u2019ils \u00e9taient consentant de nous signer ce papier-l\u00e0, que nous consentirions \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la chose \u00e0 ce prix-l\u00e0, pour avoir le contract,\u201d pour lequel nous aurions le contract et qu\u2019ils nous promettent que en tant qu\u2019il serait en leur pouvoir, que le contract n\u2019aille \u00e0 aucune autre.\nIn those words, \u201cen tant qu\u2019il serait en leur pouvoir,\u201d we have the key to the meaning which the word \u201cconsistent\u201d had in the minds of both the parties.\nThe allegations of respondents\u2019 declaration also support that construction of the sentence. The claim for damages is largely, if not entirely, based not upon a breach of the written undertaking, but upon the allegation that, notwithstanding that undertaking, the appellants allowed the city to insert in their contract a condition which made it impossible for them\u2014the appellants\u2014to carry out their agreement with the respondents and on the evidence it is clear that the appellants were not privy in any way to the action of the City Council but, on the contrary, did all they could to get the consent of the city officials to give the work to the respondents.\nThe judgment in appeal proceeds on the assumption that the appellants distinctly connived at the insertion in their contract with the city of the condition giving the preference to the Eastern Canada Construction Company. Mr. Justice Pelletier, who gave the majority judgment below, says:\u2014\nSharpe a sign\u00e9 ce contrat et accept\u00e9 ces conditions qui lui faisaient manquer \u00e0 son contrat avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, sans m\u00eame en parler \u00e0 ce dernier; sa soumission pour les travaux \u00e0 faire \u00e0 la Terrasse \u00e9tait de $17,000 plus basse que les autres et le Conseil de Ville n\u2019aurait pas impos\u00e9 cette diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable aux contribuables si Sharpe avait voulu r\u00e9sister un peu, il n\u2019avait qu\u2019\u00e0 faire un semblant de r\u00e9sistance et dans quelques jours l\u2019affaire aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par l\u2019abandon de la condition impos\u00e9e par la ville.\nUpon the evidence I would reach a contrary conclusion. Laurent says:\u2014\nQ. Quant \u00e0 vous personnellement, comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Sharpe Construction Company, aviez-vous aucune objection quelconque \u00e0 ce que le contrat de l\u2019acier fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie Masson?\nR. Non monsieur, au contraire, j\u2019\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sireux, j\u2019aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sireux de lui donner le contrat.\nQ. Pourqoui ne leur avez-vous pas donn\u00e9?\nR. Par rapport \u00e0 cette clause qui nous obligeait de donner le contrat \u00e0 la Eastern Construction Company, c\u2019est ce qui m\u2019a fait.\n* * *\nQ. A la Eastern Canada Steel Company?\nR. Qui, monsieur, c\u2019est ce qui m\u2019a fait comprendre le notaire, quand nous avons sign\u00e9 le contrat.\nQ. Vous avez examin\u00e9 la chose avec le notaire?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Et le notaire a fait remarquer que?\nR. J\u2019aurais voulu exiger qu\u2019il enl\u00e8ve cette condition-la afin de nous permettre de donner le contrat \u00e0 ceux que nous aurions voulu; et le notaire a fait remarquer que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible qu\u2019il fallait signer le contrat tel qu\u2019\u00e9crit et nous conformer aux exigences.\n* * * Q. Pourquoi cette obligation-l\u00e0 se trouvait?\nR. Parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait car un ordre du Conseil qui mettait une clause pass\u00e9e par la ville, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire par le comit\u00e9 des chemins.\nQ. Approuv\u00e9e par le conseil?\nR. Approuv\u00e9e par le conseil.\nTo the same effect Sharpe and Drouin testify.\nTo repeat what I have already said, if the document relied upon is construed as it should be according to the primary and natural meaning of the language in which the contracting parties chose to express the terms of their mutual agreement, then the undertaking of the appellants was to give the steel work to the respondents if to do so would be compatible with the terms of their contract with the city. The language used, I submit respectfully, is not susceptible of being construed to mean that the appellants assumed to give respondents a contract which would in its terms conform to their contract with the city, as assumed by the trial judge, but to give them a contract, if they could do so consistently with the conditions of their contract with the city; and that is the only contract which in the circumstances business men could reasonably be expected to have made.\nI have gone carefully through all the evidence and can find nothing to justify in any way the suggestion of wrong-doing on the part of any member of the City Council. They were all examined as witnesses and, judged by the ordinary standard of municipal ethics, there is no ground of complaint. In any event, our sole duty is to interpret the agreement which the parties made and we have no mandate or authority to sit in judgment on the conduct of the members of the Quebec City Council.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the cross-appeal dismissed with costs. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellants being the successful tenderer\u2019s with the City of Quebec for certain work to be done to the new Dufferin Terrace in that city, at the tendered price of about $55,000, entered into a written agreement with the respondents binding themselves to sign a contract with the latter as soon as the contract with the City of Quebec was executed for the furnishing and erecting complete the structural steel work of the said terrace. It would appear from the agreement made between the parties hereto that the city had the right to adopt either one of the two alternative plans stated in the agreement under one of which the respondents were to furnish and erect complete the structural steel work of the terrace for $11,400, and under the other for $13,000.\nThen follows this clause:\u2014\nIt is further understood and agreed that either of the contracts mentioned above will be consistent of the with the conditions of your contract with the City of Quebec.\nAs a matter of fact, the City of Quebec caused, with the respondents\u2019 assent, the insertion of a clause in the contract professing to bind the appellants to give the preference to the Eastern Canada Steel Company, Limited, for the furnishing of the steel structure, provided the price they charged was not greater than other companies were prepared to supply such structure.\nThe appellants sought, under cover of this extraordinary clause, to the insertion of which in the contract with the city they had assented, to escape their contractual obligations to the respondents under the agreement made with them.\nIt does not seem possible that such an attempt could be successful. Both courts below have held adversely to such contention and I concur with them.\nThe language of the clause is ambiguous, I admit, just such curiously ambiguous language as gives rise to so much litigation in commercial and business contracts. It provides that either of the contracts specified in the agreement in question between the parties\nwill be consistent with the conditions in appellants\u2019 contract with the city.\nOne of such contracts was adopted by the city and inserted in the tenderer\u2019s contract, but to it was added the clause giving rise to the litigation.\nThat clause does not mean, however, that the appellant was to assent to the insertion of a clause in the city contract, which would completely annul his contract with the respondent.\nIt allows a latitude for the adoption of either of the contracts provided for in the agreement between the parties and probably also for changes Which the city might legitimately make in the size, character and strength of the works tendered for. Within that ambit, reasonable changes might possibly be required from the successful tenderer and to that extent the agreement between the parties might be moulded and its details changed. But I repeat that, whatever else it may mean, such a clause did not contemplate changes being made which completely destroyed the contract the parties had entered into between themselves and if given effect to would transfer to another rival company the work, labour and material which the respondents had agreed to supply at a stipulated price.\nI think also that the damages allowed are reasonable and that the respondents cannot recover the damages for which they have cross-appealed on the ground that they were not such as could be held to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into their agreement.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs and cross-appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellants tendered for work to be done by the municipal corporation of Quebec in response to an advertisement asking for tenders therefor according to certain specifications.\nThe tender put in by the appellants as found by the committee in charge of the business was the lowest and most advantageous, and reached a total of about fifty-five thousand dollars.\nThe next lowest exceeded this by about $17,000. The respondents had given appellants before the tender an estimate of $15,000 for the part in question herein. After the tenders had been opened the appellant succeeded in squeezing the respondent down from this price to the lower price of $13,000.\nA written agreement securing this was entered into between the parties hereto as follows:\u2014\nQuebec, August 21st, 1914.\nObject: New Duffer in Terrace.\nMessrs. Sharpe Construction Company,\n109 Fleurie Street, Quebec.\nGentlemen,\u2014This will confirm our verbal agreement to the effect that you hereby bind yourself to sign a contract with us for furnishing and erecting complete the structural steel work for the New Dufferin Terrace for the sum of $11,400 (eleven thousand four hundred dollars), as soon as your contract with the City of Quebec for the work is executed, it being understood that this price covers a structure comprising columns, beams, ties with fittings complete, capable of supporting wooden joists and wooden floor consistent with the requirements of the specifications for Steel Superstructures of Bridges and Viaducts of the Department of Railways and Canals of Canada, and it being further understood that this structure be subject to the approval of the City of Quebec.\nThis also confirms our verbal agreement that in case the City of Quebec does not approve of a structure as above mentioned, that immediately following the signing of your contract with the City of Quebec, you hereby bind yourself to sign a contract with us for the furnishing and erecting of the structural steel work completely erected in place for the New Dufferin Terrace, for the sum of $13,000 (thirteen thousand dollars). Said structure to comprise columns, beams, ties and fittings and to be capable of supporting a uniformly distributed live load of 140 lbs. per sq. ft., floor construction to be of wooden joists and planking.\nIt is further understood and agreed that either of the contracts mentioned above will be consistent with the conditions in your contract with the City of Quebec.\nYours very truly,\nMasson, Limit\u00e9e,\nAccepted: E. D. Kellogg,\nSharpe Construction Co., Ing. in charge.\nA. Laurent.\nW. Sharpe.\nThe city council in passing a resolution on the 21st of August, 1914, granting the contract to the appellant, inserted, without any reason being assigned therefor, the following clause, Which was carried into the contract:\u2014\nDans l\u2019achat de son acier, la compagnie dite \u201cSharpe Construction Company\u201d devra donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la \u201cEastern Canada Steel Company, Limited,\u2019 pourvu que les prix de cette compagnie ne soient pas plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux des autres compagnies pour la fourniture du dit acier.\nThereupon the appellants refused to carry out their contract with respondent making the foregoing the excuse for doing so. The courts below have held it was no excuse and the learned trial judge assessed the damages for breach of contract at $1,982 which was reduced by the court of appeal to $1,482 by the deduction of an item to which I will presently refer when I come to deal with the cross-appeal. The contention of appellants\u2019 is that the last sentence of the contract above quoted relative to the contract being inconsistent with the condition in appellants\u2019 contract with the city governs; and that the latter contract having inserted therein the clause copied from the resolution put an end to the contract sued upon.\nIt is quite clear that the contract with the city adopted in its entirety the second alternative, in the contemplation of the parties as set out in their contract, without the slightest variation.\nIt seems equally clear that it was only the possibility of some variation in that regard that the parties had in mind. Such, I take it, was the meaning which the business men who wrote it intended to give it. It certainly never was intended by the respondent that the instrument should not only give appellants the advantage of reaping the profit of $2,000 which appellants got thereby, but also furnish them with the means of thereby betraying the trust which the respondent had reposed in them. That, however, would be the net result of such an interpretation of the contract as appellants put forward.\nThe original tender given the appellants before their tender to the city by the Eastern Canada Steel Co., Ltd., was $4,000 in excess of this $13,000.\nIt certainly could not have been in the contemplation of either party hereto that such a reduction would be made, or that the city council would lend itself to the improper proceeding of favouring, without any other reason than mere favouritism, one city manufacturer over another in face of such a contract as set out above.\nSuch a proceeding was not, I venture to think, a thing that ever could have been anticipated by any one signing such a contract. If the appellants had disclosed such a purpose as possible they never would have got the respondent to sign and give them the $2,000 of advantage they have reaped by such signing.\nThe appellants were bound to see that the reasonable expectations of respondent under such a contract were realized.\nIt was not for them to execute a repudiation of it, for that is what it comes to if the clause has the effect they now pretend. However, the clause itself, I incline to hold null as being ultra vires and against public policy. The manifest tendency of such a mode of dealing on the part of municipal councils would be to produce that fraud and want of good faith pleaded herein and I submit rendered it objectionable on the latter ground.\nAnd I think it would have puzzled any one trying to enforce it to have found it intra vires unless something else put forward than appears in the evidence herein or in the city charter. Counsel could not refer us to anything in the latter maintaining it. The pleading not having set up exactly this view, but the more extreme one of fraud, it is not now open to respondent, save in the way of illustrating the real nature of what the appellants assented to, and their unjustifiable excuse for doing so. That certainly cannot fall within the last sentence of the contract as touching what the parties must be presumed to have understood.\nAppellants urge that, in any event, the sum of $180 for expenses of preparing plans, etc., ought not to have been allowed.\nThe rather ingenious argument of Mr. Taschereau in regard to this claim that the item of $1,300 for loss of profits impliedly covered it, is, I think, unsound.\nThe $1,300 for loss of profits only compensates for loss of profits presumably got after the respondent had been recouped, for all his expenditure, including this item in the execution of the work.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe respondent cross-appeals in respect of $500 allowed by the learned trial judge on account of the advertising advantages it might have acquired by doing the work in a creditable manner in such a public place as where the work was to have been executed.\nWork well done and the good quality of goods supplied count for much, no doubt, in the way of business success, and are the very best advertisements any man can present to the world, but I hardly think the loss of opportunity in such regard has ever been held as an element properly entering into the assessment of damages for breach of a contract.\nThe only cases I can recall wherein such an element has been allowed to enter into the assessment of damages are actions for libel or slander or such like action which involve undesired or undesirable advertisement.\nI think the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The agreement upon which the action is brought is in the following terms:\u2014\nQuebec, August 21st, 1914.\nObject: New Dufferin Terrace.\nMessrs.

Sharpe.\nIn construing this document there are two general considerations which I think it is important to keep in mind.\nFirst, it is an informal letter containing proposals not intended to be proposals which, on acceptance, shall constitute a contract for the sale of steel or for the erection of a steel structure, but proposals for entering into a presently binding agreement that, in a certain event, namely, the awarding of a certain contract by the council of the City of Quebec to the appellants, the parties shall sign contracts for the erection of the steel structure of the Dufferin Terrace by the appellants and providing in a general way for the nature of the contracts so to be entered into.\nSecondly, that in construing such a document all the parts of it must be read together and each construed by the light of all the others and that especially in case of such an informal document it is important to read the language of the document in the light of the existing circumstances so far as known to both parties and with reference to which they must be assumed to have been contracting.\nNow, at the time the appellants signified their acceptance of the respondents\u2019 proposal and some hours before that, it was known to tooth parties that it was quite possible that the municipality would insist upon stipulating as one of the terms of their contract that the steel should be purchased from the Eastern Canada Steel Co. The parties no doubt hoped that they would succeed in inducing the council not to insist upon this condition, but the fact that they were threatened with it was known to them both; and it is in light of the fact that this contingency was present to their minds that the proposals contained in this letter must be read.\nAnd what meaning are we then to attribute to the last paragraph?\nIt is further understood and agreed that either of the contracts mentioned above will be consistent with the conditions in your contract with the City of Quebec.\nThe \u201ccontracts mentioned above\u201d are the contracts which the parties proposed to enter into after the contract with the municipality should be signed. The parties bind themselves to enter into contracts of the general description set forth in the first two paragraphs of the letter, but subject to the proviso that these contracts must be consistent with the \u201cconditions\u201d of the municipal contract, that is to say, must be capable of being being carried out consistently with due performance of the obligations created by the municipal contract. There can be no doubt in my view that the language taken in its primary sense limits the obligation of both parties to entering into contracts which shall be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the contract with the municipality; an obligation, therefore, which only becomes operative in the event of the contract with the municipality being of such a character as to permit the parties making and carrying out the contracts proposed. That being the effect of the language of this letter, I confess that, with great respect to others who take a contrary view, I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the proper construction of the document is this very construction which is suggested by an examination of the words themselves.\nIn truth the contention of the respondents seems to me, with great respect, really to involve a more or less palpable petitio principii (notwithstanding the disguises which skilful advocacy has designed for it). The argument really rests upon the assumption that the essence of the agreement was that the appellants undertook not to enter into a contract with the municipality which did not permit them to purchase the steel from the respondents. The intention to enter into such an undertaking is not declared in express terms by this document which provides that any contract to be entered into by the appellants with the respondents must be capable of execution consistently with the obligations of their contract with the municipality. No such undertaking can be implied from the document read as a whole in the light of the circumstances because it is impossible to say from anything before us that such a stipulation was necessary to give effect to the objects of the parties as disclosed by the document; and still less can it be said that reasonable and honest business men if they had thought of the contingency which happened would certainly have stipulated expressly as it is contended they did stipulate impliedly, because the fact is that they had in mind that very contingency and this very document which was prepared by the respondents and proposed by them as expressing the terms of their contract contains no such stipulation.\nIt is needless to say that a very different question might have been presented for decision if the respondents had proved that the appellants had by their own conduct brought about the insertion in the municipal contract of the stipulation requiring the steel made use of to be purchased from the Eastern Canada Steel Co.\nAnglin J.\u2014With Mr. Justice Pelletier I have found some difficulty in giving to the concluding clause in the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 21st August, 1914, the construction for which the defendants contend. The word \u201cconsistent\u201d is certainly not the most apt to express the idea which they maintain it was intended to embody. But, read in the light of the circumstances under which it was written, it would seem probable that by the clause in question the parties must have meant not merely to provide for alterations in the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants so as to make it conform in minor details to the terms of any contract which the municipality should exact from the defendants, but also to provide against liability of the defendants to the plaintiffs if the municipal council should insist upon making their contract subject to any condition which would disable the defendants from entering into a sub-contract with the plaintiffs. The municipal council did insist on such a condition. There is nothing in the record which indicates anything in the nature of connivance or collusion on the part of the defendants. On the contrary, they appear to have acted with scrupulous good faith towards the plaintiffs.\nI would, therefore, allow this appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout, substantially for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cross and concurred in by Mr. Justice Lavergne in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action on dommages pour inex\u00e9cution de contrat.\nLes appelants avaient soumissionn\u00e9 pour la reconstruction de la terrasse Dufferin, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. La cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, qui faisait ex\u00e9cuter ces travaux \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter la soumission des appelants, mais \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019en achetant leur acier ils donnent la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Eastern Canada Steel Company.\nLes appelants, qui pour faire leur soumission avaient eu des prix de la compagnie intim\u00e9e, mirent cette derni\u00e8re au courant de cette condition; et, de concert avec elle, firent aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s municipales des d\u00e9marches dans le but d\u2019induire ces derni\u00e8res \u00e0 accepter leur soumission purement et simplement.\nAu cours de ces d\u00e9marches, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les appelants ont fait une convention par laquelle les appelants s\u2019obligeaient de prendre leur acier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e si la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec leur confiait la reconstruction de la terrasse suivant l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des plans sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s, ajoutant en outre:\u2014\nIt is further understood and agreed that either of the contracts mentioned above will be consistent with the conditions in your contract with the City of Quebec.\nLes n\u00e9gotiations se poursuivirent avec la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec et cette derni\u00e8re refusa d\u2019enlever la stipulation favorable \u00e0 la Eastern Canada Steel Company.\nLes appelants sugg\u00e9r\u00e8rent ensuite \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de diminuer son prix afin qu\u2019ils soient lib\u00e9r\u00e9s de cette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui devait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Eastern Canada Steel; mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e refusa et alors ils furent oblig\u00e9s de donner le sous-contrat \u00e0 cette autre compagnie.\nToute la question repose sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette convention intervenue entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les appelants.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que les appelants \u00e9taient tenus du moment qu\u2019ils avaient le contrat avec la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, de lui donner la fourniture de l\u2019acier.\nLes circonstances, il me semble, ne pourraient pas autoriser une semblable interpr\u00e9tation du contrat. Les parties, quand elles ont fait leur convention, connaissaient les exigences de la ville de Qu\u00e9bec; et vouloir dire que les appelants se seraient engag\u00e9s formellement de donner le contrat \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u00eame si la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec persistait dans sa clause pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentielle para\u00eetrait absolument extraordinaire.\nLa convention a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame. Dans le cas de doute elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e contre celle qui a stipul\u00e9 et en faveur de celui qui a contract\u00e9 l\u2019obligation (art. 1019 C.C.).\nSi la stipulation que nous avons cit\u00e9e textuellement ne s\u2019y trouvait pas, il y aurait peut-\u00eatre doute de savoir si les d\u00e9fendeurs se seraient oblig\u00e9s, au cas o\u00f9 ils auraient le contrat de la ville de Qu\u00e9bec, de donner le sous-contrat \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Mais cette stipulation est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les obligations du sous-contrat seront compatibles (consistent) avec les conditions du contrat principal.\nLe mot \u201cconsistent,\u201d dans ces circonstances, peut pr\u00eater \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes interpretations. Ce contrat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et examin\u00e9 par des hommes de loi; mais il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 par des hommes d\u2019affaires et il n\u2019y a pas de doute, suivant moi, que l\u2019intention des parties \u00e9tait que s\u2019ils pouvaient r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre cette condition ins\u00e9r\u00e9e par la ville de Qu\u00e9bec, ou s\u2019ils pouvaient de toute autre mani\u00e8re faire dispara\u00eetre cette stipulation, alors le sous-contrat irait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSi nous examinons m\u00eame le sens litt\u00e9ral de la lettre en question, sans examiner les circonstances particuli\u00e8res dans lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite, je crois que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pourrait pas \u00e9galement r\u00e9ussir.\nEn effet, les demandeurs auraient dit: Nous sommes bien pr\u00eats \u00e0 vous donner le sous-contrat pour l\u2019acier, mais aux m\u00eames conditions que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec nous imposera.\nOr, l\u2019une de ces conditions-la \u00e9tait de donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une certaine compagnie pour l\u2019achat de l\u2019acier. Rien de plus facile alors pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accepter cette condition-la. Il lui aurait fallu simplement donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son achat pour l\u2019acier \u00e0 la Compagnie Eastern Canada Steel. De sorte que si nous examinons soigneusement les circonstances de la cause, si nous prenons en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019intention des parties, et si nous prenons m\u00eame la lettre du contrat la demanderesse intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas en droit de poursuivre les d\u00e9fendeurs-appelants pour inex\u00e9cution d\u2019obligation.\nDans ces circonstances, je consid\u00e8re que le jugement a quo doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures et que l\u2019 action de la de-manderesse-intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon & Parent.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Galipeault, St. Laurent, M\u00e9tayer & Lafert\u00e9.\n[1] Q.R. 24 K.B. 389.\n",

R.S.C., 1906, c. 35, s. 7.\nPer Curiam.\u2014The jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada is not, by the effect of the provisions of section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d limited to adjudication upon claims for compensation in consequence of expropriation proceedings in regard to which there has been only partial abandonment of the property taken, but extends as well to claims made in cases where the whole of the property has been abandoned.

C.R. 157) affirmed.\nUnder the provisions of section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d the person from whom re-vested land has been taken is entitled to compensation for damages sustained in consequence of the expropriation proceedings in the event of abandonment of the whole parcel of land as well as in the case of the abandonment of a portion thereof only. Idington J. dubitante.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d applies in matters of expropriation for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway under the provisions of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d;\u2014Per Anglin J. It was so held in The King v. Jones (44 Can. S.C.R. 495); Duff J. contra. Per Duff J.\u2014The Minister of Railways and Canals has not, by virtue of the 23rd section of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d authority to abandon lands compulsorily taken for the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway which have become vested in the Crown by force of the 13th section of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d Section 207 of the \u201cRailway; Act\u201d is not incorporated in the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d by force of the 15th section of that statute.\nOn the merits of the appeal, Davies, Idington and Brodeur JJ. considered that, in the circumstances, the amount of the award for damages made by the judgment appealed from (15 Ex. C.R. 157) was sufficient, and that the appeal should be dismissed. The Chief Justice and Anglin J held that the appeal should be allowed and the case remitted to the Exchequer Court for the purpose of estimating damages on the basis of allowing suppliants the value of the land at the date of expropriation less its value at the time of the abandonment. Duff J. was of opinion that the suppliants were entitled to the full compensation tendered by the Crown for the land taken, but, having accepted the property as returned and agreed to credit its diminished value in part satisfaction of their claim, the appeal should be allowed and damages awarded estimated according to the difference between the admitted value of the land to them when taken and its value at the date of the abandonment. Consequently, on equal division of opinion among the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, the judgment appealed from (15 Ex. C.R. 157) stood affirmed, no costs being allowed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], declaring that the suppliants were entitled to recover only $3,000 on their petition of right.\nIn 1911, land belonging to the suppliants was taken by the Crown for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway and an information was filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada by the Attorney-General for Canada in which the circumstances of the expropriation were set out, offering to pay $61,447.75 as full compensation and asking for a declaration that the land had vested in the Crown and that the amount tendered was sufficient compensation. This offer was accepted by the suppliants. Before the case came before the court for decision and about fifteen months after the land had been taken, the Minister of Railways and Canals and the Commissioners of the National Transcontinental Railway served notice on the suppliants, stated to be given pursuant to section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d section 207 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and section 15 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d as well as any other authority in that behalf, that the land was not required for the purposes of the railway and was abandoned by the Commissioners, Thereupon, the proceedings taken by the Attorney-General were discontinued and the suppliants brought the action, by petition of right in the Exchequer Court, claiming compensation in consequence of the expropriation proceedings and the effect of the abandonment. The claim made by the suppliants amounted to $31,747.75, being the balance of the sum which had been tendered by the Crown at the time of the expropriation plus $500 for special expenses incurred in the re-valuation of the property after deduction of $30,000 estimated as the value of the land, in its depreciated condition, at the time of the abandonment. By the judgment appealed from the suppliants were awarded $3,000 as full compensation for damages incidental to the prejudice caused by the expropriation proceedings and damages were refused to them on account of the alleged depreciation resulting from material alterations in the locus by the demolition of a public market-house and other buildings adjacent to the land of the suppliants. The respondent, by a cross-appeal, contended that there had been no claim made by the suppliants for loss of rent and, consequently, the Exchequer Court had no right to grant damages in that respect; that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate in regard to the claim as made, and that the amount of $3,000 awarded included indirect damages, not resulting from the expropriation, which ought not to have been allowed.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for appellants, cross-respondents.\nE. Belleau K.C. for respondent, cross-appellant.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Assuming as both parties to this appeal appear to have assumed throughout that the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d is applicable to these proceedings, I am of opinion that the assistant judge of the Exchequer Court has misapprehended the provision of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d governing this matter. The wording of the statute is simple and its meaning, I think, plain. Failure to regard the words of the statute has led to the confusion and difficulties which the learned judge discusses in his judgment occupying, many pages of the printed case.\nThe lands in this case were taken under the powers vested in the Commissioners of the Transcontinental Railway by the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d 3 Edw. VII., ch. 71. These powers which are contained in section 13 are, so far as material, very similar to those in section 8 of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d This section 13 provides by sub-section 1:\u2014 The Commissioners may enter upon and take possession of any lands required for the purposes of the Eastern Division and they shall lay off such lands by metes and bounds, and deposit of record a description and plan thereof in the office for the registry of deeds, or the land titles office for the county or registration district in which such lands are respectively situate; and such deposit shall act as a dedication to the public of such lands, which shall thereupon be vested in the Crown, saving always the lawful claim to compensation of any person interested therein.\nThe provisions of section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d are, I think, applicable to expropriations under the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d; see the case in this court of The King v. Jones[2].\nThis section 23, so far as material, provides by sub-section 1 that\nwhenever, from time to time, or at any time before the compensation money has been actually paid, any parcel of land taken for a public work, is found to be unnecessary for the purposes of such public work, the Minister may, by writing under his hand, declare that the land is not required and is abandoned by the Crown.\nAnd sub-section 2:\u2014\nUpon such writing being registered in the office of the registrar of deeds for the county or registration division in which the land is situate such land declared to be abandoned shall revest in the person from whom it was taken.\nAnd sub-section 4:\u2014\nThe fact of such abandonment or re-vesting shall be taken into account in connection with all the other circumstances of the case, in estimating or assessing the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for the land taken.\nIt will be observed that this section makes no new provision as to any compensation or damages to be paid as between the Crown and the person claiming compensation for the land taken, but only declares that the fact of the abandonment shall be taken into account in estimating the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for the land taken. The law casts the inheritance of land upon the heir and he is the only person in whom it vests lands without his consent.\nThe power conferred upon the Minister by this section is a very exceptional one since it enables him to vest the land in a person even against his will. We might expect that the rights of persons affected by this arbitrary power would be carefully safeguarded by the legislature and that is what in fact we do find, for I do not know that protection in a wider form could be afforded to their interests than it is by subsection 4 of section 23. This gives the court the most ample and general authority by simply providing that in estimating the compensation to be paid for the land taken the fact of the abandonment is to be taken into account.\nBy section 30 it is provided that if the injury to land injuriously affected by the construction of any public work may be removed wholly or in part, by (amongst other things) the abandonment of any portion of the land taken from the claimant, and the Crown undertakes to abandon such portion\nthe damages shall be assessed in view of such undertaking.\nThe intention of the legislature is, I think, the same in the rule, laid down in both sections 23 and 30, that the fact of the abandonment of the land is to be taken into account in assessing in one case the compensation for the land taken and in the other for the injury to land injuriously affected.\nThe values of the laud at the date of the expropriation and at the date of the abandonment have to be ascertained in the ordinary way but otherwise, in my view, it is immaterial to inquire what were the causes of the value of the land at these dates. The value of the land at the time of the expropriation is ordinarily the compensation which the owner is entitled to claim. I refer to sec. 47 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d and also to the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[3], to the effect that the compensation to be paid for land expropriated is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking. If, by the inverse process to expropriation, the Minister forcibly vests the property in him again, the value of the land to the owner at the time of such revesting is an element to be considered in estimating the amount to be paid to him.\nSuppose a business that has had to be removed when the property was expropriated; the property is abandoned by the Crown; the business cannot be moved back again; it may be years before the value can be realized, and meantime the owner is compelled to hold it for its speculative prospective value. In taking into account the fact of the abandonment it might in such case he that only the immediate value would be allowed by the court as a deduction from the compensation.\nIn a somewhat involved statement which, however, is baldly printed, the learned judge suggests that if the Crown is to bear decrease in the value of the land, it should benefit by any appreciation. He forgets, however, that this is an entirely one-sided power and that while the Crown is not obliged to exercise it and would presumably only do so when such exercise would be beneficial to its interests, it would obviously be impossible to force upon the former owner the property for which he may have no use and which he may not want and at the same time call on him to pay for getting it a sum in excess of the compensation to which he was entitled on the expropriation.\nThe form in which the proceedings were brought before the court, may have induced the error into which I think the assistant judge of the Exchequer Court has fallen. It is not, as he says, an action for damages resulting from the abandonment. Briefly, he has treated the matter as if it were an option which the Crown took on the property until the payment of the compensation with a liability if it did not exercise the option to pay any damages caused the owner. That, however, is not what the statute does. It provides that, on the expropriation, the lands\nshall be vested in the Crown saving always the lawful claim to compensation of any person interested therein.\nThe present case is remarkable from the fact that the Government had the property valued and filed an information in the Exchequer Court setting forth that His Majesty was willing to pay compensation to the amount of $61,747.75. This sum, the defendants by their statement of defence accepted. The parties were thus completely ad idem, the land was transferred to and vested in the Crown and the compensation agreed on. Then by the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d as amended by 3 Edw. VII., ch. 22, there is added the power which may never be exercised, of abandoning and re-vesting the property in the original owner. It is more like the case between subjects of an agreement for sale at a valuation with an agreement superadded that the vendor will, at the option of the purchaser, within a given time re-purchase at the then valuation of the property. The cases are not, of course, identical, because the powers of the Crown both of taking and abandoning the land are compulsory, and as I have before said, I do not think the value at the time of revesting is necessarily the amount for which the owner of the land should be called on to give credit.\nAlthough the appellants may not be free from blame for the form in which their claim was presented to the court, yet the basis of the judgment, being an erroneous construction of the statute, justice requires that the case should be sent back to the Exchequer Court to determine and award the amount to be paid to the appellants in respect of their claim for compensation for the lands taken, taking into account in assessing such amount, the fact of the abandonment in connection with all the other circumstances of the case.\nI may add that I entertain no doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, but if it were necessary to invoke it, I think the claim would be within paragraph (d) of section 20 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act.\u201d\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada awarding the suppliant $3,000 for damages sustained by him by reason of the abandonment and re-vestment in the owners of a property in the City of Quebec, which had been expropriated by the Government of Canada for the National Transcontinental Railway.\nThe suppliant claimed that the lands and buildings had been expropriated in January, 1911, and had not been revested in them until July, 1912, and that while they were admittedly worth $61,747.75 in 1911 (that being the sum the Government tendered and the suppliant agreed to accept as their value) they had shrunk in value when re-vested to the sum of $30,000, the difference being the damages the suppliant sought to recover, viz., $31,747.75.\nThe evidence established the fact that there was a \u201cboom\u201d in lands in that part of the City of Quebec, where the property in question was situate, at and about the time these lands were expropriated, brought about in large measure by the belief current amongst the citizens that the principal or terminal station of the National Transcontinental Railway Avas to be built on the site then occupied by the Champlain Market on or towards which the buildings on the lands in question fronted. That the value of these lands consisted largely in the fact that they so fronted on this market place on one side or end and on the river front on the other where the farmers came with their boats and produce to the market and that this fortunate conjunction enabled the owners to rent their buildings for shops, stalls and stores at very high rentals. That the general anticipation was that the removal of the market house would be followed by the building on its site and the adjoining lands of the principal station of the National Transcontinental Railway and that the subsequent change of plans, the demolition and removal of the market house to another site, and the construction of the principal station elsewhere caused a collapse of the boom and a great depreciation in nominal land values, and by reason of these facts, as stated in the suppliant\u2019s petition of right, his lot of land and buildings when returned by the Crown had depreciated in value to the extent of $31,747.75.\nThat these were reasons and causes of the high values placed upon the site and lands when expropriated and those placed upon them when returned were clearly proved by the suppliant\u2019s own witnesses Collier, Hearn and Colston and were indeed claimed as existing facts and their reasons in the suppliant\u2019s petition.\nThis claim was not allowed by the trial judge for obvious and clear reasons. The Crown had the right to expropriate the market site and buildings, to demolish the latter and build their principal terminal station on that site and the adjoining properties they expropriated or to change the terminal station site elsewhere without being responsible for the rise or diminution in value of any properties expropriated or otherwise which such changes might cause.\nThe statutory right to abandon and revest these expropriated properties in their owners could, no doubt, only be exercised subject to the payment of such damages or losses as might have been caused to the owner in consequence of the Crown\u2019s proceedings; but the sudden rise or fall in the value of the properties arising from such causes as I have mentioned could not possibly be held to be such a \u201ccircumstance in the case\u201d as should be taken into account\nin estimating or assessing the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for the land taken.\n(See sub-section 4 of section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 143.)\nThey were not special damages suffered by this land alone, but such as were shared in common by the land owners generally in the neighbourhood. They were not caused by the expropriation and the subsequent revestment of appellant\u2019s land, but by the change of market-site and transcontinental principal station-site and, in fact, had nothing to do directly with either of these acts of expropriation and re-vestment. This sudden rise and fall in the temporary speculative value of lands in that section of the city were, no doubt, as shewn by the evidence, caused by public belief that the market-house site would become the terminal site of the Transcontinental, and to the subsequent change in that respect made in the Government\u2019s plans.\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, and with the evidence before him the learned trial judge was right in my judgment in rejecting these fluctuating or speculative prices as the standard by which to estimate suppliant\u2019s damages. He allowed $3,000 as a fair and liberal allowance, I think, for the loss of rents the owners sustained during the period between expropriation and re-vestment of the property. The owner\u2019s possession had never been disturbed and he continued to draw the rents which were shewn to have been substantially reduced. The owner also escaped the payment of the taxes during the same period, which I \u201cshould think must have been considerable.\nIf, however, the owner had lost or been deprived of his right to have sold his property at the high speculative values which may have been reached and had given any evidence to that effect I should certainly think such loss a legitimate damage which could be recovered because it would be special damage caused by direct interference with his right to sell his property. If his jus disponendi had been, not technically but actually, prevented by the expropriation and he had given any evidence to shew that he had actually lost a sale at the highest figures spoken of I see no reason why he should not be compensated for that loss. The rule laid down in the Cedar Rapids Case[4], by the Judicial Committee, at pages 596-7, is that the compensation to be paid for land, expropriated is\nthe value to the owner as it existed at the day of the taking.\nIt would seem to follow that in the case of lands expropriated by the Crown, with this statutory right of re-vestment subsequently exercised, the loss which the owner actually sustained by reason of his being deprived of the right to dispose of the property during the time the title was in the Crown would \u2018be the measure of his damages. In the absence of any evidence of an offer to purchase the suppliant\u2019s right in the land, the question would be: What would they have brought in the market if put up at auction subject to the exercise of the re-vestment power by the Crown? Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste4, at page 579. See also Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[5].\nThe learned trial judge reviews the evidence given on this question and concludes most fairly, I think, that\nit is impossible to find from it that an offer for either $60.000 or $70,000 was ever made the suppliant for the property before the expropriation.\nHe might have added or for any other sum either before expropriation or afterwards before re-vestment, for no specific offer ever was shewn to have been made by any one. The best that could be said for the evi- dence on this point was Ramsay\u2019s statement that inquiries were made by speculators, after expropriation, who were willing to consider these large sums. But nothing ever came of their consideration.\nA syndicate of speculators was considering the matter, so Mr. Hearn said:\u2014\nWe had that in mind ($60,000). I don\u2019t know that I would have given that for it. We had in mind that it was worth $60,000.\nBut no offer ever was made to buy before or after expropriation nor, in my judgment, does the evidence shew that any chance of a sale at these figures was lost. Can it be doubted that if the existence of any such offer could have been proved it would have been, or if the reasonable chance of selling at the price of $60,000 could have been shewn that it would have been shewn?\nIt has been suggested that the case might be referred back and the suppliant given another \u201cday in court\u201d to try and prove this loss, but I can see no reason or ground for such an unusual course and because of the absence of any such evidence as I have referred to and because I think the damages awarded ample I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent on behalf of the National Transcontinental Railway, pursuant to the authority of 3 Edw. VII., ch. 71, on 24th January, 1911, deposited in the registry office in Quebec, a plan and description of certain lands to be expropriated to serve said enterprise, and amongst said lands was a parcel belonging to appellants.\nThe parties hereto being unable to agree as to the compensation to be given for appellants\u2019 lands, the respondent, on the 22nd October, 191\u00cc, filed an information in the Exchequer Court of Canada for the purpose of determining same and offered thereby the sum of $61,747.75 in payment thereof.\nThe appellants pleaded thereto accepting said price.\nOn the 19th March, 1912, respondent filed a discontinuance, and on the fifteenth day of July, 1912, the Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada, gave notice to the appellants that the lands so taken were not required for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway and that the proceedings were abandoned by the Crown.\nThereupon the appellants, on the 22nd March, 1913, filed a petition of right in said Exchequer Court setting forth the foregoing facts and further alleging that respondent became thereby proprietor of said land and\nthat the land was abandoned in the month of July, 1912, subject to paying compensation to the suppliants (now appellants) for the value of the land so taken and the damages accruing by reason thereof.\nThe petition proceeded as follows:\u2014\n9. The said land was, on the 24th day of January, 1911, of the value of $61,747.75, and at the time that the said land was returned, to your suppliants, in the month of July, 1912, it had a value of $30,000 only.\n10. On the 24th of January, 1911, the said lot was situate on a street bounding the Champlain Market, a large and much frequented market place in the City of Quebec, and it was anticipated at that time that the said market if removed would be replaced by the principal station of the National Transcontinental Railway, and in fact His Majesty the King was under contract with the City of Quebec, to which the said market place belonged, to replace the said market by the principal station of the said National Transcontinental Railway in the City of Quebec.\n11. In the month of July, 1912, when the said property was abandoned to your suppliants, the Champlain market had been removed and destroyed, by and on behalf of His Majesty the King, and the proposal to erect the principal, or any, railway station for the National Transcontinental Railway had been abandoned, and by reason of the foregoing facts, the said lot of land when returned by His Majesty the King had depreciated in value to the extent of $31,747.75.\n12. The suppliants were put to great expense by reason of the taking of their said land by the Crown, and of the information filed for the purpose of determining the value thereof, to wit: in the sum of $500.\nI set forth in full the only claims set up in said petition so that there need be no misapprehension of what the claim herein is. There might, I suspect, have been other claims arising from the interference for a year and a half with the appellants\u2019 exercise of dominion over said lands or dealing with same. These, if any existed, are not presented by the pleading.\nThe appellants never were dispossessed. The proceeding, it is said now, though not so alleged in the pleading had injurious effect upon the appellants\u2019 profits derivable from the letting of parts thereof to tenants.\nSome of the leases had expired pending the proceedings before the abandonment.\nOn account of the anticipated expropriation being likely to be completed it was quite natural such tenants should look elsewhere for places of business, or perhaps take advantage of the uncertainty of tenure to get better terms.\nAlthough no case was made in regard thereto in the pleadings evidence was given relative to the subject of losses caused by reason of such disturbance of the tenants and prospective lettings.\nUpon that evidence the learned trial judge allowed the sum of $3,000 in way of compensation for past and future probable losses occasioned thereby and costs to be taxed.\nIn his opinion judgment, the learned trial judge held the appellants not entitled to recover in respect of the claims set out in above recited pleading.\nThe claim for costs in and about the information seems to have been dropped owing, it is alleged, to counsel for the appellants properly declining to be a witness.\nI presume the party and party costs were taxed against the Crown on the discontinuance.\nAnd if the solicitor and client costs could not be agreed upon as chargeable to the Crown, it is to be regretted.\nI think it is also to be regretted that no evidence was presented as to the amount of the usual assessment of the property, and taxes usually paid thereon. I understood it to be admitted that for two years pending the Crown\u2019s registration of title, no taxes were or could be imposed and, hence, appellants benefited to that extent as result of that registration.\nThe disturbing effect upon leaseholds of a proceeding such as taken and kept open so long may not be fully compensated for by what has been allowed, but that on the meagre evidence presented and no claim thereto having been made in pleading, seems to me all that can be claimed.\nThe claim made for the difference between alleged values on the date of registration of the plan and the date of abandonment is, in my view of the law, quite untenable even if these relative values had been established, which I think they were not.\nIt is quite true that the legal effect of the registration of the plans was to vest the title in the Crown, but that, as Mr. Belleau well put it, was subject as it were to a resolutory condition which, becoming operative, divested the title and re-vested it in the appellants.\nIn the case of land held for an investment the injurious effect of such a proceeding as this in question, beyond creating an uncertainty of tenure on the part of the tenants and the disturbing effect so far as detrimental to the landlord, can be very little.\nIn the case of land held for purposes of speculation, or owned for any purpose, being put on the market for sale, the possible loss of a sale in a fluctuating market, by such proceedings as registration of an expropriation plan, might prove serious.\nRut if one has such a case he must plead it and prove it. Here it is neither pleaded nor proven.\nAgain, it is to be observed that in such a case the conduct of the party who keeps silent and makes no move to expedite the disposition of the claim to expropriate has to be considered. He certainly has not the right to let things drift as the appellants did here, and neither do nor say anything to expedite matters, and then claim his damages must be based on the re-suit of the common neglect of himself and his opponent.\nThe non-registration of the notice of abandonment illustrates this.\nIt was quite competent for appellants to have got it registered and if the expenses attendant on that chargeable to the Crown, it would have come in as part of the compensation they would, in such case, have been entitled to.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. There is a cross-appeal which questions the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to determine the damages suffered herein.\nIt is, I think, doubtful if, and arguable that, the Exchequer Court has not by virtue of section 23, subsection 4, of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d jurisdiction to determine the compensation to be awarded in case of an entire abandonment of all claims to expropriation. That points to a case of damages being settled on the hearing of the information.\nBut, independently of that, I think that court has jurisdiction to give relief in any case of the Crown taking, either permanently or temporarily, the lands of a subject.\nIt has taken for eighteen months or more the lands of the appellants and they should, I imagine, in a proper case be entitled to have indemnity therefor from the Crown at the suit of a suppliant in the Exchequer Court.\nI think the cross-appeal should also be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014On the 24th of January, 1911, the lands in respect of the taking of which compensation is claimed by the appellants were taken for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway, under the authority of chapter 71, 3 Edw. VII., sec. 13, by the Commissioners appointed under that Act, who on that day deposited a description and a plan of the lands in the office of the registry of deeds for the City of Quebec. On the 21st of October of the same year, proceedings were taken by the Attorney-General of Canada, professedly under the authority of section 26 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d ch. 143, R.S.C., 1906, by way of information in the Exchequer Court of Canada on behalf of His Majesty, by which information it was alleged that by the deposit of the plan and the description just mentioned the lands had become and were then vested in His Majesty and by which it was declared that His Majesty was willing to pay the sum of $61,747.75 in full compensation for the claims of all the persons interested, and a declaration was prayed that the lands were so vested and that the sum mentioned was sufficient and just compensation.\nThe appellants by their defence alleged that they were the sole owners of the property, accepted the sum offered and prayed for judgment declaring that they were entitled to be paid the same. The statement of defence was filed in October, 1911, but the Attorney-General did not proceed to trial; and on the 19th of March, 1912, a notice of discontinuance was filed, and on the 15th July, 1912, the following notice signed by the Minister of Railways and Canals and by Mr. Leonard for the Commissioners of the National Transcontinental Railway was served upon the appellants:\u2014\nNotice of Abandonment of lands taken for the National Transcontinental Railway.\nIn the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nBetween:\nJAMES GIBB and FRANK ROSS,\nSuppliants;\nand\nTHE KING,\nRespondent.\nRegistered in registry office, July 27th, 1912.

Cochrane.\nMinister of Railways and Canals.\nThe Commissioners of the\nTranscontinental Railway.\nR. W. Leonaed,\nCommissioner.\nPer Secretary.\nOn the 19th of April, 1913, a petition of right was filed by the appellants claiming compensation and it is from the judgment given on the trial of that petition that the present appeal is brought. The case presented by the petitioners was that upon the deposit of the plan and description in January, 1911, the title to the lands was transferred to the Crown and that in substitution for it a right to compensation became immediately vested in them and that the amount of compensation to which they then became entitled was that admitted to be due to them (the sum of $61,747.75) by the discontinued information. They admitted that on the return of the property the Crown became entitled to credit for a sum equal to the value of the property as of the date of its return and accepted it as payment pro tanto; but their contention was that they were entitled to the residue of the sum so admitted to be due to them after making deduction of that sum. The advisers of the petitioners apparently assumed that section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d applied and determined their rights.\nThe Crown, relying upon this same section, took the position that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The learned assistant judge of the Exchequer Court did not accede to this view but rejected the claim of the petitioners for compensation for the value of the property taken\u2014 awarding the sum of $3,000 as reparation for loss which the learned judge held to be reasonably attributable to the action of the Crown in dispossessing the appellants.\nI have come to the conclusion that both the advisers of the Crown and the advisers of the appellants have misapprehended the effect of the statutory provisions which must be looked to for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of the appellants. These enactments, I think, rightly construed confer no power upon the Minister of Railways or upon the Commissioners to revest compulsorily in the owners lands which have been taken under section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u2019 or to require the owners to accept, in discharge of the statutory obligation of the Crown to make compensation, anything but compensation in money; and the notice of the 15th July, 1912, was, consequently, without legal effect. That is the position the appellants were, I think, entitled to assume; but their advisers having proceeded on the assumption that the decision of this Court in Jones v. The King[6] was conclusive against this view of their rights, the petitioners by their petition presented their claim upon the footing that there was a re-transfer of the lands to them which must be treated as satisfaction in part of their right to compensation\u2014to the extent, as I have already said, of the value of the lands at the time of re-transfer. While I think the petitioners were entitled to claim compensation without deduction; since, nevertheless, they have accepted the re-transfer and offered to submit to the deduction mentioned, that, I think, is the footing upon which their claim should be now dealt with.\nIt will be necessary to refer to several statutes and it will be more convenient, I think, to set out these enactments verbatim before discussing the effect of them.\nThe statutory provisions to be considered are:\u2014 \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d ch. 71, 3 Edw. VII.:\u2014\nSec. 8.\u2014The Eastern Division of the said Transcontinental Rail way extending from the City of Moncton to the City of Winnipeg shall be constructed by or for the Government in the manner hereinafter provided and subject to the terms of the agreement.\nSec. 9.\u2014The construction of the Eastern Division and the operation thereof until completed and leased to the company pursuant to the provisions of the agreement, shall be under the charge and control of three commissioners to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council, who shall hold office during pleasure, and who, and whose successors in office, shall be a body corporate under the name of \u201cThe Commissioners of the Transcontinental Kail way\u201d and are hereinafter called \u201cthe Commissioners.\u201d\n2.

R.S.C., ch. 37, sec. 6; 52 Vict., ch. 19, sec. 3.\nBefore giving my reasons for thinking that the notice of the 15th July, 1912, was inoperative I make one or two observations touching the positions respectively taken on behalf of the appellants and the Crown in the argument before us.\nOn the hypothesis that section 23 applies, the con- tention advanced on behalf of the Crown that the Exchequer Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the petition seems to be disposed of simply by reference to section 20 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d and section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d There is nothing in section 23 indicating an intention to take away the right to compensation recognized by section 13 and even assuming that sub-section 4 of section 23 ought to be construed, as the Crown contends it should be construed, as limited, namely, to cases in which the abandonment relates to part of the land taken only, it would still require very explicit language to take away all right of compensation for loss occasioned by the compulsory assumption of the legal title of the property. The general rule which enables the subject to proceed by petition of right for compensation for property which has found its way into the hands of the Crown (Feather v. The Queen[7], and Windsor and Annapolis Railway Co. v. The Queen[8], at page 614) would remain operative. I agree, however, with the appellants that this is not the necessary reading of sub-section 4, the construction of which I proceed to consider with special reference to the effect attributed to the statute by the learned trial judge.\nThe learned judge appears to have taken a view, the practical result of which is that, where section 23. applies and lands taken are returned under that section so that no part remains in the possession of the Crown, the right of compensation is limited to compensation for disturbance of possession. That, with great respect, I think, is not the point of view from which the subject of compensation is envisaged by sections 22 and 23 of this statute. To prevent misapprehension, I note specially that I refer only to sections 22 and 23 and not to section 30, which deals only with the subject of injurious affection. It may be that section 30 approaches the subject from the same point of view, but that question does not arise and I express no opinion upon it at all. Sections 22 and 23 must be read together. It is perfectly true that, where section 23 applies, the declaration in section 22 that the lands become vested in the Crown and that in substitution for the title, the translation of which is thereby effected, there is vested in the owner a right of compensation\u2014it is quite true that this declaration must be read with the provisions of section 23 empowering \u201cthe Minister\u201d compulsorily to re-vest in the owner the lands taken; but on the other hand sub-section 4 of section 23 must be read with section 22 and, reading section 22 and sub-section 4 together, I apprehend it to be sufficiently clear that the governing consideration in determining the effect of the two provisions is the fact that the language of section 22 clearly imports that the compensation to which the owner becomes thereby entitled is normally to be determined as of the date when the lands vest in the Crown by the operation of section 22. In Re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[9], Lord Justice Moulton said that the general principle of compensation where land is taken under compulsory powers is that the property is not diminished in amount but changed in form,; and section 22 seems to be only an explicit statement of this well-settled principle. That, as I have said, appears to be the governing consideration for determining the joint effect of these provisions. The result then is that, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of compensation provided for in section 22, you must take into account the fact that the land taken has been compulsorily re-transferred together with the other circumstances of the case; but you are to take that fact together with the other circumstances into account for the purpose of determining how much money nought to be paid to the owner in order that he may receive in property and money the equivalent in value to him of the property taken, as of the date when section 22 became operative; that is to say, the date of the filing of the plan.\nOne can easily conceive cases in which the question thus formulated might present considerable difficulty. In the case before us, which is a comparatively simple one, we have the formal offer of the Crown and it is not disputed that the amount offered fairly represented that to which the appellants were entitled, namely, the value of their property to them; and it is not suggested, indeed it could not be suggested, that in the circumstances this could be anything other than the market value of their property in the sense in which that phrase is used in the literature of compulsory purchase. The only question of fact, therefore, upon which the learned trial judge was called upon to pass was the question of the value of the property at the date upon which it was returned.\nIf I had taken the view that the case ought to be dealt with on this footing (that is to say, that section 23 is applicable) I should not have felt embarrassed by the course on which the case proceeded in the court below. As applied to the circumstances before us, Mr. Stuart\u2019s method of working out the statute proposed at the trial and on the argument in appeal was, I think, substantially the right method; and the principle upon which the appellants\u2019 claim must rest (assuming always section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d to be applicable) was, I think, set forth with perfect clearness in the petition of right. The evidence given on behalf of the petitioners was explicitly directed to the precise point of fact just indicated; and, I think, the result of the evidence is that a deduction to the extent of $30,000 ought to be made from the amount of compensation originally offered.\nI come then to the point upon which I think, as I stated above, the appeal should be decided, viz., that the notice of 15th July, 1912, was inoperative in law.\nThe first point for consideration is: Does section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d confer upon the Minister of Railways and Canals authority to re-vest compulsorily in the owner lands acquired by the National Transcontinental Railway Commissioners under the authority of section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d? \u201cMinister\u201d in section 23 is to be read (in accordance with the direction of section 2 (a) and (b)) as meaning the\nhead of the department charged with the construction and maintenance of the public work.\nIt does not appear to require argument (when the terms of section 7 of the \u201cDepartment of Railways and Canals Act\u201d are compared with those of the sections extracted above from the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d) to shew that the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway, although clearly enough a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the words of section 2, sub-section (b) of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d is not a \u201cpublic work\u201d with whose \u201cconstruction and maintenance\u201d the Department of Railways and Canals is \u201ccharged.\u201d The condition of the authority, therefore, of the Minister, under section 23, namely, that he shall be\nthe head of the department charged with the construction and maintenance of the public work,\nfor which lands have been taken is in this case unfulfilled. The case is not a case to which the authority of the Minister of Railways and Canals extends under that section; the language of the section itself excludes it.\nMoreover, comparing the provisions of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d with the provisions of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d lands taken for the Eastern Division by the Commissioners seem to be clearly outside the contemplation of section 23. By section 13 of the former Act such lands not only become vested in the Crown, but become affected by a \u201cdedication to the public\u201d by the express words of the statute; that is, to say, I presume, affected by a \u201cdedication\u201d to the public purposes for which they are taken\u2014for the construction, maintenance and working of the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway. The \u201cwork\u201d was under the charge and control of Commissioners brought into existence by this special statute, passed in pursuance of a contract with the Grand Trunk Railway Co. who were ultimately to be the lessees and operators of it, who, as the agreement between themselves and the Government shews, were narrowly concerned with the economical construction of the railway. Lands acquired for the undertaking by these \u2018Commissioners cannot, I think, be fairly held to be subject to the power of the \u201cMinister\u201d under the provisions of section 23.\nAgain, section 13, the necessary conditions being satisfied, takes away the title from the owner substituting for it a right of compensation, which means, of course, compensation in money. In The King v. Jones[10] this court took the view that the claim for compensation means a claim against the Crown, not a claim against the Commissioners as a corporate body; and a claim, therefore, which was not intended to be made through the machinery provided by the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d but must be prosecuted and determined in the ordinary way, by proceedings instituted by petition of right or an information filed on behalf of the Crown; this right to compensation, if one is to ascertain and define it by reference to the language of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d alone (I suspend for a moment a necessary reference to section 15), is simply a right to be paid in money the value to the owner of what has been taken. And it is, of course, not disputed that the introduction of section 23, on any construction of it that has been suggested, must effect a sensible modification of the right so ascertained and defined. There is not a word in the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d referring to the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d; which circumstance does not shew, of course, that the provisions of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d relating to procedure simply are not properly available for the purpose of enforcing rights conferred by the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d in respect of which no remedy is given specifically by the last mentioned statute. But it is one thing to say, as I have no difficulty in holding, that the provisions of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d relating to procedure simply may be made available for such purposes so long as they are applied consistently with the full recognition of the substantive rights given by the special Act dealing with the particular railway, the National Transcontinental Railway; and it is an entirely different thing to say that such substantive, rights can properly be held to be modified by the provisions of another statute, general in its nature, to which not a single word of reference is to be found in the special Act.\nIt is to be observed, however, that the notice of the 15th July, 1912, is a notice given by the Commissioners of the National Transcontinental Railway as well as by the Minister of Railways and Canals; and it is a conceivable suggestion that the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d establishes a \u201cdepartment of the Government of Canada, charged with the construction and maintenance\u201d of the Eastern Division, of the National Transcontinental Railway; and that the Commissioners are the \u201chead of the department\u201d and, consequently, satisfy the description \u201cminister\u201d as defined by section 2, sub-sections (a) and (b) of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d There are two distinct objections severally fatal to this suggestion. \u201cDepartment of the Government of Canada\u201d is a phrase having a well understood significance and it clearly means one of the departments recognized by statute presided over by a Minister of the Crown, a member of the King\u2019s Privy Council for Canada. See R.S.C., 1906, ch. 4, sec. 4; ch. 48, sec. 3; ch. 23, sec. 2, etc. The second objection is that, assuming the language used to be capable of a construction reconcilable with this suggestion, it is only by attributing to the words a forced and unusual meaning; and the considerations to which I have just referred are equally weighty to justify the rejection of this interpretation which would have the effect if adopted, of seriously prejudicing the right of compensation given by section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d\nThe notice in question, moreover, professes to be given pursuant to section 207 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d: (see p. 426, ante), as well as to section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d The legislative provision now embodied in section 207 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which had its origin many years ago, frequently has been considered and it has uniformly, I think, been held that the power conferred by that provision is a power which ceases to be operative the moment the title to the land taken becomes vested in the railway company. Mitchell v. Great Western Railway Co.[11]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Little Seminary of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[12]; Re Haskill and Grand Trunk Railway Co.[13]. Application, therefore, according to its true intent, it could not have to lands taken under section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d the title to which, by the very act of taking, becomes vested in the Commissioners; and section 207, consequently, is not incorporated by force of section 15 of the last mentioned Act. These are the principal reasons which have satisfied me that the Crown is not entitled to invoke the provisions of section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d or the provision of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d just referred to.\nI have now to consider The King v. Jones[14]. In The King v. Jones14 the learned judge of the Exchequer Court had dismissed an information filed by the Attorney-General of Canada praying for a declaration that certain lands taken by the Commissioners had become vested in the Crown and for a determination of the amount of compensation payable in respect of such taking on the ground that the effect of section 15 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d was to incorporate the sections of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d relating to compensation and that compensation must be determined in the way provided for by that Act. On appeal to this court it was held that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to entertain the information and to pass upon the question of compensation on two grounds, first, that the claim for compensation under section 13 is a claim against the Crown and that jurisdiction is given by section 20 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 140, subsecs, (a) and (b), which invest that court with exclusive jurisdiction over every claim against the Crown for property taken for or injuriously affected by any public work; and secondly, on the ground that the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway is a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of sections 26 et seq. of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d That is the substance of the decision. The ratio is put very clearly in the judgment of Davies J., at page 499, in these words:\u2014 It is a public work vested in the Crown, constructed at the expense of Canada, or for the construction of which public moneys have been voted and appropriated by Parliament within the meaning of section 2, para, (d) of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d and the procedure taken by the Crown in fyling this information to determine the claim against the Crown for the lands taken falls within the language of the 26th section of that Act, and the claim itself is one coming in my judgment, within sub-section (a) of section 20, of the Act constituting the Exchequer Court and denning its jurisdiction over \u201cevery claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose.\u201d\nAltogether I entertain no doubt that the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court covers the claim made and think the appeal should be allowed and the jurisdiction of the Court affirmed.\nWith great respect, I am unable to understand why The King v. Jones[15] can be supposed in any way to decide the question which I have been discussing, touching the applicability of section 23. The effect of section 23 was not a subject of consideration in that case and I do not think anybody supposed that the court was deciding that each and every section of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d is applicable for the purpose of determining the substantive rights of the persons whose lands are taken under section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d There is not the least difficulty, as I have already said, in holding that the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway is a \u201cpublic work\u201d under section 26 for the purpose of applying that section and the subsequent provisions in so far as they relate to procedure merely; and in holding at the same time that other provisions of that statute affecting the substantive rights of the parties are not capable of application because of the very fact that they deal with substantive rights and not with procedure and because they are not consonant with provisions of the special Act governing substantive rights. Section 13 provides for the right of compensation specifically but it says nothing about\u201d procedure. There seems no reason for holding that the provisions of a general statute enabling the Crown to take proceedings in the Exchequer Court for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation where compensation is payable in respect of the taking of lands for public works does not apply to the case of compensation payable under section 13 where the language of the statute is broad enough to comprehend, and does literally comprehend, that case; provided always, that the provisions of the general statute are not imported for the purpose or with the effect of modifying the substantive rights which are the legal result of a proper interpretation of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d itself. That at all events is, I think, the proper interpretation of The King v. Jones[16].\nThe consequence would have been that the appellants, had they stood upon their rights, would have been entitled to claim the sum of $61,747.75, which the Crown had solemnly admitted to be the compensation to which they became entitled by the taking of the land. The appellants, however, in the petition of right had chosen to accept the property in part satisfaction and to that position they have consistently adhered throughout. I think this position results from a misapprehension of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d but they have asked for relief upon that footing, and upon that footing I think their claim must be dealt with. There is satisfactory evidence that the property when returned was not worth more than $30,000. It follows they are entitled to be paid the residue of compensation offered after deducting that sum.\nAnglin J.\u2014In The King v. Jones[17], a majority of the judges of this court held that the National Transcontinental Railway is a public work to which the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 143) applies.\nAlthough sub-section 4 of section 23 of that Act is not as clearly expressed as might be desired, I agree with Mr. Stuart that it applies to cases of total, as well as to cases of partial, abandonment by the Grown, and that in it the words \u201cland taken\u201d mean not land taken and kept, but land taken under the provision for its acquisition, whether wholly or partially retained, or subsequently wholly abandoned. Otherwise there would be no provision in the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d for compensation in cases of total abandonment, although in such cases the actual loss to the owner may have been very substantial. It cannot be assumed that it was intended to leave such a grievance without remedy, and if the statute is susceptible of an interpretation under which it will be provided for, that interpretation should prevail.\nIn the Exchequer Court this case has been dealt with on the footing that, upon the Crown exercising its right of abandonment under section 23, the owner became entitled to be indemnified for actual loss sustained as the direct result of his property having been taken out of his hands and held by the Crown from the date of deposit of the plan under section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d (3 Edw. VII, ch. 71), until it was re-vested in him under section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d On that basis the learned assistant judge allowed him $3,000 for loss of revenue already suffered and likely to be sustained in the future. This allowance was intended to cover all loss attributable to interference with the suppliant\u2019s user of his property, including loss of opportunities to lease it to advantage. But the suppliant was also deprived during all that period of the right to sell or otherwise dispose of his property. Until notice of withdrawal had been given the property to all intents and purposes belonged to the Crown, and the suppliant had no reason or right to expect that he would again have any interest in it. That the deprivation of the right of disposition is in most cases a matter proper for compensation can scarcely admit of doubt. When the property has diminished in value during the time that right has been withheld some compensation should certainly be made. This element of damage was not taken into consideration in the Exchequer Court. No doubt the loss sustained as the result of deprivation of the jus disponendi involves elements of contingency. The possibility of profitable sale, as such, must be taken into account. Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[18]. Neither the difficulty of determining the loss proper to be allowed for, nor the fact that elements of contingency or uncertainty are involved in it is sufficient reason for refusing compensation. Wood v. Grand Valley Railway Co.[19]; Chaplin v. Hicks[20]. If the statute should receive the construction put upon it by the learned assistant judge of the Exchequer Court, it would, therefore, be necessary that this case should be referred back to him to consider what additional sum should be allowed as compensation to the appellant for deprivation of his jus disponendi while his property was vested in the Crown, the evidence in the record being scarcely sufficient to enable us to deal satisfactorily with that question.\nI was, for a time, inclined to think that this appeal should be disposed of in the manner which I have just indicated, but further consideration has led me, though not without some hesitation, to accept the construction placed upon section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d by my Lord the Chief Justice.\nWhere land or property taken under sub-section 1 of section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d is subsequently abandoned and re-vested in the former owner under section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d no provision of either statute expressly deprives him of \u201cthe lawful claim to compensation\u201d reserved to him by section 13 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d If it has been intended that the right to compensation which accrued upon the taking of the land should cease upon the re-vesting of it, having regard to the extraordinary and exceptional exercise of eminent domain involved in such re-vesting, we should certainly expect to find the extinction of the owner\u2019s right to compensation declared in explicit terms. But, on the contrary, sub-section 4 of section 23, though not as clear as could be desired, appears to be framed on the assumption that, notwithstanding the abandonment and the re-vesting, \u201cthe person claiming compensation for the land taken\u201d is still entitled to have \u201cthe amount to be paid to\u201d him estimated or assessed by the court, which is directed, in estimating or asses-sing it, to take into account the fact of such abandonment or re-vesting, i.e., to make allowance, at its then present value to him, for any advantage or benefit which the owner will derive from such abandonment or re-vesting.\nThe suppliant would, therefore, be entitled to the amount of the compensation which he would have recovered had the Crown retained the property less what is found to be a proper deduction to be made on account of the re-vesting. The property being thus treated as having belonged to the Crown while held under expropriation the Crown is entitled to the mesne profits from it during that time, but would be liable to the suppliant for interest for the;same period on the full amount of the compensation which he would have recovered had the property not been abandoned.\nThe case has been dealt with in the Exchequer Court on an entirely different view of the effect of sub-section 4 of section 23 of the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d We are not in a position to determine satisfactorily what compensation should be allowed the appellant.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the action should be remitted to the Exchequer Court in order that the amount to be paid to the appellant may be estimated or assessed on the basis indicated.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit dans cette cause d\u2019une p\u00e9tition de droit r\u00e9clamant des dommages. Le 24 janvier, 1911, le gouvernement donnait avis d\u2019expropriation d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant aux appelants et dont il avait besoin pour la construction du Transcontinental. Au mois d\u2019octobre, 1911, des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9taient institu\u00e9es par le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d devant la Cour d\u2019Echiquier pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e pour l\u2019expropriation de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et il offrait une somme de $61,747.75. Il y eut contestation quant au montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9; mais en d\u00e9finitive les parties se sont entendues et les appelants se sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter le montant offert et les proc\u00e9dures en Cour d\u2019Echiquier furent alors discontinu\u00e9es.\nLe 27 juillet, 1912, la couronne d\u00e9clarait que l\u2019immeuble en question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas requis et cet avis \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9 le 30 d\u00e9cembre, 1912.\nDans leur p\u00e9tition de droit les appelants pr\u00e9tendent que l\u2019immeuble en question valait lors de l\u2019expropriation au-del\u00e0 de $60,000, ainsi qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 admis par le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame et que lors de la r\u00e9trocession elle ne valait plus que $30,000 et ils r\u00e9clament la diff\u00e9rence.\nLa Court d\u2019Echiquier n\u2019a maintenu l\u2019action que pour une somme de $3,000 pour les dommages qu\u2019ils avaient soufferts pour pertes de revenus.\nNous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la port\u00e9e de la sous-section 4 de la section 23 de \u201cLa Loi des expropriations\u201d (ch. 143 des Statuts Refondus de 1906). En vertu de cette loi des expropriations, lorsque la Couronne d\u00e9pose au bureau d\u2019enregistrement un plan et une description des terrains que l\u2019on veut exproprier, cet immeuble, par le fait m\u00eame de ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t, devient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9 (sec. 8).\nDans la cas actuel, cependant, les appelants sont rest\u00e9s en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et en ont retir\u00e9 tons les loyers.\nIl n\u2019y a jamais eu d\u00e9possession. La jouissance \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessairement restreinte et il leur \u00e9tait impossible de pouvoir retirer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 les m\u00eames revenus qu\u2019elle donnait auparavant. Je consid\u00e8re donc que les dommages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s par le juge de la cour inf\u00e9rieure pour cette perte de loyer doivent \u00eatre maintenus.\nLa somme de $3,000 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e repr\u00e9sente une somme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e qui les loyers qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus; mais il faut tenir compte, en m\u00eame temps, du fait que les appelants se trouvent avec des locataires qui ne leur donneront pas des revenus aussi consid\u00e9rables que ceux qu\u2019ils auraient per\u00e7us s\u2019ils avaient pu louer sans restriction. Le montant n\u2019est donc pas trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, loin de l\u00e0.\nMais le point principal soulev\u00e9 par les appelants est de savoir si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a diminu\u00e9 de valeur entre la prise de possession et la r\u00e9trocession et s\u2019il y a lieu de condamner \u00e0 la Couronne \u00e0 payer cette diff\u00e9rence.\nJe comprends que si la Couronne avait pris possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, s\u2019il y avait eu un incendie, par exemple, ou si on avait fait des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations, la Couronne serait tenue de payer ces dommages.\nMais dans le cas actual la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain en question appartenait \u00e0 la Couronne en vertu de son avis d\u2019expropriation; mais elle n\u2019a jamais exerc\u00e9 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et a laiss\u00e9 les appelants en possession.\nEn vertu de la loi, les appellants avaient droit aux dommages qu\u2019ils avaient soufferts comme r\u00e9sultat de cet avis d\u2019expropriation et de la r\u00e9trocession. Le demandeur a-t-il r\u00e9ellement souffert de dommages autres que ceux que je viens de mentionner plus haut?\nAvant que la construction du chemin de fer f\u00fbt d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des appelants valait \u00e0 peine $30,000. Elle rapportait environ $2,000 de revenus par ann\u00e9e, soit un peu plus de 6%. Il est reconnu, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qu\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ville doit donner un revenu brut de 10%. Or, en \u00e9valuant \u00e0 $30,000 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui ne donnait que $2,000 de revenu je fais une \u00e9valuation bien lib\u00e9rale.\nIl est reconnu par les appelants qu\u2019elle vaut aujourd\u2019hui environ $30,000. Elle a donc la m\u00eame valeur qu\u2019avant. Quand le gouvernement e\u00fbt d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de construire le chemin de fer, de suite cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 parut acqu\u00e9rir une plus valeur. Les avis d\u2019expropriation ne furent pas donn\u00e9s de suite et quand ils furent donn\u00e9s la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait doubl\u00e9 en valeur. Et \u00abcomme le gouvernement \u00e9tait tenu de payer la valeur qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 la date de l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation, il a offert un peu plus de $60,000.\nIl a consid\u00e9r\u00e9, je suppose, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, que ce projet de construire une gare \u00e0 cet endroit \u00e9tait trop dispendieux, \u00e0 raison probablement de la valeur factice que les expropri\u00e9s r\u00e9clamaient pour leurs terrains et alors il a simplement r\u00e9solu de ne pas donner suite \u00e0 son projet et de placer sa gare \u00e0 un autre endroit. Il a donn\u00e9 avis aux appelants qu\u2019il leur r\u00e9troc\u00e9dait leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCes derniers, je consid\u00e8re, ne peuvent pas, comme ils le font, r\u00e9clamer des dommages pour cette valeur factice que le projet du chemin de fer a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le juge avait le droit d\u2019examiner toutes les circonstances de la cause, comme le dit le statut, et notamment de consid\u00e9rer la valeur de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 non-seulement ou moment de l\u2019expropriation mais m\u00eame avant le projet de la construction du chemin. Il est bien evident pour moi que les seuls dommages soufferts par les appelants sont ceux qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s en cour inf\u00e9rieure. Ce jugement devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe appeal stood dismissed, on equal division of opinion, no costs being allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thomson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Eus\u00e8be Belleau.\n[1] 15 Ex.

Act,1867,\" ss.108,109.\nThe terms \"public harbours\" in item 2 of the third schedule of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" is not intended to describe or include portions of the sea coast of Canada having merely a natural conformation which may render them susceptible of use as harbours for shipping; such potential harbours or havens of refuge are not property of the class transferred to the Dominion of Canada by section 108 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" The term used refers only to public harbours existing as such at the time when the provinces became part of the Dominion of Canada.\nPer Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014As that part of Burrard Inlet, on the coast of British Columbia, known as \"English Bay,\" was not in use as a harbour at the time of the admission of British Columbia into the Dominion of Canada, in 1871, it did not become the property of the Dominion as a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of section 108 and the third schedule of the \"British North America Act, 1867\"; consequently, .the Province of British Columbia retained the property in the bed and foreshore thereof and could validly grant the right of removing sand therefrom.\nPer Davies, Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014Inasmuch as the proclamation, by the Dominion Government, on the 3rd of December, 1912, and the Dominion statute, chapter 54 of 3 & 4 Geo. V., deal merely with the establishment of the port and the incorporation of the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners, they had not the effect of transferring English Bay from the control of the Provincial Government to that of the Dominion Government nor of giving to the Dominion Government any right of property in the bed or foreshore of that bay.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The transfer effected by section 108 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" of the subjects described in the third schedule of that Act was a transfer of property operative upon the passing of the Act and such subjects were necessarily ascertainable at the passing of the Act by the application of the descriptions to the facts then existing, and, consequently, the question of \"public harbour\" or no \"public harbour\" must be determined according to the circumstances as they were at the date of the Union.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The term \"public harbour\" implies public user as a harbour for commercial purposes as distinguished from purposes of navigation simply, or some recognition, formal or otherwise, of the locality in dispute by the proper public authority as a harbour for such purposes, but the question of \"public harbour\" or no \"public harbour\" is a question of fact depending largely upon the particular circumstances.\nPer Duff J.\u2014If the question of \"public harbour\" or no \"public harbour\" were to be decided according to the circumstances existing when the dispute arose, English Bay must be held to be now a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of item 2 of the third schedule of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\"\nJudgment appealed from (20 B.C. Rep. 333) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Macdonald J. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia[2], by which the action was dismissed with costs. The action was brought in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the purposes of preventing the dredging out and removal of \"Spanish Bank,\" one of the natural confines of the harbour of English Bay, on the sea coast of British Columbia; of obtaining a judicial declaration that the bed and foreshore of \"English Bay\" (inside and east of a straight line drawn from the west tangent of Point Grey to Point Atkinson Light House; (see Proclamation of 3rd Dec., 1912, Can. Gaz., vol. XLVI., p. 2077)) are the property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada; for an injunction to restrain the defendants from trespassing upon the bed and foreshore of English Bay and removing sand, gravel or other material therefrom, and for damages.\nAt the trial before Macdonald J. the action was dismissed with costs and, on appeal, that judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy\u2014Minister of Justice, for the appellants. British Columbia entered the Dominion of Canada under an Imperial order-in-council, dated the 16th day of May, 1871, called the \"Terms of Union,\" and section 10 thereof provided that \"the 'British North America Act, 1867,' should (except certain parts thereof) be applicable to British Columbia in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion, and as if British Columbia had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\" By section 108 of the \"B.N.A. Act\" it is provided that the public works and property of each province, enumerated in the third schedule, shall be the property of Canada, and that schedule begins as follows: \"Provincial Public Works and Property to be the Property of Canada. (1) Canals with lands and water-power connected therewith. (2) Public harbours.\"\nThe Dominion of Canada claims that \"English Bay\" was a \"public harbour\" or part of a public harbour in May, 1871, and, being such, was included in the schedule above referred to, and that its bed and foreshore became and still are the property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada and not in the right of the Province of British Columbia. The Province of British Columbia disputes the right of the Dominion to interfere, and intervened, and was added, through its Attorney-General, as a party defendant.\nThe learned trial judge erred (1) in rejecting the evidence of reputation (a) as to such body of water being used as a harbour both before and after the Province of British Columbia entered the Union, (b) as to the said body of water being known, called, used and recognized as a public harbour by mariners; (2) in rejecting evidence as to the physical features of other well known and generally recognized harbours of the world to prove what constitutes a public harbour by way of comparison; (3) in finding that the facts existing in May, 1871, alone are to govern as to whether or not \"English Bay\" is a public harbour within the \"British North America Act\" and the \"Terms of Union\"; (4) in refusing to admit in evidence the \"British Columbia Pilots\" of the years 1888 and 1913, published by order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and portions thereof dealing with Vancouver Harbour, Burrard Inlet and anchor\u2014 age therein, and an authentic history entitled \"British Columbia Coast Names, their Origin and History,\" published by order of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries of Canada; (5) in holding that the onus of proof rested upon the plaintiffs to show that the land in question did not remain the property of the Province of British Columbia; (6) in not properly defining the meaning of the word \"harbour\" and in not properly defining the meaning of the words \"public harbour\"; (7) in not finding upon the evidence and law that the waters, bed of the sea and foreshore in question in this action are a public harbour or part of one within the meaning of the \"British North America Act\" and the \"Terms of Union\" and that the bed of the said harbour, as well as the foreshore thereof, is and has been since British Columbia became a part of Canada the property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada; and (8) in misdirecting himself in estimating the weight of the evidence of the witnesses for the plaintiffs in determining as to whether or not their evidence justified him in finding that the areas in question in this action constitute a harbour.\nThe Court of Appeal erred (1) in finding that the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act,\" ch. 115, R.S.C., 1906, does not cover an interference with the bed or shore of the sea as the one complained of in this action; (2) in finding that the Dominion officers of the Crown have no authority to interfere with or invoke the assistance of the courts to enjoin the taking of sand in question; (3) in finding that the good anchorage relied upon by the plaintiff was not shown to exist anywhere in the immediate vicinity of the \"Spanish Bank\"; (4) in finding that it was unnecessary to ex- press an opinion concerning the appellants' alternative contention that not only those harbours which were public harbours at the time of the Union passed to the Dominion but those which afterwards became public harbours also passed\u2014this was not only necessary but should have been found in favour of the appellants; (5) in finding that the width of the mouth of \"English Bay,\" having regard to its area, prevents' it falling within the definition of harbour; (6) in finding that the future adaptability and use \"in the course of time\" of the locus for harbour purposes should be considered as a test of whether it at present is in fact a harbour is erroneous and should not be followed; (7) in finding that the area in question has not become a public harbour since 1871; (8) in finding that \"English Bay\" was not one of the recognized harbours of the Colony of British Columbia; (9) in finding that \"English Bay\" is not part of Burrard Inlet which was afterwards called Vancouver Harbour; (10) in finding that the name \"English Bay\" is prima facie evidence that it is not a harbour; (11) in finding that the onus is upon plaintiffs as to whether or not \"English Bay\" is to be included in the words \"public harbour\"; (12) in finding that the Province of British Columbia granted the right of removal of sand and gravel from the area in question; (13) in finding that only harbours in use by the public and recognized as such at the time of the Union were transferred to the Dominion.\nDefinitions of \"public harbour\" are to be found in vol. 5 of the Oxford Dictionary; Worcester's Dictionary; Wester's International Dictionary; Gould on Waters (2 ed.), p. xi.; Coulson and Forbes on Waters (3 ed.), p. 464; Farnham on Waters, p. 27; Cyc. vol. 21, p. 360. The following statutory definitions are referred to: 34 & 35 Vict., ch. 105, sec. 2; \"Explosives Act, 1875\" (Imp.), 38 & 39 Vict, ch. 17, sec. 108; \"Shannon Act, 1885\" (Imp.), 48 & 49 Vict., ch. 41, sec. 17; \"Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888,\" 51 & 52 Vict., ch. 54, sec. 14 (Imp.) ; \"Forged Transfer Act, 1891,\" 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 43, sec. 4(2) (Imp.)\nReference may also be made to The Queen v. Hannam[3] , per Esher M.R., at p. 235; Kennelly v. Dominion Coal Co.[4] , per Townshend J.; Town of Huntington v. Lowndes[5], per Lacombe J., at p. 629.\nThe evidence shows that the area in question was used as a harbour before the Union\u2014ships anchored there for safety, and found shelter and anchorage; that it is a natural harbour and has been and now is used as a harbour and affords good anchorage and shelter for ships; that it is called and classed as a harbour in all old records containing matters of general geographical notoriety before the Union and, hence, was, within the minds and intentions of those who drafted the Act, a \"harbour.\" See \"Vancouver's Voyage of Discovery to the Pacific Ocean,\" at pages 248 and 249; \"Vancouver Island Pilot, 1864\" (published by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty), pages 244 and 245; \"British Columbia Coast Names, their Origin and History\" (by Captain George P. Walbran), published by order of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries of Canada for the Geographical Board of Canada, pages 478 and 507. Throughout the above records Burrard Inlet is called and classed as a harbour and \"English Bay\" is part of Burrard Inlet. The area in question is a natural harbour and all such, without exception, were intended to be transferred to the Dominion by the terms of Union. Vancouver Island, to the west, together with other islands, protect it admirably from the rough seas of the Pacific Ocean. The distance of 21 miles from Vancouver Island to Burrard Inlet is not sufficient for a heavy sea to develop.\n\"English Bay\" is surrounded by land on three sides, and is only exposed to westerly winds to the extent of one point out of 32 points of the compass.\nAt no time since the Union, forty years ago, has the province declared or exercised any proprietary right or control over the body and foreshore of \"English Bay\" or in any way disputed the claims of the Dominion thereto until after the commencement of this action, though the Dominion Government had from time to time granted leases and quit claims of water lots and foreshore in \"English Bay.\" Neither the public nor the defendants had the right to take away sand from \"English Bay,\" be or be it not a public harbour.

The claim that the province has not and never had any right to authorize the removal of sand from the bed or foreshore, nor any interference therewith, as the waters were navigable waters of the sea, but was obliged to maintain the bed and foreshore in their natural state and prevent waste, in other words, to see that the duties of the Dominion Government in regard to navigable waters were carried out locally, is untenable and must be disregarded inasmuch as there is no remedy disclosed for its enforcement. Even if it were open to the plaintiffs to contend that the jurisdiction over navigation and shipping which is vested in the Dominion Government would entitle it to stop interference with the bed of the sea, although it was the actual property of the province, this claim must be dismissed for the reasons both that it was really dropped at the trial and that there was no evidence to support it. The right of the Dominion over navigation is only legislative and as no legislation has been passed enabling the Dominion to prohibit interference by other owners, with the soil of their lands when underneath navigable waters, the claim that the province must be enjoined from authorizing the removal of sand, cannot succeed. Even if special legislation were not necessary, the plaintiffs cannot succeed because no injury to navigation has been shown. Central Vermont Railway Co. v. Town of St. Johns[21], at page 297; In re Provincial Fisheries[22], at page 575; The Queen v. Fisher[23] ; The Queen v. St. John Gas Light Co.[24], at page 346; Lake Simcoe Ice and Cold Storage Co. v. McDonald[25] .\nWith regard to this being a public harbour, the question whether or not the Dominion has any right to interfere with the taking away of sand depends upon whether the point at which the sand was taken was the bed or foreshore of a public harbour, and was also used in some sense for harbour purposes prior to the Union. \"English Bay\" was not a harbour at the time of Union and, under the terms of the \"British North America Act,\" no harbour became the property of the Dominion except such as were public harbours at the time of the Union. Even if \"English Bay\" were a harbour, there is absolutely no evidence that the bed or foreshore at the points in question were ever used for any harbour purposes. The Fisheries Case[26] , at pages 711 and 712; Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[27], at the foot of page 209 ; Pickels v. The King[28], at p. 702 ; McDonald v. Lake Simcoe Ice and Cold Storage Co.[29] at pages 415 and 422 ; The Queen v. Hannam[30] ; Foreman v. Free Fisheries and Dredgers of Whitstable[31] ; The \"Aurania\" and the \"Republic\"[32], at page 103.\nA harbour must afford safe anchorage and shelter to vessels from all winds and at all times of the year, and it must also be provided with quays or wharves for the loading and unloading of goods. It does not include all that would be included in a port, which is a district defined for customs purposes, nor does it include a roadstead, which is a place of temporary anchorage for vessels waiting to enter the harbour. \"English Bay\" does not satisfy these requirements of the above definitions, as it is exposed to winds which have often caused tugs and scows to break adrift and go ashore, and logs to be lost from booms. The seas, in a westerly wind, get up to 12 and 14 feet, and \"Spanish Bank,\" is no protection at high tide, and only a very limited one at low tide. There are no public wharves for loading and unloading goods, in fact, it is merely a roadstead, lying outside the Harbour of Vancouver. The Bay was certainly not used as a harbour prior to 1871; there were no settlers there then, and the sand was taken from a point outside the anchorage described by the plaintiff's witnesses.\nNo Dominion order-in-council, statute or proclama- tion subsequent to the Union can make this bay a \"public harbour\" under the \"British North America Act.\" If it could, then any sheet of water of whatever nature could now be taken by the Dominion under the designation of a \"public harbour.\" No order-in-council prior to the Union could have that effect. Even if it could, there is no evidence that there ever was such an order-in-council. We rely on the statement of the law on this point set out by McPhillips J.A., in his judgment in the court below.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The substantial claim in this case is for a declaration that English Bay forms part of the Harbour of Vancouver and as such is the property of the Dominion of Canada under the terms of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" Section 108 of this statute provides that\nthe public works and property of each province enumerated in the third schedule to this Act shall be the property of Canada.\nI do not think it is necessary for the decision of the present case to refer to the other public works and property enumerated in this third schedule, although for certain purposes it might be desirable to make a comparison with the nature of the other public works and property so enumerated and passing to the Dominion of Canada.\nThe constitution of this country was established by the \"British North America Act, 1867\" (Haldane, in Australia Case). It is, comparatively speaking, a short statute and it is obvious that many matters with which it deals could only be provided for in general terms. It is the business of the courts, when occasion arises, to say what interpretation is to be put on any of its provisions so far as these govern the particular case. It is not the business of the court to expand or supplement the legislation.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council accordingly, in the Fisheries Case[33], declined to give any general definition of what constituted a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of the above provisions of the \"British North America Act.\" At pages 711-712 of the judgment it was said:\u2014\nTheir Lordships think it extremely inconvenient that a determination should be sought of the abstract question what falls within the description \"public harbour.\" They must decline to attempt an exhaustive definition of the term applicable to all cases. To do so would, in their judgment, be likely to prove misleading and dangerous. It must depend, to some extent at all events, upon the circumstances of each particular harbour what forms a part of that harbour. It is only possible to deal with definite issues which have been raised. It appears to have been thought by the Supreme Court in the case of Holman v. Green[34], that if more than the public works connected with the harbour passed under that word, and if it included any part of the bed of the sea, it followed that the foreshore between the high and low water-mark, being also Crown property, likewise passed to the Dominion.\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that it does not follow that, because the foreshore on the margin of a harbour is Crown property, it necessarily forms part of the harbour. It may or may not do so, according to circumstances. If, for example, it had actually been used for harbour purposes, such as anchoring ships or landing goods, it would no doubt, form part of the harbour; but there are other cases in which, in their Lordships' opinion, it would be equally clear that it did not form part of it. (Fol. British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Raiway Co. (3), at p. 629.)\nA large body of evidence has been taken and, at the argument before this court, a wealth of research was offered us in the form of dictionary definitions, descriptions of the principal harbours of the world and other interesting information. Into any of these considerations it is unnecessary for me to enter holding as I must do that English Bay is in no sense of the word a harbour; it is in my opinion wanting in every distinctive mark that would render it possible to describe it as such. It is, indeed, admitted that, except as a possible harbour in the future it can now only be considered as an outer harbour or part of the Harbour of Vancouver.\nIt matters nothing, I think, that some one, in the year 1855, may have described this then scarcely explored part of the coast as suitable for a harbour, or that the Dominion Government should have proclaimed it as being a harbour or part of a harbour. What we have to do is to decide whether at the present time it is a harbour within the meaning of the \"British North America Act\" so that the property in it is vested in the Dominion Government. As I have said I cannot find anything present either of usage, works or requirements which would render it possible to describe this open bay as fulfilling any of the conditions essential to bring it within any definition or description of a harbour.\nI do not desire to express any opinion on the questions which have been discussed during the hearing as to whether a harbour must necessarily have been such at the date of the Union or whether it is sufficient that it was then a potential harbour; or whether, though the property remained in the province at the Union, it could by subsequent events be divested and become the property of the Dominion. None of these questions, in my opinion, need to be answered for the decision of the present case.\nThere is one point calling for consideration. The statement of claim was by leave amended to include the claim put forward in paragraph 11 to the effect that whether English Bay be or be not a \"public harbour,\" the defendants had no right to interfere with the bed of the foreshore thereof, the same being navigable waters of the sea.\nThis point, though pleaded was not relied on at the hearing in the courts below and does not appear to have been referred to in the argument; no attempt to deal with it is made in the appellant's factum. The practice of raising a substantial claim for the first time at the hearing of an appeal before this court is most objectionable and should be discouraged in every possible way. The inconvenience of such a course and its unfairness to the opposite side are obvious. This view has been strongly upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the recent case of City of Vancouver v. Vancouver Lumber Company [35], at page 720 (foot).\nThis claim is, of course, advanced under section 91 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" which gives to the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority over (amongst other matters therein enumerated) \"10. Navigation and Shipping.\" It is to be observed that it is simply legislative authority over the subject which is given to Parliament and we have not been referred to any legislation by Parliament under which the claim in question could be supported; it follows, of course, that no contravention can be alleged of any legislative provisions made by Parliament.\nAs presented by counsel in argument at the bar of this court, the claim is an abstract one, since there are no facts established on which it can be based. It is not shown that there is any navigation to be interfered with or that, if there were, it would be interfered with by any action of the respondents. The contrary would indeed appear to be the case. Neither is it shown that the removal of sand as taken by the defendant company could cause any injury to the coast; the contrary would again appear to be the case. The practice of the removal of such natural products of the shore as sand, shells and seaweed spoken of in Coulson & Forbes, in the extract quoted in the appellant's factum, at page 14, is a common one and as therein stated the right belongs to the Crown or its grantees; if, however, the shore is the property of the Grown in right of the province, this does not assist the claim of the Dominion Government. Even if English Bay were a harbour, the foreshore might be the property of the province and it has not been shown that it is the property of the Dominion. The province might have the right to take sand from the foreshore even if English Bay were a harbour and, a fortiori, if it were merely a part of the coast of the province.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The substantial questions to be determined on this appeal are, first, whether English Bay or harbour lying outside the entrance to the Harbour of Vancouver was a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of the term as used in the third schedule of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" and became, under section 108 of that Act, \"the property of Canada\" \u2014 and, secondly, whether, if it was not such a \"public harbour\" the Dominion Government had the right to restrain parties from removing gravel from a bar or bank running out from the coast into the bay and alleged to be necessary for the protection of shipping resorting to and anchoring in that bay as a harbour of refuge from storms.\nAs to the first question whether English Bay was, at the time British Columbia entered into the Union with Canada, in 1871, a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of the \"British North America Act\" I feel I need not say more than that I fully concur with the courts below and with my colleagues in answering that question in the negative.\nMr. Newcombe, however, contended that even if English Bay was not, in 1871, when British Columbia became part of Canada, a public harbour it was at least a potential one and has since then become a public harbour by reason of the use made of it by shipping and for shipping and harbour purposes and by the proclamation of 1912 proclaiming it as a port and defining its limits.\nI am quite unable to accede to this contention. I do not think the 108th section enacting that\nthe public works and property of each province enumerated in the 3rd schedule to this Act shall be the property of Canada\nwas ever intended to cover more or can fairly be construed as covering more than public works and property existing at the time the Union took place. That section passed the property in these enumerated works from the provinces to Canada. It was a then present transfer of existing public works and property and had no relation to potential works or possibilities, such as harbours, which, in the future, settlement by population and expenditure of money might create. If subsequently to Confederation from any cause potential harbours became de facto harbours and it became necessary for the Dominion to acquire the rights or property on their foreshores either vested in the Crown in right of the province or in private individuals there were obvious methods by which the Dominion could acquire such property or rights.\nThen as to the right claimed on the part of the Dominion, if English Bay was a harbour of refuge for shipping only, and not a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of the Act, to restrain any one from removing gravel from a bar or bank forming, as contended, one of the protecting arms of the alleged harbour of refuge for shipping and so destroying or impairing the protection its presence gave to the harbour, I have only to say that the amendment to the statement of claim, par. 11, did not claim that there had been any such removal of the sand or gravel from the bar in question as was destructive or prejudicial to the harbour or bay as a harbour or port of refuge. Nor did the evidence show or prove that to be the case.\nIf, under its legislative power over navigation and shipping, the Dominion had created and defined any special place as a port or harbour of refuge it might well be that it would be entitled to prevent its destruction as such by the removal of one of its protecting arms by exercising its power of expropriation and awarding compensation to the owner of the foreshore, whoever he might be. The trial judge has found that the bay does not, except under the special circumstances and to the limited extent he mentions, afford for ships a haven of safety and I do not think that the evidence shows a removal of gravel or sand from the bar which can be said prejudicially to affect that bay as a harbour of refuge.\nThe claim advanced was an absolute one challenging the right of the Attorney-General of British Columbia\nto authorize the removal of any part of the said bed or foreshore or interference therewith.\nIt does not claim that the removal of the sand or gravel complained of prejudicially affected that bay as a harbour of refuge, but simply puts forward the claim on the ground\nthat the waters of English Bay, being navigable waters, it was the duty of the Crown in so far as it was represented locally to maintain the bed and foreshores of the said waters in their natural states.\nIt seems to me that, as made, the claim was based upon the contention that English Bay was a public harbour within the \"British North America Act\" and that its foreshore as such had passed to the Dominion.\nI have already dealt with this part of the case, but giving the very widest construction to the claim as made and assuming that it was intended as an assertion of a right to protect to the fullest necessary extent a harbour of refuge created by the proclamation of 1912 I fail to find evidence to support the contention that the removal of the sand or gravel proved did prejudicially affect or destroy such harbour or might be reasonably feared to have that effect.\nThe complainant has failed in proving the facts essential to the maintenance of his case and I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The claim of appellants that English Bay now in question was a public harbour or part thereof within the meaning of the \"British North America Act,\" I think must rest upon the meaning to be given the term \"public harbour\" as used in said Act and the relevant facts demonstrating the conditions and use made of such bay, in 1871, when British Columbia became one of the provinces of Canada.\nIf we have regard either to the language used by the late Lord Herschell in The Attorney-General for Canada v. The Attorney-General for Ontario, etc.[36] , at pages 711 and 712, when dealing with the term \"public harbour\" as used in said Act or, I submit, to the plain ordinary meaning of the words, it seems quite clear that at said date there had not been any such use made of any part of said bay as to constitute it or any part of it a public harbour or part thereof.\nIt has been argued, however, that the said bay together with the protecting conformation of the adjoining and adjacent land fitted it by nature for use as a harbour and hence, as part of the Crown domain, was in fact a public harbour at the time in question.\nThe language I use is mine, but, as I understand the argument put forward, it represents fairly the substance thereof without expanding its details.\nIt seems to me almost such \"an exhaustive definition of the term applicable to all cases\" as their Lordships declined to attempt.\nIndeed, the argument seems in direct conflict with what their Lordships had in mind, else I suspect the few additional words needed to cover, what the hand of man in the service of the Crown may have done to aid nature, and thus have completed all that was needed to frame the desired exhaustive definition, would surely have been supplied.\nNay more, the framers of the legislation by which British Columbia became part of Canada, could, at that stage of things (in British Columbia's development) so easily, instead of using the round-about language they did, have framed a suitable definition that would have made plain all now contended for if they really intended as is argued.\nFor these and other considerations needless to dwell upon it seems to me the argument is not well founded and that using the old method of resorting to the facts, as their Lordships suggested in the case just referred to, destroys appellants' case.\nAnd as to what has been called the other branch of the case so far as designed to protect a harbour, that must also fail for want of a \"public harbour\" to be protected.\nThen neither does the proclamation nor the Act of 1913, constituting the Harbour Commission, which have been, tentatively as it were, put forward, seem when clearly examined to found any claim such as made.\nThe Dominion Parliament may have the power by legislation to lay a foundation for such a claim. Why, indeed, the easy path of legislation has not been chosen instead of the thorny and difficult one of litigation, seems inexplicable.\nThe proclamation deals only with the constitution of a port and the Act of 1913, by section 11 thereof, only gives the commission such property as the Dominion, at the enactment, may have had within the limits defined therein. Moreover, if the marking on Exhibit No. 3 of where the sand in question was taken be correct, that taking was outside said limits. And I suspect the Act was passed later than the alleged commission of the trespass.\nIt would seem as if the property in the foreshore was vested in the province; possibly subject to legislation of the Dominion in virtue of its powers over navigation and shipping. In the absence of such legislation it is not worth while forming a definite opinion as to the powers each may have relative thereto. And even if there is, upon which I express no opinion, an inherent power in the Dominion to take, against any one impeding navigation, proceedings to restrain the same, the facts in evidence do not seem to fit or lay a foundation therefor.\nAnd if the province has the right to the soil and minerals therein, what of the sand ?\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The principal question must be decided by the application of those provisions of the \"British North America Act,\" which effected a distribution between the provinces and the Dominion of the property of the Crown within the territorial limits of the several provinces. As Lord Watson observed in the Precious Metals Case[37] :\u2014\nThe title to the public lands of British Columbia has all along been and still is vested in the Crown; but the right to administer and to dispose of these lands to settlers together with all royal and territorial revenues arising therefrom, had been transferred to the province, before its admission into the Federal Union. And I think it is not unimportant to keep in view the difference between the provisions of the \"British North America Act\" dealing with public proprietary rights and those of section 91 conferring general legislative jurisdiction. It is true, as has been frequently pointed out, that when public property is spoken of in the Act as being \"the property of\" or \"belonging to\" the Dominion or a province these expressions import that the right to its beneficial use or the proceeds of it is within the exclusive disposition of the Dominion or of the provincial legislature as the case may be, the property itself remaining in the \"Sovereign as the Supreme Head of the State\" (see [1892] A.C. p. 443) ; and it may be an admissible form of expression to say that the question whether a given item of public property is vested in the Dominion or in the province is strictly a question of legislative control over its administration as property. Nevertheless this legislative control over Crown property as property whether transferred to the Dominion Legislature or reserved to the Provincial Legislatures is treated in the \"British North America Act\" as ownership, and their Lordships of the Privy Council have more than once held that the provisions of the Act dealing with this subject of ownership in relation to public property must be construed and applied independently of the provisions dealing with general legislative jurisdiction.\nIn St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen[38], it was said:\u2014\nTheir Lordships are, however, unable to assent to the argument for the Dominion founded on section 92(24). There can be no a priori probability that the British Legislature, in a branch of the statute which professes to deal only with the distribution of legislative power, intended to deprive the provinces of rights which are expressly given them in that branch of it which relates to the distribution of revenues and assets. The fact that the power of legislating for Indians, and for lands which are reserved for their use has been entrusted to the Parliament of the Dominion is not in the least degree inconsistent with the right of the provinces to a beneficial interest in these lands, available to them as a source of revenue whenever the estate of the Crown is disencumbered of the Indian title.\nIn The Attorney-General of the Dominion v. The Attorney-General of Ontario[39], at pages 709 and 710:\u2014\nIt must also be borne in mind that there is a broad distinction between proprietary rights and legislative jurisdiction. The fact that such jurisdiction in respect of a particular subject-matter is conferred on the Dominion Legislature, for example, affords no evidence that any proprietary rights with respect to it were transferred to the Dominion. There is no presumption that because legislative jurisdiction was vested in the Dominion Parliament rights were transferred to it. The Dominion of Canada was called into existence by the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" Whatever proprietary rights were at the time of the passing of that Act possessed by the provinces remain vested in them except such as are by any of its express enactments transferred to the Dominion of Canada.\nAnd, at page 713:\u2014\nIf, however, the Legislature purports to confer upon others proprietary rights where it possesses none itself, that in their Lordships' opinion is not an exercise of the legislative jurisdiction conferred by section 91. If the contrary were held, it would follow that the Dominion might practically transfer to itself property which has, by the \"British North America Act,\" been left to the provinces and not vested in it.\nThe question, therefore, whether Spanish Bank has passed to the Dominion is a question which must be determined by reference to the provisions of the Act relating to the distribution of the public assets and as it is not disputed that the property in question was vested in the province at the time of Confederation, the point to be determined is whether or not it has by one of the \"express enactments\" of the \"British North America Act\" been transferred to the Dominion. The Dominion contends that it has been so transferred, by force of section 108, as part of a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of item two of the third schedule.\nThe Dominion contention is twofold.\n(1) That English Bay was a public harbour within the meaning of item two at the time of the admission of British Columbia into the Canadian Union and Spanish Bank was part of that harbour.\nIf these propositions be established the property indisputably passed to the Dominion.\n(2) That English Bay, being at the time mentioned, an arm of the sea having the physical qualities necessary to fit it for use as a public harbour and having since become in fact a public harbour of which Spanish Bank is a part, the public harbour with Spanish Bank as one of its constitutent parts has consequently passed to the Dominion.\nFirst, then, was Spanish Bank part of a public harbour at the time of the admision of British Columbia into the Canadian Federation within the meaning of the second item of the third schedule ?\nLord Herschell, speaking for the Judicial Committee in the Fisheries Case[40], says it would be extremely inconvenient that a determination should be sought of the abstract question: \"What falls within the description of a public harbour ?\" And he adds that it would be likely to prove misleading and dangerous to attempt an exhaustive definition of the term applicable to all cases.\nNevertheless, it must be difficult to apply oneself intelligently to the question of fact whether a particular locality does or does not fall within item 2 of the third schedule without first having arrived at some conclusions as to the attributes connoted by the phrase \"public harbour.\" In Regina v. Hannam[41] , Lord Esher said:\u2014\nA harbour in its ordinary sense was a place to shelter ships from the violence of the sea and where ships are brought for commercial purposes to load and unload goods.\nAnd he added \"the quays were a necessary part of the harbour.\" During the argument on the Fisheries Case[42] the opinion was expressed more than once by Lord Herschell and Lord Watson and: it does not appear to have been disputed on behalf of the Dominion, that to constitute a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of item two it would not be sufficient to have simply an arm of the sea affording shelter to ships in certain states of the wind and that the phrase employed connotes in addition something in the nature of public user for loading or discharging ships. The observations made repeatedly by their Lordships during the argument are, of course, not authoritative, but I think one is justified in appealing to them as evidence of the meaning of the phrase \"public harbour\" according to the common understanding. See stenographer's note of the argument at pages 198, 199 and 201. In Attorney-General v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[43] it was assumed that it was necessary to show user for commercial purposes as distinguished from purposes of navigation merely. Generally speaking, I think such user must be shown in the absence of some evidence of recognition by competent public authority of the locality in controversy as a harbour in the commercial sense. The King v. Bradburn[44], at pages 429 and 430. As to the extent of the commercial user necessary to bring a given locality within the description \"public harbour\" a variety of circumstances may no doubt affect the determination of that question.\nIn British Columbia there was passed, in 1867, and in force at the time of Confederation an ordinance known as the \"Harbour Ordinance,\" an ordinance respecting harbour and tonnage dues and to regulate the licences on the vessels engaged in the coasting and inland navigation trade, which provided for the proclamation of \"ports, inland places and waters\" as \"harbours,\" the effect of the proclamation being to bring the proclaimed locality under the Act for the purpose of applying the regulations and prohibitions enacted by it. There is no evidence in this case and, as I pointed out, in giving judgment at the trial in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[45], there was in that case no evidence of any proclamation having been issued under that ordinance or under the ordinances passed some years before in which the legislation had its origin. Had it been shown that such proclamations had issued with respect to other localities, while the locality in controversy had never been proclaimed, that would have been of considerable weight in favour of the province; while, on the other hand, the fact that the locality had been proclaimed would establish a case in favour of the Dominion which it might be difficult if not impossible for the province to repel. Again, the expenditure of public money or the absence of such expenditure may be a circumstance of some importance. None of these elements is present in this case. The evidence shows that the physical character of English Bay is such as to make it capable of being used as a harbour. It is capable of being used, that is to say, in its natural state, not merely as a shelter for ships, but as a harbour for commercial purposes; but the evidence as to the state of affairs at the date of the Union does not really carry us beyond this. There is no evidence that it was then in use or had ever been in use as a harbour in the commercial sense and the probabilities are against it; and there is no evidence that there ever had been any public money spent upon it or any other recognition of it as a harbour by any competent public authority. My conclusion is on this question of fact that the decision must be against the Dominion.\nEven on the assumption that the Dominion had sufficiently shown English Bay to have been a public harbour at the date mentioned there would still remain the question whether Spanish Bank was a part of that harbour; there is, as I have said, no evidence of user, but I am not sure that, given a public harbour, their Lordships' observations in the Fisheries Case[46] as to the evidence of user by landing goods or anchoring ships can properly be read as intended to lay down a single exclusive test for determining whether the foreshore or solum is or is not part of it. To me, at all events, it is not quite obvious that a ledge or sandspit, the property of the Crown, affording protection necessary for the maintenance of a public harbour, that is to say, protection necessary to enable it to be used for that purpose, can in no circumstance be regarded as part of the harbour within the meaning of item two unless it is shown to have been used for discharging or mooring ships. That Spanish Bank, however, is such a necessary protection is not satisfactorily proved.\nThe second question remains. If the question of public harbour or no public harbour, for the purpose of applying section 108, had to be decided by reference to the circumstances existing at the time the controversy arises and not by reference to the state of circumstances existing at the date of Confederation, I should have no difficulty in holding that English Bay is now a \"public harbour.\"\nThe additional question \u2014 whether or not Spanish Bank is a part of that harbour is one which would probably have to be answered in the negative by reason of the absence of satisfactory evidence either of user or that it serves the office of protection.\nI think, moreover, that the Dominion fails in its main contention on this branch of the argument. The language of sections 108 and 109 and of the third schedule when read with section 117 seems to me to show that subjects of the third schedule were intended to be transferred to the Dominion as subjects which, when the Act came into force, were the property of the province and at that time answered the descriptions found in the schedule. In other words, as the transfer was to be operative upon the passing of the Act, the subjects transferred were necessarily subjects ascertainable at the time by the application of those descriptions to the existing facts. The other construction would lead to results little short of absurdity.\nThe third schedule is in the following words:\u2014\nProvincial public works and property to be the property of Canada.\n1. Canals, with lands and water power connected therewith.\n2. Public harbours.\n3. Lighthouses and piers, and Sable Island.\n4. Steamboats, dredges and public vessels.\n5. Rivers and lake improvements.\n6. Railways and railway stocks, mortgages, and other debts due by railway companies.\n7. Military roads:\n8. Custom houses, post offices, and all other public buildings, except such as the Government of Canada appropriate for the use of the Provincial Legislatures and Governments.\n9. Property transferred by the Imperial Government, and known as Ordinance Property.\n10. Armouries, drill sheds, military clothing, and munitions of war, and land set apart for general public purposes.\nIt could hardly have been within the contemplation of the Act that the roadbed of a provincial government railway, for example, constructed after Confederation should pass to the Dominion as soon as it should be a completed railway or that a ship acquired for provincial government purposes should forthwith become the property of the Dominion. One can hardly distinguish between such subjects (which, if existing at the date of the Act, would, of course, fall within the third schedule) and a pier or an artificial harbour constructed as a provincial government work.\nA reference to the language of the judgments in which the effect of sections 108, 109 and 117 has been discussed seems to indicate that it has generally been assumed that the subjects which passed under section 108 were subjects ascertainable at the time of the transfer. In the Vancouver Street Ends Case (Attorney-General v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.)[47] , it was assumed in all the courts that the question of public harbour or no public harbour and whether the foreshore was one of the constituents of the harbour must be decided by reference to the facts existing in 1871.\nIn the litigation that is generally known as the Fisheries Case[48], the first question submitted by the Dominion and the provinces in relation to the beds of public waters and public harbours was in this form in part :\nDid the beds of the lakes, rivers, public harbours * * * situate within the territorial limits of the several provinces not granted before Confederation become under the \"British North America Act\" the property of the Dominion? (See[49].)\nThe formal answer given by their Lordships to the first question is as follows:\u2014\n1. In answer to the first and fourth questions, that under the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" the improvements only in lakes and rivers within the provinces became the property of the Dominion of Canada; that under the same Act, whatever is properly comprised in the term \"public harbour\" became the property of the Dominion of Canada; and the answer to the question, what is properly so comprised, must depend, to some extent, upon the circumstances of each particular harbour.\nAll this points to a transfer operative at the passing of the Act; and on the argument it was assumed that the date of Confederation was the decisive date. See report of the argument at page 202. As to the point of view from which the subject was considered in the Supreme Court of Canada, see judgment of Strong C.J.[50] , at page 515. The questions submitted in that case were framed after a good deal of consideration and with the object of setting at rest as far as possible such points as that now raised by the Dominion. I think there is sufficient evidence in the arguments and in the judgments to show that there was a general consensus of view that the position now taken by the Dominion was not sustainable.\nIt was also contended on behalf of the Dominion in this court that the acts complained of, removing sand from the bank in question, constituted in some way an infringement of the jus publicum of which the Attorney-General for the Dominion is the proper public authority to make complaint. I have no doubt that the Attorney-General of the Dominion has a status, acting for the Crown on behalf of the public, to invoke the aid of the courts to restrain, in a proper case, any substantial infringement of the public right of navigation or of the rights incidental thereto. But counsel for the Attorney-General of Canada at the trial took an attitude which precludes the appellant from raising at this stage any contention that what is now complained of was in fact an interference with any of those rights; and that ground of relief cannot be considered in this court.\nIt seems necessary to add a word upon the suggestion that the Dominion Parliament may in the exercise of its legislative powers under section 91 against the will of a province acquire the title to provincial Crown lands for the purpose of constituting a harbour. To say the least, that, I think, is gravely questionable, it would be going far beyond anything decided or any opinion expressed in the Attorney-General v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[51], where the courts had to deal with an Act passed in exercise not only of its authority derived from section 91 but also of powers arising from the Terms of Union under which British Columbia entered Confederation and with a case, moreover, in which the assent of the province was abundantly proved; it would not be easy to reconcile such a proposition with Lord Herschell's language quoted above from the judgment in the Fisheries Case[52], or with section 117 of the \"British North America Act.\" I do not, however, enter upon a discussion of the subject. Reference may be had to, Clement's Canadian Constitution, at pp. 388 and 389; the Burrard Power Co. v. The King[53], at page 52; and the Indian Treaty Case; Province of Ontario v. Dominion of Canada[54], at page 127.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I cannot believe that it was intended that every indentation of the uninhabited sea and lake coasts of Canada which had a natural conformation that rendered it susceptible of use as a harbour should pass under section 108 of the \"British North America Act\" from provincial to Dominion control. In my opinion \"public harbours\" in the third schedule means harbours in use as such, and not mere potential harbours.\nThe purpose and operation of section 108 was to effect an immediate transfer of property from the provinces to the Dominion. I strongly incline to the view that it does not apply to harbours which have only come into use as such after the Union. There are other means by which the Dominion can acquire jurisdiction over such harbours and title to the property in the land under and adjacent to them requisite for their proper control and administration, whether that title is vested in the Crown in right of the province (Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. [55], or in private individuals.\nBut it is not necessary to determine this question because I heard nothing in the course of the argument of this appeal, and have found nothing in the record which would warrant interference with the findings of the provincial courts that neither at the date of the entry of the Province of British Columbia into Confederation (1871), nor at the time when this action was begun was English Bay in fact a \"public harbour\" within the meaning of that term as used in the schedule 3 to the \"British North America Act.\"\nNeither the proclamation nor the statute of 1913, relied on by Mr. Newcombe, in my opinion, effected a transfer of the property in question from provincial to Dominion control. The proclamation deals with a port, not with a \"public harbour,\" and is apparently based on an assumption that English Bay formed part of the Harbour of Vancouver. The statute provides powers of expropriation which, so far as the evidence shows, have not yet been exercised.\nThe record contains neither allegation nor evidence that the removal of sand by the respondent company had affected, or was likely to affect, prejudicially any interest over which legislative jurisdiction is vested in the Dominion under the heading, \"Navigation and Shipping.\"\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal from the courts of British Columbia which dismissed the action of the appellant.\nBy the \"British North America Act,\" section 108, and the third schedule, the public harbours of each province have become the property of Canada.\nBy the order-in-council, passed by the Imperial Government in 1871, British Columbia was admitted into the Dominion of Canada and it was stipulated that the provisions of the \"British North America Act\" should be applicable to British Columbia.\nVancouver Harbour was, on the 3rd of December, 1912, proclaimed as such by the Governor in Council under the provisions of the \"Canadian Shipping Act\" and according to that proclamation English Bay was declared to be a part of the harbour.\nIn the year following, a statute was passed by the Federal Parliament vesting the administration of the harbour in the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners, one of the appellants in the present case.\nWe have to examine, at first, whether this English Bay was a public harbour in 1871. As it has been decided in the Fisheries Case[56], the question as to whether a piece of property is a harbour or not is a question of fact which has to be determined according to the circumstances of each case.\nThe courts below unanimously found that English Bay was not, in 1871, a public harbour and nothing has been brought before us which could convince me that this finding was erroneous. It is even very much to be doubted whether this part of Burrard Inlet which is called English Bay was ever considered, before the proclamation of 1912, as part of the Harbour of Vancouver, or was ever considered a harbour by itself. We find by a chart of Burrard Inlet, issued in 1891 by order of the Canadian Government, that Vancouver Harbour did not include the part of Burrard Inlet where English Bay is situate; and that chart then proves conclusively that even the Dominion authorities, before 1891, did not consider English Bay as a part of the Harbour of Vancouver.\nBy the proclamation of 1912 and by the statute passed in the following year the Dominion authorities, of course, assume control over all Burrard Inlet, including English Bay. But that proclamation did not give them the ownership of the bed of the bay. It remained vested in the provincial authorities and the Dominion Government could not assume any right of ownership with regard to that bed without taking the necessary expropriation proceedings. It was a very easy thing to do, but it was not done, and until this is done the provincial authorities may assume to be the owners of the bed of English Bay.\nThe action of the appellant was properly dismissed and I see no reason why we should interfere with the judgment of the courts below.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Maitland, Hunter & Maitland.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McPhillips & Wood.\n[1] 20 B.C.

The King (52 Can. S.C.R. 15) referred to.\nMOTION before the Registrar in Chambers, to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal from the judgment of His Honour A. A. Carpenter, judge of the District Court for the District of Calgary, in Alberta, reducing the assessment of the property of the appellant by varying the decision in respect thereof by the Court of Revision of the City of Calgary.\nThe city assessor of the City of Calgary assessed real estate in the city belonging to the appellant, at a total value of $236,595, which, on his appeal, pursuant to the provisions of the city charter, to the city council sitting as a court of revision, was reduced to $201,107. On a further appeal to the district judge the assessment was further reduced to the sum of $168,595 by the judgment from which an appeal is now sought to the Supreme Court of Canada direct from the decision of the district judge.\nCrysler K.C. in support of the motion contended that the district court judge from whose decision, by provincial legislation, no appeal lay, was a \"court of last resort\" within the language of section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and that an appeal would lie from his decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nFisher, contra, urged (1) that the judge of the district court was \"persona designata\" and his decision was not the subject of an appeal, and (2) that the Alberta statutes gave an appeal from the district judge to the Supreme Court of the province and that the present appeal should not have been taken until after such an appeal had been taken and disposed of.\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is an application to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal direct from the decision of the district judge of the District of Calgary, in Alberta. The facts are as follows:\u2014\nOne William Pearce, the owner of property in Calgary, Alta., having appealed respecting the assessment of his property there from the decision of the court of revision to the judge of the district court, and being dissatisfied with the decision rendered on that appeal, now desires to appeal direct therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" I have to determine whether or not there is jurisdiction in this court to hear such an appeal, there being involved the assessment of property of a value much in excess of $10,000.\nA charter was granted to the City of Calgary by an ordinance of the North-West Territories, chap. 33, of the Ordinances of 1893. By section 40 of that ordinance provision is made for assessment appeals by which the roll shall be revised by the city council as a court of revision. The decision of that court was declared to be final, subject to an appeal to the judge of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories having jurisdiction in the City of Calgary; section 41 of the ordinance gave an appeal from this judge to the Supreme Court en banc.\nIn 1909, by chapter 9 of the statutes of Alberta, a general Act was passed applicable to all cities having a municipal charter by which an appeal from the court of revision was made to lie to the judge of the district court of the district in which the city or town affected was situated, but this statute made no reference to appeals to the Supreme Court en banc nor to section 41, sub-sec. 6, which gave such an appeal from the Supreme Court judge. In 1913, by chapter 27, sec, 7, of the statutes of Alberta, this sixth sub-section was struck out and section 41 was amended in the following manner. The section formerly provided that:\u2014\nif any person is dissatisfied with a decision of the Court of Revision he may appeal therefrom to the judge of the Supreme Court having jurisdiction in the City of Calgary.\nBy the amendment the following words were added, after the word \"Calgary\":\u2014\nand his decision shall be final and conclusive in all matters adjudicated upon\nand, by the same Act, sub-section 6 of section 41, which provided for an appeal to the Supreme Court en banc was repealed. I take it that the effect of this legislation was to provide that, after 1913, assessment appeals from the court of revision had to be taken to the judge of the district court, and that his decision was final so far as provincial legislation was concerned. This, however, could not oust the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. In The Crown Grain' Co. v. Day[1] it was held that provincial legislation could not provide that, in mechanics' lien cases, there should be no further appeal beyond the provincial Court of Queen's Bench, in Manitoba.\nThe \"Supreme Court. Act,\" by section 41, gives an appeal in the following language:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes in cases where the person or persons presiding over such court is or are by provincial or municipal authority authorised to adjudicate and the judgment appealed from involves the assessment of property at a value of not less than ten thousand dollars.\nPrevious to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, chapter 139, the clause of the former \"Supreme Court Act\" dealing with assessment appeals, instead of the words in the present section \"by provincial or municipal authority authorized to adjudicate,\" had the words \"appointed by provincial or municipal authority\" and it was held by this court in the case of The City of Toronto v. The Toronto Railway Co[2] that where, in the Province of Ontario, an appeal lay from the court of revision to a board of county court judges, and it was desired to take an appeal from such board to the Supreme Court of Canada, that no appeal lay under the section in question, as it then stood, as the county court judges were not appointed by provincial or municipal authority but by Dominion authority. Since the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, came into force this decision has no further application and jurisdiction has been exercised in a number of cases: Canadian Niagara Power Co. v. Township of Stamford[3] Re Heintze, Fleitman v. The King. [4]\nI am of opinion that the district judge who heard the appeal from the court of revision in the present case was a \"court of last resort created under provincial legislation\" within the meaning of section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nUnder these circumstances the motion should be granted and the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain the appeal should be affirmed.\nMotion granted with costs. On the 2nd of November, 1915, the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was heard on the merits, the judges present being Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ., and judgment was reserved.\nChrysler K.C. appeared for the appellant.\nC. J Ford for the respondent.\nOn the 15th of November, 1915, judgment was delivered allowing the appeal with costs, the Chief Justice and Davies J. dissenting. By this judgment, on a view by the majority of the judges of the evidence as to the value of the property in question, the amount of the assessment thereon was further reduced.

Sharpe, (Curator of the Estate of Sparrow McNeil) (Plaintiff)\nPresent:--Fitzpatric Davies, Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\nInsolvency\u2014Statute of Elizabeth\u2014Firm's moneys paid for private debt\u2014Bona fides of private creditor\u2014Rights of Quebec curator in Nova Scotia.\nA business firm in the Province of Quebec on the eve of insolvency obtained an advance from their bankers of $2,000 to purchase property on behalf of the firm in Nova Scotia. One of the partners forwarded the money to his sister in Nova Scotia requesting her to purchase the property in question in her own name and retain the same in satisfaction of a promise previously given her by him to reimburse her for certain advances made and services rendered.\nIn an action brought in a Nova Scotia court by the curator of the insolvent firm appointed by a Superior Court in Quebec.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the curator was entitled to have the transaction set aside and the lands purchased treated as part of the insolvent's estate.\nHeld, per Duff J. The equitable interest of the insolvent in real estate in Nova Scotia could only be vested in the curator by some process effective under the law of that province. His Lordship did not wish to be deemed to sanction the view that it would vest, virtute officii, in a curator appointed pursuant to an abandonment of property under the provisions of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondent's action. Sparrow & McNeil were contractors carrying on business in the City of Montreal in the Province of Quebec. On the 13th day of April, 1911, the firm borrowed from their bankers $2,000 to purchase certain gypsum property in the county of Victoria in the Province of Nova Scotia. The partner Francis J. McNeil obtained for his firm the $2,000 and had the conveyance of the lands made to his sister, the appellant. The firm of Sparrow & McNeil made a judicial abandonment of their property and the respondent on the 12th July, 1911, was appointed curator by the Superior Court at Montreal. The present action was brought against Francis T. McNeil and Jane E. McNeil by the curator claiming that the lands so conveyed were paid by the moneys of the insolvent firm, that the defendant had caused the conveyance to be made to the appellant in fraud of the firm and its creditors.\nThe trial judge discredited the evidence of the defendant Francis T. McNeil, but found that the defendant Jane E. McNeil had acted in good faith throughout and had no knowledge that the $2,000 used in the purchase was the property of the firm; that as between her and her brother there was good consideration for the conveyance being made to her, as she had supported her younger brothers and sisters for many years at an expenditure of $1,500 under an agreement with her brother that he was to buy a farm for her. He also found there was no evidence that the firm of Sparrow & McNeil were insolvent when the bargain was made between brother and sister,\u2014and that accordingly the transaction should stand. The majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that the $2,000 was advanced by the bank to buy partnership property and that defendant Francis T. McNeil had fraudulently taken the conveyance in the name of his sister and that she as regards the property was a trustee for the curator and the creditors of the insolvent firm.\nJ.L. Ralston K.O. for appellant. The evidence shows that as between the partners, McNeil had a claim against the partnership assets for $3,500; that the $2,000 borrowed from the bank became partnership funds and that while defendant McNeil, might owe that sum to the partnership, the curator could not claim the property which was purchased with it. That the doctrine of resulting trusts does not apply. Taylor v. Blakelock[1] Taylor v. London & County Banking Company[2]; Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 13, title Equity, p. 78; Vol. 15 Fraudulent and. Voidable Conveyances, p. 81. Lewin on Trusts, 10th Ed., p. 1045; the statute of Elizabeth does not apply. Clough v. Samuel.[3]\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. for respondent. The appellant Jane E. McNeil was disbelieved by a majority of the judges in the court appealed from. The family arrangement relied upon by the trial judge gave rise to no contractual liability and being non-enforceable could not constitute a good and valuable consideration for the transfer of property impeached.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.-I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Russell. DAVIES J.\u2014During the argument of this appeal felt that the appellant's case was a meritorious one, the trial judge had found strongly in her favour and there was a strong dissent by Russell J. from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing that of the trial judge.\nI have not, however, after reading and studying the appellant's evidence which the trial judge fully accepted and believed, been able to convince myself that she had established either a legal or equitable contract between her and her brother capable of being enforced either at law or in equity.\nI cannot help expressing my regret at being forced to this conclusion because it results in the loss by the appellant of all the time given and money spent by her in the bringing up and education of her young brothers and sisters. Meritorious as her case may be it fails, nevertheless, for the reasons I have stated and I therefore concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This action was brought by respondent as curator of an insolvent estate which had been the property of a Montreal firm of contractors and was abandoned there. The law of the domicile of such insolvents must prima facie determine the rights of the creditors in such cases.\nThere may arise in the pursuit of such rights in another province, which is also prima facie to be looked upon in that regard as a foreign state, many different and difficult questions of law either in relation to the administration of the insolvent's estate found there when creditors in such province may have also taken proceedings, or in many other cases in relation to the real estate of the insolvent in such other province. Here we have no such difficulties raised save in the most incidental way for there are no creditors in Nova Scotia where the action was brought who have taken any action and the real estate in question is not alleged to have been so affected by any local law as to render it non-exigible by any creditor or especially any foreign creditor.\nIn short there does not seem to be raised any legal objection which would throw an impediment in the way of the courts of Nova Scotia acting upon the ordinary well recognized comity of nations and aiding the curator resting for his rights upon Quebec law and the direction of Quebec courts to take such action as he may have been advised to be his duty to take.\nSuch local laws as exist bearing upon the questions raised are in harmony with the law upon which the curator's title to relief rests. It is only in this sense that the statutes of Elizabeth can be properly referred to or relied upon herein.\nIt is the debtor's property in the Quebec legal sense of the term that measures the right of the curator here in question.\nAnd even if the lex fori might in a given case give creditors as such a wider and more effective measure of relief than the curator can assert claim to without that given by Quebec law, he could not claim the benefit thereof.\nIf again there happened to be in the lex fori some provision which furnished a bar to attacking and realizing out of immovable property the claims of the curator, he might fail even though under the law of Quebec such a defence could not be maintained if the immovable property were situate there. No such conflict is apparent in the case we are dealing with. It is unnecessary, therefore, to dwell at length upon the authorities maintaining the several propositions I have put forward. They are collected and discussed in such well known works as Westlake's \"Private International Law,\" Foote's \"Private International Jurisprudence\" and Story's \"Conflict of Laws.\"\nIt is only necessary for our present purpose to have a clear apprehension of the general principles of law applicable to the rights of the respondent under the facts presented herein.\nIt is, as I view the facts, the law of Quebec to which we must look in this case. That law is given by a local expert in a brief and summary manner testifying thereto. And though his evidence may fall short of covering the whole ground upon which we must proceed yet we are entitled and indeed bound in this court to recognize judicially the law of each province as we decided in the case of Logan v. Lee1 following Cooper v. Cooper2, referred to therein.\nComing to the facts in evidence as I agree in the main with the analysis thereof in the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher in the court below, I need not go into details.\nThe money which paid for the land in question, except possibly $100, to which I will presently refer, was got by the insolvents as a firm and for the express purpose of paying for the land in question. I accept entirely the evidence of Mr. Johnson the agent of the bank from which it was got. And his letters to the Royal Bank providing therefor five days before the deed in question was got and the transaction completed so far away as North Sydney in Nova Scotia, indicate no time was lost. The appellant never paid any part of the purchase money, yet in answer to the interrogatories delivered before the trial, answered as follows:\u2014\n43.\u2014Did you purchase a piece of land at Island Point, Victoria County, from John McLeod, April 18, 1911; and if so, what did you pay for same, how was it paid, by whom and when?\u2014A. I purchased a piece of land at Island Point from John McLeod, and paid him $2,000 for it; my brother, I think, handed him the money, and I think the date was on or about the 18th of April, 1911.\n44.\u2014Was the transaction and negotiation, if any, for purchase carried through by you personally and how long did same take?\u2014A. carried on personal negotiations for purchase of said property, I canno say how long.\n45.\u2014How long since your brother Francis J. McNeil has been in Cape Breton so far as you know?\u2014A. April, 1911.\n46.\u2014Did you ever see a cheque for $2,000.00 dated April 18, 1911, drawn by W. F. Sparrow on the Molsons Bank, Montreal, in favour of Francis J. McNeil; if so, under what circumstances.\u2014A. No.\nWhen we find that her brother, who was one of the said firm of Sparrow and McNeil in question, managed personally and through his solicitor, and agent, the whole transaction relative to getting the deed executed and paid the money got as above mentioned, I submit that these statements under oath can hardly be properly described as counsel suggested as being merely \"uncandid.\"\nIt rather shocks one to be asked in face of such a perversion, under oath, of. the truth by the appellant, to treat her as a credible witness when testifying relatively to the same transaction. And still more so when we find she is not ignorant or stupid, but a school teacher of such attainments that at eighteen years of age she was earning a salary of nearly $600 a year, and was not in making such answers driven by the nervous excitement so often incidental to a cross-examination in a public crowded court. When later at the trial she abandons this version and seeks to set up that she had some correspondence by letters with her brother, and later some conversation with him in which he or she proposed buying a farm to put the younger members of the family upon and that she was to help out of her earnings to pay for their keep and did so help and in course of doing so paid $1,500 and she rests her claim upon that, I must, in view of her former testimony, be permitted to doubt the whole story so far as having any relation to the transaction now in question. To do her justice she says without any special questions as to it, that she would have done so anyway and I quite believe that.\nBut when we find that she tells us that the brother destroyed the letters she wrote him and she fails to tell anything of the answers thereto, and that there is no corroboration of her story, except by him, and even taking her statement of earnings up to the time of the transaction and deducting her admitted expenses, the balance could not reach any such sum, how can we rely on it for anything beyond the obvious truth that she would have done so anyway. Besides she got $200 from him on account of help needed for the family. It is not as if she had paid out in this way $2,000 and then been repaid for it by the brother advancing this money to her. In that case her first oath would have had more semblance of justification though quite inaccurate.\nEven if she had been the most accurate trustworthy person in all her statements, how could she maintain a contract by this later version upon which she could bring an action?\nThe whole story furnishes nothing upon which to rest any legal claim to fulfillment of it by this purchase. And when she must have been a minor at the time how much less can she be allowed to put it forward as a binding contract upon which to furnish not a good, but a valuable consideration? This story is at best a loose and rather inchoate thing, but her way of looking at her oath forbids us attempting to found thereon something definite and rational by inferring things not expressed.\nI do not see my way to accept the story or to found upon it anything which can be called a valuable consideration needed to uphold her right to the land in question.\nAnd we find evidence scattered through the case showing almost as clearly as the learned trial judge has expressed his opinion of him, how utterly wanting in the truth is the brother who has misled the unfortunate plaintiff and I cannot help thinking, is still doing so.\nThe story of his having paid some months before the sum of $100 deposit and got a receipt for it, ought to have been followed up in a way it was not, but taking it as told, where is the receipt? In whose name was it given? If in the appellant's name no doubt we would have had it produced and pressed on the court as proof of the alleged agreement at a time when insolvency was not so close at hand, or at least so apparent. I think the fair inference is it was in the name of this insolvent brother, if not of the firm. The vendor of the property was not called, nor were the facts and circumstances bearing upon the condition and maintenance of the family gone into as they might have been had the story now put forward been given in answer to the interrogatories. To allow it now to succeed would be putting a premium upon answering untruly such interrogatories which are intended as a means of discovery.\nI think the transaction in question was clearly gift or simulated to cover a fraud. In view of all the facts and especially the obvious unfitness of this property to serve as the suggested home farm for a family, possibly unfitted for it, and the fact that within three weeks after the deed was executed to appellant, her brother was offering an option for that part of the land, possibly the whole, which could be mined for gypsum, at an extravagant figure and Sparrow signing that option as a witness, I incline to the opinion that the later view represented the actual truth in regard to the matter and appellant but a tool in the hands of an unscrupulous brother.\nIn the former view the insolvent condition of the firms renders the transaction one entitling respondent to succeed herein.\nIn either way of looking at the matter the result must be the same\nThe circumstance that the partner Sparrow sub-scribed as a witness to the option given for the gypsum bed, counts for nothing when we find that he was active in getting if not the man who got the money from the bank.\nTo concoct theories which would help such men to exploit their creditors is not generally what courts endeavour to accomplish. Yet that seems to me what we are invited to attempt herein on the curious and dubious import of- this incident in a career of fraud which ended in leaving creditors to the amount of forty thousand dollars, and but four or five thousand dollars and perhaps not that to pay them.\nThe members of the firm were acting in harmony till sometime later. Then we have the desperate financial condition of the firm and in face of that and no legal obligation to her, a gift to appellant of $2,000 for which the bank had to be drawn upon and representations made to it which, if the story now set up by appellant and her brother be true, I am not disposed to rate this man McNeil's integrity very high, but. I do not credit him with being such a deliberate rascal as the established facts and a belief in the story now set up would imply.\nWe have heard of something akin to men plundering a bank to give their friends or relations what they wished them to enjoy. Such a thing is possible.\nThe option sold three weeks after these men had got the money out of the bank to lay the foundation for such a sale of an option rather indicates another purpose operating in their minds They were insolvents, ruined men, gambling on any chance, needing some one to hold the stakes, the appellant was such merely the stake-holder. The story now set up was not then planned. It was never then supposed to be needed. Hence at first it seemed necessary for both appellant and her brother to deny by implication in their statements, that the money was got from the source it came from and to pretend she paid the price. Later the present story was put forward. When was it invented? Why?\nPassing these suggestions which furnish ground for believing it a case of simulation I may say it is not necessary to solve exactly what was the moving cause.\nThe money of the firm paid for the property and the illustration of a resulting trust put forward by Chief Justice Townsend is very apt as showing how in our English law such a transaction might be looked at. The result according to the common sense of every system of law must inevitably lead to the same conclusion, that is, that this property became the property of the firm unless displaced by something stronger than has been brought forward. Stress is laid in appellant's factum upon Sparrow's not contradicting things told by McNeil at the trial. As the former was examined by way of commission and latter at the trial, there does not seem much force in such an argument especially in light of answers by him and the appellant to the interrogatories.\nWas the firm insolvent when the deed was made?\nThe respondent presents an estate of such hopeless insolvency, three months later, which is unexplained by any losses meantime, as to render it easy to answer that the firm was seemingly just as hopelessly insolvent at that time the gift was made, as one sometimes, but seldom, finds. The respondent is therefore entitled on the foregoing view of the facts to succeed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. The property having been purchased with funds which were held to be and I am convinced that the finding was right the property of Sparrow, and McNeil; and being property which in the circumstances either of them was, I think, entitled as against the other to have applied in payment of partnership debts, the appellant could only succeed as against Sparrow by showing that she was a purchaser for value without notice of Sparrow's rights. I think she has not shewn that by satisfactory evidence. The ground on which the appeal was supported by Mr. Ralston therefore fails.\nIt seems right to observe that the point as to the status of the respondent mentioned during the argument from the Bench is not passed upon. If taken at an earlier stage it could have been met by adding Sparrow as a party plaintiff and that no doubt accounts for the fact that it was not taken and in any view of the merits of this objection would be sufficient reason for not giving effect to it now.\nIt is only necessary to say that Sparrow's equitable interest in real property in Nova Scotia arising from his-right to have the property applied in payment of partnership debts the partnership assets proper being insufficient could only become vested in the respondent by some process which would be effective for that purpose according to the law of Nova Scotia; whether the supplementary abandonment of the 7th Sept., 1911, was sufficient for that purpose need not be discussed. The point is mentioned only to avoid the appearance of sanctioning the view that a curator appointed pursuant to an abandonment of property under the provisions of the Civil Code of Procedure of the Province of Quebec has vested in him virtute officii all the debtor's equitable interests in real property situated in other provinces.\nBRODEUR J.-I concur with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Gunn.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Galles & Hill.\n[1] 32 C.D. 560\n[2] [1901] 2 Ch 231\n[3] [1905] A.C. 442\n1 39 Can.
