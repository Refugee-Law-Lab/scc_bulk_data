Davie, (1921) 61 S.C.R. 363\nDate: 1921-02-01\nD. W. Ogilvie & Company (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nA. C. Davie and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1920: November 15, 17; 1921: February 1.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nContract\u2014Illegality\u2014Public order\u2014Questions raised only at argument\u2014New trial\u2014Arts. 989, 990 C.C.\u2014Sect. 158 (f.) Cr. C.\nPer Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014Where a contract sued upon has been held void for illegality on a ground not pleaded and not referred to at the trial until after the close of the evidence, and the circumstances relied upon to establish such illegality may be susceptible of explanation, a new trial should be directed to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to adduce evidence to meet the defence of illegality. Connolly v. Consumers Cordage Co. (89 L.T.R. 347) followed.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014In the case of a sale to the Government a contract by the vendor to pay an agent, engaged by him to procure the highest possible price, all that such agent could obtain over a figure fixed by the vendor as the minimum net price he would accept is not per se illegal as contrary to public order.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014Upon the evidence, the option agreement alleged by the appellants had expired and had never been renewed.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial court and dismissing the appellant's action. The appellants claim from the respondents the sum of $12,567.85 being for commission and profits due to them by virtue of a certain agreement, this sum being the difference between the amount for which the appellants had the right to purchase the respondent's property and the amount paid by the government under expropriation proceedings. The respondents fyled pleas that the action was premature, that the commission and profits had already been paid to appellants' agent, and others in relation to the respective items of the claim. At the close of the trial, the respondents' counsel, in argument, alleged that, upon the evidence, when they agreed to pay the appellants for was an exercise of improper influence with the government of Canada or some ministers of the Crown or some of its officials in order to effect the sale of their property. The trial judge and the Court of King's Bench dismissed the appellant's action, resting their judgment solely on that ground of illegality.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and J. W. Cook K.C. for the appellants.\nLouis St. Laurent K.C. and Gravel K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondents, as owners in part and as executors or trustees in part, were entitled to compensation for land in Levis expropriated by the Crown for purposes of the Intercolonial Railway on the 12th August, 1912. It is by no means clear whether it was as the result of ignorance of the fact that the land had been so expropriated or as a means of determining the compensation due the respondents, that they retained appellants on the 1st October, 1912, for some purpose and to effectuate same gave, on said date, the following option:\u2014\nD. W. Ogilvie, Esq.,\n11 St. Sacrament St., Montreal, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\nWe hereby give you an option to purchase the following described property, such option to be good for four (4) months from present date.\nThat certain property known as the G. T. Davie & Sons property, situated in the town of Levis, P.Q., the said property being bounded on the north-west by the river St. Lawrence; on the south-east by the public road known as the Commercial Road; the whole as per plan prepared by A. E. Bourget, P.L.S., of date March 28th, 1912. The whole as it now exists with wharves, buildings, etc., erected thereon.\nThe property to be accepted subject to existing leases and servitudes.\nRents, taxes, insurance, etc., to be adjusted to date of passing of deeds.\nThe property to be free and clear of any and all encumbrances.\nPurchase price to be as per our letter of this date, payable on passing of deeds, which must be passed within thirty (30) days from the date of acceptance of option.\nIn the event of this option being taken up and the purchase price paid, we agree to pay D. W. Ogilvie & Company, incorporated, a commission of five per cent (5%) on the purchase price.\nYours very truly,\nGeorge T. Davie & Son.\nThe appellant responded thereto by the following:\u2014\n11 St. Sacrament St.\nMontreal, Oct. 1, 1912.\nMessrs. G. T. Davie & Sons,\nLevis, P.Q.\nDear Sirs:\nIn reference to the option given me this day to purchase that certain property owned by you situated in the town of Levis, P.Q., the whole as per plan prepared by A. E. Bourget, P.L.S. of date March 28th, 1912.\nIt is hereby understood that this option is given for the purpose of my acting as your agent for the sale of the property at the best obtainable figure and on completion of the sale I am to receive a commission of five per cent on the purchase price.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) Douglas W. Ogilvie. The letter of respondents of 1st October, 1912, enclosing the option, had referred to the part the Government required as worth, at least, $2.00 per foot, evidently thereby including injurious affection of so taking, and referred to some other land as possibly required for same purpose as worth $1.00 a foot.\nThat option evidently expired by effluxion of time without any results, or extension, or renewal, and all therein, and connected therewith, seems only useful as illuminating to a certain, or rather uncertain, extent, what follows.\nThe next stage in the relations between the parties hereto appears, by the following letter of appellant of 7th May, 1913, and reply of respondent of 14th May, 1913, which read as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, May 7, 1913.\nMessrs. George T. Davie & Sons,\nLevis, P.Q.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nThe Intercolonial Railway of Canada have sent us a blue print of your property situated in Lauzon Ward, Levis, shewing the land they purpose to expropriate lying between the present Intercolonial Railway and the King's highway; the strip of land having a superficial area, according to the plan as prepared by A. E. Bourget, of 36,900 sq. ft. E.M.\nIn order to take up this matter with the Intercolonial Railway, will you kindly write us giving us the best cash price you will accept for the 36,900 sq. ft. of land. On receipt of your letter we will communicate with the proper officials and endeavour to make a sale of the property direct to the Intercolonial Railway without expropriation proceedings.\nTrusting you will give this matter your early attention, as it is advisable to settle with the railway before expropriation proceedings are started.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) D. W. Ogilvie & Co., Inc.\nPer D. W. Ogilvie. (REPLY).\nLevis, May 14th, 1913.\nMessrs. D. W. Ogilvie & Co.,\n11 St. Sacrament St., Montreal, Que.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nIn answer to your letter of May 7th, we beg to say that we are asking one dollar and twenty-five cents ($1.25) per foot of our property which has been expropriated by the Intercolonial Railway.\nYours very truly,\nGeo. T. Davie & Son.\nPer J. O. A. V.\nThat seems to have resulted in some little movement on the part of the appellant, for it is able, on the 13th Oct., 1913, to write as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, October 13th, 1913.\nF. P. Gutelius, Esq.,\nGeneral Manager,\nIntercolonial Rly. of Canada,\nMoncton, N.B.\nRe Geo. T. Davie & Son's property, Levis, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nWe beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the 9th instant and note contents.\nAs per our letter of May 16th, 1913, addressed to Mr. F. T. Brady, we are prepared to sell the G. T. Davie & Sons' property in Lauzon Ward, Levis, P.Q., containing 36,900 sq. ft., for the sum of 164,575.00, or $1.75 per sq. ft. This price will cover all damages.\nWe would point out that the question of \"Damage\" is a serious one, as Mrs. Davie has to vacate the Davie residence, lying to the south of the land in question; and the office of G. T. Davie & Sons, and the Quebec Salvage Company, has to be vacated owing to the noise, inconvenience, etc., caused by the Intercolonial Railway taking over the strip of land in question.\nIn addition to this, the question of carriage between the Davie property situated to the south and to the north of the strip of land in question has become a difficult one owing to the several tracks they have to cross, and to the fact that the ground on this strip has been excavated and it makes it difficult to take a heavy load from one property to the other.\nMr. Geo. D. Davie is in Montreal to-day and the contents of this communication has been put before him, and he has expressed his opinion of being anxious to come to an early amicable settlement with the Railway Company.\nYours very truly,\n(S.) D.W. Ogilvie & Co. Inc.\n(S.) D.W. Ogilvie. Something, not clear what, revived the energy of appellant, for we have respondent's letter:\nMontreal, Jan. 30th, 1914.\nMessrs. D. W. Ogilvie & Co. Inc.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nRe Levis property.\nI hereby confirm the verbal extension given you some time ago of your option for the purchase of the property of the undersigned at Levis, at the modified price of a dollar and seventy-five cents per foot for the portion required by the Government, viz., the portion lying between the highway and the Intercolonial Railway, and containing approximately thirty-six thousand nine hundred square feet, or one dollar and twenty-five cents per foot, if you take the whole of the property; the above option being hereby extended until, say, the first of April, next.\nYours truly,\n(S.) George T. Davie & Sons.\nPer G. D. D.\nMontreal, March 31st, 1914.\nThe above option is hereby renewed on the same terms and condition for sixty (60) days from the present date.\n(S.) George T. Davie & Sons.\n(S.) per G.D.D.\nand reply from appellant's manager, as follows:\u2014\nMarch, 26th, 1914.\nGeorge D. Davie, Esq.,\nLevis, P.Q.\nDear Mr. Davie:\nIn reference to the strip of land containing about 36,900 sq. ft. which the Intercolonial Railway desire to purchase.\nFollowing your verbal instructions, I have again got directly in touch with the officials of the Intercolonial Railway regarding the sale of this property, and have to-day been informed that as Mr. Gutelius is likely to be kept at Ottawa for some days on important business nothing at present can be done.\nThe official in question, however, informed me that the railway were anxious to come to an amicable settlement for the purchase of this property.\nUnder the circumstances, in order that there be no misunderstanding, will you be good enough to renew the option of date January 30th, 1914, which expires on April 1st, 1914, for say, sixty (60) days.\nThis will give an opportunity to meet Mr. Gutelius in Montreal or Moncton during the next couple of weeks and get this property sold at private sale without any of our Quebec friends interfering in same.\nWith kindest regards,\nYours very truly,\nDouglas W. Ogilvie. Nothing having been accomplished meantime, and the sixty days' extension if given (as may be inferred from the letters of 22nd April and 28th April, 1914) having expired, I again remark that all the foregoing must pass for nothing as contractual basis to be relied upon by appellant, save as illuminating the relations between the parties.\nThe letters I refer to of April, 1914, are as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, April 22nd, 1914.\nGeo. D. Davie, Esq.,\nLevis, Que.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nI understand Mr. Barnard spoke to you in reference to the property of George T. Davie & Sons which I.C.R. wish to acquire.\nI can get you one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per sq. ft. for this piece of land from the railway, but I am also of the opinion that if we hold out, this sum can be increased.\nAs our option on this property is good until June 1st, I would be obliged if you would give the matter consideration.\nI might suggest that the property be sold to myself or some other responsible individual on a small cash payment at $1.75 per sq. ft.; and that any profit over and above $1.75 per sq. ft. secured from the I.C.R. be divided amongst those interested. This matter we would have to adjust when we next meet.\nTrusting you will take the matter up with your brothers and see what can be done.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) Douglas W. Ogilvie.\nLevis, Que., 28th April, 1914\nD. W. Ogilvie, Esq.,\n11 St. Sacrament St., Montreal.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nYour favour of the 22nd instant re the property expropriated at Levis by the I.C.R. was duly read and as requested I have talked the matter over with my brother.\nHe is agreeable that we dispose of this property either to yourself or some other responsible party that you would name at $1.75 per sq. ft. on consideration of a cash payment to be made on same, leaving you to dispose of it to the Government and any difference over the $1.75 to be divided as you see fit.\nYours truly,\nGeorge D. Davie. On the 2nd of June, 1914, when that last option extension ended, respondents, apparently tired of the needless and vexatious delay, promptly began to act on their own behalf and wrote directly to the manager of the Intercolonial as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, June 2nd, 1914.\nF. P. Gutelius, Esq.,\nManager, Intercolonial Rly., Moncton, N.B.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nSince Sept., 1912, we have been corresponding with various officials of the Intercolonial Railway in reference to a strip of land at Levis, P.Q., which the railway company has taken possession of and which belonged to Geo. T. Davie & Sons, Levis, P.Q.\nThe property in question has been acquired by the Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co., Limited, and at a meeting of the directors held at Montreal, this morning, we were instructed, without prejudice to the proprietors' rights and subject to immediate acceptance, and that the deed of sale be signed not later than July 1st, 1914, to make the following proposition:\nWe will sell you the property containing a superficies of 36,900 sq. ft. E.M. as per survey prepared by A. E. Bourget, P.L.S., for the sum of sixty-nine thousand, five hundred and seventy-five dollars ($69,575.00) cash, on passing of deed. The purchase price to include damages to the adjoining property as belonging to the Davie Company.\nThe Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co., Limited, is anxious to come to an amicable settlement regarding the purchase of this land, and we trust you will give the matter your immediate consideration.\nHis reply is not in the case.\nSurely that must have cut away all hope on the part of appellant ever reaping anything by fair means of any profit beyond the basis of $1.75 per foot for whatever land taken by the Crown for the purposes in question.\nIn response to letters meantime the appellant's manager wrote as follows:\u2014 11 St. Sacrament St.,\nMontreal, Sept. 15th, 1914.\nMessrs. George T. Davie & Sons,\nLevis, P.Q.\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, asking what the position is of your claim against the Government for land taken for the I.C.R. cattle sheds at Levis.\nI beg to say that the settlement of this matter is progressing, I consider on the whole, very satisfactorily.\nWe have arranged with the Government to apply for a petition of right to sue the Government for the value of the land, but have been asked not to press this matter, as they expect to make a settlement.\nIn Ottawa last week we were asked to write Mr. Gutelius telling him that if the matter was not settled before the 20th instant, we would apply for the Petition of Right and that the same would be granted.\nOf course you know it is very difficult to get the Government to move in any matter outside of war matters just at present; but they are well disposed, and I really think we will be able to settle this matter without suit within a very short time.\nOf course when the settlement is effected,, it will bear interest from the date of the taking of possession by the railway company of the Davie property.\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory, and assuring you that we are doing everything possible in order to obtain a quick settlement in this matter.\nYours very truly,\nDouglas W. Ogilvie.\nLevis, Que., 17th Mar., 1915.\nNothing more appears in the case, bearing directly on the measure of appellant's retainer until March 17th, 1915, when respondents write as follows:\u2014\nMessrs. D. W. Ogilvie & Co., Inc.,\n11 St. Sacrament St., Montreal.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nIn connection with our property at Levis, which the Intercolonial Railway Co. has taken possession of for a siding and which property has been in your hands for sale to the Government, Mr. Barnard states that the Government will be willing to settle for the property on terms that would give us one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per foot for the property, with interest at 4% from date of sale to be passed as soon as the deeds are got in shape. The purchase price to be payable as soon as the Government is in funds and not later than two years from date.\nThis would be satisfactory to us and we hereby authorize you to close the matter on such terms.\nYours faithfully,\nGeo. T. Davie & Sons.\nIt is to be observed that this did not expressly renew or pretend to extend the terms of previous letters giving an option and it is to me incredible that in face of the respective letters of appellant of 13th October, 1913, and of respondents of 2nd of June, 1914, to Mr. Gutelius, plainly declaring their terms, that there should exist any hope of profit to be got by fair means.\nI, therefore, see no basis upon which appellant can rest any claim for compensation on such a basis, or any other basis than the 5% on price of $1.75 per foot.\nHence if there was in fact any discovery that a larger area than the original 36,900 square feet within that spoken of and defined by the plan of expropriation, that larger area was respondents' property and the price they named of $1.75 per sq. foot over and over again, sometimes expressed as 36,900 square feet, and at others as that more or less, was theirs within the literal terms declared in the foregoing letters'.\nThe only thing quite apparent is that for years the respondents having allowed the appellants the opportunities I have outlined above, then ceased to do so and claimed payment on basis of $1.75 a foot upon which appellant would be entitled to its commission. That had been paid before the appellant sued herein on the basis of 36,900 sq. feet being the correct measurement as assumed throughout till execution of deed; unless in regard to an incident connected with the work of one Addie, a surveyor, who was not called, and whose computation of the area in question may have been the foundation for claims alleged to have been made by the Government that it contained only 34,312 square feet.\nThe deed to the Crown which resulted, after a year or more of delay, and is dated 2nd June, 1915, professes to convey 38,723 feet.\nI am unable to identify the two descriptions, that is the one given in expropriation and that given in the deed, as being identical, though I see nothing to demonstrate that the area in the original description had been for any reason increased and yet why a new description was resorted to is neither explained nor explicable on the evidence before us. Either they are the same or the contract under which appellant worked has been departed from in a way that would not help it herein.\nIf they are, as is quite possible, within the same boundaries, only differently expressed, then the appellant has nothing to complain of herein unless by reason of an error of computation of area that he has not got his commission upon the price of $1.75 per square foot.\nThe apparent difference in area would be 1,823 feet, which, at $1.75 per foot, would be $3,190.25, and appellant's commission thereon would be, as I make it, $159.51 due him, if this later computation of area correct.\nOn my construction of the appellant's contract with respondents, as evidenced by the above quoted letters and the attendant circumstances interpreting same, this would be the ultimate result for appellant. I can see no ground for the extension of the implications of profit after the time limit therefor had expired and the respondents had declared by their letter of 2nd June, 1914, to Mr. Gutelius, the terms upon which they were willing to accept as compensation for their land expropriated, whether it be 36,900 feet or 38,723 feet.\nIt would have been highly improper for those serving the Crown to have given more; if more given, it must be attributed to mistake, or something worse, which I hope did not exist, and, in any event, could not benefit appellant.\nIn this view of the contract between the parties hereto there never was any foundation for the pretension of appellant to any share in the interest to be paid by the Crown for the detention of payment.\nThe claim set up by appellant of about twenty to twenty-five per cent profit, under all the circumstances, is most repulsive and suggestive of much suspicion of its having been founded upon hopes and expectations offensive against the provisions of the public policy enunciated in section 158 of the Criminal Code.\nUnless we are to assume, what is inherently improbable, that the respondents were so ignorant and incapable as to be quite unfitted for taking care of their own affairs, and much less of discharging their duties as trustees, the result seems inexplicable upon any other theory than that the Crown was made to pay twenty-five per cent more than respondents were willing to accept.\nWhich alternative should be adopted: That the Crown was not well advised; or that it was imposed upon? And again, that such imposition was designedly brought about, or merely that the feeble folk serving the Crown were overcome by those serving the respondents? And again, was it the result of a clear recognition on the part of the respondents that it was only by engaging an equipment adequate to surmount the lethargic resistance of such feeble folk, that the respondents could get a just consideration of their rights which led them to offer such a price for the service?\nIn the evidence there is a good deal that is very suggestive of some willingness to do some manoeuvering.\nIn justice to the Minister of the Department there is not the slightest ground of suspicion attaching to him or to others directly serving the Crown.\nWe must, however, I submit, aid them in removing the tendency of suspicion on the part of those believing otherwise that such things can be done, by always scrutinizing closely the conduct of those dealing with their subordinates.\nThere is much to arouse suspicion in some features of the actions of the parties hereto and their respective agents, and if the suspicious discovery of increase in area is unfounded the Crown may recover from the respondents, but that would not or should not help appellant.\nThere is, in my view of the facts, no need to consider the ground taken in the courts below.\nIf the result had been to increase the price to the extent claimed by appellant of twenty or perhaps twenty-five per cent beyond the price which the respondents had offered, then, I suspect, there would be much in the case to suggest an examination of the law and facts which the said courts have proceeded upon.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs, but without prejudice to the appellant's right to recover in another action the small item of $159.00 it may be entitled to if in fact there was actually an increase of area beyond that originally contemplated, conveyed to the Crown. Whether or not there was an error or computation in the area upon the basis of which the price per foot desired by respondents was such as to entitle appellant to the item I have named as possible based thereon, has not been the foundation of this appellant's action or tried out.\nIt is quite possible that the respondents have been paid too much, and that such overpayment is recoverable by the Crown, and hence I do not deal with the payments made by respondents to the subordinate agent of the appellant.\nDuff J.\u2014I regret to say that I have been unable to concur in Mr. Lafleur's contention that the decision of the trial judge affirmed by the Court of King's Bench to the effect that the plaintiff's claim arises out of transactions juridically sterile because partaking of the nature of trafficking with influence is entirely without foundation in the evidence.\nOn the other hand it is quite clear to me that the odious accusation which by the conclusion of the courts below is held to be established was never really put to the witnesses principally concerned in such a way as to give them a fair opportunity of meeting it and clearing themselves; and the point to which I have given my attention is whether, there being some evidence pointing in the direction of the conclusion at which the courts below have arrived, it is of sufficient weight to support the judgments or of so little weight as to require a reversal of those judgments on this point. On the whole I think the more satisfactory course is to order a new trial reserving all the costs including all the costs of the appeal to this Court to abide the result of that trial. This being my conclusion, it would be improper to discuss the evidence in detail. I am satisfied that as regards the other issues raised by the pleadings the appellants have fully established their right to recover the amount claimed; and the retrial should therefore be limited strictly to the issue whether or not the contract upon which the claim is based is a contract the enforcement of which the law regards as incompatible with those paramount interests of the community which are compendiously indicated by the phrases \"public policy\" and \"public order.\"\nAnglin J.\u2014Appealing from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, affirming the dismissal of their action by the Superior Court, the plaintiffs seek judgment for the amount of their claim, or, alternatively, a new trial on the ground that they were not given an opportunity of meeting a charge of illegality, not pleaded and first preferred in the course of the argument before the trial judge, on which the judgments against them solely rest.\nThe claim as formulated in the declaration consists of three items:\n(a) Balance of commission at five per cent on the price which the defendants agreed to accept for their land\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026$\n159.51\n(b) Price paid in excess of what the vendors agreed to take, exclusive of interest\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n1,809.75\n(c) Interest on the price paid between the date of taking possession and the date of closing the transaction (\"date of sale\")\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n10,598.59\n$12,567.85 Besides particular defences peculiar to each item, two general defences are pleaded\u2014that the action is premature and that the plaintiffs' claim has been satisfied by payments made by the defendants to Mr. C. A. Barnard. Consideration of these pleas may be advantageously deferred. The discussion of the several items will, therefore, proceed subject to them and to the defence of illegality.\n(a) and (b). A contract to pay a commission of five per cent on a price of $1.75 per square foot, which the defendants had agreed to accept, is admitted. A supplementary contract that any sum in excess of this figure which the plaintiffs could induce the Government to pay would belong to them as additional remuneration is contested. But in view of the admissions in the examination of Allison C. Davie, the correspondence in evidence, and the acknowledgment of this supplementary contract by the payment of $5,000 on account of it by the defendants to Mr. C. A. Barnard, there seems to be no reason to doubt that it is established. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the balance of the commission asked and only to the $1,809.75 claimed as excess price, or whether the demand for a balance of commission is unfounded and the whole $5,000 and interest thereon should have been claimed as \"extra price\" depends on the true area of the property conveyed to the Crown.\nIf the area conveyed was in fact that named in the deeds, 38,723 square feet, the claim as formulated is correct as to both items. If it was 36,900 square feet, which was the basis of the negotiations and of the actual settlement with the Government of the price paid ($64,575 for 36,900 square feet at $1.75, plus $5,000, a lump sum agreed to as a compromise), the claim for a balance of commission is ill founded and, if not debarred by the principle limiting the adjudication to the sum demanded (Art. 113 C.C.P.) the plaintiffs would be clearly entitled to the sum of $5,000 and interest thereon instead of $1,809.75, in respect of item (b) of their claim. In their factum, however, while apparently recognizing that a mistake was made in this respect to their detriment they adhere to their claim as formulated in the declaration.\nThe notice of expropriation gave the area of the property to be taken as .79 acres, or 34,412 square feet. According to a survey made by Mr. Bourget, P.L.S., the actual area of the land expropriated was 36,900 square feet and the defendants appear to have based their claim throughout on that being the correct quantity. They still adhere to that position. Another survey made for them by Mr. Addie is stated in a letter from the Deputy Minister of Railways to Mr. Barnard to have shown an area of 38,671.3 square feet. The Deputy Minister points out that Mr. Addie probably included land which was already the property of the Crown. The defendants asked that the Government should send a qualified surveyor to check over Mr. Addie's survey on the ground and arrive at a definite result with him. If that was done, the record does not show the result. Whether anything was done or not, and whatever its result if anything was done, it is abundantly clear that the transaction was closed between Mr. Barnard and the Department on the basis of the actual area being 36,900 square feet, which it was agreed should be conveyed at a price of $1.75 per foot ($64,575) plus $5,000 additional. This latter sum was agreed upon, Mr. Barnard tells us, by way of compromise between the figure of $1.75 per square foot stated by the plaintiffs in their letter of 13th October, 1913, to the general manager of the I.C.R., and confirmed by the defendants' letter of the 30th of January, 1914, as what they were willing to accept on a basis of 36,900 square feet, and $2.00 per square foot, the price finally demanded from the Department by Mr. Barnard, who represented the plaintiffs. Mr. Barnard's evidence and his letters put that beyond doubt.\nThe deeds transferring the land to the Crown, in which the area is stated to be 38,723 square feet, were not seen either by the plaintiffs or by Mr. Barnard before execution, although they had asked to be notified of the closing of the matter and had stated (letter of the 14th of March, 1916) that they wished to be present. Mr. Barnard tells us that on the date of closing (2nd. of June, 1916) Mr. Dupr\u00e9, who acted for the Government in investigating the title and in giving instructions for the preparation of the deeds and had arranged to notify Mr. Barnard so that he and Mr. Ogilvie might attend on the closing, telephoned him from Quebec that\nthe matter was all ready and that the Davies insisted on its being closed that afternoon.\nOf course Mr. Ogilvie and Mr. Barnard were unable to be present.\nMr. Banard says that there were three different surveyor's reports and that that meant quite a few interviews between himself and Mr. Dupr\u00e9. On the 2nd of February, 1916, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants:\u2014\nThe situation is simply this: The Government have several plans showing different areas of the property, and it is necessary that Mr. Addie prepare a plan of the property as per the expropriation notice\nIf the area as shown on this plan appears satisfactory to the Government the matter will be closed at once.\nThe Department of Railways and Canals informs us that their engineer at Moncton has instructions to go into the matter with Mr. Addie. And we are to-day again taking up the matter with the Department, inquiring as to the delay. To this the defendants replied on the following day:\u2014\nPlans have already been prepared by Mr. Addie of the property and are now in possession of the Government.\nWhat is required is that an engineer be appointed to go over the ground with Mr. Addie (as Mr. Brown, chief engineer at Moncton, wrote Mr. Addie he had no orders to that effect) and which Mr. Barnard promised he would attend to at Ottawa.\nIt is urgent that this be done and that a Government engineer go over the ground with Mr. Addie so that we can get the matter closed up and a settlement effected without further delay.\nOn the 13th of March the papers were sent by the Department of Justice to MM. Dupr\u00e9 & Gagnon with instructions to get the matter closed without delay. It must have been after this date that Mr. Barnard had the frequent interviews with Mr. Dupr\u00e9 of which he speaks. Some delay was occasioned by difficulties of title and in having the order in council for payment put through. There is no further reference in the record, however, to the question of area. Neither Mr. Dupr\u00e9 nor the notary Couillard, who prepared the deed, nor any of the surveyors or railway officials concerned, is called to explain how the area came to be fixed at the figure named in the deeds. Mr. Barnard in a letter of the 22nd of May, 1917, to the late Mr. Stuart K.C., who was then acting for the defendants, refers to the change of area as a \"manoeuvre * * with a view to covering up the $5,000.\" Thomas O'Neill, the defendants' accountant and confidential clerk and a witness on their behalf, also suggests that 38,723 square feet was inserted in the deed \"because there was something to cover\" in \"the making of the $5,000.\" But if that had been the purpose the area would almost certainly have been increased by 2,857.14 square feet (which at $1.75 per square foot would amount to $5,000) and made 39,757.14 square feet. While Allison C. Davie could not explain the statement in the deeds that the area was 38,723 square feet and refused to characterize it as \"false,\" he swore positively that he knew the area of the property to be 36,900 square feet.\nWhether there is anything due in respect to item (a) and what should have been the plaintiffs' claim on item (b) depend entirely upon the true area of the property conveyed. In my opinion that cannot be ascertained on the evidence now before us. This question should therefore form one of the issues for determination on the new trial, which must be had for other reasons presently to be stated. The plaintiff's rights in respect to items (a) and (b) should be determined as above indicated when such area is ascertained. To permit of complete justice being done if the true area proves to be less than 38,723 square feet leave should be reserved to the plaintiffs to present an incidental demand under Art. 215 (1) C.C.P. for the whole or any part of the balance of the sum of $5,000 (and interest thereon) not covered by the conclusions of their present declaration. Should such a demand be held not to lie the right to bring action for any such balance not recoverable in this action, should, if the defence of illegality is not successful, be reserved to them.\n(c) The claim for interest, $10,598.59, between the date of taking possession (12th of August, 1912) and the date of conveyance (2nd of June, 1916) is preferred on two grounds\u2014as profit secured from the Government over and above $1.75 per foot, and as covered by a contractual stipulation. The sum claimed includes $762.40, interest paid on the $5,000 and recoverable, if at all, under item (b). If the plaintiff's claim to the interest on the $64,575 rested solely on a stipulation that they should receive so much of the purchase price as exceeded $1.75 per square foot, the view suggested by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec that as an accessory of the principal it would belong to the defendants (res accessoria sequitur rem principalem) might occasion difficulty. The principle of the law of mandate adverted to by my brother Mignault might also prove an obstacle to recovery by the plaintiffs. But the special contract invoked by them, if established, overcomes these difficulties.\nWhile the matter was still in the stage of negotiation the plaintiffs informed the defendants by letter (15th of September, 1914), that\nof course when the settlement is effected it will bear interest from the date of the taking possession by the railway company of the Davie property.\nAllison Davie admits that from this letter the defendants learned that the Government would pay interest from the date of expropriation. When negotiations between Mr. Barnard and the Department had so far progressed that he was able to state the terms of settlement, we find this passage in a letter from the defendants to D. W. Ogilvie of the 17th of March, 1915:\nMr. Barnard states that the Government will be willing to settle for the property on terms that would give us one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per square foot for the property with interest at four per cent from the date of sale to be passed as soon as the deeds are got in shape. The purchase price to be payable as soon as the Government is in funds and not later than two years from date. This would be satisfactory to us and we hereby authorize you to close the matter on such terms. The important words in this letter are \"from the date of sale.\" Although the witness O'Neill says he understood them to mean \"from date of expropriation\" (testimony probably inadmissible), Allison C. Davie offers no such explanation and George D. Davie, with whom all the negotiations were carried on by Ogilvie, is not called as a witness. Mr. Barnard says that it was distinctly understood that the interest up to the date of actual conveyance was to be given the plaintiffs and himself as additional remuneration. He certainly made a claim on that basis at an interview with Allison C. Davie and O'Neill in January, 1916, when he met them in Quebec to make certain, he says, that they understood the terms of the settlement and precisely what disposition was to be made of the moneys to be paid by the Government. Davie and O'Neill both admit that interview. Barnard says he understood the claim he then made was assented to: Davie and O'Neill that it was to be referred to George D. Davie. The failure to call the latter as a witness is, therefore, most significant. Barnard himself was a witness for the defendants and their counsel had him verify and then put in evidence a letter of the 22nd of May, 1917, from himself to the late Mr. G. C. Stuart, who was then acting for the Davies. In that letter Mr. Barnard says:\nOgilvie's agreement provided that he would get anything over and above $1.75 a foot. We tried first to get $2.50 a foot and then $2.00, and finally got the Government to offer $1.75. The matter was at a deadlock for some time when, after numerous interviews with the Minister, I arranged that instead of getting $2.00 a foot we should get $1.75 plus $5,000.00 and interest on the whole amount at 4% from the date of taking of possession, the $5,000.00 and interest from taking of possession being a compromise between our demand at $2.00 and the Government's price of $1.75.\nI considered that Ogilvie, under his agreement, would be clearly entitled to the $5,000.00 and the interest from the date of taking of possession, but in order to avoid all possible misunderstanding, pre- pared a special letter which I sent to Ogilvie with instructions to have same signed by the Davies, in which I mentioned that I had arranged with the Government for the sale of the property on terms that would give them $1.75 per foot, \"with interest at 4% from date of the sale to be passed as soon as deeds are got in shape,\" and I thought by reciting \"from date of sale to be passed as soon as deeds are got in shape\" that I had made it quite clear that they would only get interest from the date of the deed of sale.\nI further explained the matter in a letter to Mr. George Davie and also verbally to Mr. O'Neill, and when I found that the cash payment would not be sufficient to pay off Ogilvie took the trouble to go to Quebec and meet Mr. Allison Davie and Mr. O'Neill at Chinic's Hardware Store where we went into the figures and worked out exactly how much the Davie Estate would have to add to the cash payment in order to settle with Ogilvie, and how Mr. Allison Davie and Mr. O'Neill can now pretend that the estate is entitled to the interest from date of taking possession is frankly beyond me.\nP.S. In figuring the amount of interest that Ogilvie is entitled to I have in the above letter calculated interest up to the 2nd of June, the date of the passing of the deed of sale. To give you the whole story I should mention that when I met Mr. Allison Davie and Mr. O'Neill in Quebec at Chinic's and we figured the amount of interest coming to Ogilvie they raised the point that if interest until the execution of the deed of sale was to be paid to Ogilvie the settlement might drag on for a long time to the prejudice of the Davie estate. I agreed that this would not be fair as the expectation was, when the Davies agreed to take $1.75 a foot, that they would get payment within a reasonable time, and after some discussion it was agreed that Ogilvie's right to the interest would stop on the 1st of March.\nMr. Barnard's statement as to the objection raised by Messrs. Davie and O'Neill is corroborated by their testimony. The defendants also called Mr. D. W. Ogilvie as a witness on their behalf and had him pledge his oath to the truth of all the facts within his knowledge stated in Mr. Barnard's letter to Mr. Stuart.\nFinally, the defendants paid Mr. Barnard $10,763 on the 5th of June, 1916. Allison C. Davie says on examination for discovery by counsel for the plaintiffs that this payment was made in fulfilment of a legal obligation\u2014he is quite sure of it. On examination by counsel for the defendants he at first repeats this statement, but under adroit questioning he eventually says that, while the first $5,000 was so paid, the second $5,000 was paid \"out of goodwill,\" after a conference of the family. Once again George D. Davie is not called to verify this statement. The witness O'Neill was not asked as to it. To me it is simply incredible. Five, thousand dollars (with $763 interest on it) was admittedly paid to Barnard as principal secured in excess of $1.75 a foot. Barnard had in January also demanded the interest from August, 1912, to the date of closing on the $64,575 to be received by the Davies for themselves. The Davies held Barnard's note for $10,000 principal and $1,500 interest in connection with another transaction. They seem to have assumed that because of the relations between Barnard and Ogilvie's company any payment which they might make to the former would operate pro tanto as a discharge of their obligations to the latter. They probably conceived that it would be a good stroke of business to obtain payment of Barnard's note by setting it off against what they apparently believed might safely be credited to him in discharge of their obligation to the plaintiffs. Perhaps to avoid any admission that might prove embarrassing in the event of Ogilvie insisting on his claim for the interest, while they described the first $5,000 of the $10,000 of principal paid to Barnard as \"difference on sale of Davie property to I.C.R.,\" they designated the second $5,000 as \"allowance for services rendered\" in the statement sent to Barnard and as \"bonus for trouble\" in a statement certified by O'Neill and filed at the trial. Comment on all this seems unnecessary. I would merely add that the testimony of Allison C. Davie is most unsatisfactory, It gives an impression of shiftiness and unreliability. Taking into account all the evidence before us bearing upon it, if obliged now to determine the question, I should incline to the view that the Davies did agree with Ogilvie that his firm should have as part of their remuneration the interest on the $64,575 between the date of taking possession and the date of sale, by which I am disposed to think was meant the date of execution of the deeds. But as a new trial must be had on other grounds, it will probably be more satisfactory that this item should be dealt with by a judge who will have the advantage of seeing the witnesses and possibly also of evidence not now before us, such as the testimony of George Davie and the explanatory letter to him mentioned in Barnard's letter to Stuart. We have not the benefit of the views either of the trial judge or of a majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench on the merits of the plaintiffs' claim apart from the defence of illegality. The learned Chief Justice would treat the interest as an accessory and holds the claim for $159.51 unfounded. Mr. Justice Martin would disallow the plea of compensation based on the payments to Barnard and the defence that the action was premature. He finds the claim for interest unfounded and also that for a balance of commission. Mr. Justice Pelletier proceeds solely on the ground of illegality. Mr. Justice Greenshields dissents and there is no opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Carroll. The formal judgment merely dismisses the appeal \"considering that there is no error in the judgment appealed from.\"\nThe general defences still remain to be considered.\nI know of no legal ground on which the defendants can set up payment to Barnard as an answer to the plaintiffs' claim. Neither as a partner nor otherwise was he entitled to receive moneys payable to them. He was merely their employee or sub-agent and had apprised the defendants of that fact by sending them a copy of his letter of the 24th of March, 1916, written to D. W. Ogilvie. Nevertheless they chose to pay Barnard instead of the plaintiffs, moneys due, if at all, to the latter.\nThe defence that the action is premature has occasioned me some difficulty. The answer to it suggested by Mr. Justice Martin, the only judge below who alludes to it, seems open to the objection that the delay in payment was negotiated by Barnard himself and assented to by Ogilvie. The defendants, however, would seem to have recognized by their payments to Ogilvie of commission on $64,575 and to Barnard of $10,763 in June, 1916, that they were then under obligation to pay whatever remuneration had been earned in respect of the entire sale, notwithstanding that they had not yet received $60,000 of the purchase money and the interest thereon. With some doubt I accept the view of my brother Mignault that this defence should not prevail.\nI do so the more readily because it does not afford an answer to a part of the claim proportionate to the part of the purchase money paid before action and does not preclude a declaratory judgment as to the balance. Moreover by an incidental demand under Art. 215 (2) C.C.P., all the purchase money having since been paid, the plaintiffs could have put themselves in a position to recover such balance, if not otherwise disentitled to it. The fact that the defence was not given effect to in the courts below affords a strong indication that in their opinion it should not be maintained. The illegality charged by the defendants at the close of the trial was a violation of Article 158 (f) of the Criminal Code. They in effect then alleged that what they agreed to pay the plaintiffs for was an exercise of improper influence with the Government or some Minister or official thereof. They refer to the following features of the evidence as warranting an inference that that was, in part at least, the nature of the consideration which they were to receive for the remuneration to be paid.\nOgilvie says that the Davies \"appreciated\" that he was \"in a better position to negotiate than they were;\" that was also his own impression:\nthe Davies felt that (he) could get a better price * * * from the Government than they could,\nand that\nMr. Barnard was probably in a more favourable position than (himself) to negotiate with the Government and its officials.\nAny price in excess of $1.75 per square foot which they could obtain from the Government was to be divided between the plaintiffs and Barnard.\nAlthough the Davies were always willing to accept $1.75 per square foot for their property and on the 22nd of April, 1914, Ogilvie had written them\nI can get you one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per square foot for this piece of land from the railway, but I am of the opinion that if we hold out this sum can be increased,\nthe completion of the transaction was delayed until June, 1916, so far as appears solely to enable Ogilvie and Barnard to secure additional moneys for themselves from the Government. The Government actually paid $5,000 more than the Davies had asked and were willing to take. In addition they paid $10,598.59 of interest which the plaintiffs assert the Davies had agreed to hand over to them. For two years the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to induce Mr. Gutelius, the general manager of the I.C.R., to agree to pay the defendants' price of $1.75 per foot. Then Mr. Barnard was brought in to break the impasse by negotiating with the Minister over Mr. Gutelius' head. The price demanded for the land was immediately raised. Mr. Gutelius was over-ruled and $5,000 additional in principal and $10,598.59 interest\u2014the latter apparently not expected by the Davies for themselves\u2014was eventually paid by the Government.\nMr. Barnard says he was brought into the transaction when it was found that nothing could be done with Mr. Gutelius\u2014and that after he was brought in the negotiations were left entirely in his hands, adding, however,\nI had Mr. Ogilvie to help me. I had Mr. Ogilvie use his influence up at Ottawa and with the railway people\nand that he (Barnard)\nwas to use his influence * * * to try and persuade Ottawa that the price was reasonable.\nIn a letter of the 11th of June, 1915, written to George D. Davie, when matters were dragging, Barnard says\nI expect to go to Ottawa this week and take the matter up with my friends.\nThomas O'Neill, the defendants' accountant, says Ogilvie told him\nI have handed the whole thing over to Barnard. I do not want to mix with the politicians in Ottawa and he has friends up there.\nThen there is the suggestion thrown out in the examination for discovery of D. W. Ogilvie that Mr. Barnard was closely connected by marriage with a member of the Government, and finally the increase of the area from the 36,900 square feet, claimed by the Davies to be the true area, to the 38,723 square feet mentioned in the deeds, coupled with Barnard's and O'Neill's surmise that it was made to cover up the additional $5,000.\nIn addition to all this, apparently before Mr. Barnard's services were enlisted, there was a reference to Government valuators, with whom the plaintiffs advised the defendants to \"keep in touch\"\u2014a mysterious intervention of a Mr. Lockwell, whose status and connection with the matter are not explained\u2014an interview between Lockwell and Ogilvie at the latter's residence in Montreal and eventually a valuation by these valuators at the absurdly high figure of $3.00 a square foot, on which the Department refused to act.\nThe cumulative effect of all these things is relied upon to warrant the inference that the plaintiffs demanded compensation or reward, by reason of, or under the pretence of, possessing influence with the Government, or with some minister or official thereof (directly or through Barnard as their sub-agent), for procuring from the Government payment of the defendants' claim for compensation for their expropriated property. The learned trial judge considered this inference warranted and that the contract sued upon was therefore illegal as a barter of improper influence. His judgment was pronounced on appeal to be free from error. Two of the learned appellate judges (Lamothe C.J., and Martin J.), added, however, that in the case of a sale to the Government a contract by the vendor to pay an agent, engaged by him to procure the highest possible price, all that such agent could obtain over a figure fixed by the vendor as the minimum net price that he would accept, is in itself illegal as contrary to public policy and involving deception of the Department interested and a fraud upon the Government. Mr. Justice Martin speaking of the subject of the present action says\nit was a demand for compensation under a pretence of possessing influence with the Government: it was an agreement intended to mislead and had the effect of misleading the Government as to the price the respondents were willing to take for their property. The manner in which it was made afforded an opportunity for appellant to exploit the Government.\nThis aspect of the case has been dealt with by my brother Mignault. I agree with his views upon it and cannot usefully add to them. I am unable to appreciate the ground of the distinction drawn by the two learned appellate judges betweeen the Government and a corporation, firm or individual as a purchaser as affecting the legality of a contract for the remuneration of the vendor's agent based on the quantum of his interest in an increased price.\nBut the ground of the judgment of the Superior Court requires further consideration. The first observation I would make upon it is that if the four principal facts relied upon\u2014the over-ruling of Mr. Gutelius, the long delay after the letter of the 22nd of April, 1914, the payment of a large sum over and above the price the vendors were prepared to accept and the increase in the area from 36,900 square feet to 38,723 square feet\u2014have any probative force in support of the defendants' case they tend to establish rather an actual and successful use of improper influence with the Government, or some minister or official thereof, than a mere demand for compensation based on the existence of such influence real or pretended. Yet Mr. Justice Martin says\nthere is no evidence or suggestion that any official of the Government was corrupted in any manner, and the learned Chief Justice of Quebec makes the same statement and adds\nIl n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'on ait exerc\u00e9 aucune influence indue sur la d\u00e9cision des autorit\u00e9s. Il n'est pas non plus all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que le terrain expropri\u00e9 avait une valeur inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle pay\u00e9e par l'Intercolonial. Entre le gouvernement d'une part et Davie & Co. d'autre part, le contrat n'est pas attaqu\u00e9 et ne para\u00eet pas attaquable.\nBut for the four facts which I have specified, the other matters relied upon in support of this branch of this case\u2014equivocal expressions in evidence and correspondence and sinister suggestions of advantages taken of friendships and family connection carried no further\u2014would not be deserving of notice. Their significance depends wholly upon their connection with the salient facts above stated. Taken with those facts they no doubt give rise to a situation \"fraught with suspicion.\" But, with respect, if the matter were to rest where it now is the inevitable result in my opinion would be a verdict of \"not proven\"\nThe appellants quite reasonably do not desire such a Pyrrhic victory. They wish to remove the stigma necessarily left by an accusation such as that under consideration if it be not completely refuted. Unfortunately they did not ask for a postponement of the trial to afford them an opportunity to meet that charge when it was preferred in argument before the trial judge. Had they done so and been refused, even if the evidence were vastly stronger than it is\u2014if it clearly established a prima facie case against them\u2014having regard to the manner in which the charge was sprung, they would, in my opinion, have been entitled to a new trial to afford them the opportunity denied\u2014not as a matter of grace, but as of right. Not having taken that course, however, they are now obliged to ask indulgence. Yet, as the Lord Chancellor (Halsbury), delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said, in Connolly et al. v. Consumers Cordage Co.[1], where similar illegality, not suggested in the Courts below, had been found by this Court\nit is impossible to resist the cogency of the argument of counsel that he has not had an opportunity of meeting the allegations that are suggested against his client. As already stated, the circumstances are fraught with suspicion but suspicious as they are, they may, nevertheless, be susceptible of explanation, and, if so, the opportunity for explanation and defence ought to have been given. That has not been done; and whatever may be the suspicions that their Lordships, in common with the learned Judges below, may entertain upon the subject, mere suspicion without judicial proof is not sufficient for a court of justice to act upon.\nMy only doubt has been whether the proper course in the present case would not be entirely to reject the defence of illegality as unsupported by proof. I defer, however, to what is probably the better judgment of my learned colleagues that there is sufficient of suspicion in the circumstances already before us to warrant sending the case back for a new trial in order that this defence may be fairly and fully investigated and the appellants' guilt established, if they be guilty, or if not their character cleared of what any right-thinking man must regard as an imputation under which they should not remain if it can be removed.\nOn the new trial the issues to be contested should be restricted to the question of the area of the property conveyed by the defendants to the Crown, the existence of a contract with regard to the payment of the interest to the plaintiffs and the defence of illegality. The question on this defence should be whether the plaintiffs by reason of or under the pretence that they or their agent Barnard possessed influence with the Government or with any Minister or official thereof demanded or exacted from the defendants or induced the latter to pay, offer or promise any compensation fee or reward for procuring from the Government the payment of the defendants' claim or any portion thereof for the taking by the Government of the defendants' property at Levis.\nUnder all the circumstances there should be no costs of this appeal to either party.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La demanderesse-appelante r\u00e9clame le paiement d'une commission au sujet d'un terrain qui appartenait aux d\u00e9fendeurs et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9 par la Couronne.\nSur la contestation telle que li\u00e9e, la demanderesse aurait probablement r\u00e9ussi pour une partie importante de sa r\u00e9clamation, mais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, confirm\u00e9e en cela par la Cour d'Appel, a trouv\u00e9 que l'option et les conventions invoqu\u00e9es par la demanderesse n'avaient pour but que de couvrir son intervention aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales pour obtenir par son influence des conditions plus avantageuses et un prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le terrain expropri\u00e9, et que ces conventions, \u00e9tant contraires \u00e0 l'ordre public, \u00e9taient ill\u00e9gales.\nCette question d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense; et la demanderesse dit qu'elle en souffre pr\u00e9judice parce que certaines circonstances louches qui sont au dossier d\u00e9montreraient, si elles \u00e9taient expliqu\u00e9es par une preuve additionnelle qu'elle se d\u00e9clare en position de faire, qu'elle a agi d'une mani\u00e8re absolument l\u00e9gale et honn\u00eate.\nEn effet, il serait important d'expliquer cette nomination d'\u00e9valuateurs, la pr\u00e9sence autour d'eux ou au milieu d'eux de personnages \u00e0 r\u00e9putation douteuse, cette lettre des d\u00e9fendeurs o\u00f9 ils disent qu'ils connaissent bien ces \u00e9valuateurs, we think our Mr. George can keep in touch with them (Letter, 19th Dec, 1913),\net le rapport de ces \u00e9valuateurs donnant pour le terrain expropri\u00e9 une valeur plus consid\u00e9rable que celle que les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter.\nIl serait bon de conna\u00eetre les raisons pour lesquelles les d\u00e9fendeurs ont choisi comme mandataires des personnes d'une ville \u00e9loign\u00e9e qui ne connaissaient rien ou presque rien des terrains expropri\u00e9s. Cette circonstance devient d'autant plus myst\u00e9rieuse que Ogilvie dit, dans sa lettre du 26 mars 1914, qu'il esp\u00e9rait pouvoir compl\u00e9ter la transaction par vente priv\u00e9e\nwithout any of our Quebec friends interfering in same,\net que Barnard, dans une lettre du 15 janvier 1915, dit qu'il irait \u00e0 Ottawa dans quelques jours\ntake the matter up with my friends when I am there.\nIl est \u00e9vident que Gutelius, le g\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Intercolonial, pour l'usage duquel ce terrain \u00e9tait expropri\u00e9, ne voulait pas payer le prix demand\u00e9 par Davie et Ogilvie, et alors on a utilis\u00e9 les services de Barnard pour n\u00e9gocier avec le ministre et passer pardessus la t\u00eate de Gutelius. Ogilvie aurait dit \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 une personne entendue comme t\u00e9moin dans la cause:\nI have handed the whole thing over to Barnard. I do not want to mix with the politicians in Ottawa, and he has friends up there.\nIl serait \u00e9galement important de savoir pourquoi on a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans l'acte de vente une quantit\u00e9 plus consid\u00e9rable de terrain que celle que les d\u00e9fendeurs disent avoir c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Barnard ne peut pas s'expliquer ce changement et il sugg\u00e8re\nthe area was changed with a view to covering up the $5,000,00, for which manoeuvre there was no reason whatever. Il y a encore d'autres circonstances dans la cause qui rendent probable l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette transaction: mais comme la demanderesse se croit en position d'expliquer toutes ces circonstances et qu'elle n'en a pas eu l'occasion, je crois que nous devrions, dans ces circonstances, non pas confirmer le jugement des cours inf\u00e9rieures, mais appliquer la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Connolly v. Consumers Cordage Co.[2], et renvoyer la cause en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour faire une enqu\u00eate compl\u00e8te, et les tribunaux seront ensuite en meilleure position de se prononcer sur cette question de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du contrat intervenu entre les parties.\nL'un des items les plus importants de la r\u00e9clamation de la demanderesse porte sur le question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il s'agirait de savoir si l'int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis l'expropriation jusqu'\u00e0 la passation du contrat appartiendrait aux d\u00e9fendeurs ou \u00e0 la demanderesse.\nIl y a peut-\u00eatre un peu d'ambiguit\u00e9 dans la lettre que les d\u00e9fendeurs ont sign\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet, mais apr\u00e8s les explications de Barnard, qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 cette lettre, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 enclin \u00e0 accepter son t\u00e9moignage; mais comme il est formellement contredit sur un point par d'autres t\u00e9moins et comme nous n'avons pas l'avantage de l'opinion du juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s et qui a entendu ces t\u00e9moins sur leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, il vaut mieux ne pas pr\u00e9juger la question.\nLes defendeurs, dans leur d\u00e9fense, ont plaid\u00e9 que l'action \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et que Barnard avait autorit\u00e9 de recevoir de l'argent d'eux pour et au nom de la demanderesse.\nCes deux moyens de d\u00e9fense sont mal fond\u00e9s. Il n'y a rien dans les conventions entre la demanderesse et les d\u00e9fendeurs qui d\u00e9montre que le paiement de la commission ou de la partie du prix de vente qui exc\u00e8derait $1.75 du pied ne serait pay\u00e9 que lorsque les d\u00e9fendeurs recevraient eux-m\u00eames leur argent du gouvernement. Leur conduite prouve amplement qu'il n'y a pas eu de d\u00e9lai d'accord\u00e9. Ils n'avaient re\u00e7u, lors de la passation de l'acte fixant l'indemnit\u00e9, qu'une somme de $11,034.58: et cependant ils ont de suite pay\u00e9 une somme d'au del\u00e0 de $13,000.00 \u00e0 la demanderesse et \u00e0 Barnard.\nQuant au paiement fait \u00e0 Barnard, il ne peut pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9tendu qu'il doit \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 contre la demanderesse. Barnard avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par la demanderesse pour aider au r\u00e8glement par le gouvernement de la r\u00e9clamation des d\u00e9fendeurs, mais il n'avait pas l'autorisation et le pouvoir de la de manderesse de percevoir des deniers pour elle.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu, mais sans frais, vu que l'appelante est en faute de ne pas avoir demand\u00e9 en cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 faire l'enqu\u00eate qu'elle d\u00e9sire maintenant mettre au dossier.\nLe contre-appel, vu la disposition du pr\u00e9sent appel, devient inutile et devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 sans frais.\nLe dossier devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 en cour sup\u00e9rieure pour s'enqu\u00e9rir de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du contrat.\nA cette fin les parties devront avoir le droit d'amender leurs plaidoiries. La demanderesse pourra pr\u00e9senter, dans le cas o\u00f9 le contrat ne serait pas ill\u00e9gal, une demande incidente, si la cour sup\u00e9rieure le permet, ou bien le droit lui sera r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de r\u00e9clamer par une nouvelle action une somme additionnelle si la quantit\u00e9 de terrain vendu n'est pas de 38,723 pieds mais est d'une quantit\u00e9 moindre. Mignault J.\u2014The appellant, a body corporate, which is owned and controlled by Mr. Douglas W. Ogilvie of Montreal, claims from the respondents $12,567.85 made up, as stated in its factum, of the following items:\n1. For balance of commission on the sale by the respondents to the Canadian Government for the Intercolonial Railway of a parcel of land at Levis, Que\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.$\n159.51\n2. For difference between purchase price of 38,723 square feet at $1.75 per foot, being\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...$67,765.25\nand the price actually obtained for the property.\u2026\u2026..69,575.00\n1,809.75\nInterest on $9,575.00 for three years and 295 days at 4%\n1,459.59\nInterest on $60,000.00 for three years and 295 days\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n9,139.00\n$12,567.85\nTo explain this claim, I must say that on the 2nd of June, 1916, the respondents sold the property in question to the Government for a block price of $69,575.00, with interest from \"the date of taking\" (which the parties admit was the 12th of August, 1912, date of the registration by the Government of the expropriation notice). The deed described the property as containing 38,723 square feet, and the appellant alleges that this was its area, and the Government, on the date of sale, paid to the respondent on account of the price, $9,575.00, with interest at 4% from the date of taking, said interest amounting to $1,459.59, so that the total cash payment was $11,034.59, The balance of the purchase price, $60,000.00, the Government was to pay in two years from the date of sale, June 2nd, 1916, with interest at 4% from the date of taking The final payment, amounting with interest to $69,575.00, was made to the respondent on or about October 20th, 1918, a year and a half after the bringing of the appellant's action. As briefly as can be stated, the appellant's claim is that it is entitled to a commission of 5% on a price giving to the respondent $1.75 per square foot, and it calculates this commission on a price of $67,765.25, representing $1.75 per square foot on a total area of 38,723 feet. The appellant was paid $3,228.75 as 5% commission on $64,575.00, which, at the price of $1.75 per foot, represents an area of 36,900 feet, and it demands an additional amount of $159.51 being 5% on $3,190.25, the difference between $64,575.00 and $67,765.25.\nThen the appellant claims that it is entitled, over and above this commission, to anything received by the respondents in excess of $1.75 per foot, and the sale price being $69,575.00, this excess amounts to $1,809.75.\nFinally, treating the interest payable to the respondents as being something to which it, the appellant, is entitled as being over and above the price of $1.75 per foot, it demands, as representing this interest, the sum of $10,598.59, the greater part of which was paid to the respondents long after the action was brought.\nAmong other matters, the respondents plead that the action, in so far as it is based on any amount paid to them after June 2nd, 1916, is premature. They also object that the real area of the property was 36,900 feet and not 38,723 feet as alleged by the appellant and stated in the deed of sale to the Government. They also claim the benefit of payments exceeding $10,000.00 made by them to Mr. Charles A. Barnard K.C., who was associated with the appellant in the negotiations concerning the sale of the property. I will dispose at once of this last defence by saying that, in my opinion, the respondents cannot, as against the appellant, offset any payments made by them to Mr. Barnard. Before taking up the different items of the appellant's claim, I must refer to the question of the area of the property which was discussed at considerable length at the hearing. No evidence of this area was given at the trial. The appellant alleges that it was 38,723 feet, and the deed of sale, and a subsequent deed between the Government and the respondents correcting it, expressly give this figure as the area sold. On the other hand, both Mr. Ogilvie, who owns the appellant company, and the respondents acted throughout on the assumption that the expropriated property contained 36,900 square feet, which was stated to be shewn by a plan prepared by Mr. Bourget, land surveyor, which plan however is not in the record. The respondents had measurements made by Mr. Addie, land surveyor, and it is mentioned in a letter written to Mr. Barnard by the Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals that Addie reported an area of 38,671.3 feet. The expropriation notice gives the area as being 79\/100 of an acre, or 34,412 feet. Mr. Barnard, in one of his letters, qualifies as a \"manoeuvre\" the statement in the deeds of an area of 38,723 feet, and some of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench looked on it as being a very suspicious circumstance. The position, however, is this: The appellant founds its action on a sale of 38,723 feet, and no evidence, outside of the deeds, was made of the real area. This seems clearly to be the basis of the appellant's action as it was conceived by the appellant itself.\nFirst item. Claim of $159.51, additional commission. This claim is based on the agreement, which is not disputed by the respondents, to pay 5% on the sale of the property at $1.75 per square foot, and the question whether the respondents have paid all the commission owed by them or not depends on the area of the land sold. This, I have said, the appellant alleges was 38,723 feet. The respondents deny this allegation, and aver that the total area was 36,900 feet. The appellant had therefore the onus of establishing its averment, but, as regards the respondents, the statement in the deed of sale from the respondents to the Government as well as in the subsequent deed of correction, in both of which the area is declared to be 38,723 feet, might probably be considered conclusive evidence, as being at least an extra-judicial admission by the respondents of this area; and moreover while Mr. Allison Davie swore, when examined on discovery, that the area was 36,900 feet, he added however the qualification\nthat is the plan we followed then\nand he did not undertake to say that the statement in the deeds was false. The matter could have been cleared up by producing a copy of the plan annexed to the deed of sale, and possibly by a survey on the ground of the area shown on this plan, but as that was not done, I would have been disposed to hold the respondents bound by their admission in the deeds, However, out of deference to the desire expressed by my brothers Anglin and Brodeur, I am willing, inasmuch as the case must be sent back for retrial on the question of the legality of the contract, that new evidence be taken to establish the real area of the property taken by the Crown. When this evidence is made, it will be possible to determine whether the appellant's claim for $159.51 is justified, assuming that its action remains in the form in which it was brought. Third item. Claim of the appellant for $10,598.59, interest on the purchase price of $69,575.00. In my study of this case I dealt with this item before considering the second item of $1,809.75, which is the one in connection with which the greatest difficulty arises in view of the judgments of the courts below. I had formed an opinion on the merits of this claim for interest, but inasmuch as I now defer to the desire of my brothers Anglin and Brodeur that this question be among those directed to be retried, with the view that some evidence which was not given be made, I deem it my duty, so as not to embarass the new trial, to express no opinion as to this item of the appellant's claim.\nSecond item. Claim of the appellant for $1,809.75, being the difference in price between $67,765.25. representing 38,723 feet at $1.75 per foot, and $69,-575.00, the total purchase price paid by the Government.\nThis sum of $1,809.75 is clearly something paid by the Government over and above the purchase price of $1.75 per foot, and the appellant is entitled thereto if the ground on which its action was dismissed in the courts below cannot be sustained.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action of the appellant without costs for the following reason:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la dite option et les conventions subs\u00e9quentes, prouv\u00e9es et all\u00e9gu\u00e9es comme s'y rattachant, n'avaient pour but que de couvrir l'intervention des demandeurs comme interm\u00e9diaires entre le Gouvernement du Canada et les autorit\u00e9s du chemin de fer Intercolonial, d'une part, et les d\u00e9fendeurs, d'autre part, pour procurer, par leur position et leur influence, aux dits d\u00e9fendeurs, des conditions plus avantageuses et un prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le terrain alors ainsi expropri\u00e9, et que la consid\u00e9ration stipul\u00e9e \u00e9tait le prix de telle intervention; Consid\u00e9rant que toute convention de cette nature est contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public, et que toute consid\u00e9ration stipul\u00e9e pour y donner effet est ill\u00e9gale et nulle et ne peut faire l'objet d'une r\u00e9clamation en justice.\nThe Court of King's Bench affirmed this judgment, Greenshields J. dissenting, but in their reasons for judgment some of the learned judges considered that an agreement the object of which was to obtain from the Government for this land something in excess of the price for which the respondents were willing to sell it, was an illegal contract, contrary to public order, and that the appellant could not recover any compensation for its services under this agreement. In the words of Chief Justice Lamothe,\nDavie & Co. et la compagnie appelante se sont entendus ensemble pour t\u00e2cher d'obtenir de l'Intercolonial une somme additionnelle d'environ $5,000, somme que Davie ne r\u00e9clamait pas. En d'autres mots, ils se sont entendus pour soutirer du tr\u00e9sor public, une somme additionnelle non r\u00e9clam\u00e9e et non due. Le motif des contractants et leur but avou\u00e9 sont clairement illicites. Il s'agissait de tromper le d\u00e9partement des chemins de fer sur les intentions de Davie & Co.; il s'agissait de cacher ou de mettre en oubli le prix r\u00e9el demand\u00e9; le d\u00e9partement a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit \u00e0 croire que Davie & Co. r\u00e9clamaient r\u00e9ellement $5,000 de plus, et tout cela pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la compagnie appelante. Il s'agissait de fonds publics. Le gouvernement n'est pas dans la position d'un particulier; il ne peut faire aucune lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 sans le consentement du parlement.\nJe partage les vues du juge de premi\u00e8re instance; le contrat entre Ogilvie &. Co. et Davie & Co. avait pour base et motif une consid\u00e9ration ill\u00e9gale, illicite et contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public. Les tribunaux ne peuvent en forcer Fex\u00e9cution.\nIn consequence, the Court of King's Bench dismissed without costs the appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court.\nIt should be observed that the grounds on which both judgments below dismissed the appellant's action, were not taken in the respondent's plea, but the contention was raised at the hearing in the first court, and I would, with deference, think that the parties and particularly the appellant should have been afforded the opportunity of bringing fresh evidence on the issue thus raised. In saying that I do not for a moment dispute that the Court can proprio motu dismiss an action when it comes to the conclusion that it is founded on an unlawful and illicit contract; but even then I think it is better to reopen the case so that the parties may, if they can, clear themselves of the imputation of having made an unlawful or illicit agreement.\nThe words of the learned Chief Justice of the Province of Quebec which I have quoted, may I say so with respect, somewhat overstate the facts of this case as I conceive them. What happened was that the respondents were willing to accept $1.75 per foot for their property and to pay a commission of 5% on this price to the appellant who was their agent, and who was in no wise connected with the Government or under fiduciary relations with it. The respondents agreed also to abandon to the appellant anything in excess of the stated price which the appellant might obtain. There was no suggestion whatever of deceiving the Government, and there was surely no duty incumbent on the appellant to disclose to the Government the price which the respondents would accept. It was the case of an agent bargaining with a third party for the best obtainable price, even a price in excess of that which his principal would accept, and the fact that the agent had stipulated with his principal that the excess price would belong to him does not make the contract illegal. The learned judges of the Court of King's Bench recognize that such a contract can be made when the purchaser is a private individual (see also Guillouard, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, no. 16, who discusses the nature, thereby admitting the legality, of such a contract), but why can it not be made when the purchaser is the Government, provided no misrepresentation's, no corruption of public officials nor improper methods are resorted to, and provided that the vendor and his agent are under no fiduciary relations with the Government imposing on them the duty of disclosure? Here the learned Chief Justice says:\nIl n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'aucun officier public ait \u00e9t\u00e9 corrompu. Il n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'on ait exerc\u00e9 aucune influence indue sur la d\u00e9cision des autorit\u00e9s. Il n'est pas non plus all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que le terrain expropri\u00e9 avait une valeur inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle pay\u00e9e par 1'Intercolonial.\nEntre le gouvernement d'une part et Davie & Co. d'autre part, le contrat n'est pas attaqu\u00e9 et ne para\u00eet pas attaquable.\nThat being the case, even though this property was to be paid with public monies, how can it be said that the agreement between the parties was illegal and contrary to public order? The words \"public order\" may be words to conjure with, but their meaning is very vague, and although undoubtedly a contract contrary to public order is void (arts. 989 and 990 Civil Code), still where a contract is not prohibited by law it should be very obvious that it is contrary to good morals or public order before it be set aside. With respect, I cannot agree with the learned Chief Justice when he comes to the conclusion that this contract, which would not be contrary to public order if the purchaser were a private citizen, is against public order because the lands were bought by the Government, it being remembered that the agents who dealt with the Government were under no fiduciary relation towards it, and resorted to no corruption, misrepresentation or undue influence. The learned trial judge puts the case on somewhat different grounds when he finds that there was a contract whereby Ogilvie and Barnard undertook, through their position and influence with the Government, to obtain a higher price for the property than that which the respondents were willing to accept, the additional sum so obtained to be divided between them. This, in my opinion, is a very much stronger ground.\nIt is useless to deny that the facts in evidence lend some support to the theory on which the Superior Court's judgment is based. The respondents contracted with Ogilvie and I have said that, in my opinion, their contract was not per se an illegal one. But Ogilvie found Mr. Gutelius, the superintendent or general manager of the Intercolonial Railway, obdurate. He refused to pay even $1.75 per foot for the property, and then Ogilvie secured the co-operation of Mr. Barnard, presumably and even admittedly, because he possessed, or was supposed to possess, influence with the Government. Mr. Barnard asked $2.25 per foot from Mr. Gutelius who had declined to pay even $1.75, and this was naturally refused. (See Barnard's letter to Mr. Geo. D. Davie of April 1st, 1915). Mr. Barnard then negotiated with the Minister of Railways and Canals, the head of the Department, and finally Mr. Gutelius was overruled and the sale was agreed to at a price of $64,575.00, representing $1.75 a foot for an area of 36,900 feet, which the parties then understood was the area of the land, plus $5,000 which the Government agreed to pay over and above this price. Mr. Barnard says, in his letter of May 22nd, 1917, to Mr. Stuart K.C., that this was a compromise between his demand first of $2.50, then $2.00, and the Government's price of $1.75. There is no doubt that in all he did, Mr. Barnard acted with the approval of Mr. Ogilvie and also, I think, of the respondents, and but for his intervention and influence it is possible the opposition of Mr. Gutelius would not have been overcome. It is needless to add that the $5,000.00 so obtained was to be divided between Ogilvie and Barnard.\nUnder these circumstances the two courts have found that the contract giving to Mr. Ogilvie and \"those interested\" the surplus or profit which he might obtain over and above the selling price of $1.75 per foot, was a contract made with them by reason of their real or supposed influence with the Government, in other words was a purchase of their influence with the Government, and consequently null and void.\nThe appellant complained before us that it had not been afforded an opportunity to meet, and disprove if it could, the contention that it had bartered its influence with the Government, which contention was raised only at the argument in the first Court. I have already said that I think that it should have been afforded that opportunity and as a matter of justice, and because were I to dispose of the contention on the evidence in the record, I would have great difficulty in determining whether there has been really here a barter of influence with the Government, or an ordinary contract with an experienced broker looking towards the securing from the Government of the best obtainable terms, I have come to the conclusion that the record should be sent back to the Superior Court with directions to reopen the case on this question whether there was, as found by the Superior Court, an agreement by Ogilvie or Barnard, through the influence which they possessed or pre- tended to possess with the Government or with any Minister or Official thereof, to obtain for the respondents the price of $1.75 per foot for the expropriated property, any sum obtained in addition to the said price to be divided between Ogilvie and Barnard.\nI have not referred to the defence that this action is premature. The reason for which this defence was disregarded, to wit that Ogilvie's right to claim commission could not be affected by a delay granted by the respondents for the payment of the purchase price, is in my opinion unsound inasmuch as the respondents sold on terms made for them by Ogilvie or by his agent, Barnard. But, in view of the conduct of the respondents themselves, I do not think that this defence should be maintained. They paid to the appellant, immediately after the signing of the deeds, and although they had received only $9,575.00 on account of capital, the full commission on the purchase price of $64,575.00, the $5,000.00 added thereto being treated by them as something due to Barnard, thereby recognizing that the appellant did not have to wait until the payment of the balance of the purchase price to claim its commission on the balance. They thus put their own construction on their contract with the appellant, and I do not think they should now be allowed to contend that the right of the appellant, whatever it was, was postponed until the monies were actually paid over to the respondents.\nI therefore agree that there should be a retrial as stated in the memorandum which will be included in the formal judgment of the Court.\nIt may well be, if the area of the expropriated property be shewn to be 36,900 square feet, that the appellant has misconceived what are its rights against the respondents, assuming that the contract sued on is a lawful one. For the surplus price paid to the respondents over and above the price of $1.75 per foot would then be $5,000.00, and not $1,809.75 as alleged in the declaration. Whether the appellant, in view of the retrial, would be entitled to amend its declaration, or to take an incidental demand, is a question on which I do not deem expedient to express in advance any opinion, but I am willing that any opportunity to amend or to take an incidental demand be afforded the appellant on the new trial ordered. It seems to me that if the appellant is entitled to any portion of the price paid the respondents as being over and above the sum of $1.75 per foot, it should get a proportionate part of the interest paid to the respondents on the purchase price of the property.\nI would grant no costs to either party of this appeal nor of the cross-appeal which, in my opinion, should be dismissed.\nJUDGMENT.\nThe appeal is allowed without costs and a new trial on certain points is directed as indicated in memorandum. Idington J. dissenting.\nMemorandum for Formal Judgment.\n1\u00b0 The appeal is allowed without costs.\n2\u00b0 The Court declares that the defendants' contentions that the action was prematurely instituted and that Barnard was the plaintiff's partner and that Barnard had authority and power to receive money for the plaintiff company are unfounded.\n3\u00b0 The record will be sent back to the Superior Court to further inquire into and determine (a) whether the plaintiffs by reason of or under the pretence that they or their agent Barnard possessed influence with the Government or with any Minister or official thereof demanded or exacted from the defendants or induced the latter to pay, offer or promise any compensation, fee or reward for procuring from the Government the payment of the defendants' claim or any portion thereof for the taking by the Government of the defendants' property at Levis;\n(b) the area of the property conveyed by the defendants to the Crown; and\n(c) whether the defendants contracted to pay the plaintiffs as part of their remuneration the interest paid by the Crown on the purchase money between the date of its taking possession of the property and the date of the execution of the deeds conveying it.\n4\u00b0 The Court orders that both parties shall have liberty to amend relevantly to the new enqu\u00eate above directed so far as Quebec procedure permits and that, without in any way determining that it would be maintainable, leave shall be reserved to the plaintiffs, should the area of the property be found to be less than the 38,723 square feet mentioned in the deeds, to prefer, if so advised, an incidental demand for an increased allowance in respect of excess price over $1.75 a square foot for the number of square feet by which the property shall be found to fall short of 38,723.\nThe Court declares that if the illegality of the contract is not established the plaintiff company is entitled to a commission at the rate of 5% on so much of the purchase money paid as represents the price of the land actually conveyed at $1.75 a square foot less the sum of $3,228.75 already paid to it and also the sum of $1,809.75 claimed in the declaration in respect of excess price with interest thereon and in addition thereto to any sum for which they may successfully maintain the incidental demand above mentioned.\nShould such incidental demand not be preferred or be held not to lie and the defence of illegality fail leave will be reserved to the plaintiffs to bring such action as they may be advised for any balance (over $1,809:75) of the sum of $5,000 paid as excess price which they may see fit to claim.\nIf it is not established that the contract alleged by the plaintiffs is illegal, adjudication on the defendants' liability in respect of the sum of $10,598.59 claimed for interest is reserved to be disposed of by the Superior Court.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cook & Magee.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pentland, Gravel & Thomson.\n[1] [1903] 89 L.

Garneau, (1921) 61 S.C.R. 450\nDate: 1921-02-01\nL. L. Fuller (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nL. Garneau (Defendant) Respondent.\n1920: November 5, 8; 1921: February 1.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nSale\u2014Sale of land\u2014Agreement\u2014Reservation of mines and minerals to Crown\u2014Implied powers\u2014Whether greater than those expressly reserved in Crown grant. The reservation, in a Crown grant, of the mines and minerals \"with full power to work the same and for this purpose to enter upon and use or occupy the * * * lands or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals * * * \"confers greater powers than those implied in a bare reservation in an agreement for the sale of the land so granted of \"all mines and minerals.\" Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The terms of both reservations imply the right to win, get at and take away the minerals; but the terms of the reservation in the Crown grant may imply furthermore the right to cause subsidence or destruction of the surface.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 194) reversed, Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Scott J.[2] and dismissing the appellant's action. The appellant is the purchaser from the respondent of certain lands under an agreement of sale \"reserving unto His Majesty, His successors and assigns, all mines and minerals.\" Later on, the appellant discovered by a search made in the Land Titles Office that the reservation of mines and minerals in favour of the Crown was not in the terms as represented by the respondent; and alleging that it was a much more complete reservation, he claimed rescission of the agreement of sale.\nJ. R. Lavell for the appellant.\nC. H. Grant for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The single and only question which arises on this appeal for us to determine is whether the words of the reservation in the Crown grant are greater than, or different from, the words in the agreement of sale from the defendant respondent to the plaintiff appellant.\nThe words in the latter agreement are\nreserving unto His Majesty, his successors and assigns, all mines and minerals.\nThe reservation in the Crown grant is as follows:\u2014\nReserving thereout and therefrom all mines and minerals which may be found to exist within, upon or under such lands together with full power to work the same and for this purpose to enter upon and use or occupy the said lands or so much thereof or to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals, pits, seams and veins containing the same.\nAfter reading the authorities cited by the counsel at bar to sustain their respective contentions, I am of the opinion that the appeal fails. I think that Mr. Justice Ives, who delivered the judgment of the Appellate Division, correctly stated the question at issue, in his reasons for judgment, as follows:\u2014\nDo the words in the Crown grant enable more extensive colliery operations to be carried on to get (or win) the minerals than do the words used by the defendant vendor in the agreement, extended by legal implication?\nAnd he answered that question, I think, correctly when he said he thought they did not.\nThe full reservation merely adds to the reservation of the mines and minerals\nthe full power to work the same and for this purpose to enter upon and use\nso much of the lands and to such an extent as may be necessary for the \"effective working of the minerals\" or the mines, etc.\nI cannot doubt under the authorities that these express powers are impliedly and necessarily contained in the simple reservation of the mines and minerals and that they do not extend or enlarge these implied powers which are essential to give efficacy to the reservation.\nSee per Bayley, in Cardigan vs. Armitage[3], and Lord Wensleydale in Rowbotham vs. Wilson[4]; Duke of Hamilton vs. Graham[5],\nWe are not called upon to decide upon the respective rights of the mine owners under these reservations as against the surface owner, and, of course, do not do so. Whether or not they carry the right as against the surface owner to cause subsidence of the soil it is not either necessary or desirable on the facts before us to determine. That question is certainly a difficult and a delicate one and should only be dealt with, where necessary to determine, on the facts as found in each case. I do not, in the present appeal and on the facts as they appear in the record, feel called upon or justified in expressing any opinion on that question.\nI simply determine that, in my opinion, the two reservations mean the same and that the implied powers arising in the one are equivalent to the express powers given in the other. But whether they give the right to cause subsidence as against the surface owner I leave for determination when a case actually involving that question arises and all the facts necessary to decide it are before the Court.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014If the language used upon which it is attempted herein to rest a charge of fraudulent misrepresentation, is only applied in a common sense way, having regard to what I suspect is common knowledge on the part of every one dealing in real estate in Alberta, it would mean, to him to whom it was addressed there, exactly what the language of the reservation in a Crown grant expresses, when the title rests upon that with the reservation therein of mines and minerals.\nI must be permitted to doubt if it took seven years on the appellant's part to discover this in face of such a falling market as ensued.\nThe ground of delay not having been expressly taken and argued out by reason of the narrow limitations of the direction of trial as presented to us, I need not pursue that phase of the question of delay. But the pleadings shew that the agreement of purchase which appellant accepted pursuant to such alleged misrepresentation, contained an express provision for the appellant purchaser getting a deed of conveyance pursuant thereto, subject to the conditions and reservations in the original grant from the Crown. That is all he is entitled to get and surely it embraces such a well-known common reservation of mines and minerals in the form now in question.\nThe cases relied upon by the appellant, in his factum, to overcome this express feature of the contract in question, do not seem to touch its force and efficacy as a complete answer to the pretension of misrepresentation and fraud as specified by appellant's pleadings set up as the fundamental part of his case.\nThe cases so cited and relied upon are the well-known cases of Venezuela Co. v. Kisch[6]; Redgrave v. Kurd[7], and Rawlins v. Wickham[8].\nAnd besides in their essential features of fraud or misrepresentation going far beyond anything pleaded herein, the first named shews how prompt action is required and delay may be inexcusable and destructive of such a claim.\nThere is in short no fraud or misrepresentation herein, if the pleadings are to be read as a whole, as the factums seem to indicate. We have in the case no copy of the order directing what is to be disposed of, but no doubt that in the record and the recognition by each factum of what is involved, may be taken as our guide to the limitations thereof. I may be permitted to say that it does not seem to me at all necessary to rely upon some of the decisions cited in support of the judgment appealed from, and thereby impliedly to assume that the reservation in the Crown grant means, in every case, exactly what many of the decisions cited seem to imply in regard to subsidence of the surface, for they were, in many instances, by the consideration of a course of legal and judicial history which ultimately may not be found exactly to fit all the conditions leading to what was intended to be expressed in the reservations in the Crown grants for land in our North West provinces; especially when coal, for example, forms part of that very surface in question which inevitably must subside when such coal is taken.\nIt seems better to avoid putting, impliedly, an interpretation, or construction of the Crown reservation which I hold must have been, or should have been, from the foregoing considerations, presented to the mind of appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The point of law to which the Appellate Division directed its attention is stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ives:\u2014\nThe plaintiff is the purchaser from defendant of certain lands, under an agreement of sale \"reserving unto His Majesty, his successors and assigns, all mines and minerals.\"\nThe full reservation of the Crown grant is in the following words:\u2014\nReserving thereout and therefrom all mines and minerals which may be found to exist within, upon or under such lands together with full power to work same and for this purpose to enter upon and use or occupy the said lands or so much thereof or to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals or the mines, pits, seams and veins containing the same. The issue is whether the words used in the Crown grant confer a wider power on the owner of the mines and minerals over the surface, than the words in the agreement, which admittedly are extended by the implied right to the mineral owner to enter upon the surface and dig for, get and carry away the minerals. Or perhaps we might put the issue thus: Do the words of the Crown grant enable more extensive colliery operations to be carried on to get the minerals than do the words used by the defendant vendor in the agreement, extended by the legal implication?\nThe precise question therefore upon which it is necessary to pass is whether an exception of \"mines and minerals\" gives in favour of the grantor rights as large as the rights given by such an exception associated with an express reservation of the right to work in the terms above stated. It is to be noted that the easement given by the reservation involves not only the right to take the minerals found in the lands granted but to enter and occupy the land for the working of all veins containing minerals that may be found in them. I should hesitate before holding that the powers of entry for the purpose of exploration under such a reservation are not greater than those given by a provision of the deed excepting simpliciter \"mines and minerals.\"\nThere are other points which might be suggested but it is unnecessary to discuss them because in one respect at all events I have come to a definite conclusion that the reservation of the right to work in the terms of the patent confers wider rights than an exception in the more limited form. It is established doctrine that the right to work in such a way as to let down the surface does not arise under an exception of \"mines and minerals\" unless there is something in the terms of the deed which expressly or by necessary implication gives such a right. That is settled in a series of cases. Love v. Bell[9]; Butterley v. New Hucknall Colliery Co.[10]. (See especially the judgment of Lord Macnaghten at pp. 385-6). But the rule seems to be also established that where there is an express right to work a specified kind of mineral even in terms less comprehensive than those we have now to pass upon that may, according to the circumstances, involve the right to work that kind of mineral notwithstanding this consequence. Ashbury J. in Welldon v. Butterley Co.[11], fully discussed the effect of a disposition where the reserved rights include by express stipulation the power to work the subjacent coal eo nomine, and where it is established as a fact that by no known method of working the coal can subsidence be avoided.\nThe reservation in the patent does not specifically mention coal or any other mineral but there is a reservation of all \"mines and minerals\" and a right to work all of them. It does not appear to me that a right expressed in these terms is less comprehensive as regards any particular mineral that may be found than a right derived from a stipulation in the same terms but applicable to that particular mineral alone. I think the judgment of Ashbury J. is convincing and although in express terms it applies only to the case of a reservation of the right to work specific minerals the reasoning does, I think, involve the conclusion that the rights under such a clause as that we have to consider are of the same character; and in that reasoning I concur.\nThis suffices to dispose of the precise question passed upon by the Appellate Division and decided by them in a sense adverse to appellant and the result is that the appeal from that decision should be allowed and the judgment dismissing the action set aside. The action will of course proceed in accordance with the Alberta practice in the usual course to the trial of the other questions which remain to be determined.\nI express no opinion of course upon any of these questions nor do I make any suggestion whatever as to the ultimate effect of the present decision upon the determination of the concrete questions in controversy in this litigation.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal and of the hearing in the court of first instance.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal is whether a reservation of mines and minerals simpliciter in a grant of land carries with it all the rights and privileges, actual and potential, which the reservation of mines and minerals\nwith full power to work the same, and for this purpose to enter upon and use or occupy the lands or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals or the mines, pits, seams and veins containing the same\nfound in the grant of the land here in question from the Crown, may confer. For the appellant it is contended that there is a substantial difference in regard to the right to destroy or cause subsidence of the surface and certain other rights.\nThe implication in the mere reservation of them in a grant of land of the right to win, get and take away the minerals is recognized by a long series of authorities. The powers which this implied right gives are well stated by Kekewich J., in Marshall v. Barrowdale[12]. They may be formulated in terms not dissimilar to those above extracted from the Crown grant. But that the right so implied is always subject to the condition that its exercise shall not prejudice the surface owner's natural right to support is conclusively established by many authorities in English courts of which the most recent is the decision of the House of Lords in Thomson v. St. Catharine's College, Cambridge[13]. The surface cannot be destroyed however necessary it may be to do so for the practical working of the mines.\nThe same result follows in the case of an express power to work, etc., where it is possible to work the mines and extract the minerals without causing subsidence or destruction of the surface, and the right to do so is not conferred expressly or by necessary implication in the terms in which the power is couched. Dixon v. White[14]; Davis v. Treharne[15]. A modern instance of such a necessary implication is found in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co.[16].\nAs Lord Macnaghten said in the Butterknowle Case[17], after referring to the more recent decisions of their Lordships:\u2014\nThe result seems to be that in all cases where there has been a severance in title and the upper and the lower strata are in different hands, the surface owner is entitled of common right to support for his property in its natural position and in its natural condition without interference or disturbance by or in consequence of mining operations, unless such interference or disturbance is authorized by the instrument of severance either in express terms or by necessary implication. This presumption in favour of one of the ordinary and most necessary rights of property holds good whether the instrument of serevance is a lease, or a deed of grant or reservation, or an inclosure act or award. To exclude the presumption it is not enough that the mining rights had been reserved or granted in the largest terms imaginable, or that powers or privileges usually found in Crown grants are conferred without stint, or that compensation is provided in measure adequate, or more than adequate, to cover any damages likely to be occasioned by the exercise of those powers and privileges. But where it is established that the mines cannot be worked or the minerals extracted without entailing such consequences, an express power to work the mines and get the minerals necessarily implies the right to cause subsidence and destruction of the surface. This is the result of the decisions in Butterley Co. v. New Hucknall Colliery Co.[18]; Duke of Buccleuch v. Wakefield[19], and Bell v. Earl of Dudley[20]. The authorities on this branch of the law are ably discussed in the recent judgment of Astbury J. in Welldon v. Butterley Co.[21].\nIn this latest case it is stated to be now scientifically established that all systems of coal mining necessarily result in the subsidence of the surface. It may be that in the present case it can be shewn by evidence that whatever coal lies under the land in question cannot be removed without destruction of the surface. At all events the fact that the express powers reserved in the Crown grant expose the purchaser to the risk of such a result, to which he would not have been subject had the reservation been merely of \"mines and minerals,\" in my opinion suffices to preclude an a priori finding that the title offered him is such as the vendor can compel him to accept.\nOther differences between the scope of the expressed and implied powers urged by the appellant are probably negatived by the limitative word \"necessary\" in the clause of the Crown grant. But they, as well as the defences of notice by registration and waiver of the right to repudiate, and the effect of the provision in the agreement that the deed to be given shall be subject to the conditions and reservations in the original grant from the Crown,\ncan be dealt with more satisfactorily after a full trial of the action.\nI am for these reasons, with great respect, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of dismissal set aside and the action allowed to proceed to trial in the ordinary course. It may be that the plaintiff will then fail to satisfy the court that whatever minerals may be upon, in or under the land cannot be removed without permanent injury to the surface and that the defendant will on that ground eventually succeed.\nThe appellant is entitled to be paid his costs of the appeals to the Appellate Division and to this court; and the costs of the motion before Mr. Justice Scott should be costs in the cause to the plaintiff in any event thereof.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The issue of law tried on the pleadings in this case is whether the contention expressed in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the respondent's statement of defence is well founded for if it is the appellant's action was rightly dismissed. These two paragraphs are as follows:\u2014\n10.\u2014The defendant says that the reservations set out in paragraph 7 of the statement of claim are the same reservations or less reservations than those implied by reservation of the mines and minerals.\n11.\u2014The defendant says that in law, reservation of the mines and minerals is equivalent to reservation of mines and minerals together with full power to work the same and, for this purpose, to enter upon and use or occupy the said lands, or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effective working of the said minerals or the mines, pits, seams and veins containing the same. The appellant's action claimed rescission of an agreement of sale made with the respondent, on the ground, inter alia, that although the respondent stated that he could not agree to sell the mines and minerals, which were reserved, he represented that this was the only reservation, whereupon the agreement of sale was signed, reserving to His Majesty, his successors and assigns, all mines and minerals. And the appellant alleges in paragraph seven of his statement of claim (referred to in paragraph ten of the statement of defense), that since the agreement of sale, he has discovered by a search made in the Land Titles Office that the reservation of mines and minerals in favour of the Crown was not as represented by the respondent, but was a much more complete reservation, being as follows:\u2014\nReserving thereout and therefrom all mines and minerals which may be found to exist within, upon or under such lands together with full power to work the same, and for this purpose to enter upon and use or occupy the said lands or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals or the mines, pits, seams, and veins containing the same.\nThe appellant's case is that under a bare reservation to the Crown of mines and minerals, while the mines and minerals lying under the surface could be\u2014to use the terms found in most reservations\u2014won, got at and taken away, this could only be done subject to the surface owner's natural right of support of the surface by the subjacent strata, whereas, under the reservation found in the Crown's grant, the Crown could, if necessary, cause a subsidence of the surface; so that the reservation in favour of the Crown is materially different from that represented by the respondent, and much more serious in its effects than a general reservation of mines and minerals would be. The respondent's contention, as expressed in paragraph 10 and 11 of his plea, in my opinion, is clearly unfounded. I take it as being now well settled that a bare reservation of mines and minerals does not carry with it the right to cause subsidence of the surface. An express reservation, on the contrary, in terms such as those to be found in the grant from the Crown and quoted above, where the mines and minerals cannot be won, got at or taken away without causing subsidence of the surface, carries with it by necessary implication the right to work the mine and extract the minerals even to the point of depriving the owner of the surface of his right of support by the subjacent strata.\nThis distinction is well expressed in the head note to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Butterley Co. Ltd. v. New Hucknall Colliery Co. Ltd.[22], as follows :\u2014\nIn construing instruments which involve the severance of surface or of a higher seam and subjacent minerals it is presumed that the owner of the surface or of the higher seam intends to reserve his common law right of support; the onus of shewing that this was not the intention of the parties to the deed lies on the mineral owner, and this onus is not discharged by the insertion of full powers of working and carrying away all the minerals expressed in general terms, or of wide provisions for compensation. But when the mineral owner proves not only that the upper seam will not be destroyed, but only injured to such an extent as will admit of compensation, and, further, that it is impossible to get the minerals at all without letting down the upper seam, all reasons for qualifying the general words of the powers of working are gone, and if the terms of the instruments make it clear that it was the intention of the parties that subjacent seams should be worked, it is a necessary implication that they intended that there should be a subsidence of superjacent strata.\nAs an example of a case where there is only a bare reservation of mines and minerals, I may refer to the recent decision of the House of Lords in St. Catharines College, Cambridge, v. Dowager Countess of Rosse[23], where the right to cause subsidence of the surface was denied. And, as shewing where this right can be implied, when the terms of the reservation are sufficiently wide, and the mine cannot be worked without causing subsidence, there is the still more recent decision of Mr. Justice Astbury in Welldon v. Butterley Co., Ltd.[24]. This last case, while not binding on us, is very instructive as shewing where the right to cause subsidence can be considered as a necessary implication of the right to work the mine, and the learned judge very exhaustively deals with all the authorities bearing on the matter.\nOn the issue of law raised in this case by the respondent's plea, I, with respect, think that the appellant is right in complaining of the dismissal of his action. His action should therefore go to trial, and inasmuch as the respondent alleges that he, the appellant, purchased subject to the conditions and reservations in the original grant from the Crown, it should be determined whether this (if proved) renders his purchase subject to the express reservation above quoted, and whether it is possible or not to win, get at and carry away the minerals without causing subsidence of the surface. The question will then be whether the appellant has made out a case for rescission of the agreement of sale.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division, costs of motion to the plaintiff in any event.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 15 Alta.

In October, 1912, one Maher, who had bought the property from the respondent, instructed the appellant to prepare plans and specifications for a ten story building. The work was commenced but discontinued about May, 1913, owing to lack of funds on the part of Maher. On September 1st, 1916, the property was retroceded by Maher to the respondent. After May, 1913, some work was done for protection from the weather of the part of the buildings erected. In November, 1916, the respondent leased the property to one Chadborn who erected a garage on it between December, 1916, and May, 1917. On September 14th, 1916, the appellant registered his claim against the property, and on March 31st, 1917, also addressed a notice, to the registrar as well as to Maher and the respondent, claiming $7,851 for his services as architect and he registered this notice on April 13th, 1917.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and L.P.

Il repose sur ce principe d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui veut que ceux qui\nmettent leur temps, leur travail, leur soin ou quelque mati\u00e8re sort pour faire une chose ou pour la refaire ou la conserver\naient un privil\u00e8ge sur la plus-value de l'h\u00e9ritage qui r\u00e9sulte de son travail. Domat, vol. 3, \u00e9dition de 1822, p. 448; Pothier, \u00e9d. de 1844, vol. 17, Des cri\u00e9es, n\u00b0 129. Ce privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 dans notre code par les codificateurs dans les articles 1695 au titre du Louage, 2009 et 2013 au titre des Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques, et 2103 au titre de l'Enregistrement. DeLorimier, Biblioth\u00e8que du code civil, vol. 17, pp. 384 et 404; vol. 18, pp. 235 et 236.\nA l'exception de l'article 1695, tous ces articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9s par la loi Aug\u00e9 et la l\u00e9gislation subs\u00e9quente, c'est-\u00e0-dire par les statuts suivants: 1894, 57 Vict., ch. 46; 1895, 59 Vict., ch. 42; 1904, 4 Ed. VIL, ch. 43; 1916, 7 Geo. V, ch. 52.\nSous l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais le privil\u00e8ge existait sans enregistrement, et il en \u00e9tait de m\u00eame au Bas-Canada jusqu'en 1841 lorsque l'ordonnance de l'enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 promulgu\u00e9e par le Conseil Sp\u00e9cial qui a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les architectes, constructeurs ou autres ouvriers employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction d'une b\u00e2tisse devaient faire enregistrer leur privil\u00e8ge en faisant faire des proc\u00e8s-verbaux de l'\u00e9tat des lieux avant les travaux commenc\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s les travaux termin\u00e9s. Cette derni\u00e8re disposition de la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e dans l'article 2013 du code civil (DeLorimier, vol. 17, p. 404). Cette loi cependant \u00e9dictait une proc\u00e9dure tellement compliqu\u00e9e et dispendieuse que l'entrepreneur et l'architecte seuls pouvaient s'en pr\u00e9valoir et qu'elle donnait peu de confort au pauvre ouvrier ou journalier qui, avec son salaire alors peu r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur, ne pouvait se payer le luxe d'un avocat pour s'adresser aux tribunaux et faire nommer des experts pour faire la visite des lieux. Alors la loi Aug\u00e9, du nom de son auteur, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 1894 pour venir au secours de l'ouvrier en d\u00e9clarant que le journalier, l'ouvrier, le fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux et le constructeur ne seraient pas tenus de faire faire des rapports d'expertise que leur privil\u00e8ge subsisterait sans enregistrement pendant la dur\u00e9e des travaux, mais qu'ils devaient enregistrer leur privil\u00e8ge dans les trente jours qui suivraient le parach\u00e8vement des travaux ou la cessation de l'ouvrage.\nL'architecte \u00e9tait omis dans cette nomenclature. Les articles 2009, 2013 et 2103 du code civil, qui le d\u00e9signaient nomm\u00e9ment, \u00e9taient rappel\u00e9s et remplac\u00e9s par d'autres articles o\u00f9 son nom n'apparaissait pas, et d'autres articles, soit 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d et 2013e d\u00e9signaient la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour les conditions de l'existence du privil\u00e8ge, son rang et les droits du propri\u00e9taire dans le cas de notification du privil\u00e8ge. Par contre, cependant, l'article 1695 subsistait toujours qui d\u00e9clarait:\nLes architectes, constructeurs et autres ouvriers ont un privil\u00e8ge sur les \u00e9difices et autres ouvrages par eux construits pour le paiement de leur ouvrage et mat\u00e9riaux, sujet aux r\u00e8gles contenues au titre des privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques et au titre de l'enregistrement des droits r\u00e9els.\nIl est possible que la loi Aug\u00e9 n'e\u00fbt pas pour effet de faire dispara\u00eetre le privil\u00e8ge de l'architecte, car les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de certains articles aux titres des Privil\u00e8ges et de l'Enregistrement auraient pu permettre l'enregistrement de ce privil\u00e8ge si formellement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par l'article 1695. Mais la l\u00e9gislature a \u00e9videmment cru qu'il pouvait y avoir lieu \u00e0 des incertitudes et alors elle a, en 1895, rappel\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement la l\u00e9gislation de l'ann\u00e9e 1894 et lui a substitu\u00e9 une nouvelle l\u00e9gislation o\u00f9 cette fois l'architecte repara\u00eet dans les articles 2009, 2013, 2013a, 2013c et 2103.\nLe fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en 1894 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 nomm\u00e9ment avec le journalier, l'ouvrier et le constructeur dans les articles 2009, 2013, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d et 2103, dispara\u00eet de ces articles; et le l\u00e9gislateur adopte six nouveaux articles, 2013 (g) \u00e0 2013 (1) o\u00f9 il indique une proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour donner au fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux\nun droit d'hypoth\u00e8que qui prendra rang apr\u00e8s les hypoth\u00e8ques enregistr\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement et les privil\u00e8ges cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente loi (art. 2013 (1)).\nL'architecte par cette l\u00e9gislation de 1895 reprenait incontestablement son rang parmi les privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s; et, par contre, le fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, qui, ant\u00e9rieurement au code civil, avait un privil\u00e8ge, ainsi que le d\u00e9clare Domat (loc. cit. p. 448), se trouvait soumis \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime particulier qui participait de la saisie-arr\u00eat, de l'hypoth\u00e8que et du privil\u00e8ge tout \u00e0 la fois. Plus tard, en 1904, (4 Ed. VII, ch. 43), on a r\u00e9tabli le fournisseur des mat\u00e9riaux parmi les privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s des articles 2013 et 2013a du code civil tels qu'amend\u00e9s en 1895, mais on ne l'a pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2009 qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les cr\u00e9ances privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es sur les immeubles.\nJe ne puis m'emp\u00eacher aussi de signaler la r\u00e9daction de l'article 2013a qui, avec l'amendement fait en 1904, se lit maintenant comme suit:\nRelativement \u00e0 leur privil\u00e8ge, le journalier, l'ouvrier, l'architecte et le constructeur prennent rang dans Tordre qui suit\n1\u00b0 Le journalier;\n2\u00b0 L'ouvrier;\n3\u00b0 L'architecte;\n4\u00b0 Le constructeur;\n5\u00b0 Le fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux.\nIl est \u00e9tonnant qu'on n'ait pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de mentionner dans la premi\u00e8re partie de l'article le fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, comme on a fait pour les autres. C'est qu'il y a des oublis bien \u00e9vidents et qui nous d\u00e9montrent bien que toute cette l\u00e9gislation a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e bien h\u00e2tivement et qu'elle donne lieu \u00e0 certain doute et \u00e0 une certaine ambiguit\u00e9 qui doivent nous faire rechercher l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur (art. 12 C.C.).\nDans cet ordre d'id\u00e9es, je remarque que l'article 2009, tel qu'\u00e9dict\u00e9 par la loi Aug\u00e9 de 1894, en \u00e9num\u00e9rant les cr\u00e9ances privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es sur les immeubles, donne au paragraphe 7me\nla cr\u00e9ance du journalier, de l'ouvrier, du fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux et du constructeur\nsujette aux dispositions de l'article 2013. L'article 2013 alors adopt\u00e9 en 1894 disait que ce droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de ces quatre privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s s'exercerait sur la plus-value; et dans l'article 2013b, il \u00e9num\u00e9rait encore ces quatre privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et d\u00e9clarait que leur privil\u00e8ge existerait sans enregistrement pendant les travaux et avec enregistrement apr\u00e8s les travaux termin\u00e9s.\nDans la loi de 1895, on fait dispara\u00eetre dans l'article 2009 le fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux et on le remplace par l'architecte; de m\u00eame, dans les articles 2013 et 2013a. Mais quand on vient alors \u00e0 r\u00e9diger l'article 2013b on ne mentionne plus l'architecte mais simplement le journalier, l'ouvrier et le constructeur. Pas un mot de l'architecte. Est-ce par inadvertance, comme dit l'honorable juge-en-chef de la Cour d'Appel? C'est bien possible, car, comme pour le constructeur, ses services acqui\u00e8rent de jour en jour pendant la construction une plus grande valeur. Sa cr\u00e9ance augmente au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les travaux progressent et alors je comprendrais qu'il ne f\u00fbt pas oblig\u00e9 d'enregistrer au cours des travaux.\nL'ordre-en-conseil qui \u00e9tablit les honoraires d'architectes et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans la cause nous d\u00e9montre que les honoraires de l'architecte sont susceptible d'augmenter avec le progr\u00e8s des travaux. Il est donc fort possible que ce soit un oubli du l\u00e9gislateur de ne pas avoir mentionn\u00e9 l'architecte parmi les personnes qui \u00e0 l'article 2013b ont un privil\u00e8ge sans enregistrement.\nMais la Cour d'Appel, dans une cause de Carri\u00e8re v. Sigouin[3], semble avoir dispos\u00e9 de cet argument. Il s'agissait dans cette cause de savoir si le privil\u00e8ge du fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux existait dans le cas o\u00f9 il n'avait pas donn\u00e9 l'avis exig\u00e9 par l'article 2013g.\nL'honorable juge Demers, en \u00e9tudiant la l\u00e9gislation alors existante, disait sur l'article 2013b:\nL'article 2013 (b) n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 par la loi 4 Edouard VII. Or par la loi de 1895 le fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux n'est pas compris dans l'article 2013b. L'article 2103 ne peut donc \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 au fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, puisque ce dernier n'est pas mentionn\u00e9 dans l'article 2013b.\nCette opinion de l'honorable juge Demers est bien d\u00e9cisive: c'est que l'article 2013b ne peut pas s'appliquer au fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, parce qu'il n'est pas mentionn\u00e9. Alors il en serait donc de m\u00eame pour l'architecte, puisqu'il n'en est pas question non plus dans cet article 2013b. Cette cause de Carri\u00e8re v. Sigouin3 ne devrait pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e comme autorit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9cider, comme la Cour d'Appel l'a fait dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, que l'architecte doit enregistrer dans les trente jours de la cessation des travaux.\nJe partage l'opinion du juge Demers que le fait du l\u00e9gislateur de ne pas avoir mentionn\u00e9 l'architecte dans l'article 2013b d\u00e9montre que cet article ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 par l'architecte ou contre lui.\nQuand, en 1895, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu parler de l'architecte, il l'a nomm\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9, et notamment aux articles 2009, 2013, 2013a et 2013c. Ce dernier article surtout rend pour moi la chose \u00e9vidente qu'il n'y a pas eu inadventance en r\u00e9digeant l'article 2013b. J'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le demandeur ne devait pas r\u00e9ussir pour les raisons suivantes:\nPar l'article 1695 du code civil, le privil\u00e8ge de l'architecte est soumis aux r\u00e8gles contenues au titre des Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques et au titre de l'Enregistrement des Droits r\u00e9els. Les dispositions des articles 2013, 2013b et 2103 du code civil, tels qu'ils existaient en 1916 quand Cook est devenu tiers d\u00e9tenteur de l'immeuble, ne sont pas tr\u00e8s claires et peuvent porter \u00e0 controverse, comme je viens de le dire: mais, par contre, les articles 2082, 2083 et 2084 du code disposent des droits des parties dans le pr\u00e9sent litige.\nD'abord l'article 2082 nous dit que l'enregistrement des droits r\u00e9els leur donne effet et \u00e9tablit leur rang suivant les dispositions contenues au titre de l'Enregistrement.\nL'article 2084 nous indique les droits r\u00e9els qui sont exempts des formalit\u00e9s de l'enregistrement: et il inclut notamment les privil\u00e8ges mentionn\u00e9s en premier, quatri\u00e8me, cinqui\u00e8me, sixi\u00e8me et neuvi\u00e8me lieux dans l'article 2009. Il en r\u00e9sulte donc, en raison de la r\u00e8gle expressio unius est exclusio alterius que le privil\u00e8ge de l'architecte, qui est mention\u00e9 \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7me de l'article 2009, doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9. Suivant l'article 2083, les droits r\u00e9els soumis \u00e0 la formalit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement ont effet du moment de leur enregistrement \u00e0 l'encontre des autres cr\u00e9ances dont les droits n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s que subs\u00e9quemment.\nDans le cas actuel, l'appelant n'a enregistr\u00e9 son privil\u00e8ge que post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 Cook a fait enregistrer son titre de propri\u00e9taire. Cet enregistrement est tardif et ne peut pas constituter un privil\u00e8ge qui pourrait \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 Cook. Sans adopter les motifs de la Cour d'Appel, j'en confirmerais, pour les raisons ci-dessus, le dispositif avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an action by the appellant to have it declared that he has, as architect, a privilege for $7,851 affecting subdivision 7 of lot No. 1339 and lot No. 1340 of St. Antoine Ward in the City of Montreal belonging to the respondent.\nOne James H. Maher had purchased these lots from the respondent in October, 1912, for $110,000 of which $20,000 was paid in cash and the balance, $90,000, was secured in the respondent's favour by a vendor's privilege and was payable by instalments. Immediately after the purchase, Maher instructed the appellant's firm, Saxe and Archibald, in whose rights the appellant now is, to prepare plans and specifications for a ten story building on this property. Tenders were then called for and that of one Deakin for $192,500 was accepted by Maher and a contract made between him and Deakin for the construction of the building, stipulating that it should be completed in September, 1913. The work was commenced and continued until May, 1913, when Maher became financially embarrassed and the work was stopped. On the 31st of July, 1913, a contract was made between Deakin and Maher, which had been drafted by the appellant, whereby it was agreed that the\u00b0 building operations would be postponed until March 1st, 1914; that the value of the building as it stood was $33,550 on which $25,000 had been paid, leaving a balance of $8,550; that there was a balance of $9,135 due the contractor for which Maher gave his note; that the contractor would proceed with the work on March 1st, 1914, on receiving 20 days previous notice, provided he was guaranteed that the necessary financial arrangements to complete the work had been made; and that should the construction not be proceeded with by March 1st, 1914, the contractor would then be entitled to claim the balance due him to date.\nNo notice to continue the work on March 1st, 1914, was given by Maher to Deakin, nor were the necessary financial arrangements made. No work was done save what was necessary to protect the part already built, which was nothing more than the foundations and reached the level of the sidewalk.\nOn September 1st, 1916, Maher, being unable to pay the respondent the balance due on the purchase price of the property, reconveyed it to the latter, represented by his brother, Mr. J. W. Cook, K.C., in consideration of the balance he owed him, $90,000, for which the respondent gave him a discharge. This deed of sale was registered on September 2nd, 1916.\nOn September, 14th, 1916, the appellant addressed a notice to the registrar of Montreal West and to Maher, stating that he claimed $7,851, and demanding that his claim be registered against the property. This notice was registered on December 16th, 1916. On March 31st, 1917, the appellant also addressed a notice to the registrar as well as to Maher and the respondent, claiming $7,851 for his services as architect\nin the construction of a building now being erected on said lots\nand required that it be registered against this property, This notice was registered on April 13th, 1917.\nIt may be observed that although the appellant stated that the building was then being erected, the work had been stopped since May, 1913, except what was done for the protection of the work from the weather, and the idea of any further construction had evidently been abandoned. It should be added that in November, 1916, the respondent leased the property to one Chadborn who erected a garage on it some time between December, 1916, and May, 1917.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the respondent's plea and gave judgment for the appellant on two grounds: 1, that the ratification by the respondent of the acceptance of Maher's reconveyance by Mr. J. W. Cook was insufficient; 2, that the appellant's privilege had been registered in due time.\nThe Court of King's Bench[4] reversed this judgment, rejecting, and I think rightly, the first and somewhat technical ground, to which I will not further refer, the more so as it was not urged before this court, and as to the registration of the appellant's privilege holding as follows in the formal judgment:\nAttendu que le 1er mars 1914, Maher n'a pu, \u00e0 raison de ses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, continuer les travaux qui, d\u00e8s lors, \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s termin\u00e9s;\nAttendu que Archibald, architecte, ne pouvait enr\u00e9gistrer son privil\u00e8ge d'architecte ni le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1916, ni en avril 1917 plus de 30 jours apr\u00e8s que les travaux \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s termin\u00e9s.\nIn effect, and indeed in terms, this decision is that the appellant could not register his privilege more than 30 days\napr\u00e8s que les travaux \u00e9taient censes termin\u00e9s.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that no such term as 30 days after the work is deemed to have terminated or to have ceased is to be found in this frequently amended and somewhat unskilfully drafted legislation. The case of work abandoned before completion is clearly a casus omissus in these articles, as is likewise the case of an architect or contractor dismissed during the course of the building operations. It appears unnecessary to go into the history of this legislation, for we are only concerned with its proper construction as it existed at the time the appellant's services were rendered. Articles 2013 (first paragraph), 2013a, 2013b and the first paragraph of article 2103 were then as follows:\u2014\n2013. The labourer, workman, architect, builder and supplier of materials, have a right of preference over the vendor and the other creditors, on the immovable but only upon the additional value given to the immovable by the work done.\n2013a. For the purposes of the privilege, the labourer, workman, architect, builder and the supplier of materials rank as follows: 1, the labourer; 2, the workman; 3, the architect; 4, the builder; 5, the supplier of materials.\n2013b. The right of preference or privilege upon the immovable exists, as follows:\u2014\nWithout registration of the claim, in favour of the debt due the labourer, workman and the builder, during the whole time they are occupied at the work or while such work lasts, as the case may be; and, with registration, provided it be registered within the 30 days following the date upon which the building has become ready for the purpose for which it is intended.\nBut such right of preference or privilege shall exist only for one year from the date of the registration, unless a suit be taken in the interval, or unless a longer delay for payment has been stipulated in the contract.\n2103. I. The privilege of the persons mentioned in article 2013 dates, in the cases mentioned in the first clause of article 2013b, only from the registration within the proper delay, at the registry office of the division in which is situated the immovable affected by the inscription of a notice or memorial drawn up according to form A, with a deposition of the creditor, sworn to before a justice of the peace or a Commissioner of the Superior Court, setting forth the nature and the amount of the claim and describing the immovable so affected.\nThe learned judges of the Court of King's Bench appear to have considered that through some inadvertence the paragraph of Art. 2013b commencing with the words \"without registration\" omitted any mention of the architect, and that during the continuance of the work superintended by him the architect could claim a privilege without registration. I have been unable so to construe this article, nor do I think it competent for the court to supply an omission which appears to have been intentional. It was no doubt considered that inasmuch as the labourer, the workman and, to some extent, the builder have claims which become payable at fixed times as the work progresses, it would, especially in the case of the two first, be inconvenient to require them to register a series of claims payable day by day or week by week for varying amounts. In the case of the architect there is no exemption from registration during the progress of the work and there is no provision allowing him to assert a privilege while the work progresses, unless his claim has been registered.\nA careful reading of article 2013b shows that this difference was clearly intentional. \"The right of preference or privilege upon the immovable\" which \"exists\" is obviously the \"right of preference\" mentioned by Art. 2013, and is that in favour of the labourer, workman, architect, builder, and supplier of materials. Therefore the right of preference referred to in the first line of Art. 2013b is the right of the five classes enumerated in article 2013 and also in article 2013a. Then article 2013b states how this right \"exists,\" and it exists:\n(a) without registration of the claim, in favour of the debt due the labourer, workman and the builder, during the whole time they are occupied at the work or while such work lasts: and\n(b) with registration, provided \"it,\" that is to say the right mentioned in the first line of article 2013b, be registered within the 30 days, etc.\nIf it had been intended that the words \"in favour of the debt due the labourer, workman and the builder\" should apply to and govern the two clauses above indicated as (a) and (b) respectively, they would have been placed in the introductory clause immediately after the verb \"exists.\" Placed as they are, their restrictive effect is confined to the phrase \"without registration, etc.,\" leaving the phrase \"and with registration, etc.,\" unrestricted and applicable to the entire subject of the verb \"exists,\" thus embracing in clause (b) the architect and the supplier of materials as well as the other three classes. No valid reason has been advanced for rejecting this plain grammatical construction. There is no accidental omission to supply. The architect is deliberately left out of the first clause and equally deliberately included in the second. The architect's right of preference or privilege \"exists,\" \"dates,\" or \"takes effect\" only from the date of registration, in view both of article 2013b and of art. 2103, and also by virtue of the general rules applicable to the registration of real rights (arts. 2082, 2083), unless it be expressly exempt from registration (arts. 2013b and 2084), which it clearly is not.\nIt is true that article 2013b grants a delay of 30 days for the registration of the architect's privilege; but this is in case the work has been completed, for the starting point of this delay is the date when the building has become ready for the purpose for which it is intended. If the building operations are not completed, but, as in this case, abandoned in course of prosecution, there is no delay for registration, for there is no date fixed by law from which this delay could be computed. It follows that, in such a case, although the architect must register his claim, he is granted no delay for registration and his right of priority as to other registered claims can only count from the date of the registration of his own claim (art. 2083). I may now cite art. 2013f for it leads to the consideration of the legal principle upon which the dismissal of the appellant's action should in my opinion be supported.\n2013f. The sale to a third party by the proprietor of the immovable or his agents, or the payment of the whole or a portion of the contract price, cannot in any way affect the claims of persons who have a privilege under Art. 2013, and who have complied with the requirements of articles 2013a, 2013b, 2013c and 2103.\nIt follows that the sale of the immovable to a third party will be conclusive against the architect if the latter has not complied with the requirements of the articles here mentioned, and therefore, in a case like this where the work has been stopped and abandoned and the building has never become ready for the purpose for which it is intended, if the property be sold to a third party who registers his deed of sale before the architect registers his privilege, the architect's claim cannot be asserted against the immovable.\nHere when the appellant registered his claim the respondent was the registered owner of the property and in my opinion it was then too late for the appellant to register his claim against the property. I may add that there is no suggestion of bad faith on the respondent's part, and the appellant must stand or fall on his strict compliance with the provisions I have cited.\nIt is unnecessary to express any opinion upon the question whether the appellant could have effectively registered his claim either on the 16th of December, 1916, or on the 13th of April, 1917, had Maher remained the owner of the property.\nI make no reference to the amendments made to this legislation by the statute 7 Geo. V, ch. 53, because it came into force only on Dec. 22, 1916, at which date the respondent was the registered owner of the property, and any work done by the appellant had been finished long before its enactment.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Elliott & David.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cook & Magee.\n[1] [1819] Q.R. 29 K.B. 364.\n[2] Q.R. 29 K.B. 364.\n[3] [1908] Q.

Though, where there has been part performance of an agreement, the courts, when asked to decree specific performance, should struggle against any difficulty arising from vagueness in the terms of the agreement in order to effectuate the real intention of the parties, they cannot do what would amount to making an agreement as to some of the essential terms on which the parties were never ad idem.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 587) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Walsh J. (1) and dismissing appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nC. C. McCaul K.C. for the appellant.\nH. R. Milner for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment on this appeal prepared by my colleagues Anglin and Mignault JJ. and find that they have expressed very clearly the views which I had myself formed after hearing the argument and carefully reading and considering the reasons for judgment of the trial judge and Mr. Justice Beck speaking for the Appellate Division.\nIt is one thing, and no doubt commendable, for a court in cases where there has been part performance of an agreement to struggle against the difficulty ensuing from vagueness in the terms of the agreement and, if possible, without creating a new agreement, to spell out one which they conclude from the evidence represents the real intention of the parties. It is quite another thing, however, to make a new agreement for the parties as to which they themselves were never ad idem.\nWith great respect for the Appellate Division I cannot help concluding after reading over the evidence that they have done the latter in this case and have made an agreement for the parties which they themselves never intended. It may be, I do not doubt it, a very fair agreement and one calculated to do justice to both parties, but it is not the agreement the parties themselves reached or intended.\nI concur in the proposed judgment allowing the appeal with costs throughout and restoring the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action of ejectment in which respondent counterclaimed asking for specific performance of a contract of sale and purchase under which the vendor put the respondent in possession of the land in question, and the latter, in reliance upon the good faith of said vendor, made substantial improvements in way of buildings and fencing and cultivation.\nThe appellant admittedly has no higher rights than the vendor, who was her father.\nHe admits negotiating with the respondent for a sale of the premises to him and gave a written memorandum which defined the land accurately, named the price and the cash deposit to be paid on a stated date, and the rate of interest for the balance. And thereby he induced respondent to enter into possession and make the said improvements in question.\nThe learned trial judge held that as the parties differed in some of the minor details as to later payments, there was no enforceable agreement.\nThe Appellate Division unanimously reversed that judgment and by accepting respondent's version as to the first crop to be reaped that year, and the vendor's version as to those details relative to later payments, properly, as I hold under the circumstances, declared the respondent, on assenting thereto, to be entitled to specific performance.\nI have no doubt that according to what was within the common knowledge of the learned judges in appeal, so deciding, there was nothing very substantial in the possibly different results likely to be reaped from the operative effect of either version relative to these details.\nAnd the vendor's repeated assertion that the terms of payment, which he was to become bound to observe in the contract with his vendor, should govern those he was to receive from respondent, seems to furnish, if believed, a clear ground for the completion of the contract in an enforceable form. Those terms had been fixed and never were changed but the original vendor had stipulated he was not to be bound until a third party, then abroad, had assented to such terms of payment.\nThat party might have made some change but in the ultimate result he did not. That detail of the contract was in suspense, as it were, but all else was settled absolutely and the result I have adverted to effectually disposed of that suspensive condition.\nIndeed if respondent had been as astute as the Appellate Division and had, on the development of this unsubstantial difference in the probable result of these details in evidence, simply said to the learned trial judge: \"This is a quarrel about nothing, I am, though literally correct in my version, content to accept that of the other party to the contract, and be bound thereby,\" I incline to think the result might have been satisfactorily settled at the trial. At least I can see no answer there would have been to the counterclaim for specific performance within the principles upon which the courts of equity have long rested their judgments in cases dependent upon part performance of the contract.\nUnfortunately the conduct of the respondent's vendor had been so wanting in straightforward dealing as to provoke the former into an insistence on his version of the details being correct and what should be observed.\nI think the Appellate Division has taken a view that is quite maintainable and that this appeal should be for the reasons it has assigned, dismissed with costs throughout. DUFF J.\u2014Equity has gone very far in affording relief to a person who, occupying land, has spent money in making improvements or in connection with his occupation under the belief created or encouraged by the owner of the land that an interest would be granted to the occupier sufficient to enable him to enjoy the benefit of his expenditures. Relief is not afforded on the ground of agreement but on the ground that it would be unjust to permit the owner to dispossess the occupant in the circumstances without at all events making compensation. The cases are discussed and summed up in the judgment of Lord Hobhouse in Plimmer v. Corporation of Wellington[2]. The respondent is not entitled to stand upon this ground in this appeal because a claim to relief upon this ground was never put forward and no such claim has been the subject of investigation.\nThe courts would also give effect to a properly-founded inference arising from the conduct of the parties that possession of land was taken or continued under an understanding amounting to an agreement for sale either upon terms ascertained in fact or upon reasonable terms as to price and otherwise to be determined in case of dispute by the judgment of a competent court.\nI think the judgment of the trial judge was right that the parties never arrived at an agreement in terms and I think moreover that the facts disclosed in the evidence are not sufficient to support an inference that they proceeded upon such an understanding as that just indicated.\nIt follows that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. ANGLIN J.\u2014With very great respect I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge reached the correct conclusion upon the evidence in this record and that what the Appellate Division has done, under the guise of exercising to its fullest extent or even straining its power and duty to ascertain the terms and to enforce the complete performance of a somewhat vague contract of which there had been part performance, (Wilson v. West Hartlepool Ry. Co.[3]), amounts in fact to the making of a new contract for the parties.\nIn regard to the amount of the second instalment it is no doubt common ground that some agreement was reached. The memorandum, however, is indefinite. Raymer, who made the contract with the defendant and is a witness for the plaintiff, deposes that it was to comprise the whole, the defendant that it was to consist of half of the proceeds of the 1918 crop. In view of this direct contradiction in the evidence the learned trial judge was unable to determine which story should be accepted. The Appellate Division, however, has seen fit to accept that of the defendant and to reject that of Raymer, fixing the value of one-half of the 1918 crop at $500. While that may not be making a contract but merely determining what one term of the contract actually made really was, the sufficiency of the ground for rejecting the conclusion of the trial judge on this branch of the case seems to me to be questionable.\nAs to the remaining instalments, however, the only provision of the memorandum signed by Raymer is that the balance of the purchase money should be payable in yearly payments with interest at 8%. The defendant's story is that it was agreed that each of these instalments was to be one-half the proceeds of the annual crop whatever it might amount to. On the other hand, Raymer says that the amounts of the instalments were to be arranged after the terms of his own purchase of the land from Mr. Symington had been agreed upon, that they were to be of fixed sums, and were to be paid out of the proceeds of the annual crops so far as they might suffice, but that any deficiency was to be supplemented in cash. Here again the learned trial judge was unable to decide to which version credence should be given. The Appellate Division, however, has entirely rejected the defendant's story on this branch of the case and has determined that there shall be five equal annual instalments of $800 each payable with interest at 8% on the balance from time to time remaining unpaid, making the dates of those payments synchronize with those of the five payments of $700 each to be made to Symington, thus accepting in part Raymer's story of what it was his intention to exact when the final agreement should be made. It seems to me, with great deference, that this is nothing else than making an agreement for the parties in respect to matters which they themselves had left open for future settlement and goes beyond any powers that courts of equity have ever asserted\u2014great and wide as those powers undoubtedly are. This is not the case of a completed agreement couched in general terms and omitting only some details which the law will supply. Neither is it a case of nothing being left to be done except the embodiment in a formal instrument of terms fully agreed upon and sufficiently evidenced. Here essential elements are left open to be made the subject of future agreement. The language of Kay J. in Hart v. Hart[4], and that of Turner L. J. in Wood v. Midgley[5], cited by Mr. McCaul, seems closely in point. I would allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In this case, although the learned trial judge (Walsh J.) found that Raymer and the respondent had agreed for the purchase and sale of the property here in question conditionally on Raymer acquiring it from Symington, the total sale price being $4,800; he also found that they never were ad idem as to the terms of payment and that therefore there never was any agreement which could be enforced. This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division, Mr. Justice Beck, with whom the other learned judges concurred, stating, after having cited the conflicting versions given by Raymer and the respondent Watson as to the terms of payment, that he accepted the respondent's evidence that the first payment was to be $300 and half of the 1918 crop, (which would give $500, the respondent having valued this crop at $1,000). Mr. Justice Beck also expressed the opinion that the balance, $4,000, was to be apportioned so as to accord with the terms of the sale agreement between Symington and Raymer's daughter, the appellant, and should be paid at the same dates at 8% interest. He proceeds to determine the issues between the parties as follows:\u2014\nThe judgment will contain a declaration to the effect that the contract is one for the payment of $300 on the 10th of July, 1918, and for the payment of one-half of the proceeds of the crop of 1918, the value of the one half being fixed (on the defendant's evidence) at $500; and for the payment of the balance, $4,000, of the purchase money, in five equal annual instalments with interest at 8%, on the 25th February in each of the years 1919-23; interest on the purchase price of $4,800 (except the $300 which was refused by the plaintiff) to be calculated from the 8th of April, 1918. The judgment should also provide in some form for the protection of the defendant against the plaintiff's non-payment to Symington. It should allow the defendant one month from the date of his acceptance of this judgment for the payment of the arrears owing to the plaintiff.\nThese amounts can be calculated and inserted in the formal judgment.\nIf the defendant declines to accept this judgment his counterclaim will be dismissed with costs, and the judgment for the plaintiff will stand. If the defendant accepts this judgment he will have his costs of the action, and the plaintiff's action will be dismissed with costs. If the defendant accepts this judgment he will have his costs of the appeal, otherwise the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nIn view of the finding of Mr. Justice Beck that the contract is as stated in the first paragraph of the above excerpt it seems strange (may I say so with all deference) that the defendant is left free to decide whether he will accept or refuse the judgment. However he accepted it and the plaintiff now asks that this judgment be set aside and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nRecognizing to the fullest extent that where a contract has been partly performed, the court, when asked to decree specific performance, will struggle against the difficulty ensuing from the vagueness of the contract, still it is obvious that the court cannot make a contract for the parties if the latter have not agreed on its material terms. So the proper inquiry on this appeal is whether what the Appellate Division declares to be the contract was really what the parties had agreed on, for if they had not agreed on these terms the contract contained in the judgment is one made by the Court for the parties and obviously cannot be sustained.\nA careful reading of the evidence has convinced me that the terms of payment stated in the judgment were agreed to by neither Raymer nor Watson. They had made and signed a memorandum stating their agreement as far as it had gone, viz., a sale of the property for $4,800; a cash payment of $300 on or before July 10th, 1918; a further payment to be made from the proceeds of the crop to be grown on the land; an agreement for sale to be executed during the season; and the balance of payments to be payable yearly at 8% interest. It would really be difficult to imagine anything more indefinite than this memorandum (the wording of which I have followed as closely as possible) in so far as the terms of payment are concerned, and the confusion becomes greater still when we refer to the testimony of Raymer and Watson.\nThe former says he was to get $300 in cash; the entire crop for 1918; and the balance of the payments were to be governed by the contract he would make with Symington.\nAccording to Watson he was to pay $300 in cash, make a half crop payment in 1918, and give half the crop from that on.\nIn view of this testimony I must find that the contract, as stated by the judgment of the Appellate Division, agrees with neither of the versions of the parties. It takes from Watson's story the half crop payment of 1918 and from Raymer's evidence the division of the balance of the sale price so as to fit in with the payments to be made to Symington. This in my opinion could not be done.\nWe have therefore this result that the parties by their testimony contradict each other as to the material terms of their contract and that the terms contained in the judgment of the Appellate Division are inconsistent with either of their versions. It follows that the judgment really makes a contract for the parties, and, unless I do the same, I find it impossible, on my consideration of the evidence, to state what the agreement between Raymer and Watson really was. Under these circumstances, the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the parties were never ad idem in respect of the terms of payment seems inevitable.\nWith some reluctance, for the good faith of Raymer of whom the appellant is merely the nominee seems open to suspicion, I have therefore come to the conclusion that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored. Costs will go to the appellant here and in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs\n[1] [1919] 15 Alta. L.R. 587; [1920] 1 W.W.R. 939.\n[2] [1884] 9 A.C. 699.\n[3] [1865] 2 de G.

Norstrant (Defendant) Respondent\n1920: October 28, 29; 1921: February 1.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nSale\u2014Sale of land\u2014Option under seal\u2014Condition precedent\u2014Consideration\u2014Nominal\u2014Expressed as \"now paid\"\u2014Non-payment\u2014Specific performance\u2014Subsequent conduct\u2014Parol evidence\u2014Statute of Frauds. The respondent was purchasing some land from a company of which the appellant was the sales agent for $86,400 and asked the latter to join him in the undertaking. The appellant, before doing so, wished to see personally his principals who were resident in the United States in order to obtain their consent. The respondent then entered into an option agreement under seal whereby in consideration of the sum of $100 \"now paid,\" of which receipt was acknowledged, and of the payment of half of the cash instalments due in virtue of the purchase agreement, he assigned to the appellant an undivided half-share interest in the land. The above sum of $100 was in fact neither paid nor demanded. The respondent then proceeded to complete the original purchase agreement, paid the cash instalments amounting to $10,000 to the owners and sold part of the land at a profit. The appellant, after having obtained the approval of his principals, sent to the respondent the sum of $5,000 with interest thereon within the delay specified in the option; but the respondent returned it and refused to carry out the agreement. The appellant sued for specific performance.\nHeld, Duff and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that the option agreement was binding upon the respondent. Cushing v. Knight 46 Can. S.C.R. 555) discussed. Per Sir Louis Davies C.J.\u2014The question whether the giver of the option was bound thereby, without the payment of the $100, is entirely one of intention, and, in this case, there was nothing to indicate that it was the intention of the parties that such payment should be a condition precedent to the respondent being bound, both parties understanding that the down payment was immaterial and negligible.\nPer Sir Louis Davies C.J.\u2014Upon the evidence, conduct and correspondence of the parties, the option agreement was to become operative only when the consent of the appellant's principals had been obtained; and after such consent there was no unreasonable delay on appellant's part in tendering to the respondent the moneys stipulated in the agreement.\nPer Idington J.\u2014When a contract for an option is under seal and purports to bind for a specific time, assented to by the covenantee, its binding effect cannot be affected by any omission to pay the consideration declared to have been received, unless and until actual payment has been demanded and refused.\nPer Duff J., Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The actual payment of the sum of $100 was made a condition precedent to the instrument becoming effective as an option, and the consideration cannot be treated as a mere nominal one.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014But the subsequent conduct of the respondent has been such as to preclude him from relying upon the non-fulfilment of the condition. Duff J. contra.\nPer Anglin J \u2014And parol evidence of the facts warranting this inference is admissible since it does not amount to such a variation of the terms of the contract that verbal proof of it would offend against either the rule in regard to contracts reduced to writing or the Statute of Frauds. Duff J. contra.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Assuming that the payment of $100 was a condition precedent to the existence of a binding option, the respondent's offer to sell one-half interest in the lands purchased was not expressly or impliedly revoked before its acceptance by the appellant within reasonable delay.\nPer Duff and Mignault JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The payment of $100 was one of the facts which the appellant, relying upon the existence of the option, had to establish, in the absence of circumstances dispensing with the performance of this essential condition.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The grant of an option has the effect of vesting in the optionee an interest in land, and, if given for valuable consideration, is not revocable; and the giver of the option is not entitled to break it on offering to pay damages.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L. R. 252) reversed, Duff and Mignault JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Simmons J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the appellant.\nC. C. McCaul K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The only question for us to determine is the effect of the non-payment of the $100 at the time the agreement for the purchase by Davidson of the undivided half interest in the lands of the respondent Norstrant was signed by the parties.\nThe written agreement expresses the sum as being '\"now paid,\" that is, at the time of its execution, and it being agreed upon and not in controversy that it was not then paid, the respondent contends, and the Appellate Division found, that this action for the enforcement of the agreement would not lie and dismissed it accordingly.\nAfter careful reading of the evidence and the opinions of the learned judges of the Appellate Division I am of the opinion that the conclusion of the Chief Justice, who dissented from the judgment and concurred with the trial judge, was correct and that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored, substituting however for the reference to assess damages as directed by him an order for an accounting. I am strongly inclined to think, after careful reading of their evidence, that both parties regarded the down payment of the $100 as immaterial and negligible, and looking at the very large sum involved in the sale of the one-half of Norstrant's interests in the lands, the kind and character of the transaction and the conduct of the parties, that the down payment was waived.\nI desire however to rest my judgment upon the fact, as clearly proved and not challenged or denied, that at the very time the agreement was being signed by the parties it was agreed and fully understood that it was not to become operative or effective unless and until Davidson, who was the agent for the owners and as such had sold the lands to Norstrant, had seen these owners and obtained their consent to his becoming a part purchaser of the lands with Norstrant.\nIt is quite clear that without such a consent on the part of the owners it would be alike inequitable and unjust for Davidson to become a part owner with Norstrant to whom, as agent for others, he had sold the lands.\nThe evidence on this point is clear, undisputed and unchallenged. Davidson's statement, not denied, is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Will you give a history of the matter so as to explain why the agreement was put in a lateral form as it is? A. Well, Mr. Norstrant had been considering for some time the purchase of these lands and I had discussed, I had charge of the sale of the lands, and I had discussed the purchase of the lands with him, at the time when my associates were here a few months prior to this, they had set the price on these lands of around twenty-five dollars an acre. After discussing the subject with Mr. Norstrant he informed me that, as the total amount was some eighty-seven or eighty-eight thousand dollars, that he thought the deal was too large for him, and at his home near Beiseker, when this matter was discussed, he said to me \"Don't you want to take a half interest with me in them?\" and I informed him at the time that I thought the purchase was a good purchase for him and would be and would interest me, but that owing to the fact that I was operating the company for the estate and for Mr. Beiseker, I would not agree to close any transaction of that nature without first having an opportunity of consulting with them and getting their approval. I told him, however, that I thought * * that I felt quite sure there would be no trouble, that they would be quite willing for me to take this interest, behause they had already established the price which Mr. Norstrant was paying and that they would have no objection to my going in, and I informed then I * * and I informed him I wanted to take it up with them personally, and I would be going down to Minneapolis in the early spring and that therefore, we could arrange some agreement that would give me until May. That was along the line of the understand.\nThe conclusion, and I think the only reasonable conclusion, to be drawn from the evidence is that, while the terms on which Davidson was to purchase the half interest were agreed upon, put into writing and signed by the parties, it was at the same time clearly understood and agreed that, inasmuch as Davidson had acted as the agent of the owners in selling the lands to Norstrant, he could not purchase back a half interest in the same lands from Norstrant without the consent of those for whom he had acted in selling the lands.\nAs Davidson said in his evidence, he could not \"close the transaction\" without such consent.\nThe signed agreement, therefore, was merely a tentative one depending for its coming into effect and becoming operative upon Davidson obtaining the consent of those for whom, as agent, he had acted in selling Norstrant the lands.\nDavidson, accordingly, went to Minneapolis, obtained the necessary consent of the parties spoken of, and without any delay, on his return home, on the 14th March, 1918, wrote respondent defendant, Norstrant, that he had, a week before, \"returned from the States,\" and that the parties whose consent was necessary to his becoming a purchaser of a half interest in the lands were quite agreeable to his becoming such a purchaser and asked respondent whether he should send his cheque for the $5,000 (which included the down payment of $100) to Norstrant's residence or deposit it to his credit in some bank in Calgary.\nOn the 19th March, not having received any reply to the letter of the 14th, Davidson again wrote enclosing the cheque for $5,066.16, the $66.16 being interest at 7% up to date.\nOn March 23rd Norstrant replied to Davidson's letter of March 14th, explaining the delay as having been caused by the \"miscarriage somewhere\" of Davidson's letter and further stating that he\nhad plenty of cash on hand * * * having made arrangements to get $10,000,\nand on the 9th April 'replied to Davidson's letter of the 19th March forwarding him the cheque for $5,066.16, returning the cheque and saying:\nI don't need the money now as I have to pay interest on the money which I borrowed when the deal was made anyway, and this money would only be idle here.\nOn 23rd April, Davidson again wrote Norstrant formally notifying him that he accepted the offer contained in the agreement of December 8th and was\nprepared to pay him forthwith the $5,000 and interest and the other amounts specified\nfor the purchase of the undivided half share of the lands and enclosing marked cheque for $5,100.91, being the $5,000 with interest from Dec. 4th, 1917, In this letter he also asks for an accounting of any of the lands Norstrant has sold. On the 25th April, Norstrant replied simply returning the marked cheque, having in his previous letter stated why he did not want the money, and saying he \"would be in at your meeting the first of the month.\"\nOther correspondence followed but not the faintest hint was given by Norstrant at any time or in any letter or otherwise that he repudiated the agreement or claimed it was not binding on him because of the non-payment of the $100 at the time of the signing of the agreement.\nI repeat that the proper conclusion, and I think, the only proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence, conduct and correspondence of the parties is that they mutually had agreed at the time the agreement was signed, it was not to become operative or effective unless and until Davidson had obtained the consent of the necessary parties to his entering into it.\nIn this view of the case, the non-payment of the $100 on the date of the signing of the agreement, 5th Dec, 1917, was not imperative or necessary. The \"transaction was not closed\" and was agreed not to be closed, nor was the agreement to become operative, unless and until such consent was obtained. When it was obtained, there was no unreasonable or undue delay on Davidson's part in notifying Norstrant or in tendering to him the necessary money stipulated by the agreement, including the down payment of $100 and interest.\nUnder these circumstances and for these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appeal Court and restore the judgment of the trial judge, with the substitution of an accounting for the reference to assess damages. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant sues upon an option agreement under seal whereby the respondent agreed to give appellant the opportunity of bearing half the burden and reaping half the profits to be derived from a contract he, the respondent, was entering into for the purchase of five sections of land in Alberta.\nThe total price on the basis fixed of $27.00 an acre, amounted to $86,400, of which $10,000 had to be paid in cash. The respondent was almost appalled at the magnitude of the undertaking and the appellant, on behalf of his employers, was endeavouring to induce him to make the purchase, when respondent asked him if he would join him in the undertaking.\nThe appellant in answer properly said he could not do so without the express assent of his employers, who were in Minneapolis, and he would not be able to explain to them fully, without a personal interview, all that might bear on such a question, for which he could not hope till visiting Minneapolis in the early spring.\nTo overcome that these parties hereto agreed that the respondent should give the appellant an option until the 1st of May following, to become a partner in the purchase by paying the respondent meantime the half of the cash payment and assuming in all other respects the burdens, direct and incidental to the carrying out of the contract.\nA Calgary solicitor drew up for them a long written agreement, providing for everything that might be likely to arise in the carrying out of such a contract.\nThat was dated 8th of December, 1917, and made between said parties, and began by witnessing that\nin consideration of the sum of $100, one hundred dollars, of lawful money of Canada now paid by the purchaser to the vendor, receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, the vendor covenants and agrees to and with the purchaser to sell and assign to the purchaser on or before the 1st day of May, 1918, one undivided one-half share or interest in sections fourteen (14), fifteen (15), nine (9) , ten (10) and eleven (11), in township twenty-eight (28), in range twenty-eight (28), west of the fourth meridian, in the province of Alberta, subject to the covenants and conditions contained in the agreement of sale thereof from the Calgary Colonization Company, Limited, to the vendor, for the price or sum of five thousand $5,000 dollars, on which shall be credited the sum of one hundred ($100) dollars, with interest at six (6%) per cent per annum from December 4th, 1917, and an undivided one-half (\u00bd) share or interest in all necessary equipment purchased by the vendor for the operation of the said farm prior to the first day of May, 1918, for the price or sum equivalent to one-half (\u00bd) of the actual cash paid for or on account of same by the vendor, subject to the payment of any unpaid purchase money remaining against the same, together with a sum equivalent to one-half the cash paid by the vendor prior to the said first of May, 1918, in the cultivation of the said lands together also, with one half-of the actual cash cost of any necessary buildings which may be erected by the vendor on the said lands prior to the said date.\nThe remainder of the contract provided for numerous details, needless to repeat as not now in dispute.\nThe parties executed this agreement under their hands and seals. The respondent then proceeded to complete the original proposed purchase agreement and paid $10,000.\nThe hundred dollars was never in fact paid or afterwards referred to until the appellant tendered the $5,000 in March, and repeated it in April following, in more formal terms.\nThe appellant had gone, as expected, to Minneapolis in March, and wrote after his return from there on 14th March, 1918, to respondent as follows:\u2014\nMarch 14th, 1918.\nJames Norstrant, Esq.,\nRockyford, Alberta.\nDear Jimmie:\u2014\nI returned a week ago from the States, and consulted with Mr. Beiseker and Mr. Smith of the estate, and they are quite agreeable to the contract which I made with you in regard to the purchase of half interest in the five sections. Please inform me whether you desire me to send you my check for $5,000 to Rockyford, or shall I place it to your credit in some bank in Calgary.\nIf you are not coming in to Calgary again within a week or so, wish you would let me know some day that I could meet you at Rockyford, and I will run out to see you.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) James W. Davidson.\nGetting no reply he wrote him again on 19th March, enclosing his cheque for $5,066.16, to cover the $5,000 and interest at 7%.\nOn 23rd March, 1918, respondent wrote saying as follows:\u2014\nRockyford, Alberta.\nMr. J. W. Davidson,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Mr. Davidson:\u2014\nReceived your letter of March 14th. This letter must have been mislaid somewhere, and then the roads have been so very bad, our teams have not been to town this last week.\nI have plenty of cash on hand. I made arrangement at Drumheller, to get ten thousand dollars.\nMr. Davidson, if you could let me know about a week ahead and I will meet you at Rockyford, or I expect to be in the 29th March for the bull sale, if that will be satisfactory to you. Kindly let me know.\nYours truly,\nJ. G. Norstrant.\nAnd on the 9th April he wrote as follows:\u2014\nRockyford, Alberta,\nApril 9th, 1918.\nMr. J. W. Davidson,\nCalgary, Alta;\nDear Mr. Davidson:\u2014\nEnclosed find your cheque for $5,066.16 which I am returning. I don't need the money now as I have to pay interest on the money which I borrowed when the deal was made anyway, and this money would only be idle here.\nAm very busy getting at the seeding now. Will try and get in to see you as soon as I can find a few days to spare.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) J. G. Norstrant. Respondent not having appeared as promised, appellant wrote, enclosing a marked cheque for $5,100.71, explaining at length what it was for and desiring information on the subject of what had been done relative to the land, and to this the respondent replied as follows:\u2014\nRockyford, Alta., April 25th, 1918\nMr. Jas. W. Davidson,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nEnclosed find your cheque which you left with me yesterday. I will be in at your meeting the first of the month.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) J. G. Norstrant.\nThe appellant wrote on 30th of April, 1918, a long letter recounting the history of their dealing and also returning the cheque.\nIn my view of this case this correspondence, apart from being evidence of the tender or waiver thereof, is only of importance in regard to an aspect of the case which I will refer to presently.\nNo dispute arises here or below, so far as I can see, as to the tender.\nThe learned trial judge gave judgment for the appellant after having heard both him and respondent as to such collateral or subsidiary facts as were relevant or irrelevant.\nThe Appellate Division, by a majority, reversed that judgment, the Chief Justice dissenting and upholding the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThe majority of the court seem to hold, notwithstanding the contract being under seal, that unless and until the hundred dollars named therein as consideration had been paid, the contract was void. I wholly dissent, with great respect, from such view of the law. I agree that a unilateral offer of an option without consideration can be revoked at any time, unless under seal as this contract was.\nI am of the opinion that if the offer is made under seal and not accepted it may be withdrawn within a reasonable time and that the measure of such time might under certain circumstances be very brief indeed.\nI am further of opinion that, if there is no other consideration than mutual promises, an agreement for an option without seal may be enforceable.\nSuch promissory consideration may be in shape of a promissory note, or a promise to give one, or something else of value. And when the contract for an option, as here, is under seal and purports to bind for a specific time, assented to by the covenantee, it binds without the payment of any consideration.\nAnd the binding effect thereof cannot be affected by any mere omission to pay what is named as the consideration which has been declared to have been received, unless and until the offerer has demanded from him bound to pay such consideration, and been refused.\nNone of the said several propositions of law for the most part need, I respectfully submit, any citation of authority to support them or any of them.\nThe distinction between the efficacy of contracts under seal and those not, so far as consideration therefor is concerned, still stands good, I think.\nThe man contracting under seal to give an option to the other party thereto, and stipulating for a consideration named, is entitled to have it paid, but even if it is not paid, it stands as a debt due and, by oral evidence, can be so shown despite the acknowledgment of its receipt. That debt, or price of consideration, remaining due and owing by virtue of the bargain attested by such debtor executing the contract, is sufficient consideration even if he owing it never accepts the option.\nThat alone would uphold the validity of the contract even if a mere simple contract not under seal so far as the elements of need of consideration for such like contract is concerned. How can its being made under seal render it less?\nThere is presented in argument here, as has been elsewhere, what, if I may be permitted to say so with respect, seems to me a mere metaphysical train of thought, which suggests its payment is a condition precedent, inherent in the contract so framed, to render its becoming at all operative. Where is that condition precedent to be found? It certainly is not expressed. And I repeat it never has been successfully invoked in the case of a simple contract.\nI have not found in the numerous English and Canadian and other authorities cited, anything to support such a proposition. I find in the judgment of Cowen J. in the case of McCrea v. Purmort[2], at foot of p. 113 and top of p. 114, two sentences which express more neatly than I have seen elsewhere what is my own view of the relevant law on the subject, as follows:\u2014\nLooking at the strong and overwhelming balance of authority, as collectable from the decisions of the American courts, the clause in question, even as between the immediate parties, comes down to the rank of prima facie evidence, except for the purpose of giving effect to the operative words of the conveyance. To that end, and that alone, is it conclusive.\nIf the case presented were a mere simple contract expressed to be in consideration of the promise to pay one hundred dollars it would be prima facie binding. And if the acknowledgment of its receipt were therein expressed that could not be held to be in anyway destructive of the vitality of the contract.\nIt might well be that if and when payment had been demanded and refused such refusal would end the force of the contract.\nSuch being, as I take it, the condition of things under a simple contract, I repeat, how is it changed by adding a seal? It seems, I respectfully submit, a confusion of thought which should not have existed if the common use of such a form of expression had been borne in mind.\nI respectfully submit that this alleged implication of a condition has no foundation in law to rest upon in any aspect of the case.\nAnd the citation in support of respondent's case, of decisions such as Dickinson v. Dodds[3], or Davis v. Shaw[4], in which respectively an unaccepted offer of an option for which there was no consideration was properly held null or revocable at will, does not help to commend the curious theory of an implied condition precedent in a case where the offerer is bound both by his seal and the acceptance of a promised consideration which he never demanded before his breach of contract. Had he done so and been refused payment, I should have held him released.\nIn truth there is no English or Canadian authority, or American either when correctly interpreted, directly supporting such a proposition of an implied condition precedent, as claimed herein.\nOn the contrary we have the dictum I quote above from the judgment in the McCrea Case[5] neatly expressing the law, as I view it, applicable to this case. The case of Cushing v. Knight[6] has in it the element of demand and refusal, on unjustifiable grounds, of payment. Then we have the insurance cases, beginning with Xenos v. Wickham[7], followed by numerous English decisions as well as many American cases which in principle seem to refute this theory of an implied condition precedent as operative, unless and until payment of the consideration.\nOf the latter numerous cases, Basch v. The Humboldt Mutual Fire and Marine Ins. Co.[8], is typical.\nThe decision in Morgan v. Pike[9], holding that the covenantee was entitled to recover on a deed although obviously the consideration therefor was his covenant in same deed, which he had never executed, seems to cover the whole ground.\nAnd when we come to the actual facts surrounding the contract and the conduct of the parties in relation thereto, so fully illuminated by the correspondence above quoted, there seems not the slightest ground for reliance upon such a theory, and, if it ever had a possible existence, seems to have been clearly waived.\nI would therefore, allow the appeal with costs. I agree, however, with Mr. Justice Beck's suggestion that a judgment for an account would be much more appropriate than an assessment for damages, for this is an action for the sale of a share in the contract. If the parties, or either of them, desire such an amendment it should be granted as the judgment the court should have given.\nDUFF J. (DISSENTING).\u2014I am unable to perceive any difficulty in the point of construction which was the principal point argued and the principal point discussed in the court below. The contract of the 8th Dec, 1917, professes to create an option, to vest an option in the appellant and it is a long settled rule that in the exercise of an option for the purchase of land the terms as to time of payment and otherwise of the contract under which it is created must in all respects be strictly pursued. Master v. Willoughby[10]; Brooke v. Garrod[11].\nIn the contract now before us it is, I think, quite clear that the sum mentioned, $100, as the consideration for the option is a sum the payment of which is one of the essential conditions of the constitution of the option, one of the facts which the plaintiff, relying upon the existence of the option, must establish in the absence of circumstances dispensing with the performance of the condition. It is not necessary to consider the effect of Gushing v. Knight[12]. I see no reason to depart from the view I expressed there or indeed to reconsider the subject, but the arguments in favour of the view that the sum nominated to be paid upon the execution of the instrument is a condition of the constitution of the vendor's obligation are much stronger here than in that case by reason of the circumstance that the instrument we are here dealing with is a unilateral instrument, and I repeat, I can entertain no doubt that the payment of the sum mentioned is, by the terms of the instrument, a condition precedent upon the performance of which at the time specified any right of the appellant derived from the instrument alone must rest. I can only add that I am unable to agree with the suggestion that the consideration named can be treated as a merely nominal consideration. The question which occupied much attention on the argument\u2014it now proves not to be open as I shall explain presently\u2014is one which does not appear to have been considered in the courts below, and it is this: Has the conduct of the parties been such as to preclude the respondent from relying upon the non-fulfilment of the condition precedent, the point upon which he succeeded in the Appellate Division?\nThe appellant's contention is twofold: 1st, it is said, the whole of the consideration of the purchase, the sum of $5,000 with interest from the date of the agreement was paid by the appellant and accepted by the respondent and this I shall consider after discussing the second branch of the argument; 2nd, it is said the respondent by his conduct waived the stipulation of the contract requiring the immediate payment of $100 as a condition of the option. It should be noticed that the payment is not a condition of the instrument going into effect; the instrument was unquestionably validly executed and went into effect as a deed but the payment was a condition named in the deed upon the performance of which the appellant's rights under the deed are based. It seems quite clear that the option if validly created would vest in the optionee an interest in land. The decision of the Court of Appeal in London and South-western Railway Co. v. Gomm[13], seems to be conclusive. Each one of the three judges, Sir George Jessel, Sir James Hannen, and Lindley L.J. explicitly hold that the grant of an option has the effect of creating an interest in land and these opinions are not mere dicta; they are the foundation of a distinct ground upon which the judgment of the court was based. It has often been held that where the judgment of a court is based on two distinct grounds it is not competent to another court bound by that decision to disregard one of them as being unnecessary to the decision.\nTrue, the interest of the optionee is not the same as that of a purchaser but it is real and substantial and is not revocable and here I must take leave to dissent from the observation made by the learned trial judge in the course of the proceedings to the effect that the giver of the option might lawfully disregard it and pay damages. An option given for valuable consideration is not revocable. Bruner v. Moore[14]; Manchester Ship Canal Co. v. Manchester Racecourse Co.[15]. And in South Wales Miners Federation v. Glamorgan Coal Co.[16], Lord Lindley points out that to break a contract it is an unlawful act and that in point of law a party to the contract is not entitled to break it on offering to pay damages. Any attempt on the part of the grantor to withdraw the option would be disregarded by a court administering equitable principles.\nSince the option, if validly constituted, vested in the optionee an interest in land the contract embodied in the instrument under discussion was a contract within the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds; and it is, I think, settled law that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant could at law avail himself of a parol agreement to vary or enlarge the time for performing a \"contract previously entered into in writing\" and required so to be by the Statute of Frauds; and moreover that in equity when a contract falling within the Statute of Frauds is once made no conduct or verbal waiver can be relied upon to substitute a different agreement from the one appearing in the contract itself unless the case can be brought within the equitable principles on the subject of part performance. Stowell v. Robinson[17]; Morris v. Baron[18]. It does not at all follow that one of the parties to the contract may not estop himself by his conduct or by his conduct put himself in a position in which he is precluded from denying that the other party has observed in a particular case the time or manner designated by the contract for the performance of one of its stipulations. Hartley v. Hymans[19].\nWhere one party to a contract is under an obligation to pay the other is under a correlative and concurrent obligation to accept and if the party in whom the obligation inheres prevents the performance of it by failure to observe his own concurrent obligation or otherwise by any wrongful act, he will not be allowed to take advantage of the non-performance of the first party; and this principle is comprehensive enough to prevent any person on whom the incidence of the contractual obligation falls justifying or excusing his default in performance of it by setting up the promisee's non-performance of a condition precedent where the promisee's non-performance is due to the conduct of the promisor which makes it unjust or inequitable that the promisor should rely upon such non-performance. Mackay v. Dick[20]. These principles have been applied in a series of cases relating to contracts for the sale of goods where at the request of the buyer or seller there has been a forbearance to deliver at the time named for delivery in the contract. Where the postponement of delivery took place at the request of the buyer made before the date fixed for delivery, it was held in Hickman v. Haynes[21], that the buyer was estopped from averring that the seller was not in truth ready and willing to deliver on the contract date. (Page 607). And the principle of the decisions which are summed up in the judgment of Lindley L. J. in the case just mentioned was stated in the judgment of Brett J. in Plevins v. Downing[22], in these words:\u2014\nIt is true that a distinction has been pointed out and recognized between an alteration of the original contract in such cases, and an arrangement as to the mode of performing it. If the parties have attempted to do the first by words only, the court cannot give effect, in favour of either, to such attempt, if the parties make an arrangement as to the second, though such arrangement be made only by words, it can be enforced. The question is what is the test in such an action as the present, whether the case is within the one rule or the other.\nWhere the vendor, being ready to deliver within the agreed time, is shown to have withheld his offer to deliver till after the agreed time in consequence of a request to him to do so made by the vendee before the expiration of the agreed time, and where after the expiration of the agreed time, and within a reasonable time, the vendor proposes to deliver and the vendee 'refuses to accept, the vendor can recover damages. He can properly aver and prove that he was ready and willing to deliver according to the terms of the original contract. He shows that he was so, but that he did not offer to deliver within the agreed time because he was within such time requested by the vendee not to do so. In such a case it is said that the original contract is not altered, and that the arrangement has reference only to the mode of performing it. But, if the alteration of the period of delivery were made at the request of the vendor, though such request were made during the agreed period for delivery, so that the vendor would be obliged, if he sued for non-acceptance of an offer to deliver after the agreed period, to rely upon the assent of the vendee to his request, he could not aver and prove that he was ready and willing to deliver according to the terms of the original contract. The statement shows that he was not. He would be driven to rely on the assent of the vendee to the substituted time of delivery, that is to say, to an altered contract or a new contract. This he cannot do so as to enforce his claim. This seems to be the result of the cases which are summed up in Hickman v. Haynes(1). There appears, it is true, to be some point in the criticism upon this judgment made in a note at pp. 690-1 of the last edition of Benjamin on Sales, to the effect that the distinction drawn by Brett J. between a postponement at the request of the plaintiff and a postponement at the request of the defendant is not consistent with the decision in the Tyers case[23], and that the view of Blackburn J. expressed arguendo in that case gives the true rule, namely, that a postponement of delivery by a seller in consequence of the assent of the buyer to his request stands in the same position as a postponement at the request of the buyer. In neither case, it is suggested, does the plaintiff rely upon a binding contract to postpone delivery but upon a voluntary forbearance brought about by the conduct of the other party and in either case, it is suggested, the plaintiff, if in truth he would have performed the condition, had he not been induced to refrain from doing so by the conduct of the other party, is in a position to aver and prove his readiness and willingness to perform it.\nThis criticism, it will be observed, really leaves untouched the principle stated in the judgment of Brett J.; it is rather directed to his concrete application of it by which it may at least be plausibly contended the scope of the principle is not adequately recognized.\nThe principle upon which courts of equity have acted is stated by Lord Cairns in Hughes v. Metropolitan Rly. Co.[24], in a passage applied by Farwell J. in Bruner v. Moore[25], to the effect that stipulations as to time in a contract constituting an option may be waived by conduct having the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced \"where to enforce them would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have * * * taken place between the parties.\"\nI am discussing, it will be observed, the waiver of conditions precedent. As regards waiver of conditions subsequent somewhat different considerations apply, in the majority of cases at all events, as usually the right affected by the condition is made defeasible at the option of the party entitled to enforce the condition. In such cases the right continues to subsist until the party has declared his election to avoid it which he may of course do by unilateral act, the matter being entirely in his own hands. In dealing with conditions precedent where the act designated is one of the things which enter into the constitution of the right the existence of which is in dispute and consequently if the act is not performed no right arises under the strict terms of the contract, obviously something more than a declaration of intention either by words or by conduct is required to fill the gap. Obviously also the gap is filled if the party entitled to enforce the condition is either estopped by law or on equitable principles precluded from disputing that the other party has done everything required to be done on his part; and there seems to be no reason in principle why the estoppel or the corresponding equitable claim should not be rested upon facts or upon conduct subsequent to the time fixed for the performance of the condition. As Lord Chelmsford said in Roberts v. Brett[26]:\u2014 I have no difficulty in saying that in such a case the party who may avail himself of the non-performance of the condition precedent but who allows the other side to go on and perform the subsequent stipulations has waived his right to insist upon the unperformed condition precedent as an answer to the action.\nBentsen v. Taylor[27]; Panoutsos v. Hadley Co.[28]; Hartley v. Hymans[29]; Leather Cloth Co. v. Hieronimus[30].\nAlways observing, however, that in those eases in which the Statute of Frauds comes into play the plaintiff must fail if in substance he is relying not upon the written agreement but upon a verbal agreement or an agreement by conduct substituted for the written agreement in whole or in part. Stowell v. Robinson[31]; Noble v. Ward[32]; Bruner v. Moore[33]; Corn Products Co. v. Fry[34]; Morris v. Baron[35]; and subject always, moreover, I repeat, to this, that the plaintiff has been put in a position by the conduct of the other party to aver that he was at the time designated (when the provision as to time is imperative) ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. With the plaintiff \"readiness and willingness\" where he is seeking to enforce an obligation in which he is involved concurrently with the defendant is always a condition precedent, and this is so even in a case in which if he had been the defendant he might have succeeded in resisting the claim against him on the ground that he was absolved from performance by the conduct of the other party.\nWhichever party is the actor\nsaid Lord Halsbury in Forrestt v. Aramayo [36] and is complaining of a breach of contract he is bound to show, as a matter of law, that he has performed all that was incident to his part of the concurrent obligations. The averment that he was always ready and willing to perform his obligation is a necessary averment.\nHickman v. Haynes[37]; Plevins v. Downing[38]; Hartley v. Hymans[39].\nApplying these principles to the circumstances disclosed in the present appeal I should be disposed, as I intimated more than once in the course of the argument, to think that a vendor and purchaser accustomed to deal with one another and on such a footing as the parties to this appeal were having executed an instrument such as that before us and having separated without a word being said as to the payment of the consideration for the option, the sum being comparatively trifling, there was sufficient prima facie evidence of a request for forbearance and compliance with that request to constitute an estoppel within the meaning of the cases discussed in Hickman v. Haynes37. One circumstance, however, deprives this view of relevancy; the evidence shows quite plainly that the appellant's attention was not drawn to the circumstance that this sum of $100 was to be paid on the execution of the instrument and points rather directly to a similar conclusion as touching the respondent's state of mind. The appellant who never thought of the condition precedent as he states himself, cannot, of course, be heard to say that his default was due to anything done by the respondent who, as far as one can see, was in the same state of inattention as himself. Not only does he not aver readiness and willingness; such an averment if made would be conclusively negatived by his own evidence. The subsequent conduct of the parties gives no additional support to the appellant's contention on this point and indeed a perusal of the case makes it quite clear that neither estoppel nor the corresponding equitable principle is a ground of claim which the appellant is entitled to rely upon in this court. There is no suggestion of it in the pleadings, it was not touched upon by either the trial judge or the judges of the Appellate Division, it was barely mentioned in the appellant's factum and the cross-examination which at first sight might seem to have been directed to it appears on a closer examination to have been aimed at the respondent's plea of mistake on his part and overreaching on part of the appellant.\nAs to the contention that the purchase price was accepted by the respondent the correspondence establishes that the respondent had no intention of accepting the appellant's cheque and there was nothing in the respondent's conduct calculated to convey to the mind of the appellant the idea that such was his intention. I concur with the comment of Stuart J. as regards the appellant's knowledge of the sales made by the respondent. I do not doubt that the appellant was aware of these sales when he wrote the letter of the 19th, March. In making the sales the respondent had committed himself to a series of contracts involving a repudiation of any obligation to sell to the appellant; Manchester Ship Canal Co. v. Manchester Racecourse Co.[40], and Metropolitan Electric Supply Co. v. Ginder[41]; he was asserting openly (and there is no doubt with the knowledge of the appellant acquired anterior to any offer of payment) his right to deal with the property as owner; and I can find in the appellant's conduct thencefor- ward only a persistent though unsuccessful effort to coax or trick the respondent into a position in which he could aver that his cheque had been accepted. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014A defence of misrepresentation having failed at the trial, the only question now before us is the effect on the rights of the parties of the nonpayment by Davidson at the time the agreement sued upon was executed of the sum of $100, receipt whereof is thereby acknowledged as the consideration for the vendor's covenant to sell.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Alberta in his analysis of the opinions delivered in this court in Cushing v. Knight[42], so much relied on for the respondent, has, I think, satisfactorily distinguished that decision from the case at bar. Yet, if the question now presented were merely one of interpretation of the written agreement, while an implied promise by the respondent to pay the sum of $100 to the appellant as the consideration for which the latter undertook to keep his offer of sale open from the 8th December, 1917, to the 1st of May, 1918, may be found in it, I should think it also clear, that actual payment of that sum was thereby made a condition precedent to the instrument becoming effective as an option. Nor do I find in the terms in which it is couched any latent ambiguity in this respect such as might justify resort to evidence of conduct or negotiations to aid in construction.\nI cannot assent to the contention that the facts that the agreement is under seal, and that it contains a recital of the payment of the sum of $100 are conclusive in the appellant's favour. Neither can I regard that sum as merely a nominal consideration. But as Baron Bramwell said in White v. Beeton [43]\nthat which was at one time a condition precedent (may) by my own conduct become no condition precedent. * * The performance of an act may be at one time a condition precedent and not at another.\nThe reasonable inference from the circumstances immediately following the execution of the agreement and the subsequent letters of the respondent\u2014unless we are to attribute to him bad faith in writing them amounting almost to dishonesty\u2014seems to be that, without relinquishing his right to insist upon actual prepayment of the $100 he voluntarily forbore doing so and made it apparent that he was satisfied to rely upon the undertaking or liability of the appellant to pay that sum either as part of the $5,000 payable on the 1st of May or before the time for making that payment should expire. Parol evidence of the facts warranting this inference is admissible since it does not amount to such a variation of the terms of the contract that verbal proof of it would offend against either the rule in regard to contracts reduced to writing or the Statute of Frauds. It does not involve the substitution of a promise to pay for actual payment as the consideration. Such a case would present great difficulty. Vezey v. Rashleigh[44]. It is merely a withholding by the respondent of the exercise of his right to insist upon the performance at the date thereby fixed of a promise to pay stipulated in the written contract, Tyers v. Rosedale & Ferryhill Iron Co. per Martin B.[45]\u2014a substituted mode of performance assented to without release of the original obligation; Leather Cloth Co. v. Hieronimus [46] ; Plevins v. Downing[47]. The principle taken from Lord Cairns' ju.dgm.ent in Hughes v. Metropolitan Rly. Co.[48], as applied in Bruner v. Moore[49], may perhaps also be invoked. That the appellant assumed liability to pay the $100 is, I think, sufficiently evidenced by his execution of the agreement which would otherwise seem to have been purposeless. I incline to the view that there was a binding option, if not from the execution of the instrument, from the 14th of March, or, at all events, from the date of the tender in April.\nIn any event, however, the document of the 8th December, 1917, may, in my opinion, be regarded as an offer to sell a one-half interest in the lands in question upon the terms therein stated. There was never any express revocation of that offer and nothing had transpired that would imply a revocation before the appellant intimated his intention to accept and tendered the amount which would be due to the respondent on the 1st of May, including the $100 and interest thereon.\nResale of the land was contemplated by the parties. Resale at a profit was the chief object of the venture. The sales made by Norstrant did not imply a revocation of his offer to sell to Davidson an undivided one-half interest in his purchase from the Calgary Colonization Company. Knowledge of those sales by Davidson, therefore, would not amount to notice of revocation of that offer such as would preclude an effective acceptance of it. Moreover Davidson was in fact unaware of Norstrant's sales when he sent the letter of the 14th of March, 1918, intimating his intention to carry out the agreement. No other act of revocation is suggested. Davidson might have some recourse in damages against Norstrant if he exceeded his authority and his sales were unsatisfactory. But he can in any event hold Norstrant accountable for his share of their proceeds.\nAssuming in favour of Norstrant that the prepayment of the sum of $100 remained a condition precedent to the document becoming binding as an option and, that it was therefore open to him at any time before acceptance of the offer to sell to have withdrawn it, communication of such a withdrawal to the appellant was necessary in order to terminate his right of acceptance and preclude him by exercising it from converting the offer into a firm contract of sale.\nWhile the delay in Davidson's acceptance might, apart from the special circumstances, have been so unreasonable as to render it inefficacious, the evidence here shows that such delay as was required to enable the appellant at his convenience in the early spring to interview the members of the firm of Beiseker and Davidson at Minneapolis was contemplated and provided for. Davidson communicated the result of that interview to the respondent by his letter of the 14th March, written promptly on his return from the trip on which it took place, and informed him of his intention to take up the option and become the purchaser of a one-half interest in the lands. He formally accepted Norstrant's offer and tendered all the money due on the 1st of May by his letter of the 23rd of April, receipt of which in due course has been proved.\nI would, for these reasons, with great respect, allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge, substituting however for the reference to assess damages directed by him an order for an accounting as indicated by Mr. Justice Beck. MIGNAULT J. (DISSENTING).\u2014That this case presents some features of considerable difficulty is shewn by the division of opinion in the courts below. And the respondent, who lost in the first court but succeeded in the Appellate Division, the learned Chief Justice of Alberta dissenting, relies on legal principles of an elementary character, the great difficulty not being as to * the principles themselves but rather on the question whether a proper case has been made out for their application.\nThe agreement signed by the parties on the 8th December, 1917, gave rise to this litigation. This agreement, in so far as is material to the present controversy, states that in consideration of the sum of $100 \"now\" paid by the appellant to the respondent, the receipt of which is acknowledged, the respondent agrees with the appellant to sell and assign to him, on or before the 1st of May, 1918, one undivided half share or interest in certain farm land which the respondent purchased on the same day from the Calgary Colonization Company, subject to the covenants and conditions contained in the agreement of sale from the latter company to the respondent, for the price of $5,000 on which was to be credited the said sum of $100 with interest at 6% per annum from December 4th, 1917, and an undivided one-half share or interest in all necessary equipment purchased by the respondent for the operation of the farm prior to May 1st, 1918, for a price equivalent to one-half of the actual cash paid for the same by the respondent, subject to the payment of any unpaid purchase money remaining against the same, together with a sum equivalent to one-half the cash paid by the respondent prior to May 1st, 1918, in the cultivation of the said lands, together also with one-half the actual cash cost of any necessary buildings erected by the respondent on the said lands prior to the above date. In the event of the appellant availing himself of the respondent's agreement, certain stipulations were made as to the farming operations to be carried on by the respondent which are not material to the present inquiry. The document witnessing the contract was made under seal and was signed by both parties.\nAlthough by this instrument the respondent acknowledged receipt of $100 stated to be the consideration of the agreement, it is common ground that this sum was not paid nor was it ever demanded by the respondent. The reason the appellant desired to obtain an agreement in this form, was that one Davidson, then deceased, and one of whose executors the appellant was, had had an equitable interest in the property, and the appellant very properly did not wish to enter into the venture before consulting his co-executors, which he expected would require some time. He went to Minneapolis with this object in view, and after his return he wrote, on March 14th, 1918, to the respondent informing him that he had obtained the consent of his co-executors and asking the respondent if he desired that he should send him a cheque to Rockyford or place the money to his credit in a bank in Calgary. On March 19th, the appellant sent the respondent his cheque for $5,066.16, being the half of the cash payment made by the latter to the Calgary Colonization Company with interest at 7 per cent from January 10th. The respondent answered on March 23rd, acknowledging receipt of the letter of March 14th, stating however that he had plenty of cash on hand. On April 19th, the respondent wrote to the appellant returning the cheque for $5,066.16 saying that he did not need the money then as he had to pay interest on the money which he had borrowed when the deed was made, and the appellant's money would only be idle in his hands. The appellant wrote again, on April 23rd, insisting on the respondent's acceptance of the half of the cash payment made by him, notifying him that he accepted the offer contained in the agreement of December 8th, and enclosing a marked cheque for $5,100.71, being the $5,000 with interest from December 4th. This cheque the respondent returned without assigning any reason on April 25th.\nWhen this action was taken by the appellant, the respondent contested it, denying the tender of $5,100.71 and any notification of acceptance by the appellant of the offer contained in the agreement of December 8th. It was only at the trial that the respondent amended his statement of defence by setting up total failure of the consideration mentioned in the agreement.\nIt is on this plea of failure of consideration that the Appellate Division dismissed the appellant's action.\nReliance was placed in the Appellate Division on the decision of this court in Cushing v. Knight[50], but it seems to me that the fact that in that case a demand was made for the money consideration, which had not been paid although its receipt was acknowledged in the agreement, with notification that if it were not paid within four days, the contract would be treated as rescinded,\u2014sufficiently distinguishes Cushing v. Knight50 from the present case where no such demand was made.\nSome discussion took place at bar and in the courts below on the question whether the $100 mentioned as consideration could be regarded as a purely nominal consideration, the more so as the agreement was under seal and therefore, it was contended, would stand without consideration. Independently of the question whether the sealing of the agreement rendered it enforceable without consideration, I have not been able to satisfy myself that failure of consideration, where a valuable consideration is requisite for the existence of a contract, can be met by saying that the consideration mentioned in the contract is a merely nominal one and can therefore be disregarded. For this would be equivalent to holding that although consideration is required, no consideration at all is necessary. In other words, if this contention is sound, where the parties mention a merely nominal consideration, instead of a substantial one, the contract would stand without payment of this consideration, and, if so, it would be valid without any consideration. If the sum mentioned as consideration be so insignificant that it can be disregarded, then there is no consideration whatever. I may add that even were it open to the appellant to urge that a nominal consideration can be disregarded, here the sum of $100 appears sufficiently substantial, the more so as it was to be credited on the purchase price, to prevent us from holding that it was in any way purely nominal.\nNor is it any answer to say that the agreement being under seal no consideration at all is necessary, for the agreement itself states that it was entered into in consideration of the then and there payment of $100, and if this sum was not paid, the sealing of the agreement would not protect it from the total failure of the consideration it expressly mentions.\nComing now to the objection that the sum of $100 was not paid and therefore that the agreement sued on is void for want of consideration, I think it must be conceded, on the construction of the agreement, that the payment of this sum was a condition precedent to the existence of any contract of option between the parties. It is said that the respondent waived this stipulation as to the mode or time of performance, but I have been unable to find any evidence of such waiver. It is true that when the appellant sought to tender the sum which had to be paid before May 1st, the respondent alleged that he was not then in need of money to carry out his purchase from the Calgary Colonization company. But while the respondent may have thought that he was bound by the agreement, still the fact remains that he could not be bound unless the money consideration mentioned in the deed was paid. I cannot see my way to find in the agreement both an option contract conditioned on the prepayment of the consideration and, if the consideration failed, an offer open to acceptance so long as it was not withdrawn. The agreement is either an option contract binding on the respondent from its date, or it is no contract at all, certainly not a mere offer which the appellant could accept before May 1st, 1918, provided the offer had not been withdrawn before that date. The intention clearly was that the respondent should be bound until the first of May to sell a half share of the property to the appellant, if he accepted the option, but the respondent could not be so bound unless the money consideration mentioned in the deed was paid, for the granting of the option to purchase was based on this payment. The answers made by the respondent to the appellant's letter are consistent with the fact, which I think probable, that, not having, as he swore, a copy of the agreement; he was unaware of the existence of the clause requiring the pre-payment of the $100, and the appellant himself says that he read over the contract without noticing this clause. But then if the respondent was without such knowledge, it certainly cannot be said that he waived this stipulation. The position in fine appears to me to be this. The appellant sues on this agreement and must therefore shew that he fulfilled the condition subject to which it was entered into. This he has not done and he has consequently not made out a case entitling him to succeed.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 15 Alta.

CO. 1915, c. 39. The appellant bought a horse from one Dygert for $1,700, paid $300 cash and gave two notes of $700 each. Below each note was written an agreement providing that the property in the horse would not pass until the balance of the purchase price was paid; and stipulating that \"no holder of said notes by or to whom * * * said notes * * * have been discounted * * * shall be affected by the state of accounts between the subscriber and the promisee or by any equities existing between the subscriber and the promisee, but shall be deemed to be a holder in due course and for value of the notes held by him.\" Dygert indorsed the notes to the respondent bank for value. The horse died before the notes were paid and the sale was then avoided between the appellant and Dygert under \"The Sale of Goods Ordinance.\"\nHeld, that the respondent bank was entitled to recover on the notes from the appellant.\nPer Idington, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014Under the agreement, the respondent bank was a holder in due course, though it had notice of the contract between the appellant and Dygert.\nPer Idington, Duff and Mignault JJ\u2014These notes were severable from the agreement and constituted in law promissory notes.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1920] 3 W.W.R. 542) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Walsh J. at the trial[2] and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. L. Scott for the appellant.\nA. B. Hogg for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant signed what are in due form two ordinary promissory notes for $700 each That was followed on each of the same sheets of paper at the respective heads of which each of said promissory notes had been written and signed by appellant, by an agreement purporting to be made between said appellant and Dygert, the payee of each of the said promissory notes.\nEach of these agreements was signed by appellant but not by Dygert.\nEach of the same has indorsed on it an affidavit, purporting to have been sworn to by Dygert; first stating that he is the owner or bailor of the goods mentioned in the written agreement; that said copy of agreement is a true and correct copy of the agreement of which it purports to be a copy, and that\n3. The said agreement truly sets forth the agreement between myself and the said F. V. Killoran the parties thereto, and that the said agreement therein set forth is bona fide and not to protect the goods in question mentioned therein against the creditors of the buyer or bailee.\nThese promissory notes were indorsed to another party who re-indorsed to respondent who sued to recover same.\nThe learned trial judge treated each of these promissory notes, and what followed, as one document, and together as an ordinary lien note. He then applied or sought to apply sections 9 and 22 of the \"Sales of Goods Ordinance\" of Alberta thereto and found that the effect thereof, in the event of the death of the stallion, (which was the property agreed to be sold) and which event took place before payment of the said promissory notes, was that the obligation to pay ceased, and dismissed the action.\nIn the Appellate Division this judgment was reversed and judgment given for the respondent for the amount of the said promissory notes and interest with costs.\nAgainst that judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe said alleged promissory notes I must hold to be in law promissory notes, and the respective agreements following each, a merely collateral agreement which may or may not have some operative effect between the parties thereto, but cannot effect, even with notice thereof to the respondent taking them in due course, its rights to recover.\nIn each of these agreements was a clause designed to stop the appellant from denying that indorsees in due course could be otherwise than such.\nIn my view it is not necessary to follow up all the manifold views that may be taken of the curiously worded agreement.\nThe respondent was not a party thereto. There was no proof of failure of consideration, nor could there be under such very peculiar circumstances.\nThe whole contrivance of each of the said supplementary documents and all that followed each, may, if persisted in as a mode of doing business, lead to much litigation, and may result in disappointment to those using it when that has run its course, but for the present case all that has to be determined is that each of the documents first signed is a promissory note, to the suit upon which no effectual answer has been set up. Of the curiosities I have found in my search for what might be an answer, I may' refer to the cases cited in Byles on Bills, 17th ed., page 251. And of these the case of Salmon v. Webb[3], in its essential features, including the non-execution of the agreement by the promisee, alike to this, determines in principle how a mere collateral agreement may fail to operate against those holding in due course.\nI need not enlarge but may, in deference to the argument presented by counsel for appellant, say that I doubt if his contention for the narrow meaning he claimed for the phrase\nany equities existing between the subscriber and the promise\nused in the said agreements, so called, is tenable.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have no difficulty in concurring with the view of the Appellate Division that the instruments sued upon are promissory notes. In each case there is, it is true, on the same piece of paper one of these instruments and a collateral agreement, but the collateral agreement is no part of the instrument sued upon. By its express terms, indeed, it is not to qualify the absolute obligation of the promissor or to affect the contractual rights of the parties in such a way as to impair the negotiability of the note.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Assuming in the appellant's favour, but without so deciding, that although there is much in the terms of the documents to support the contrary view, the instruments sued upon were not promissory notes, the agreements in my opinion make it clear that the respondent, as a holder with whom the notes had been discounted, is entitled to all the rights which would have attached to its position were the instruments promissory notes of which it was the holder in due course. I cannot understand for what other purposes it was stipulated that\nno holder of said notes by or to whom * * * said notes * * * have been discounted * * * shall be affected by the state of accounts between the subscriber and the promisee or by any equities existing between the subscriber and the promisee, but shall be and shall be deemed to be a holder in due course and for value of the notes held by him.\nAs \"a holder in due course,\" the respondent is, in my opinion, entitled to recover, whatever mighty have been the rights of R. F. Dygert had the notes remained in his hands.\nOn this ground I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014Killoran agreed to purchase from a man named Dygert a horse for $1,700 on which he made a part payment of $300 and signed for the balance of the purchase price two instruments which I might, for the sake of this decision, call lien notes. There is a difference of opinion in the courts below as to whether these instruments should not be considered as promissory notes. But I do not feel obliged in view of the conclusion I have reached to decide this point.\nThese instruments stipulate that the property of the horse would not pass until the balance of the purchase price would be paid and they contain the following clause:\nThese notes * * * may be discontinued, pledged or hypothecated by the promisee and in every such case payment thereof is to be made to the holder of the notes instead of the promisee, and no holder of the said notes * * * shall be affected by * *. * any equities existing between the subscriber and the promisee, but shall be, and shall be deemed to be a holder in due course and for value of the notes held by him. Dygert indorsed these instruments and besides made a written assignment of them to the plaintiff who now sues Killoran, who signed them.\nKilloran contends that the sale of the horse has been avoided under the provisions of the \"Sale of Goods Ordinance Act,\" which declares, in section 9, that\nwhere there is an agreement to sell specific goods and subsequently the goods, without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer, perish before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided.\nUnless otherwise agreed the goods remain at the seller's risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer; but when the property therein is transferred to the buyer the goods are at the buyer's risk whether delivery has been made or not.\nIn the present case, the goods were delivered, but the property thereof remained with the vendor, they are at his risk and between the vendor and the purchaser the sale should be considered as avoided since the horse sold died before it became the absolute property of the purchaser. Res peril domino.\nBut as far as the transferee is concerned, the situation is different, in view of the provisions of the contract made by the appellant. The latter has agreed that the notes could be transferred and that the holder should be considered as a holder in due course in spite of the notice he might have of the contract between the vendor and purchaser. He contracted himself out of the right of resorting as against the assignee of the creditor to his equities against the creditor himself. (Leake on Contracts, 6th ed., page 865).\nThis holder should then be considered in the light of this agreement as if he were a holder in due course without notice under the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act. He can recover the payment thereof, though the sale of goods which has brought the signature of these instruments is avoided.\nI am of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I have duly considered all that Mr. Scott said in his very able argument for the appellant and in the memorandum which he has since filed. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the appeal cannot be sustained.\nThe promissory notes sued on, although printed on the same sheet of paper as the agreement for the sale of the stallion, are, I think, severable from this agreement, and constitute perfectly valid promissory notes which could be transferred, as was done here, by indorsement. Consequently even if the contract was terminated between the parties by the death of the stallion, the rights of the respondent as holder in due course of these notes are unaffected thereby.\nI also concur in the reasons for judgment of my brother Anglin, as a further ground for the dismissal of this appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 3 W.W.R. 542.\n[2] [1920] 3 W.W.R. 17.\n[3] [1852] 3 H.L.

Ville de Saint-Jean, (1921) 61 S.C.R. 535\nDate: 1921-02-01\nNarcisse Lord (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nLa Ville De Saint-Jean (Defendant) Respondent.\n1920: November 19; 1921: February 1.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Public road\u2014Sidewalk\u2014Prescription\u2014Dedication\u2014Servitude\u2014Art. 2193 C.C.\nOn an action en homage instituted by the appellant, the respondent claimed the ownership of a strip of land, used as a sidewalk in front of the appellant's property, by virtue of documentary title, by dedication and by prescription of thirty years. The appellant denied the existence of the documentary title and urged that the respondent's possession was not unequivocal, alleging that, during that possession, the steps leading into his house encroached on the side-walk, the cornices projected over it and the drain crossed the strip of land.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the corporation respondent is the owner of the strip of land.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The encroachments alleged by the appellant did not have the effect of vitiating the respondent's title.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014A municipal corporation can acquire a public way by prescription. Mignault J. dubitante.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The respondent became owner of the strip of land by way of dedication duly accepted.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The common law doctrine of dedication is not a part of the law of the province of Quebec.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Georges Fortin for the appellant.\nF. L. Be\u00efque K.C. and P.A. Chass\u00e9 K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The rule governing the acquisition of a public way by prescription is stated in Proudhon, Vol. 2, at p. 372, in the following words:\u2014\nConcluons donc que, quand un chemin qui sert de communication entre plusieurs lieux habit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 publiquement ouvert et librement pratique, c'est-\u00e0-dire paisiblement poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par l'\u00eatre moral et collectif que nous appelons le public, pendant plus de trente ans qui constituent aujourd'hui le terme extr\u00eame de notre prescription la plus longue, le droit en est acquis \u00e0 ceux qui se trouvent \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de s'en servir.\nPossession by the public in the manner described is essential. In my opinion the public user proved in this case had not the quality of exclusiveness necessary to enable one to describe it as \"possession.\"\nI have not been able to convince myself that the principle of dedication as understood in the common law is a part of the law of Quebec. It has rather been assumed to be so upon the authority of an observation in the judgment of Lord Fitzgerald in Chavigny de la Chevroti\u00e8re v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[1]. Rightly read that passage does not, in my judgment, suggest even that the English principle of dedication is a part of the law of Quebec. The object of the passage is to give a description of the character of the user necessary in prescription, the \"abandonment\" being referred to as one of the elements indicating the nature of the user; and as regards the character of the user required for the purpose of giving a title by prescription there is no difference between the law of England and Scotland and, of course, as his Lordship points out, the French law on that subject is the same. To construe the passage as laying down the rule that the principle of dedication is a part of the law of Quebec necessarily involves the result that one must ascribe to Lord Fitzgerald speaking for the Judicial Committee the dictum that as regards the principle of dedication the law of England and Scotland are the same. A dictum which would be opposed, as every one knows, to the fact.\nThere are no doubt dicta and perhaps even decisions of comparatively recent date by judges in Quebec which nominally, at all events, seem to involve a recognition of the common law doctrine of dedication. I have been unable to discover any principle of law upon which these dicta and decisions are based which applies in the province of Quebec. There is one fundamental distinction between the law of England and the law of France in respect of highways. By the law of England, the highway is regarded as a locus in which the public has a right of passage, the proprietorship of the fundus being prima facie vested in the adjoining owners. The existence of the public right could be established by prescription, that is by proving a public user from which it might be inferred that the public had enjoyed the right from time immemorial. Later the courts for the purpose of abridging the period resorted to an expedient analogous to the expedient adopted in the case of easements, properly so called, the presumption of a lost grant. Facts sufficient to lead to the inference that in fact the owner had devoted the property to the use of the public as a highway and that the public had acted upon and accepted the donation were held to be a sufficient foundation for the public right. But the public right acquired in this way could like the public right acquired by prescription be a right of user only. The proprietorship in the fundus could not pass to the public because the public in whom the right of passage was vested was a public consisting of all the King's subjects and such a fluctuating body could not, by the law of England, be the proprietor of a corporeal interest in land.\nIn the law of France there appears to be no such obstacle. 2 Proudhon, pp. 370-1. But I have looked in vain for any authority showing that French law ever recognized any principle by which the proprietor of land lost his title to it eo instante by the mere act of opening it to the public with the intention of enabling the public to have the enjoyment of it as a highway.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am not satisfied that the disposition by the provincial courts of the several objections to the regularity and sufficiency of the surveyors' report taken by the appellant was erroneous.\nOn the merits of the case it is quite clear that the respondent city has not a documentary title to the strip of land in dispute. Without determining the sufficiency of its alleged title by prescription. (I entertain some doubt as to the exclusiveness of the possession shewn) I am convinced, for the reasons assigned by my brother Mignault, that title in the city corporation by dedication has been established. Brodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de savoir qui, du demandeur ou de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse, est propri\u00e9taire du terrain sur lequel est sis le trottoir qui se trouve en face des lots 139 et 140 du cadastre de la ville de St. Jean.\nLa corporation d\u00e9fenderesse en r\u00e9clame la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par une possession imm\u00e9moriale qui remonte \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1868, puisque cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par son conseil municipal de remplacer le trottoir en pierre par un trottoir en bois. Ce nouveau trottoir avait sept pieds de large et \u00e9tait construit sur le cot\u00e9 nord de la rue appel\u00e9e la Place du March\u00e9 et rejoignait les b\u00e2tisses du demandeur.\nEn 1905, la corporation intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remplacer ce trottoir en bois par un trottoir en ciment d'une largeur un peu moindre que le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, en laissant cette fois un espace d'environ un pied entre le trottoir lui-m\u00eame et la maison du demandeur. Evidemment cette politique de la d\u00e9fenderesse ne plaisait pas au demandeur et il a protest\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse, le 17 ao\u00fbt 1905, d'avoir \u00e0 faire le trottoir de la m\u00eame largeur que l'ancien, sinon il r\u00e9clamerait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession absolue du terrain sur lequel serait situ\u00e9 le trottoir.\nLa ville ayant refus\u00e9 de se rendre \u00e0 cette sommation, la pr\u00e9sente action en bornage a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e. Des arpenteurs experts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour visiter le terrain en litige et entendre les t\u00e9moins; et ils ont fait rapport que la possession trentenaire r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la corporation \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a accept\u00e9 le rapport des experts: et, enfin, la Cour d'Appel a unanimement confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que la possession de la d\u00e9fenderesse intim\u00e9e est une possession \u00e9quivoque, promiscue et commune, et qu'elle ne peut alors servir de base \u00e0 la prescription acquisitive; et il se base sur l\u2019article 2193 du code civil qui dit\npour pouvoir prescrire au moyen de la possession il faut qu'elle soit continue et non interrompue, paisible, publique, non \u00e9quivoque et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire,\net il invoque \u00e0 cette fin que le demandeur a toujours fait acte de propri\u00e9taire sur le terrain en litige en y construisant et en y maintenant des perrons, en le traversant d'un canal d'\u00e9go\u00fbt, en \u00e9rigeant au-dessus du terrain les corniches de sa maison, en y \u00e9talant des machines agricoles et en en payant les taxes.\nIl est en preuve que cette lisi\u00e8re de terrain a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse pour un trottoir \u00e0 l'usage du public et ce depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial.\nCe trottoir a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit, maintenu et renouvel\u00e9 par la corporation intim\u00e9e et il faisait absolument partie de la rue publique.\nNous ne sommes pas, comme dans la cause de Gauvreau v. Page[2], en face d'une possession \u00e9quivoque o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire du terrain avait ouvert un chemin pour l'exploitation de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et y avait fait tous les frais d'entretien et de construction. Nous avons dans la pr\u00e9sente cause une corporation municipale qui a fait des trottoirs il y a plus de trente ans sur le terrain en litige et les a constamment entretenus.\nMais on se demande si la prescription trentenaire est en force dans notre droit.\nJe ne saurais mieux faire sur ce point que de citer Proudhon, Trait\u00e9 du Domaine Public, qui dispose de la question dans les termes suivants: (no. 631, p. 964, 2me. \u00e9dition). Mais un chemin public pourrait-il \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par le moyen de la prescription ordinaire? .. Il s'est form\u00e9 un chemin \u00e0 travers un ou plusieurs fonds, soit communaux, soit de particuliers; et chacum sert de communication entre des lieux habit\u00e9s, ou d'un village \u00e0 un autre village; dans le principe ceux qui l'ont \u00e9tabli n'en avaient pas le droit; le propri\u00e9taire ou les propri\u00e9taires des fonds qui en sont travers\u00e9s ont gard\u00e9 le silence pendant plus de trente ans, et depuis ce temps il a \u00e9t\u00e9 constamment et publiquement pratiqu\u00e9; ces propri\u00e9taires seraient-ils encore fond\u00e9s \u00e0 en interdire l'usage? Ne pourrait-on pas, au contraire, leur opposer que, par la possession trentenaire, il y a eu prescription acquisitive du chemin au profit du domaine public? .\u2026 Concluons donc que quand un chemin qui sert de communication entre plusieurs lieux habit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 publiquement ouvert et librement pratiqu\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire paisiblement poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par l'\u00eatre moral et collectif que nous appelons le public, pendant plus de trente ans, qui constituent aujourd'hui la dur\u00e9e de notre prescription la plus longue, le chemin est acquis au domaine public de la commune.\nL'appelant invoque le fait qu'il a des perrons qui couvrent une petite partie du trottoir et que les corniches de sa maison surplombent le trottoir et qu'un canal d'\u00e9go\u00fbt le traverse.\nCes diff\u00e9rentes servitudes ne sauraient affecter les droits de la corporation. Comme dit Guillouard, vol. 1er, Prescription, no. 375 :\nNon-seulement on ne peut acqu\u00e9rir par prescription la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol des voies ou places publiques, mais on ne peut acqu\u00e9rir sur ce sol aucune servitude qui soit contraire \u00e0 la destination de la rue ou de la place; sans doute, les propri\u00e9taires riverains d'une rue ou d'une place peuvent y \u00e9tablir des portes, y ouvrir des vues, y conduire les eaux pluviales ou m\u00e9nag\u00e8res, car c'est la destination m\u00eame de la rue ou de la place de procurer ces avantages aux riverains.\nLoca enim publica, utique privatorum usibus deserviunt, jure scilicet civitatis non quasi propria cujusque.\nMais du moment o\u00f9 il s'agit d'un usage de la voie ou de la place de nature \u00e0 nuire \u00e0 la destination g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de ces terrains, \u00e0 entraver les services qu'ils sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre, le riverain ne peut pas plus acqu\u00e9rir un droit de servitude qu'un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nParlant de la possession \u00e9quivoque, Guillouard, au no. 273 du m\u00eame trait\u00e9, dit:\nMais si la possession est \u00e9quivoque, la pr\u00e9somption doit \u00eatre \u00e0 notre avis en faveur de l'Etat ou de la commune. Dalloz, 1854-1-114.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse pr\u00e9tend qu'il y a eu dedication (abandon) du terrain en litige. Vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en suis venu sur la question de la prescription trentenaire, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter longuement ce point. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 exprim\u00e9 longuement mon opinion \u00e0 ce sujet dans la cause de Gauvreau v. Page[3], et j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la doctrine de dedication du droit anglais n'est pas en force dans Qu\u00e9bec et qu'un abandon d'immeuble \u00e0 titre gratuit ne pouvait pas se faire sans titre, vu qu'un acte portant donation entre vifs doit \u00eatre notari\u00e9 et porter minute \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9 (art. 776 C.C.). Dans le cas actuel cependant le demandeur para\u00eet admettre dans sa d\u00e9position et son prot\u00eat que le terrain n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9 gratuitement par ses auteurs, mais que cet abandon s'est fait pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration et que la cession alors participe non pas de la donation mais du contrat de vente. Dans ce cas, un contrat par \u00e9crit ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nPour ces raisons l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Apr\u00e8s l'examen du volumineux dossier en cette cause, il ne me para\u00eet pas susceptible de doute: 1\u00b0 que la lisi\u00e8re en question n'appartient pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e en vertu de ses titres comme faisant partie du lot no. 136 du cadastre de Saint-Jean, connu sous le nom de Place du March\u00e9; 2e, que sans cette lisi\u00e8re l'appelant n'a pas, sur la rue Jacques Cartier, toute la largeur que lui donnent ses titres et le cadastre pour les lots ayant front sur cette rue, soit 43 pieds pour le lot no. 140, 31 pieds pour le lot no. 141, 36 pieds pour le lot no. 142, en tout 110 pieds.\nCela explique l'insistance de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 vouloir borner non suivant ses titres mais d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'elle appelle sa possession imm\u00e9moriale. Sous ce dernier aspect, je puis tirer du dossier une troisi\u00e8me constatation de fait qui ne souffre aucun doute, c'est que, lors de l'institution de l'action de l'appelant, en 1905, la lisi\u00e8re en question \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e par un trottoir \u00e0 l'usage du public depuis au del\u00e0 de trente ans, en prenant la date mentionn\u00e9e par l'appelant, 1873, o\u00f9 il en a eu d'abord connaissance, mais il est \u00e9vident que l'existence d'un trottoir \u00e0 l'usage du public sur cette lisi\u00e8re remonte \u00e0 une date bien ant\u00e9rieure.\nUne quatri\u00e8me constatation de fait que je tire du dossier, c'est que dans l'origine les perrons de l'appelant occupaient une partie de la lisi\u00e8re et du trottoir qui s'y trouvait, que les corniches de l'h\u00f4tel de l'appelant se projetaient au dessus du trottoir de vingt-cinq \u00e0 trente pouces, et qu'il y a , en travers du trottoir, un canal d'\u00e9go\u00fbt appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant, \u00e9gouttant son h\u00f4tel, lequel canal continue ensuite en dehors de la ligne ext\u00e9rieure du trottoir et rejoint un canal du voisin du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est, se d\u00e9versant finalement dans l'\u00e9gout de l'intim\u00e9e sur la rue Champlain, car il n'y a d'\u00e9gout public sur la Place du March\u00e9 que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant. L'appelant dit que peu apr\u00e8s qu'il f\u00fbt rendu l\u00e0 il a r\u00e9tr\u00e9ci ses perrons. En 1907, il a reb\u00e2ti l'h\u00f4tel, le reculant du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord, c'est-\u00e0-dire en s'\u00e9loignant de la lisi\u00e8re et du trottoir, d'environ un pied, pour le mettre en ligne avec un magasin qu'il avait sur le lot no. 139. Le plan suppl\u00e9mentaire pr\u00e9par\u00e9 sur l'ordre de la cour sup\u00e9rieure par les arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres pour indiquer les lignes de division respectives r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par les parties, fait voir que les constructions de l'appelant sont \u00e9loign\u00e9es d'un pied et demi \u00e0 un pied huit-dixi\u00e8mes de la ligne adopt\u00e9e par les arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres, et que les perrons ou marches des portes lat\u00e9rales sont en dedans de cette ligne. Prenant pour acquis les faits que je viens de mentionner, l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9videmment besoin soit de la prescription, soit de l'abandon par destination \u00e0 l'usage du public (dedication) pour r\u00e9ussir en cette cause. Les arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres se sont bas\u00e9s sur la prescription trentenaire pour reconna\u00eetre les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame sur la lisi\u00e8re, et les jugements dont est appel reposent \u00e9galement sur cette prescription, mais le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc du Roi, invoque aussi l'abandon par destination comme suit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve d\u00e9montre que la lisi\u00e8re en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse pour l'usage de la rue \"Place du March\u00e9\" et d'un trottoir longeant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud.\nJe suis convaincu qu'il a d\u00fb en \u00eatre ainsi et que les auteurs du demandeur ont abandonn\u00e9 cette lisi\u00e8re \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9, celle-ci, au moins depuis 1866, par un r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par elle, s'\u00e9tant oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 faire et r\u00e9parer \u00e0 ses frais le trottoir qui s'y trouvait. Dans son prot\u00eat du 17 ao\u00fbt, 1905, l'appelant all\u00e8gue que ses auteurs ont permis la construction sur leur terrain d'un trottoir par tol\u00e9rance et \u00e0 condition que ce trottoir f\u00fbt de sept pieds de large. Il n'y a pas de preuve de cette derni\u00e8re condition, et apr\u00e8s tant d'ann\u00e9es la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant d'\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire exclusif de cette lisi\u00e8re me semble franchement insoutenable. En 1905, lors de son prot\u00eat, la seule chose qui l'ait \u00e9mu c'\u00e9tait la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e de construire un trottoir en ciment large de cinq pieds pour remplacer le trottoir en bois de six pieds environ de largeur qui depuis longtemps couvrait la lisi\u00e8re, et apr\u00e8s ce prot\u00eat et l'institution de l'action, l'appelant a lui-m\u00eame construit sur cette lisi\u00e8re un trottoir en bois \u00e0 l'usage du public sur le m\u00eame emplacement que l'ancien trottoir, bien qu'\u00e0 une largeur moindre, confirmant ainsi la destination de la lisi\u00e8re-Il est donc \u00e9vident qu'il y a eu abandon au public de cette lisi\u00e8re, en supposant qu'elle ait primitivement appartenu aux auteurs de l'appelant, ce que je crois probable. Cet abandon a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e qui, pendant plus de trente ans avant le proc\u00e8s, a construit et entretenu un trottoir sur la lisi\u00e8re.\nL'appelant, surtout pour contester la qualit\u00e9 de la possession de l'intim\u00e9e, invoque le fait que ses perrons occupaient une partie du trottoir, que ses corniches s'y projetaient et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 et est encore travers\u00e9 par le canal d'\u00e9gout dont j'ai parl\u00e9. Cependant l'appelant dans son t\u00e9moignage admet qu'il y a \u00e0 Saint-Jean nombre de perrons qui empi\u00e8tent sur les trottoirs de l'intim\u00e9e, ce que cette derni\u00e8re para\u00eet tol\u00e9rer, et on ne saurait de l\u00e0 conclure s\u00fbrement que l'intim\u00e9e n'ait pas poss\u00e9d\u00e9 le trottoir. Aujourd'hui aucun perron de l'appelant ne se projette au del\u00e0 de la ligne adopt\u00e9e par les arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres, et il n'appert pas que ses corniches la d\u00e9passent, de sorte que si cette ligne est maintenue l'appelant n'a pas \u00e0 enlever ses perrons et corniches. Quant au canal d'\u00e9gout, je n'attache aucune importance au fait qu'il traverse le trottoir, du moins comme pouvant affecter le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession du trottoir et de la lisi\u00e8re; cela me para\u00eet \u00eatre un arrangement tout \u00e0 l'avantage des deux parties pour le drainage des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sur la Place du March\u00e9, et sans port\u00e9e aucune sur leurs droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 respectifs.\nSi la lisi\u00e8re en dispute a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e par l'appelant et ses auteurs pour l'usage du public, et si cet abandon a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, ce qui me para\u00eet incontestable, la ligne adopt\u00e9e par les arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres doit \u00eatre maintenue. Je me base uniquement sur le fait de cet abandon d\u00fbment accept\u00e9. Dans la cause de Gauvreau v. Page[4], j'ai exprim\u00e9 mes doutes sur la question de savoir si un chemin public peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par prescription trentenaire, la difficult\u00e9 \u00e9tant toujours de prouver la possession requise pour cette prescription, et cette difficult\u00e9 dans l'esp\u00e8ce se trouve accrue par le fait de l'existence sur la lisi\u00e8re, pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, des perrons de l'appelant. Cette difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la preuve de la possession avec les qualit\u00e9s requises pour la prescription n'existe pas quand il s'agit de la destination \u00e0 l'usage du public, car cette destination n'exige que l'acceptation suffisante du public ou de l'autorit\u00e9 municipale qui le repr\u00e9sente. De plus, alors que, pour la' prescription, il faut que la possession ait dur\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode fix\u00e9e qui peut \u00eatre interrompue, l'abandon ou destination pour l'usage du public est complet et d\u00e9finitif d\u00e8s son acceptation, et sans que la possession du public ait dur\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e a priori.\nMon \u00e9tude du dossier m'am\u00e8ne donc \u00e0 conclure que la ligne de division adopt\u00e9e par les jugements dont est appel doit \u00eatre maintenue. De nombreuses objections ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par l'appelant \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure des arpenteurs-g\u00e9om\u00e8tres. Ces objections ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par les deux cours et j'accepte leur d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nSur le tout, pour les raisons que je viens d'indiquer, et sans adopter les motifs des jugements quant \u00e0 la question de prescription, je crois que l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Georges Fortin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P.

Horner (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1921: February 2, 3, 24.\nPresent:\u2014Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nNegligence\u2014Railway\u2014Jury trial\u2014Res ipsa loquitur\u2014Burden of proof\u2014 Master and servant\u2014N.W.T. Ord. (1915), c. 98. The respondent's husband, a brakesman in appellant's employ, was killed by the derailment of his train. The derailment was caused by an unlocked switch being partly open. At the trial, the respondent simply gave evidence of the accident and of the damages claimed by her, resting her case on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The appellant then moved for a non-suit on the ground that this doctrine was not applicable in a case between master and servant. The motion was refused and the appellant proceeded to produce evidence to rebut the prima facie case of negligence. The jury rendered a verdict in favour of the respondent.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that, upon the evidence, the verdict of the jury that the condition of the switch was due to the negligence of the appellant must be upheld.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014In the province of Alberta the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be invoked by a servant seeking to hold his master liable for injuries sustained in the course of his employment, since the defence of common employment has been taken away by statute; and it was incumbent upon the appellant to rebut the presumption of negligence resulting from the application of the doctrine.\nPer Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The sufficiency of the evidence adduced by the appellant to rebut such presumption was wholly within the province of the jury.\nPer Mignault J. (dissenting).\u2014The evidence adduced by the appellant having completely rebutted the prima facie case of negligence resulting from the rule res ipsa loquitur, and the respondent not having made any affirmative proof of negligence of the appellant, the jury was not justified in finding a verdict in favor of the respondent.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1920] 3 W.W.R. 909) affirmed, Mignault J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming, on equal division of the court, the judgment of Walsh J. with a jury, and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and ill the judgments now reported.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and N. D. McLean for the appellant.\nDavid Campbell for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent sued as the widow of a brakeman killed in an accident on appellant's railway. That accident and the consequent death of respondent's late husband were caused by the train on which he was serving having been derailed in passing a switch which was found unlocked.\nThere can be no doubt of the derailment having been the result of the switch having been unlocked.\nPrima facie that condition of things must be attributable to the open switch and that in turn to the negligence of appellant. The burden of proof that it was due to some other cause than such negligence thus rested upon the appellant. Until that was established by such clear evidence that the jury could not, as reasonable men, refuse to accept and act upon it the presumption arising from the circumstances, expressed in the maxim res ipsa loquitur, stands as the guide for the jurors.\nThe sole substantial question raised by this appeal is whether or not the jury has by acting upon the said presumption, and unreasonably, either impliedly refused to believe, or so far as believed to accept as a satisfactory rebuttal of such presumption the evidence adduced by the appellant, tending to shew that appellant's servants absolutely discharged their respective duties and that the discharge thereof would cover all that may be involved in the charge of negligence.\nNow, it is the province of the jury to decide as to the credibility of each and every witness and the measure of credibility to be given to the evidence of each witness.\nThe jury may properly disregard the evidence of each witness from many points of view. It may find from his demeanour or otherwise that he is entirely unworthy of credit.\nIn this case there does not seem to be anything for applying such an extreme view as to any of the witnesses, especially in view of the expressions in the learned trial judge's charge. There is, however, very much in the ordinary experience of life which the jury could well apply in this case, and that is that he on whom the duty is cast and is daily many times discharging, with absolute care and accuracy, may from time to time through a great variety of causes omit to discharge.\nSuch a man in good faith is apt to persuade himself that he had actually discharged his duty when, as a matter of fact, he had entirely forgotten to do so, or failed from some cause to perform it.\nYet in such a case of failure his master may be legally liable for the negligence involved, if injury to another results therefrom.\nThe jury in such a case must use the best judgment it can and its verdict is only reviewable and reversible by an appellate court if such as no twelve men could reasonably arrive at on the evidence presented. In this case or any other where the jury may have been of a less number, I do not regard the exact number of twelve jurors as governing, though I present it as what has been so often presented by the highest courts in England where twelve is the number of a jury selected to try an issue of fact.\nThe jury was confronted with the problem of deciding whether the unlocked switch was the result of negligence on the part of some one of the servants of the appellant, or a criminal interference by some stranger.\nThe evidence tendered to rebut the former depended, in almost every instance bearing on that aspect of the case, upon the unsupported evidence of a single witness, who may have been mistaken. If any link in that chain of events thus failed the whole defence fails.\nAnd we should not forget the very serious consequences presented to the mind of each of such witnesses tempting him to persuade himself that he must have discharged his duty, when in fact he may have failed to do so.\nAs to the possibilities of the switch being left unlocked, Farrell, a witness for the appellant who had been a brakeman on its trains, testified that he had found switches unlocked \"but not very often.\"\nI should have preferred to have seen this point pressed upon others. For what it is worth it shews that appellant's servants are not quite as infallible as it pretends herein.\nThe alternative question presented to the jury, of whether or not the unlocking in question herein was the result of strangers to the service having improperly meddled with the lock, seems unsupportable by any evidence worth considering. The fact of someone having taken, on the Sunday in question, a hand car used by the section foreman, and apparently ridden oil it for some miles away to a point where it was found later, is relied upon as if important.\nOne can easily understand how and why some idle men or boys, on a Sunday or holiday, might be tempted to do such a thing. It seems, however, an incident quite incapable of explaining why they, or such like idlers, should engage in the far more serious criminal conduct of unlocking the switch and deliberately planning the wreck of the train in question or any other passing over the point in question.\nMoreover the switch was at a part of the country five or six miles away from any habitation but one, other than that of its foreman, and there was not the slightest effort made to attach blame to that party, or indeed to any party.\nIf there had been any reason to believe that it was the work of any persons designing to wreck the train, some trace would probably have been found of such persons.\nThe death of three men, and the ruin of property in cars and otherwise, which must have resulted, would have so aroused public attention and the public authorities as to have disclosed if any foundation in fact for such a theory, something more than a commonplace incident of someone taking a ride on a hand-car\u2014left as it was to tempt the idlers to so use it.\nThere was never, I suspect, much search made for the alleged criminal unlocking of the switch. Probably nobody believed that theory and it was only looked on as fit to ask judges and juries to accept it. To my mind the whole of the hints thus thrown out as to the cause of the accident are not deserving of serious consideration as an alternative to the possibilities indeed probabilities of the unlocked switch being the result of neglect.\nBefore parting with the hand-car incident I cannot forbear remarking that its exposure to such use was apparently the result of carelessness on the part of the foreman on whose inspection of the switch so much reliance is placed. Alternatively he seems to have felt he was in such a deserted district, so remote from possible marauders, that he was quite safe in doing so.\nYet we are asked to presume on such a slender thread of evidence as adduced that the jury coming to a like conclusion were, in doing so, acting as no set of reasonable men could do and hence set aside their verdict.\nThe point was made in argument here that other trains had passed over unhurt.\nIt is admitted in evidence that such going in one direction would not be affected by the condition of the switch but contended that one had preceded the one in question and passed in safety going in same direction.\nHence it is argued that assuming we have an account of all trains run on the part of the road in question there was nothing happened for at least twenty-four hours out of which could have arisen the neglect of duty in question.\nThat would be a cogent, though by no means conclusive, argument had the appellant proven, as it should have done, if possible, that there was no other train passing which needed to use the switch, and left it unlocked.\nIt is said by counsel for appellant that no such point was made in argument below. Whether that be correct or not does not matter. It is the evidence we have to be guided by and not the argument of counsel.\nI doubt much, however, if it was not present to the minds of the learned judges in the court below, for I find Mr. Justice Ives in writing his judgment, had properly looked for such evidence and found it in the answer of Mr. Irwin, a superintendent of appellant on his examination for discovery, as follows:\u2014\n224. Q. When, prior to the accident, was the switch in question last operated? A. 17.20 K., July 5th, that would be 5.20 P.M.\n225. Q. And that train proceeded out of the \"Y\" upon the main track, going west? A. Yes, Sir, I presume it did; I don't know whether it went in and backed through or went into the other switch first and came out of this. My opinion is they would head into this switch and back through the other one, but I am not prepared to say.\nMr. Justice Ives held that this answer to 224 having been put in by respondent's counsel is sufficient. It seems to me quite clear that the party so testifying could not swear to that needed to make effective proof meeting the point raised, and is only assuming it.\nI am unable, with great respect, to agree with that view of Mr. Justice Ives as to the weight to be attached to this, but pleased to find that he felt as I do the need of some such evidence to make any possible defence for appellant out of the movement of trains.\nI may remark in passing that the learned Chief Justice relied on other grounds entirely, in which, with respect, I cannot agree.\nI am quite unable to understand why or by what process of reasoning a fellow servant who had nothing to do with the switch in question, could be debarred or his representatives be debarred from reliance on the maxim of res ipsa loquitur which is nothing but a concise expression of common sense applied to circumstantial evidence. It is equally applicable to every phase of common sense use of circumstantial evidence.\nIt could hardly be applied to the case of a man in charge of a switch injured by his own neglect or his representatives founding an action on such injury.\nThere are many other things incidental to the inquiry which I should have liked, before giving a favourable ear to appellant, to have heard a good deal more relative to.\nOne of these was the question of the light on this switch and the angle at which the target was set when the train was approaching the point in question; and another as to the results found after the accident in the situation of the switch and light in something more tangible and satisfactory than what appears in evidence.\nThe frame in which the switch was set is sworn to have been undisturbed after the accident. If so, why was the light so found, as it was, not giving light, and the target turned as it was?\nAnd if not the result of the accident why was it passed instead of stopping?\nAnd again the neglect of someone to lock the switch after using it may have been productive of much in its many possible movements as the result of trains passing over the point in question either way.\nOn these points the evidence is left in a rather unsatisfactory condition.\nThe following evidence is worth considering:\u2014\nQ. A Juryman. You state this train was the first one that went over the switch before the accident. If you went over that and that switch was apparently open would it have any effect on your train?\u2014A. None whatever.\nQ. Your train would not close the switch or throw it wider open? A. Well, it might; it would, but it would spring back to about half way,\nQ. It would not affect your train at all?\u2014A. No. It suggests in the first place that the jury was possibly quite as alive to the several questions thus raised as we can be, and that the passage of the trains upon which so much reliance is placed by appellant, may have had much to do with the changes in the switch's position if left unlocked. Such shaking and disturbance of the switches unchained may have had much more serious results upon an unlocked switch in relation to the accident in question than the evidence discloses.\nIn conclusion I should say that for a great many years this Court has refused in any way to interfere with the measure of damages as left by the courts below, even when we have felt them excessive. If the courts below cannot find therein a ground for granting a new trial then we should not interfere.\nThere must be an end, if possible, to litigation being prolonged.\nI agree so fully with what has been well said by the learned judges below, taking the view I do of this case, that I rely thereon as well as on the foregoing reasons in reaching the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs here and below.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal was argued by Mr. McCarthy with his usual force and ingenuity, but it is unnecessary, in my judgment, to enter upon any of the interesting general questions discussed. I agree with the majority of the Appellate Division that from the circumstances in evidence the jury might properly infer that the condition of the switch was due to the negligence of somebody for whom the' appellants are responsible; and I think the jury, by their finding, expressed this conclusion with sufficient clearness. ANGLIN J.\u2014Read together, as I think they should be, the answers of the jury to the first and second questions submitted to them cover findings\n(a) that the cause of the derailment which resulted in the death of Horner was the switch in question \"not being properly set and locked,\"\n(b) that the existence of this state of affairs was attributable to the defendants, and\n(c) that it amounted to actionable negligence.\nThese findings, unless they are not sustainable, sufficed in my opinion, to warrant the entry of judgment for the plaintiff for such damages as she was entitled to recover.\nThat the derailment was caused by an unlocked switch being partly open is common ground. The plaintiff offered no evidence to shew how the switch came to be in that condition, invoking the doctrine res ipsa loquitur to establish prima facie responsibility of the defendants for its being so. That, if attributable to an act or default of them or their servants, the position of the switch amounted to actionable negligence is neither questioned nor questionable.\nNor does it seem open to doubt that, if the plaintiff's husband had been a passenger\u2014if the relation of master and servant had not subsisted between him and the defendant company\u2014upon the fact that the derailment was caused by a partly open switch being established or admitted, the applicability of the doctrine res ipsa loquitur would have been incontestible.\nThe switch belonged to and was under the management of the defendants; in the ordinary course of things it could not have been half open as it was unless the defendants' servants in charge of it had failed in some respect to use proper care; in the absence of explanation by the defendants it would be reasonable for a jury to infer that the switch was not properly closed and locked because of some want of care on the part of those servants. Scott v. The London and St. Katherine Docks Co.[2]; Flannery v. Waterford and Limerick Rly. Co.[3].\nMr. McCarthy strongly contended, however, that the fact that Horner was an employee of the defendants excludes the applicability of res ipsa loquitur. That and the sufficiency of the evidence adduced by the defendants to establish that they and their servants had fully discharged their duty in regard to the switch and thus to lead to the inference that its admittedly improper position was ascribable to the intervention of some foreign agency for which they were not accountable, or at least to render unwarrantable the inference that it was attributable to them, were the main grounds of the appeal.\nThat res ipsa loquitur cannot ordinarily be invoked by a servant seeking to hold his master liable for injuries sustained in the course of his employment is due to the fact that the injury may have been caused by the fault of a fellow servant for which at common law the master would not be liable or, it may be, to the fault of the servant himself. Where it is equally probable that the master may or may not be liable no presumption of liability can arise. But when, as in Alberta, the defence of common employment has been taken away by statute and the master is liable to a servant for injuries due to the neglect of a fellow employee if the servant injured was himself neither responsible for nor in a position to know the existence of the danger which caused the injury complained of, there seems to be no reason why he should not be entitled to invoke the doctrine res ipsa loquitur as if he were a stranger. In my opinion upon the admitted facts of this case the plaintiff was clearly justified in invoking that doctrine. In all probability the switch would not have been unlocked and partly open as it was found immediately after the derailment unless there had been neglect of duty by some servant of the defendants. At least that was an inference which a tribunal of fact could properly draw.\nThe sufficiency of the evidence adduced by the defendants to rebut that inference by shewing that their servants had fully discharged their duty in regard to the position of the switch was eminently a matter for the jury. The credibility of the witnesses who deposed to the discharge of their several duties in regard to the closing of the switch or seeing that it was closed was for the jury to determine. Counsel for the respondent very properly pointed out that while there was the positive evidence of Neil Macdonald, a brake-man on a train which had used the switch twenty-four hours before the derailment, that he had closed and locked it, the conductor of that train upon whom the company's rules cast the duty of seeing that every switch used by this train is left in proper position was not called as a witness, and there was no satisfactory evidence that other trains had not used the switch in the interval. Mr. McCarthy answers that the train despatched sheet was produced and shewed every train operating in the division during the period in question. He also stated that the failure to call either the conductor or the train despatcher is urged here for the first time. It is impossible to know whether the jury discredited the evidence of Neil Macdonald, and that of Jordan, the section foreman, who testified that he saw the switch locked on the morning of the day of the accident, or whether they inferred proprio motu from the failure to call the train despatcher that some other train or engine had used the switch during the day of the accident.\nMr. McCarthy also relied very much on evidence that another train travelling in the same direction as that on which the unfortunate Horner was engaged had safely passed over the switch about eleven hours before the derailment. This is no doubt cogent evidence, but its conclusiveness depends wholly on the sufficiency of the proof that there had been no legitimate use of the switch during the intervening eleven hours.\nIt is common ground that the opening of the switch by accident, if it were locked, was an impossibility. Interference with it by mischevious boys, as was suggested, would be, to say the least, highly improbable. The opening of it by design by any unauthorized adult would be a criminal act such as should not be presumed. While, if trying the case on the evidence in the record and without seeing the witnesses, I might have been disposed to consider that the presumption of actionable fault arising under the doctrine res ipsa loquitur was sufficiently met, I am unable to say that a jury properly instructed, as the jury in this case admittedly was, could not reasonably have reached the contrary conclusion.\nWhile the verdict was undoubtedly large, having regard to the facts that the man who was killed was only twenty-six years of age, that he was in good health and in good standing as a railroad man, that he had been already promoted to the rank of conductor and apparently had excellent prospects for future advancement, that he was earning at the time of his death about $175 a month, and that the plaint iff, aged twenty-three years, and two children of tender age survive him, I am not prepared to say that the amount of the judgment is so excessive that we would be justified in setting it aside on that ground.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is a railway accident. The plaintiff's husband was employed as brakeman on one of the appellant's trains, which derailed at a switch west of Peace River Station. Three men were killed, amongst whom was this brakesman. In inspecting the wreck it was found that the switch was half open and that the derailment was due to that.\nThe plaintiff proved her case in establishing the accident and the condition of the switch and of the railway line at this place. She rested her case on the maxim, or, as I prefer to call it, on the rule of evidence res ipsa loquitur.\nThe defendant company then moved for a non-suit on the ground that this rule of evidence does not apply as between master and servant. The trial judge dismissed the defendant's application and the company called evidence.\nThis evidence is to the effect the switch had been opened the night before for the passage of a train, that it had been properly locked after closing it, that on the day of the accident, some trains passed in both directions and nothing strange was seen in connection with this switch which appeared in good order, that about an hour before the accident happened a train going west passed at that place and the switch looked all right and that when the eastbound train on which the brakesman Horner was working, passed the switch was half open. Now how this change in the switch came to happen no evidence is adduced to shew. It was left to the jury as a question of inference. If the verdict had been a general verdict it would without doubt, have to be sustained, because there is enough of evidence to leave to the jury the inference that the accident was due to the negligence of the company. But the verdict was not a general one. It is stated that the defendant was guilty of negligence; and they assign as a cause of the negligence that the switch was not properly set and locked and that it caused the derailment and wreck of the train. In other words, the answer appears to be a finding of the cause of the accident rather than a fixing of the responsibility for it.\nBut as they have in answer to the first question found expressly that there was negligence on the part of the railway company, their finding may be due to the fact that they may not have believed some of the witnesses for the defence or they may have drawn the inference that the accident was due to the fault of the employees of the company.\nAs to the rule of evidence res ipsa loquitur, it should be observed that the exclusion of the rule in the case of master and servant is based upon the doctrine of common employment. In Alberta, a legislation was passed by which this doctrine of common employment has been discarded; and I am of the view that the rule of evidence should be fully observed in a system of legislation where the doctrine of common employment is no more in force.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs. MIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent's husband was killed in an accident on the appellant's railway, and in a suit against the appellant she obtained from the jury a verdict for $25,000 which, subsequently to the appeal by the appellant to the Appellate Division of Alberta, she reduced to $20,000.\nThe facts fortunately give rise to no dispute between the parties. Late at night on Sunday, July 6th, 1919, a freight train known as Extra East No. 2047 of the appellant was derailed at Peace River Junction, a place where there is practically no settlement, and the respondent's husband, who as head end brakeman was riding in the cab of the engine, was killed, as were also the engineer and fireman. At the place where the locomotive was derailed a loop fine known as the \"Y,\" used to permit trains to change their direction, leaves the main fine and extends to a branch of the railway to the north, which branch also leaves the main fine a short distance further east. The cause of the derailment was discovered immediately by the conductor, the rear end brakeman and an employee who was riding as a passenger, all three of whom were in the \"caboose\" and were uninjured, the rear part of the train not having left the rails. This cause was that the switch connecting with the \"Y\" was about half open, so that the wheels of the engine, the tender and the first fifteen cars left the rails, and the engine in which Horner was riding was thrown over onto its right side. The switch, or rather the lever handle by which it was operated, was usually held in place by a locked padlock, but after the accident this padlock was found unlocked. The lamp of the switch was not burning after the accident and, as a matter of fact, it then received a blow which would have sufficed to put out the fight had it been burning. The switch lever handle was raised and was pointing across the main line, while the target was very nearly parallel with the main line. At that place there is a curve and the evidence seems to shew that from the engine of train No. 2047 approaching the switch the lamp would have shewn green if it was then lighted, as it must have been, for otherwise it would have been the duty of the engineer, who had full view of the switch for a mile and a half before he reached it, to stop his train. It is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the light was then burning and showed green. This, however, is, and can only be, a surmise, for none of the ill-fated occupants of the locomotive cab survived to tell the story.\nIn her action claiming on her behalf and on behalf of her children $30,000 damages for her husband's death, the respondent alleged three grounds of negligence against the appellant:\u2014\n(a) In running the said train at the time and place of the said occurrence at an excessive and dangerous speed.\n(b) In permitting or causing the said \"Y\" switch to be set or placed improperly to allow the said train to pass along and upon the main track safely.\n(c) In having a defective switch and railway tracks at the time and place of said occurrence, whereby the said locomotive was caused or allowed to leave the railway tracks as aforesaid.\nOf these three grounds the first and third may be disregarded because none of them were found by the jury.\nAt the trial the respondent made formal evidence of the accident, by calling a physician to prove the cause of death and by putting in parts of the examination on discovery of Mr. Irwin, superintendent of the first division western district of the appellant's railway, and also of the damages claimed by her, and then declared that she rested her case and relied on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The appellant having moved for a non-suit, the question of this doctrine and its applicability between master and servant was argued and the trial was adjourned to give the learned trial judge time to examine the authorities. The following day the learned trial judge refused the motion, but the respondent nevertheless decided to put in additional parts of the examination of Mr. Irwin with the object apparently of further establishing negligence on the part of the appellant. The motion for non-suit was renewed at what was termed the second close of the respondent's case and was again denied.\nThe appellant then proceeded to call witnesses, to wit its servants and officials, in order to rebut any prima facie case resulting from the rule res ipsa loquitur, assuming its applicability in a case like this. I will have to discuss this evidence in detail, so I will immediately quote the answers made by the jury to the questions submitted by the learned trial judge.\n1. Was the death of Horner caused by the negligence of the defendant? A. Yes.\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? A. Of switch known as west main track switch leading to the \"Y\" at Peace River Junction not being properly set and locked causing the derailment and wreck of train known as Extra East No. 2047.\n3. If the plaintiff is entitled to recover, what amount of damages is she entitled to recover? A. $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars.)\nBefore discussing the rule of evidence res ipsa loquitur, the first point to be considered is whether it applies in a master and servant case like this one, having regard to the state of the law in the province of Alberta.\nIt is broadly stated in text books such as Beven on Negligence, 3rd edition, p. 130, and Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 21, p. 439, note m, that this rule does not apply between master and servant. But on referring to the cases cited by them: Patterson v. Wallace[4]; Lovegrove v. London, Brighton and South Coast Rly. Co.[5], where a dictum of Willes J. at p. 692 is quoted, it is seen that the fellow servant rule was there applied, and, in cases governed by that rule, it is clear, as stated by Willes J., that\nit is not enough for the plaintiff to shew that he has sustained an injury under circumstances that may lead to a suspicion, or even a fair inference, that there may have been negligence on the part of the defendant; but he must go on and give evidence of some specific act of negligence on the part of the person against whom he seeks compensation.\nAnd the same eminent judge, at p. 691 of the same report, said that\nthere can be no doubt that the person injured and the person whose negligence caused the injury were fellow servants.\nI am therefore disposed to think that because of the fellow servant rule, which applies (except in matters governed by Workmen's Compensation Acts) in almost every jurisdiction subject to the common law, the maxim res ipsa loquitur\u2014which is no more than a presumption of negligence that the defendant must rebut\u2014has been considered inapplicable in master and servant cases. But the fellow servant rule has been excluded in Alberta by chapter 98 of the Ordinances of the North West Territories, whereby is was enacted that:\n2. It shall not be a good defence in law to any action against an employer or the successor or legal representative of an employer for damages for the injury or death of an employee of such employer that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of an employee engaged in a common employment with the injured employee any contract or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding. Therefore inasmuch as the liability of the master for injuries suffered by his servant is in Alberta the same as his liability for injuries inflicted on a stranger, I would not be disposed to qualify the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur by distinguishing one case from another. And there is no authority that I know of which excludes this maxim between master and servant in a jurisdiction where the rule as to common employment has been repealed by statute. This point now stands to be determined by this court for the first time, and I think it must be determined against the contention of the appellant.\nNow as to the rule res ipsa loquitur, a rule of evidence I have said, and a very reasonable one, it is now firmly established, and its scope is well shewn fey the following quotations from the opinions of eminent judges.\nIn Christie v. Griggs, [6], Sir James Mansfield C.J., observed that\nwhen the breaking down or overturning of a coach is proved, negligence on the part of the owner is implied. He has always the means to rebut this presumption, if it is unfounded; and it is now incumbent on the defendant to make out that the damage in this case arose from what the law considers a mere accident.\nThe defendant in that case having made evidence concerning the cause of the accident, the Chief Justice said:\u2014\nThere was a difference between a contract to carry goods, and a contract to carry passengers. For the goods the carrier was answerable at all events. But he did not warrant the safety of the passengers. His undertaking, as to them, went no further than this, that as far as human care and foresight could go, he would provide for their safe conveyance. Therefore, if the breaking down of the coach was purely accidental, the plaintiff has no remedy for the misfortune he has encountered. In Carpue v. London and Brighton Rly. Co.[7], Lord Denman said:\u2014\nIt having been shewn that the exclusive management, both of the machinery and of the railway, was in the hands of the defendants, it was presumable that the accident arose from their want of care, unless they gave some explanation of the cause by which it was produced; which explanation the plaintiff, not having the same means of knowledge, could not reasonably be expected to give.\nIn Byrne v. Boadle[8], the case of a barrel falling from a building on the plaintiff, Pollock C.B. expressed himself as follows:\u2014\nThe fact of its falling is prima facie evidence of negligence and the plaintiff who was injured by it is not bound to shew that it could not fall without negligence, but if there are any facts inconsistent with negligence it is for the defendant to prove them.\nIn Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co.[9], Erle C.J. said at p. 601:\u2014\nThere must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the thing is shewn to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.\nIn Kearney v. London, Brighton and South Coast Ry. Co.[10], a case of a brick falling from a bridge and injuring a person passing under it, Cockburn C.J. stated:\u2014\nWhere it is the duty of persons to keep premises, or a structure of whatever kind it may be, in a proper condition, and we find it out of condition, and an accident happens therefrom, it is incumbent upon them to shew that they used that reasonable care and diligence which they were bound to use, and the absence of which it seems to me may fairly be presumed by the fact that there was the defect from which the accident had arisen. Therefore there was some evidence to go to the jury, however slight it may have been, of this accident having arisen from the negligence of the defendants; and it was incumbent on the defendants to give evidence rebutting the inference arising from the undisputed facts. In Flannery v. The Waterford and Limerick Ry. Co.[11], the plaintiff had been injured by the derailment of a train in which he was travelling. Palles C.B. followed Scott v. London & St Katherine Docks Co.[12], and, at p. 39 said:\u2014\nI am of opinion that as the railway, the engine and the waggon were under the defendants' management, and as the circumstance of the wagon leaving the rails does not happen in the ordinary course of things if due care is used, the fact of the accident was sufficient evidence to call upon the defendants to shew that there was no negligence on their part.\nI think therefore that the circumstances of this case and the fact of the open and unlocked switch which undoubtedly caused the derailment, suffice to establish a prima facie case of negligence making it incumbent on the defendant to rebut the presumption of fault resulting therefrom.\nIf the appellant has sufficiently rebutted this presumption there is no doubt that it cannot be held liable for Horner's death. Christie v. Griggs[13]; Readhead v. Midland Ry. Co.[14]. This is therefore the question that must be determined by carefully examining the evidence adduced by the appellant.\nIn so far as the switch is concerned\u2014and in view of the jury's finding I need not consider the other grounds of negligence set up in the respondent's statement of claim, but I may say that the appellant established that the equipment of the train, its air brakes as well as the railway itself were in perfect condition\u2014it was proved to be one of the best switches on the line. It was last used in connection with the \"Y\" the evening before the accident. Six miles west of the switch is a summer resort, Alberta Beach, and an excursion train had run from Edmonton to this resort on Saturday, July 5th, without stopping at Peace River Junction. On the return trip this train left Alberta Beach about 8.45 P.M. and stopped at this switch to go into the \"Y\" in order to turn the train. Neil Macdonald, the head end brakeman, on this train, opened the switch to let the train go on to the \"Y\" track. He swore that after the train had passed on this track, he set the switch in normal position, parallel with the main line, placed the lever handle down and locked it. This witness was not cross-examined by the respondent.\nThe next day, Sunday, the 6th of July, the day of the accident, Jordan, the appellant's section foreman, as was his duty, inspected the switch between 10 and 11 o'clock in the forenoon. He testified that it was in good condition then, that the lever handle and lock were in proper place, properly locked, and that the switch was set for the main line. He said that on Sundays people are often on the track\u2014it is to be remembered that Alberta Beach is six miles away\u2014 and that his hand car, which was some distance east, was stolen that afternoon and taken to near St. Albert, also to the east of the switch. The switch lamp was then burning. He had often inspected the switch and never found it unlocked.\nAnother freight train of the appellant, known as extra 2147 west, had twice passed the switch along the main line that Sunday. First coming from Edson, which is west of Peace River Junction, it passed the switch about noon, going east, without stopping. The engineer of this train, Fallon, swore that the switch then was all right, and that had it been wrong the train would have been derailed, for it was going in the same direction as Horner's train went that same night. Returning towards Alberta Beach that evening, his train passed the switch between 8 and 9 o'clock, and went on to Alberta Beach, where it was crossed by Horner's train No. 2047, which did not stop at Alberta Beach and continued on to the east and was derailed at the switch as already stated. Fallon, the engineer of train 2147, being on the north side of the locomotive (the switch was on the south side of the line), could not see the switch when he went on that evening to Alberta Beach, but the fireman, Wellington, and the head end brakeman, Farrel, of train 2147 were in position to see the switch as they passed, and both swore that the switch was then all right, the target shewing all right for the main fine, and Farrel said that had the switch handle been in a horizontal position facing north he would have noticed it, and that he saw nothing like that. It was however stated by Wellington that if the switch was open an inch or two as his train went west, it would not affect the train at all, and that the flanges of the wheels would bring it over into its proper place. As to this, another witness of the appellant, Jordan, confirmed this last statement, saying that a train going west would close the switch, but that it would spring to a certain extent afterwards. None of the men on the train 2147 could say whether the switch light was burning when this train passed the switch going west that evening, for it was not then dark enough to notice the light.\nAs I have said, train 2047 on which Horner was riding passed train 2147 at Alberta Beach, going east. It was derailed at the switch about half an hour afterwards, and I have described the condition in which the switch was then found, unlocked, the lever handle raised and pointing to the north across the main line. Of the witnesses called by the appellant, the learned trial judge said in his charge to the jury:\nNow I think I may say with perfect propriety that in my opinion the railway company has acted with great candour and with great fairness in the number and class of the witnesses whom it has placed before you. It seems to me that they practically exhausted the witnesses who were able to cast any light upon this tragedy, and it is to be commended for that. Those men who were called were without exception all employees of the railway company. There has not been a suggestion made against their perfect honesty, and I am very glad that that is so. These men struck me as being fair-minded, honest, intelligent men, who gave evidence they did give with perfect candour and straightforwardness. That is my opinion of them. You may have a different opinion. I am simply expressing my own opinion, but there is no suggestion that simply because they are employees of the railway company they twisted their evidence to suit the purpose of their employer. We all know, in these days at any rate, that the sympathies of railway men are just as apt to be with each other as they are with their employer. However, Mr. Campbell was exceedingly fair in his conduct of this case and has not made the slightest imputation against the perfect honesty of the various witnesses called by the defence. So that you have had these men before you, you have heard from them their story, and it is for you to say now upon a review of all the evidence whether in your opinion this unfortunate accident occurred through the negligence of the railway company.\nElsewhere the learned trial judge said:\u2014\nI feel quite justified in saying that in my opinion all the evidence that could be given has been given in this case, except, perhaps, the evidence of the man by whom this switch was opened and who apparently is not known to any person, and you are entitled to draw such inference from all the evidence as that evidence will justify.\nIt was contended on behalf of the respondent that the jury may not have believed the testimony of these witnesses, whose credibility however was in no way impeached by her counsel, and the straightforwardness of whose evidence was testified to by the trial judge; that they may not have believed Mac-donald who said that he set and locked the switch for, the main line on the Saturday evening, and he was not cross-examined by the respondent's counsel,\u2014nor Jordan who on Sunday forenoon found the switch locked and set for the main line\u2014nor the train crew of train 2147. If the jury did not believe this evidence there is nothing in the verdict to shew it, for the negligence which they found was that the switch was not properly set and locked, which obviously refers to its condition at the time of the derailment and involves no necessary disbelief in the testimony of Macdonald and Jordan that it had been properly set and locked the evening previous and was so set and locked on the forenoon of Sunday. And this testimony was conclusively corroborated by the fact that train 2147 passed the switch safely at noon on Sunday going east, for had the switch been in the condition in which it was that evening at the time of the derailment, this train would unquestionably have been derailed.\nThe only possible difficulty to my mind is that it might perhaps be said that the open and unlocked condition of the switch at the time of the accident justified the inference that Macdonald, when he said that he had closed it the night before, and Jordan, when he testified that it was closed and locked between 10 and 11 of the forenoon of Sunday, were mistaken and should be discredited. That inference might have had some weight had train 2147 not passed the switch safely going east at noon on Sunday, but with this fact standing out I would not think that any jury would be justified in disregarding the positive evidence made by the appellant that the switch had been properly set and locked. Indeed the evidence as to the prior condition of the switch is all one way and is so strongly corroborated that it would seem almost a mockery if a verdict finding that the switch had not been properly set and locked when last used could be supported by suggesting that perhaps the jury had not believed this evidence. And, as I have already said, I construe the jury's answer as referring merely to the condition of the switch at the time of the accident and not to its previous condition that day and the evening before.\nI think that taken with what the learned trial judge said to the jury when they were recalled after discussion of objections to the charge, the jury's answer to question 2 must bear this construction. The learned trial judge said:\nI told you at the start of my charge that the plaintiff by a simple proof of the fact that this accident had occurred had imposed upon the company the onus of proving that it did not occur through its negligence. I think I made myself quite plain as to that. And it follows from that, of course, that if the company has not satisfied you that the accident did not occur through its negligence then it did not discharge that onus, and the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.\nThe appellant's counsel did not object to this direction, which, in my judgment, may I say so with deference, goes beyond what is incumbent on the defendant in such cases. See Christie v. Griggs [15] and Readhead v. Midland Ry. Co.[16]. But the jury being told that the simple proof of the accident imposed on the company the onus of proving that the accident did not occur through its negligence, and that if the company did not prove this the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict, naturally considered the open and unlocked switch which caused the accident as being itself the negligence they found against the defendant in answer to the first question, and that is the verdict they rendered.\nSo we have this result, if the respondent's contention is sound, that because the jury finds that the switch was unlocked and unset at the time of the accident, evidence of regular inspection of the switch, positive proof that when inspected that day it was locked and set for the main line, in fact evidence that the appellant used reasonable care and diligence and did all that human care and foresight could suggest to ensure the safety of its line, is all of no avail to rebut what obviously is a mere presumption under the rule res ipsa loquitur.\nI cannot concur in this result which would impose on the railway company the obligation of an insurer towards those who travel on its lines. For it is obvious that the best organized and most carefully guarded human systems may and do occasionally fail. But when the railway company has done all that human care and foresight can suggest to render its lines safe to the public and to its own employees, an occurrence like the one under consideration is as much a pure accident as is the breaking of an axle-tree through a hidden flaw in its welding. And where there has been, as here, regular and careful inspection of the switches of the railway, unless it be held that the appellant is obliged to have an employee in constant attendance at each of its switches, I must find that the appellant's evidence completely rebuts and destroys the prima facie case\u2014for it is only a prima facie case\u2014which results from the rule res ipsa loquitur. The respondent was thus without evidence of the negligence which she alleged and which was the very basis of her right of action, and the appellant was entitled to a verdict in its favour. Under these circumstances, the verdict for the respondent appears to me entirely perverse.\nI may add that at the argument I asked counsel for the appellant what criticism he had to make of the evidence adduced by the appellant. He said first that the conductor of Macdonald's train, whose duty it was, as well as of Macdonald himself, to see that the switch opened for that train had been properly closed and locked, should have been called to corroborate Macdonald. In view of the fact that possibly the conductor did not verify this, for otherwise he would no doubt have been called, his testimony would have been useless, and the learned counsel who had not even cross-examined Macdonald, should not therefore criticise the non calling of this conductor. A second criticism was that the appellant had not proved that no train since Macdonald's train had used this switch. The learned counsel probably forgot that he had himself proved this fact by putting in question and answer No. 224 of Irwin's testimony on discovery which read as follows:\u2014\nQ. When prior to the accident was the switch in question last operated? A. 17.20 K. July 5th, that would be 5.20 P.M.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the respondent's action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1920] 3 W.W.R. 909.\n[2] [1865] 3 H. & C. 596.\n[3] [1878] Ir.

L.R. 265) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial which dismissed the actions of the respective plaintiffs (respondents) The respondent Ash executed an agreement with the appellant to sell to him the stock and assets of a company. Appellant was to assume the liabilities and pay $5,900 in cash. Ash had collected a part of this amount from the other respondents to purchase stock in the company but never procured the stock. The respondents Best and Calvert brought action to recover from appellant the amounts due them.\nIn a schedule to the agreement of sale the liabilities of the company were given as $36,894, \u201cor thereabouts.\u201d Appellant was obliged to pay $857 more and claimed the right to deduct it from the amount payable to Ash. The trial judge acceded to this but on refusal to add Ash as a party he dismissed the two actions. In the Appellate Division Ash was added and judgment was given allowing Best and Calvert the amounts they respectively claimed. The Court held that Ash was a trustee of the amount payable by appellant who could not set off the $857 against it as the debts were not mutual. Beattie then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW.J. McCallum for the appellant.\nJ.J. Gray for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal and concur in the reasons for judgment stated by Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Canada against appellant in two actions alleged to have been consolidated, and founded upon an agreement dated the 27th day of May, 1919. That agreement was made between the respondent Ash as vendor, of the first part; appellant as purchaser, of the second part; and the Canadian Drill and Electric Box Company, Limited, thereinafter called \u201cThe Company\u201d of the third part,\nThe recitals set forth his acquisition of the business and assets of two companies and a sale thereof by him to the party of the third part which had by two agreements agreed to issue certain of its capital stock to said vendor who had agreed to pay certain liabilities therein referred to and that the company had purported to carry on business and had\nincurred certain obligations, and certain shares of its capital stock have been applied for, sold, issued or allotted or agreed to be sold, issued or allotted either by the company or the vendor, and the vendor has received certain monies from persons who subscribed for shares of the company\u2019s capital stock and has paid certain monies either to or for the company.\nAnd whereas the agreements hereinbefore mentioned have not been carried out and default has been made thereunder and the vendor is financially unable to carry out his part of the same and it is inexpedient for the company to insist on the performance of the same, and the company and the vendor have agreed to cancel the agreements between them.\nAnd whereas, on the representation, condition and understanding that at the date hereof the assets of the company are as set out in Schedule \u201cA\u201d attached hereto, and that the total liabilities or obligations of the company are as set out in Schedule \u201cB\u201d attached hereto, and upon all the said assets of the company being transferred and assigned to the purchaser and upon all the shares of the capital stock of the said company which have been sold, issued or allotted and all the interest of the vendor and any other persons in shares which have been agreed to be sold, issued, or allotted, being transferred and assigned to the purchaser or his nominee or nominees and upon the vendor releasing the company and the purchaser from all claims of every nature and kind whatsoever which he may have against the company or under the said agreements or any of them or otherwise howsoever, the purchaser herein called the party of the second part has agreed with the vendor and the company to enter into these presents.\nThe operative part of the agreement then proceeds in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements to set forth in most comprehensive terms that:\u2014 The vendor doth hereby grant, transfer, assign and set over unto the purchaser all his interest, if any, in the agreements hereinbefore mentioned and, in the shares of the capital stock of the said company which has been subscribed, applied for, sold, issued or allotted, or agreed to be sold, issued, or allotted, whether to the vendor himself or to any other person or persons.\nThe vendor hereby appointing the purchaser his attorney to transfer on the books of the company either in the name of the purchaser or his nominee or nominees, such of the shares as are owned by or as stand in the name of the vendor or in which he is interested in any way.\nAnd the vendor covenanting and agreeing to procure and deliver to the purchaser within thirty days valid and proper transfers or assignments of all shares owned by or standing in the name of, any other persons or in which such persons may be interested in any way.\nAnd the vendor further covenanting and agreeing to procure the execution and delivery by the company of these presents and the approval and ratification of the directors and shareholders of the same.\nAnd the vendor further waives all claims of every nature and kind whatsover which he may have against the company or under the said agreements or any of them or otherwise howsoever, and hereby releases and discharges the company and the purchaser from all obligations therefor and thereunder.\nThen:\u2014\nThe company doth hereby grant, transfer, assign and set over unto the purchaser all its right, title and interest, if any, in and to the agreements hereinbefore mentioned and its goodwill, chattels, stock, lands, buildings, fixtures, patents, formulas, blue prints, accounts and bills receivable and particularly the assets as set forth in the schedule \u201cA\u201d attached hereto, as well as all other assets and claims whatsoever.\nThat is followed by the covenant of the appellant now sued upon, which reads as follows:\u2014\nAnd in consideration of the foregoing the purchaser hereby covenants and agrees to assume the obligations and liabilities of the company as set forth in Schedule \u201cB\u201d attached hereto amounting to the sum of $36,894.38 or thereabouts, and to pay to the vendor or the various persons entitled thereto the sum of $5,900.00 upon receiving releases of their respective rights arising from the payment of money to the vendor, or transfers of the shares in the said company upon which the said amount has been paid by the persons making said payments or subscribing for shares. The respondent Ash presumed to assign $1,000, part of the said $5,900 to Best, his father\u2011in\u2011law, and to Calvert, his brother-in-law, the sum of $900.00 out of said $5,900.00.\nThen, as the evidence discloses in the following questions and answers\nQ. Did they instruct the bringing of these actions or did you? A. I instructed my solicitor to take action.\nQ. For them? A. Yes.\nhe instituted these actions in the respective names of his said friends.\nThe defendant, now appellant, set up that the liabilities represented in said schedule had substantially exceeded the total represented in said Schedule \u201cB\u201d and that in some respects the assets had fallen short of the total represented.\nThe learned trial judge arrived at the conclusion that these assignees could not maintain, as mere assignees of the chose in action, any action unless the covenantee Ash was added as party plaintiff.\nHe proceeded then at the close of the trial to set forth the difficulties in the way of such plaintiffs, even if Ash were added as a party attempting to recover, and, in any event, inasmuch as the covenant sued upon, had proceeded upon the implied covenant on the part of Ash, relative to the substantial correctness of the Schedules \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB,\u201d the defendant, now appellant, was entitled to have the balance, due under his covenant, reduced by the sum of $857.06, and such further sums as a reference might, if desired, disclose.\nHe then gave the plaintiffs a limited time to procure the consent of Ash to be so added.\nIt turned out, as represented later to the learned trial judge, that Ash had refused to give such consent. He then, quite properly, proceeded to dismiss the actions and in support of his judgment referred to relevant authorities which support the position he took.\nThereupon, the plaintiffs appealed to the court of appeal for Ontario, and, on the case coming up before the Second Appellate Division, that court properly held Ash was a necessary party, and he consented to be added accordingly.\nThe appellant seems to have consented to that being done.\nThe next question that thus arises was whether the said claim of $857.06 could be, as that court treats it, set off, or, as I prefer, set up by way of defence to the action on the covenant sued upon.\nIn my opinion an assignment of anything less than a whole chose in action does not entitle the assignee to sue, and these actions should, I submit with respect, have been dismissed on that ground, long before they were.\nThe statute enabling an assignee of a chose in action to sue, in my opinion, never was intended to enable the possessor of a valuable chose in action to issue a kind of currency, as it were, by dividing up his right into little bits and distributing them amongst his friends, and giving each of them a chance to worry and annoy the debtor.\nThe Second Division of the Appellate Court would seem also to have held, at first blush, something akin thereto, else it need never have insisted upon Ash being made a party plaintiff, as it seems to have directed.\nHaving, however, so directed and allowed the argument to proceed on that basis, it seems to be alleged by the judgment appealed from that counsel for appellant admitted or made some admission from which it had inferred as follows:\u2014 In the course of promoting the Canadian Drill and Electric Box Company, Limited, Ash went about seeking subscribers for shares, and obtained $5,900 of money which it now transpires he received as trustee for the subscribers in order that he might procure for them shares in the company. No shares were ever issued to these subscribers and Ash remained a trustee of the moneys which he had received and of the $5,900 payable by the defendant under the terms of the agreement in recoupment of these trust moneys which are traced to the defendant.\nThis situation does not appear to have been brought to the attention of the trial judge by counsel for the plaintiff and only transpired in the course of the argument in this court from the admissions of counsel for defendants in answer to questions from the court. This circumstance appears to me to be decisive of the controversy. The issue is as to the right to set off against the $5,900 due by defendant to Ash as trustee the over payment made by defendant on account of general liabilities, for repayment of which Ash is alleged to be personally responsible.\nThere is nothing in the respondents\u2019 case at the trial as presented in the evidence supporting same, or in reply to justify counsel in making any such admission and he stoutly asserts he never did.\nIt is difficult to see how, after all that had transpired in the trial court, and the contentions set up there and in appeal, that he should have done so, and given away his client\u2019s case.\nHe may no doubt in argument have conceded something not intended, as young men may almost concede anything and then be mistaken.\nI have no hesitation in holding that in such a case as is presented herein, counsel could not bind his client to something the document sued upon does not warrant him in conceding.\nI deal, therefore, only with the document and the relevant facts as disclosed at the trial.\nNothing appears therein to constitute a trust or a condition of things involving a trust and notice thereof to appellant. I fully agree with the law as set forth by the late Street J., one of the best of Ontario judicial authorities in law, in the following paragraph quoted by the judgment appealed from, as follows:\u2014\nIn all the cases since Tweddle v. Atkinson[2] in which a person not a party to a contract has brought an action to recover some benefit stipulated for him in it he has been driven, in order to avoid being shipwrecked upon the common law rule which confines such an action to parties and privies, to seek refuge under the shelter of an alleged trust in his favour: Mulholland v. Merriam[3] Re Empress Engineering Co.[4] Re Rotherham Alum Co.[5] Gandy v. Gandy[6] Hendersom v. Killey;[7] Osborne v. Henderson[8]; Robertson v. Lonsdale[9]\nAn examination of the authorities thus cited and what they demonstrate leads me to conclude that a covenantor who is a bare trustee need not be made a party to enable his cestuis que trustent to sue; that a covenant to pay to some third party a sum named, or fruit of something being contracted for, does not create such a trust as to entitle the third party to sue; and that the trustee may be made a party if the requirements of justice so demand.\nThe first of these decisions clearly indicates conclusively the legal truth of the first of the propositions I submit, and the foundation for the next of foregoing propositions is found in the others, as well as the reason for the last, which is merely a safeguard against injustice in executing the equities involved in some complicated cases.\nWith great respect I cannot agree with the deductions which the court below appears to have drawn from said decisions. One more point made on the argument for respondent was that the words \u201cor thereabouts\u201d in the covenant disposed of the claim. No authority was cited, and common sense would perhaps be the best. A trifling or comparatively insignificant sum, which I do not think $857.06 is, even in a large deal, might possibly be covered thereby. Abler judges than I have refused to go further, or so far, perhaps. The cases of Barker v. Windle[10], Davis v. Shepherd[11], and Oddie v. Brown[12], present the use of the phrase.\nThey seem to refer us to common sense.\nI think the learned trial judge was right and that his judgment should not have been disturbed, and that this appeal should be allowed with costs herein, and a reference as the learned trial judge offered be again offered if desired by either party, costs thereof to abide the event.\nDUFF J.\u2014The only question requiring discussion turns upon the effect of certain provisions in the agreement of the 27th May, 1919. Among other things it is provided as follows:\u2014\nWhereas on the representation, condition and understanding that at the date hereof * * * the total liabilities or obligations of the company are as set out in Schedule B attached hereto * * the purchaser * * * has agreed with the vendor to enter into these presents\n* * *\nAnd in consideration of the foregoing the purchaser hereby covenants and agrees to assume the obligations and liabilities of the company as set forth in Schedule B attached hereto amounting to the sum of $36,894.38 or thereabouts, and to pay to the vendor or the various persons entitled thereto the sum of $5,900 upon receiving releases of their respective rights arising from the payment of the money to the vendor, or transfers of the shares in the said company upon which the said amount has been paid by the persons making the said payments or subscribing for shares. The liabilities of the company proved in fact to include liabilities not mentioned in the schedule and to be in the aggregate considerably more than the sum mentioned, $36,894.38; the purchaser asserts the right to apply the sum of $5,900 mentioned in the paragraph above quoted in liquidation in part of these obligations.\nThe Appellate Division has held that the vendor was a trustee in respect of this sum of $5,900 because it was made up of sums which the appellant\u2019s counsel was understood to have admitted on the hearing of the appeal were owing by the vendor to various persons from whom he received them for the purpose of applying for and securing shares in the company, which shares were never issued; and the conclusion is drawn from these facts that the covenant contained in the paragraph quoted from the operative part of the agreement in respect of this $5,900 is a covenant entered into with the vendor as trustee for these persons and, consequently, it is said that no part of this sum can be diverted for the purpose of liquidating the undisclosed liabilities.\nWith respect, I think it is a debatable point whether the covenant in question is a covenant with the vendor as trustee. Assuming that he was accountable to other persons as trustee for these moneys which he received from them for a purpose which was never carried out, it would by no means necessarily follow that the purchaser was contracting with him as trustee. The true meaning of the contract may be that the purchaser agreed with the vendor to indemnify him against these obligations either by paying the vendor or by paying the vendor\u2019s creditors.\nHowever that may be, with great respect, the answer to the respondents\u2019 contention is to me abundantly clear that, assuming the covenant as regards this sum of $5,900 to be a covenant exacted by the vendor and entered into by the purchaser for the benefit of other persons, the rights of these other persons must depend upon the terms of the agreement and the rights of the beneficiaries in respect of the fruits of the enforcement of this covenant can be no higher than the rights given by the covenant itself. The beneficiaries\u2019 rights whatever they were as against the vendor, could not be affected by the covenant. The covenant itself takes its effect as part of the agreement in which it is found and gives such rights and only such rights as flow from that agreement.\nNow the recital quoted above makes the right of the vendor depend upon the condition that the representation mentioned is a true representation. Saving in so far as subsequent events may have affected the reciprocal rights of the parties, the condition expressed in the recital is an essential term of every obligation undertaken by the purchaser. Now, it is not suggested that anything has happened which has relieved the vendor and the beneficiaries from the exigency of this term to such a degree at all events as to deprive the purchaser of the right to set up the non-fulfilment of it as a defence pro tanto against any action on the covenant now sued upon.\nThe point made upon the words \u201cor thereabouts\u201d in the covenant is without substance. The recital shews that the agreement proceeds upon the representation that the liabilities and obligations of the company are set out in full in Schedule B. There is nothing in the words of the operative part of the agreement to qualify this, the words \u201cor thereabouts\u201d obviously being intended to qualify only the statement as to the aggregate amount of the liabilities and obligations mentioned. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division and I think justice will best be done by making an order in terms of the judgment offered by Mr. Justice Hodgins at the conclusion of the trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Whatever they may be, the rights of the original plaintiffs, Best and Calvert, or of the added plaintiff, Ash, as against the defendant Beatty in respect of the moneys sued for in these actions arise out of and are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement made between Ash and Beatty on the 27th of May, 1919. It is solely under that agreement that any liability exists against Beatty and he is entitled to insist on the terms on which he undertook it being fulfilled. These terms cannot be affected by the relationship between Ash and Best and Calvert.\nIt may be that the $5,900, if it should reach Ash, would in his hands be subject to a trust for the plaintiffs, Best and Calvert, and others. It does not follow that it was as a trustee that Beatty agreed to pay him this sum. But, assuming that to be the case, Beatty\u2019s undertaking to pay it would be subject to the conditions of the agreement whereby he assumed that obligation. Those conditions were, inter alia, that the company which Beatty was acquiring possessed certain assets as shewn in Schedule A to the agreement, and that its liabilities did not exceed $36,894.38 \u201cor thereabouts,\u201d as shewn in Schedule B. Beatty alleges breaches of both these conditions.\nAt common law a breach of either condition would preclude recovery on Beatty\u2019s covenant. But in equity on the defendant being put in the same position as if the conditions had been strictly observed by deducting from what he has undertaken to pay enough to make good the default, he may be required to pay the balance. The case is not one of set-off in the ordinary sense, but one of inability on the part of the plaintiffs to establish their claim until the conditions of the defendant\u2019s obligation have been fulfilled at their expense.\nUpon evidence warranting such a finding the learned trial judge held that Beatty\u2019s claim that the liabilities exceeded $36,894.38 by $857.06 was established. This amount is too large to be covered by such words as \u201cor thereabouts.\u201d Having been obliged to expend $857.06 to put himself in the position which he would have held had the condition as to the amount of the company\u2019s liabilities been fulfilled, Beatty\u2019s obligation to pay $5,900 to Ash \u201cor to various persons entitled thereto\u201d is pro tanto reduced. Having already paid $4,000 on this account, to \u201cvarious persons entitled thereto,\u201d subject to the further deductions which he asserts a right to make, there remains due from Beatty $1,900 less $857.06, or $1,042.94.\nThe defendant also claimed to deduct damages which he alleged he had sustained because certain assets included in Schedule A either did not fulfil representations made as to them or were subject to defects in title not disclosed. This claim was rejected by the learned trial judge on the ground that the evidence did not sufficiently support it and I am not prepared to overrule that finding.\nAnother deduction claimed referred to a sum of $425 owing by one Aylesworth to the company whose assets were acquired from Ash. This claim was for money advanced and the record contains a written acknowledgment of it by Aylesworth. All that appears in evidence about this item is a statement by Beatty that Aylesworth demurred when asked by him to pay it on the grounds that he had lost money and time through his connection with the company and that Ash had personally claimed this sum from him. But it is not proved that Beatty is unable to collect this sum from Aylesworth\u2014still less that it was not a valid asset of the company. Ash was not asked about it when he gave evidence. The learned trial judge makes no reference to this claim of the defendant, probably either because it was not pressed upon him or because he thought it could not be seriously contended that the evidence established it.\nThe sole deduction to which the defendant is entitled, therefore, is the sum of $857.06. The disposition of the case proposed by the learned trial judge in his opinion of the 12th December, 1919, seems to have been correct and should now be directed.\nThe appellant is entitled to have his costs in this court and the Appellate Division paid him by the respondents.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This case has caused very serious misunderstandings. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge expressed his willingness to maintain the action in part if the plaintiffs Best and Calvert would bring into the case G.P. Ash as co-plaintiff with them. But the trial judge having ascertained that the plaintiffs had declined to add Ash as a party plaintiff, later on dismissed the action.\nThen in the Appellate Division counsel for the plaintiffs stated that he had been misunderstood by the trial judge and that he was willing to add Ash as a co\u2011plaintiff; he applied to the Appellate Division for an order making Ash co\u2011plaintiff, and the case was argued. It was contended in appeal that Ash acted with regard to the sum of $5,900 which Beatty undertook to pay by agreement of the 27th of May, 1919, as trustee and that no deduction could be claimed from that sum for non-fulfilment on the part of Ash of obligations which he contracted in virtue of this agreement.\nThe Appellate Division declared that in the course of the argument and from admissions of counsel for Beatty in answer to questions from the court, it appeared that the said sum of $5,900 was trust money and that this sum could not be set off against claims that Beatty could claim against Ash personally.\nAs a result the plaintiffs\u2019 actions were maintained by the Appellate Division.\nNow Beatty appeals to this court and his counsel virtually states that he never made any admissions which would justify the inferences drawn by the court below.\nIt seems to me that all these misunderstandings which have arisen, as well before the trial judge as before the Appellate Division, should have been brought formally to the attention of the judge or of the court before whom the consent or admissions have taken place.\nIf a judgment is rendered upon alleged refusals or admissions which have, according to the views against whom they were invoked, never occurred, then they should bring the matter before the tribunal where the alleged refusals or admissions have been made, in order that the matter be more conveniently discussed and dealt with.\nNone of the parties however in this case have been willing to adopt this procedure and the appellant now asks relief from this court. The respondent claimed at first that we had no jurisdiction, at least in the case of Calvert, because the amount in controversy did not exceed $1,000. (Sec. 48 Supreme Court Act).\nIt is to be noticed that the real plaintiff, according to the judgment of the court below, is the trustee Ash and that the two actions have been consolidated. The defendant Beatty has a judgment against him for an amount exceeding $1,000, viz., $1,962.72.\nIn these circumstances, this court has jurisdiction.\nAs to the merits of the appeal, I have not been able to find in the record the evidence that Ash was acting as trustee for the persons who, like Best and Calvert, purchased shares in the company in question. This item of $5,900 should be treated in the same way as the rest of the purchase price.\nAs Ash has not fulfilled the conditions of his agreement, the appellant may raise successfully this issue in an action to recover part of the purchase price.\nThe appellant Beatty claims that he could recover from the plaintiff Ash a sum of $857.06 alleged to be due by him for excess liability which he paid for Ash\u2019s benefit. This sum should be deducted from the amount which he still owes to Ash.\nThere is also a sum of $425 which he claims should be deducted from the $5,900.00. As to this claim of $425.00 the evidence is not complete and the matter should be referred to the Master.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Ash, having been added as co-plaintiff in the Appellate Division, the question was whether, under the agreement between Ash and Beatty, the latter, being sued by Best and Calvert in two separate actions for amounts claimed to be due to Best and Calvert as transferees of Ash by virtue of this agreement, could set off against the plaintiff, the sum of $857.06, being the amount paid by him, Beatty, in excess of $36,894.00, the amount represented to him as the liabilities of the Canadian Drill and Electric Box Company, whose assets were sold by Ash to Beatty. The sale agreement in question represented that the liabilities of this company were $36,894.38 or thereabouts, as set out in a schedule attached to the agreement, and Beatty paid liabilities amounting to $857.06 in excess of this amount. The amount payable by him to Ash by virtue of this agreement was $5,900.00. The two actions were for $1,000.00 and $900.00 respectively as a part of this price, and against these actions Beatty claimed that he was entitled to set off the said sum of $857.06.\nThe Appellate Division refused him this right of set-off for the following reasons which I quote from the judgment of Mr. Justice Masten:\u2014\nIn the course of promoting the Canadian Drill and Electric Box Company, Limited, Ash went about seeking subscribers for shares, and obtained $5,900 of money which it now transpires he received as trustee for the subscribers in order that he might procure for them shares in the company. No shares were ever issued to these subscribers and Ash remained a trustee of the moneys which he had received and of the $5,900 payable by the defendant under the terms of the agreement in recoupment of these trust moneys which are traced to the defendant.\nThis situation does not appear to have been brought to the attention of the trial judge by counsel for the plaintiff and only transpired in the course of the argument in this Court from the admissions of counsel for defendants in answer to questions from the court. This circumstance appears to me to be decisive of the controversy. The issue is as to the right to set off against the $5,900 due by defendant to Ash as trustee the overpayment made by defendant on account of general liabilities, for repayment of which Ash is alleged to be personally responsible. In other words what is claimed is to set off against a debt due to Ash as trustee a claim against him personally. But these are not mutual debts and could not be set off in law or equity. Ambrose v. Fraser [13]\nThe plaintiffs are therefore entitled to recover the full amount claimed without any set off or deduction in respect of the claim of $857.06.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that while undoubtedly a debt due by a person personally cannot be set off against a claim made by him as trustee, this legal principle is without application in this case. Best and Calvert and their co-plaintiff Ash sue for something alleged to be due under this sale agreement between Ash and Beatty. It was a condition and representation of this agreement that the liabilities assumed by Beatty amounted to $36,894.38 or thereabouts, and notwithstanding this condition and representation Beatty had to pay $857.06 in excess of this amount. It is therefore immaterial whether Ash was or was not a trustee for third parties as to the amount payable by Beatty under the agreement. The actions are for an amount due by Beatty as price of this sale and are founded on the agreement which contains this condition and representation. The defence of set-off of Beatty is also based on this agreement. Therefore if Ash or his assignees claim under the agreement, they can be met by any defence arising out of its terms, and it matters not whether they sue as trustees or otherwise, I am therefore of opinion that the defence of set\u2011off was open to Beatty.\nI had some doubts whether the excess amount paid by Beatty could come within the words \u201cor thereabouts.\u201d But, on reflection, I have come to the conclusion that the difference is too substantial to permit us to exclude it under so vague a clause. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division and the judgment should be in the terms of the opinion of Hodgins J.A., dated the 12th December, 1919.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamport, Ferguson and McCallum.\nSolicitor for the respondents: T.T.

An employee was injured and brought action against the respondent. The appellant, in pursuance of a condition of the policy, assumed the defence. During the trial, the appellant learned, by the respondent's own admission, that the machine which caused the accident had been unguarded in breach of a condition of the application and of the policy. But the appellant continued the defence down to judgment awarding damages to the employee. The respondent brought this action to recover the amount paid by him. The appellant pleaded that owing to the respondent's breach of the condition of the policy, it was relieved from liability.\nHeld, that the appellant company, having assumed and continued the defence with knowledge of the fact that the machine was unguarded, waived any right to dispute liability under the policy for such breach of condition.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (13 Sask. L.R. 405) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Haultain C.J. at the trial and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nP. E. Mackenzie K.C. for the appellant.\nG. H. Yule for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant insured respondent against loss from the liability imposed by law upon the assured for damages on account of bodily injuries accidentally suffered, while the policy was in force, by an employee while within the factory and in and during the operation of the trade or business described in a specified schedule.\nThere appear as usual numerous conditions limiting appellant's liability.\nAnd indorsed on the policy was the following:\nIndorsement to be attached to and forming part of Manufacturers' Liability Policy No. M. 165, Modern Laundry.\nNotwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, it is hereby understood and agreed that all mangling machines owned and operated by the assured shall be provided with fixed guards or safety feed tables, adjusted at the point of contact of the rolls so as to prevent the fingers or hands of the employees from being drawn into the rolls, and that such guards shall be maintained during the term of this policy. Any failure on the part of the assured to provide and maintain such guards shall relieve this company from liability on account of personal injuries due to such neglect, and this policy is accepted by the assured accordingly.\nDated at Winnipeg, Man., this 6th day of February, 1914.\nThe Western Canada Accident and\nGuarantee Insurance Company.\n(Sgd.) A. F. W. Severin,\nManager and Secretary.\nThe main questions raised herein are whether or not the said provision can be waived or the appellant estopped from setting it up against respondent in answer to this suit upon said policy, and whether or not, in either such case, the facts relied upon establish in law either waiver or estoppel.\nA young woman working at a mangle in respondent's laundry was injured by her fingers being drawn into the rolls.\nThe contention set up by appellant was and is that the mangle in question was not guarded in the manner specified and hence no action can lie.\nThe factum for the respondent claims that there is no evidence from which it can be inferred that the absence of a guard was the immediate cause of the accident.\nI confess I am unable to find in the evidence any necessary connection between absence of the guard and the accident. But the parties concerned seem to have assumed there was. The case seems to have been argued out on that assumption.\nI may be permitted to point out the difference between the language of the above quoted condition and the terms of the local statutes which provide for the protection of employees thus:\u2014\n17. No person shall keep a factory so that the safety of any person employed therein is endangered or so that the health of any person employed therein is likely to be permanently injured.\n19. In every factory:\u2014(a) All dangerous parts of mill gearing machinery * * * shall be, so far as practicable, securely guarded.\nThe words of this section 19 only require that the\nmachinery shall be, so far as practicable, securely guarded.\nThe condition indorsed on the policy and herein relied upon is in form absolutely imperative by requiring\nguards, * * * so adjusted at the point of contact of the rolls so as to prevent the fingers or hands of the employees from being drawn into the rolls. This feature of the condition must be borne in mind when we are asked to consider that the appellant had no notice of the actual fact of a want of guard.\nIn the report of the respondent to appellant of the nature of the accident and probable cause which was made on the form supplied by appellant, we find the following question and answer:\u2014\n35. Narrate below how accident happened, its cause, etc., and illustrate by any marked rough sketch which you think will enable the cause of the accident to be easily understood:\nGirl was ironing handkerchiefs and odds and ends. It is figured out that the ring on her finger caught in the fabric and the rolls took her hand in on to the heated ironing surface before hand was released, was turned.\nHow could appellant relying, if its present pretensions are well founded, upon such a clause as quoted above by way of limitation of its obligation, fail to discern instantly on reading such an answer that there was no guard such as called for?\nIt seems to me inconceivable that any one knowing and relying upon such a condition could read said statement of the nature of the accident and not have his attention aroused thereby. I can conceive of his feeling that no known guard could have prevented it.\nIts next or concurrent step was to send its agent, Sinclair, who was such a trusted agent as to be the same man who had countersigned the policy in question and given it vitality a few months previously, to make inquiries on its behalf into all that was involved.\nHe was shewn the place and how the accident happened, and returned and had further discussion, according to respondent's evidence. And, according to the foreman's evidence, he was told the machine was running in the same condition at the time of the accident. It was unguarded. Trotter, the manager of appellant's local agency, came later, as I infer, and was told by the mother of the injured employee that the machine was unguarded. Trotter pretends he does not recollect, but admits it was possible she had done so.\nSeverin, the general manager of the appellant, was examined for discovery, and part of his said examination was put in evidence.\nHe was asked and answered thus:\u2014\nQ. Who were your authorized agents at Saskatoon. A. Willoughby-Sumner & Company.\nQ. Was there a Mr. Sinclair connected with that company? A. There was in 1914.\nThat examination disclosed a mass of correspondence which passed between him and appellant's head office and the local agency, which leads me to the conclusion that the appellant abandoned, if it ever had any intention of relying upon, such a defence as now set up, and instead to take its chance in preference thereto of defending the action the employee might bring against the respondent.\nAnd when that action was brought the appellant was notified by respondent and the former asserted its right under the policy to defend same.\nIt entrusted the defence to a firm of solicitors of whom one was called and produced the appellant's letter of instructions to defend.\nThat letter clearly indicates that, instead of raising any question such as involved in the condition in question, the appellant could by defending the action try to defeat the employee in that action by relying on her having worn a heavy ring and thus being drawn in, and the law which shewed she had assumed the risk, despite the law for her protection. I cannot understand and I am not at all inclined to believe the assertion or contention that the writer of such a letter did not well know and understand all the foregoing facts, tending to prove that it was by that time well understood by the appellant that there were no such guards in use as required at the time of the accident, or for a long time before the policy issued, as required either by the local statute or the more rigid terms of the condition indorsed on the policy.\nThe solicitor says, after producing said letter:\nI assumed machinery was unguarded from letter from defendant instructing me. I discussed question of guard having been removed with Severin before trial.\nI agree with him that the clear inference from the letter of instructions indicates as much and in face of his disclosure as to discussing the question of absence of guards with Mr. Severin before the trial, I am unable to understand why the trial was gone on with unless upon the assumption that Severin had for the appellant elected his chance of defeating the employee to his then chance of defeating respondent in such an action as this.\nThere is abundant evidence I think that the respondent was induced by the action of the appellant to change his position, by reason of the course of conduct of appellant, to his detriment. And I am of the opinion that it is thereby estopped from setting up the condition relied upon.\nI might have mentioned the contribution by appellant to redress the wrong the employee had suffered, which never should have been made if it had any thought of turning round on respondent and setting up the condition in question. Hence I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal was right in allowing the appeal on the main issue and in regard to the cross-appeal which arose out of such contributions.\nThey, in any other light than as flowing from appellant's election to abandon its condition, might be treated as voluntary payments and hence not recoverable.\nThe allowance of the costs of defence in pursuing such a course of conduct is, if possible, still more indefensible.\nThe cases cited in The Atlas Assurance Co. v. Brownell[2], proceed on the want of authority in those concerned and are clearly distinguishable from this where the general manager is ultimately the authority who made the election to abandon the condition.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014After carefully considering the evidence I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed. I think the weight of evidence supports the view contended for on behalf of the respondent that the appellant company assumed the defence of Miss Oxenham's action with the knowledge that the basis of the claim was, in part at all events, the fact that the machine she was tending was unguarded and that there was no misrepresentation of fact by the respondent as to the state of the machine.\nThe defence having been assumed in such circumstances and persisted in down to the trial with the acquiescence of the respondent, there is, I think, ample evidence to support the inference, and that I think is the right inference, that the company agreed to assume responsibility under the policy. The agreement of the respondent by which the control of the proceedings and negotiations for settlement, if there should be any, were delivered over to the company is a sufficient consideration.\nThere is, I think, not the slightest ground for suggesting that the company's officials were not acting with the authority of the company; and I can see no ground whatever for doubting that the company is bound by the agreement.\nThe case does not raise any of the nice points that sometimes arise when a claim is founded upon election, estoppel or waiver taking effect on equitable principles.\nAnglin J.\u2014Assuming in the appellant company's favour that, but for its continued conduct of the defence in the action of Oxenham v. Parrott after becoming aware by Parrott's own admission that the machine on which Oxenham was injured was unguarded, it would have had a good defence to Parrot's claim in this action for indemnity under the policy held by him on the ground that accidents in the use of unguarded machinery were not within the risk, its continuation of that defence down to judgment estops it in my opinion from now setting up that answer to this action. Its right to conduct Parrott's defence to the Oxenham claim existed only if and because the injury to Oxenham was within the risk covered by its policy.\nOn becoming aware of the fact which it now alleges excluded Parrott's liability to Oxenham from that risk, it had an election to repudiate liability to Parrott and decline further to carry on his defence or to accept such liability and continue that defence. Its action in continuing the defence would seem to be unequivocal and to import an election to undertake liability upon its policy. But it was at all events conduct from which Parrott was justified in assuming that it had so determined and that he therefore need not concern himself with the Oxenham claim\u2014either to defend that action or to endeavour to settle it.\nJudgment was recovered by Oxenham for $1,400.09. Parrott's evidence is that he believed he could have effected a settlement of the action for $700, and circumstances detailed in the evidence indicate a probability that a settlement could have been effected for a sum substantially less than $1,400. The principles enunciated in the judgment of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in the leading case of Clough v. London and North Western Rly. Co.[3], delivered by Mellor J., but written by Blackburn J. as he tells us in Scarf v. Jardine[4], and approved in Morrison v. Universal Marine Ins. Co.[5], govern this case.\nAssuming that the fact that Oxenham was injured on an unguarded machine excluded any claim in respect thereof from its policy, the appellant company had a right of election either to repudiate or to accept liability therefor. With full knowledge of that fact, if it did not actually elect to do so\u2014Scarf v. Jardine\u20144, it so acted as to create the impression that it accepted responsibility. The position of the respondent\u2014the other party to the contract\u2014was affected. He took no step to protect himself because lulled into security by the belief, induced by the company's action, that it would indemnify him against whatever judgment Oxenham might recover. Prejudice sufficient to support an estoppel would seem to be implied in these circumstances. Ogilvie v. West Australian Mortgage and Agency Corporation[6]; Knights v. Wiffen[7]. After Oxenham had recovered judgment the respondent had no chance to avoid payment of the damages thereby awarded. The burden lies on the appellant company, whose conduct lulled the respondent to rest, to shew that he could not have escaped any part of that liability after the time when its officers learned the fact that the machine on which Oxenham was injured was unguarded. Dixon v. Kennaway & Co.[8].\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMignault J.\u2014I am inclined to think that the fact that the mangling machine by which Miss Oxenham was injured was unguarded, notwithstanding that the respondent had declared that all machinery would be provided with proper guards, was a breach of the conditions of the policy issued to him by the appellant at a lower premium than if the risk insured were against accidents caused by unguarded machinery, and that for this reason the appellant could have been relieved from liability under the policy. But the question here is whether the appellant is now entitled to repudiate liability for this breach of contract, in view of the fact that when the respondent was sued by the mother of Miss Oxenham, the appellant undertook to contest the latter's claim with the result that a judgment was recovered against the respondent for $1,409.09, which the latter has paid and now seeks to recover from the appellant. The respondent states that if he had been left free to compromise the claim against him, he could have settled it for $700. Mrs. Oxenham, at the trial, swore that she refused an offer of $100 made on behalf of the appellant, but that she offered to the respondent to settle for $700 and would have done so.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, who tried the case, stated that the appellant may be held to have first had knowledge of the unguarded condition of the mangling machine at the time the solicitor for the plaintiff in the Oxenham action became aware of the fact on the examination for discovery of Parrott. The learned Chief Justice however considered that the appellant having under the policies the right to defend the action, the fact that it continued to do so after having obtained this knowledge, did not suggest any waiver of the conditions of the policy.\nThe Court of Appeal being of opinion that this conduct involved waiver of any right to dispute liability under the policy and that the position of Parrott had been prejudiced by the conduct of the appellant in contesting the Oxenham action, when he, Parrott, could have settled for one-half of the amount he was eventually condemned to pay, reversed the judgment the learned trial judge had rendered in favour of the appellant.\nThe only construction, in my opinion, that can be placed on the conduct of the appellant in defending the Oxenham action on behalf of the respondent is that it assumed liability under the policy, for this was its obligation by virtue of the contract it made with the respondent. So far as this conduct was induced by its ignorance of Parrott's breach of con- tract, it could not be set up by the latter against the appellant. But when the appellant discovered this breach, which entitled it to repudiate liability under the policy, it was placed on its election between repudiating liability and treating the policy as existing between Parrott and itself. It was then that it should have made its election and given notice thereof to Parrott. By continuing with full knowledge of the breach to contest the action it elected to treat the policy as existing. From that point of view it would not seem necessary to shew that the respondent was prejudiced by the continuance of the defence set up by the appellant against the Oxenham action, but the existence of this prejudice strengthens the respondent's contention that, notwithstanding his breach of contract, the appellant should be held to have elected to treat the contract as still existing. And the least that can be said is that the appellant so conducted itself as to give Parrott reason to believe that it had elected to continue the policy and thus prevented him from making the best terms possible with Mrs. Oxenham.\nI do not think that under the law of contract there can be any doubt that when a breach of contract by one of the contracting parties occurs, the other party can elect to rescind the contract or to continue it notwithstanding the breach, and if it elects to continue the contract, it is held to all the covenants therein contained. I may perhaps on this point be permitted to refer to my judgment in American National Red Cross v. Geddes Bros.[9], in which, although I wrote a dissenting opinion, there was, as I understand it, no dissent as to this legal proposition which rests on very solid authority: Clough v. London & Northwestern Ely. Co.[10]; Scarf v. Jardine[11]; Frost v. Knight[12]; Johnstone v. Milling[13].\nApplying therefore this rule, I must find that the appellant, which could have repudiated liability when it acquired knowledge of the unguarded condition of the mangling machine, elected not to do so by continuing to contest in the respondent's name the Oxenham action. And therefore I think it cannot now set up the breach as a defence to the respondent's action claiming to be reimbursed for what he was forced to pay to Mrs. Oxenham, the more so as the conduct of the appellant in continuing to contest the Oxenham action after knowledge of the breach, caused a prejudice to the respondent by preventing him from effecting an advantageous compromise with Mrs. Oxenham.\nMy impression is that some forms of guarantee policies expressly state that the defence by the company of any action taken against the insured shall not be deemed an admission of liability under the policy. There is nothing of the kind here, and the conduct of the appellant distinctly shews that it recognized its liability towards the respondent.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCraney, Mackenzie & Hutchinson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G, H.

Idington J. dissents.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the conviction of the appellant on an indictment for murder.\nThe appellant being put on trial pleaded that he was insane when the crime was committed. Subject to this defence the crime was proved.\nThe trial judge in charging the jury instructed them that the onus of proving insanity was on the prisoner and that such defence must be established \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The appeal Division having already decided in 1818 in The King v. Kierstead[1] that this was a proper charge the trial judge refused an application for a reserved case based on it as a misdirection and the Appeal Division refused to direct that he should grant it. In a case of Rex v. Anderson[2], the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta had, in 1814, held that such a charge was misdirection arid the prisoner applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of the amendment of the Criminal Code passed in 1920 being 10-11 Geo. V, ch. 43, sec. 16. This amendment authorizes a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave to appeal to that Court where provincial courts have given conflicting decisions on a question of criminal law. The leave was granted in this case the effect of which was that the judge granting it held that it can be granted where the court below is unanimous (if not the amendment would be unnecessary, as if there is dissent in the court below an appeal would lie as of right) and also that the refusal of the provincial court to direct the trial judge to reserve a case is an affirmance of the conviction under sec. 1024 C.C.\nW. P. Jones K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. Wallace K.C. for the respondent referred to Rex v. Beard[3].\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was indicted for murder and convicted thereof. The defence set up was insanity. The facts bearing upon his actual commission of the crime charged seem to have been of such a conclusive character as to leave no room for doubt of his guilt unless he could be excused on the ground of insanity, or rather a doubt of his sanity which is sought to serve the same purpose. Stripped of undue verbiage confusing or tending to confuse the mind, the issue raised is whether or not if there might have been or ought to have been created by the evidence adduced a doubt as to his sanity in the minds of the jurors who tried him, then he should have been acquitted.\nThe law in Canada ever since the enactment of the Criminal Code of 1892, is that declared by section 11 thereof continued in section 19 of the Criminal Code, chapter 146 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1906, as follows:\u2014\n19. No person shall be convicted of an offence by reason of an act done or omitted by him when labouring under natural imbecility, or disease of the mind, to such an extent as to render him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission, and of knowing that such an act or omission was wrong.\n2. A person labouring under specific delusions, but in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity, under the provisions hereinafter contained, unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of some state of things which, if it existed, would justify or excuse his act or omission.\n3. Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.\nIn submitting the question of appellant's sanity to the jury, the learned trial judge told them that the burden was placed upon the accused to make out his insanity at the' time of the commission of the offence, beyond a reasonable doubt.\nInasmuch as that precise form of direction had been then recently, unanimously approved by the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick in the case of The King v. Kierstead[4], the learned trial judge refused to reserve a case for said court, founded upon the objection that there was error in so charging the jury. That court upon appeal thereto decided to abide by its ruling in said case and refused to interfere. The Court of Appeal for Alberta in a similar case of The King v. Anderson[5], having, in 1914, by a bare majority decided that a charge using similar language to that now in question, was erroneous and granted a new trial, the appellant obtained from my brother Anglin leave to appeal to this court, under and by virtue of chapter 43, section 16, of the Dominion Statutes of 1920, which provides as follows:\u2014\n16. The following section is inserted immediately after section one thousand and twenty-four of the said Act:\n1024a. Either the Attorney-General of the province or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence, if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case,\nand continues to provide for a judge of this court giving in such case leave to appeal.\nIt has been argued before us not only that there is a substantial conflict between the judgment in question and that in the Anderson Case5, but also that the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in Davis v. United States[6], is the correct view to adopt.\nThe head note to that report is as follows:\u2014\nIf it appears on the trial of a person accused of committing the crime of murder, that the deceased was killed by the accused under circumstances which\u2014nothing else appearing\u2014made a case of murder, the jury cannot properly return a verdict of guilty of the offence charged if, upon the whole evidence, from whichever side it comes, they have a reasonable doubt whether, at the time of killing, the accused was mentally competent to distinguish between right and wrong, or to understand the nature of the act he was committing.\nNo man should be deprived of his life under the forms of law unless the jurors who try him are able, upon their consciences, to say that the evidence before them, by whomsoever adduced, is sufficient to shew beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged. Such is the result of an argument in which about a hundred authorities were cited, and many of them are referred to in the judgment of the court.\nSuch is, as it seems to me, the drift and probable result of accepting the law as laid down in the Anderson Case[7], in preference to that by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal.\nThe grave consequences of our so deciding would be almost tantamount to repealing the above quoted enactment of our Code, obviously designed to put an end to what was presumably an undesirable state of our law as administered, and place it upon clear and, but for what has happened, I should have supposed unmistakable grounds.\nIn the Anderson Case7, Mr. Justice Stuart was, I respectfully submit, apparently unable to define the difference between a defence to the \"satisfaction of the jury\" or \"dearly proven\" and one \"beyond reasonable doubt.\"\nAnd, with great respect, I cannot see how, for a moment, the protection thrown around a prisoner is, as he suggests, necessarily interfered with by the due limitation of the defence set up.\nMr. Justice Beck cited therein as authority Cyc's definition which tends in same direction as ultimately decided in the Davis Case[8] I refer to above.\nNone of the other authorities which he cites, to my mind, I respectfully submit, when closely examined and considered, really touch the kernel of what is involved herein.\nOn the other hand such decisions as Chief Justice Harvey relies upon, aptly present the identical view he took of the Anderson case, as that which had been presented by eminent judges in England, using the phrase \"beyond reasonable doubt\" in the same sense in relation to the proof of insanity as did the learned trial judge in that case.\nHe cited Bellingham's Case, decided in 1812; referred to in Russell on Crimes (7th ed.) at page 65; Reg. v. Stokes[9], decided in 1848, only five years after McNaghten's Case[10], by Baron Rolfe, who had been appointed to the Exchequer Chamber in 1839 and hence possibly one of the judges called to answer the question in the McNaghten Case10, and (though best known as a leader of the Chancery Bar) had had considerable experience in criminal trials as recorder of Bury St. Edmunds, and in presiding at the trial of many notable criminal cases; and the case of Rex v. Jefferson[11], where Mr. Justice Bigham, as late as 1908, charged the jury in the same terms as now objected to.\nAnd although that case went to appeal no one ever thought of raising such a ground as now taken herein. Why so unless clearly untenable?\nThe truth would seem to be that the law as laid down in the McNaghten Case10, that in order to establish the defence, on the ground of insanity, it must be \"clearly proven\" and that \"to the satisfaction of the jury\" has always been, for at least a hundred years the law in England; and that it has been so presented to juries concerned in the language now complained of without challenge.\nMr. Tremear, in the second edition of his work on our code, in his notes upon the section thereof now in question, says that it was in the draft code prepared by the Imperial Commission, but never adopted by parliament. Law seemingly was found to be more stabilized, as it were; in England without a code, than in some other countries with one.\nThat, however, is no reason for our departing from our criminal code which seems to me in its terms to be more imperatively adverse to the appellants contention in its terms than the logical result of the judicially made law of England.\nThe word \"satisfaction\" has given to it, in Murray's Dictionary, as one of its many meanings, the following :\n6. Release from suspense, uncertainty, or uneasiness (J.); information that answers a person's demands or needs, removal of doubt, conviction.\nPhrase, to (a person's) satisfaction.\nI am unable to find the thing proved, as our Code so expressly requires, unless it is so beyond reasonable doubt. I should dislike very much to hold any man proved insane, either in a civil or criminal proceeding. unless I could do so beyond reasonable doubt.\nAnd I venture to think that the safety and protection of society is just as important as is the protection of a member thereof, when that member is placed upon trial. On the one hand he or she has been most justly protected for ages by the use of a judicial formula, as it were, lest passion and prejudice should prevail and injustice be done.\nAnd in relation to the defence of insanity, those who have given thought to the matter at all, must realize how easy it has been and still is to abuse the defence by suggestions, for example, of temporary insanity, and mislead those moved by pity or passion, to the deterioration of the due administration of justice.\nI respectfully submit that society as a whole is quite as much entitled to be protected as a single member thereof. Such illustrations as proof of an alibi, which forms part of the evidence of the actual facts pro and con, bearing upon the issue raised relative to the actual perpetration of the offence in question, are quite beside the collateral substantive issue of mental and moral responsibility.\nThat is only permitted to be raised as a defence in law to the actual commission of the offence when rebutting the presumption of sanity declared by said section until the insanity is proved.\nThe charge against an accused person should in regard to the acceptance of and weight to be given the evidence of fact for or against him or her so far as bearing upon the actual offence charged, be kept clearly and distinctly severable from the defence of insanity, and each of the issues thus raised be given its own proper place in the presentation thereof, made by the judge's charge, or otherwise.\nIt must be determined first whether or not upon the evidence bearing upon the actual perpetration of the offence, the accused can be found \"beyond reasonable doubt\" guilty, and then due consideration be given to the alternative of whether or not at the time in question the accused was of sound mind within the meaning of the statute and that finding must be subject to the like limitations of proof \"beyond reasonable doubt.\"\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014On the trial of an accused person indicted for murder where the defence of insanity is set up, it is incumbent upon the accused in order to negative his responsibility for an act otherwise criminal to prove to the satisfaction of the jury that he was insane at the time he committed the act. Mcnaghten's Case[12], and Criminal Code, section 19, subsec. 3. The trial judge told the jury that they ought to convict the prisoner unless the defence of insanity was established by the prisoner beyond a reasonable doubt, and he added:\nIf you entertain any reasonable doubts as to the sanity of the prisoner at the time he committed the act, why then it is your duty to convict.\nThis direction was, in my opinion, an erroneous one and calculated to mislead the jury.\nBroadly speaking, in civil proceedings the burden of proof being upon a party to establish a given allegation of fact, the party on whom the burden lies is not called upon to establish his allegation in a fashion so rigorous as to leave no room for doubt in the mind of the tribunal with whom the decision rests. It is, generally speaking, sufficient if he has produced such a preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion he seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the possible views of the facts. This proposition is referred to by Mr. Justice Willes in Cooper v. Slade[13], in these words:\nThe elementary proposition that in civil cases the preponderance of probability may constitute sufficient ground for the verdict.\nThe distinction in this respect between civil and criminal cases is fully explained in a judgment of Mr. Justice Patteson speaking for the Judicial Committee in the case of Doe d. Devine v. Wilson[14], The whole passage is so instructive and so apt that it is worth while reproducing it in full:\u2014\nNow, there is a great distinction between a civil and a criminal case, when a question of forgery arises. In a civil case the onus of proving the genuineness of a deed is cast upon the party who pro- duces it, and asserts its validity. If there be conflicting evidence as to the genuineness, either by reason of alleged forgery, or otherwise, the party asserting the deed must satisfy the jury that it is genuine. The jury must weigh the conflicting evidence, consider all the probabilities of the case, not excluding the ordinary presumption of innocence, and must determine the question according to the balance of those probabilities. In a criminal case the onus of proving the forgery is cast on the prosecutor who asserts it, and unless he can satisfy the jury that the instrument is forged to the exclusion of reasonable doubt, the prisoner must be acquitted.\nNow, the charge of the learned judge appears to their Lordships to have in effect shifted the onus from the defendants, who assert the deed, to the plaintiff, who denies it, for in substance he tells the jury that whatever be the balance of the probabilities, yet, if they have a reasonable doubt the defendants are to have the benefit of that doubt, and the deed is to be established even against the probabilities in favour of the doubt. Certainly, it has been the practice so to direct the jury in a criminal case; whether on motives of public policy or from tenderness to life and liberty, or from any other reason, it may not be material to inquire, but none of those reasons apply to a cicil case. If, indeed, by the pleadings in a civil case, a direct issue of forgery or not, be raised, the onus would lie on the party asserting the forgery, and this would be more like a criminal proceeding, but even then the reasons for suffering a doubt to prevail against the probabilities, would not, in their Lordships' opinion, apply.\nThis exposition of the distinction between the two classes of cases brings out the point that the rule in criminal cases is a rule based upon policy.\nThe distinction may be illustrated by reference to another class of proceedings in which a similar rule applies, namely, proceedings to establish illegitimacy and proceedings in which the validity of a de facto marriage is called in question. Where a child is born of a married mother and husband and wife have had access during the relevant period the presumption of legitimacy is of such a character that it can only be overcome by evidence producing in the mind of the tribunal a moral certainty. And this moral certainty is contrasted by Lord Lyndhurst in a celebrated passage in Morris v. Davies[15], with a conclusion reached by weighing the probabilities and resting upon a mere balance of probabilities. The like rule prevails where a marriage having been solemnized, there have been cohabitation and issue and a question arises as to whether the marriage ceremony was formally sufficient. In such a case it is incumbent upon those who impeach the validity of the marriage to demonstrate the existence of the defect.\nAll this is sometimes expressed by saying that the law presumes innocence and legitimacy but in truth the fact that in given circumstances there is a rebuttable presumption of law in favour of a certain conclusion does not necessarily afford any guide as to the weight or strength of the evidence required to rebut the presumption. The law presumes for example that a promissory note is given for a valuable consideration; a presumption which has only the effect of establishing a prima facie case. The law presumes innocence but it prescribes also a supplementary rule, namely, that in criminal proceedings, at all events, the presumption of innocence is not rebutted unless the evidence offered for that purpose demonstrates guilt in the sense of excluding to a moral certainty all hypotheses (not in themselves improbable) inconsistent with guilt.\nThe precise question to be determined is whether the same rule governs where the presumption to be overcome is a presumption of sanity. Where the question arises on a criminal prosecution the practice has been to treat the presumption as a presumption of law and this practice seems to be sanctioned both by the answers given by the judges in Mcnaghten's Case[16] and by the provision of the Criminal Code of Canada above referred to; but as I have just pointed out the circumstance that the presumption is a presumption of law tells us nothing as to the weight of the proof required to overcome it. Is there a special rule as to this?\nI am unable to think of any principle or any reason of policy comparable in importance to those upon which rest the rules touching the presumptions of innocence and legitimacy for holding that a similar rule should be applied as touching the character of the proof to be exacted where the presumption to be overcome is the presumption of sanity; or why the general principle should not be adhered to that in judicial proceedings conclusions of fact may legitimately be founded upon a substantial preponderance of evidence.\nI have moreover no doubt that the expressions which have for generations been used by judges in instructing juries in criminal proceedings as to the degree of certainty justifying a conviction (as \"the prisoner must be given the benefit of the doubt,\" \"guilt must be established to the exclusion of reasonable doubt\"), are expressions which have passed into common speech; and that a Canadian jury receiving instructions couched in similar terms as to the probative weight of the evidence necessary to justify a given conclusion would in the great majority of cases attach to these expressions the significance which they ordinarily bear and are intended to bear when used in relation to the presumption of innocence. A jury being instructed that a finding of insanity would only be proper if they should be satisfied to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt upon that point, would not, I am quite sure, understand that an affirmative conclusion would be justified by proof consisting only of a substantial preponderance in the weight of evidence. It will be necessary to refer very briefly to some authorities that have been mentioned. And first of the charge of Mansfield C. J. in Bellingham's Case, which is said to have been approved by Lord Lyndhurst C. B. in The Queen v. Oxford[17]. The report of Sir James Mansfield's charge seems to be a newspaper report only, and Lord Lyndhurst's words of approval seem to be rather directed to the Chief Justice's definition of insanity than to his remarks upon the burden of proof. Lord Lyndhurst indeed in Oxford's Case17, contents himself with stating that the jury must be satisfied that the prisoner was insane before they can properly acquit him. Bellinghams's Case was a very painful case and I do not think it can be regarded as a satisfactory authority upon this point. See The Queen v. Oxford17; The Queen v. McNaughton[18], and especially the speech of Mr. Cockburn. In Oxford's Case17, just referred to, Lord Denman C.J., who with Alderson B. and Patteson J. presided, limited himself to remarking as regards the burden of proof that all persons \"prima facie must be taken to be of sound mind till the contrary is shewn.\" In similar terms the jury was charged in The Queen v. Vaughan[19]; Reg. v. Higginson[20]; Reg. v. Davies[21]; Reg. v. Barton[22]; Reg. v. Townley[23]; Reg. v. Layton[24].\nIt is quite true that in Reg. v. Stokes[25], Rolfe B. is reported to have said that if the jury were left in doubt it would be their duty to convict, and similar language is attributed to Bingham J. in Rex. v. Jefferson[26]. When the remarks of these learned judges are read as a whole, however, the fair interpretation of them seems to be that the jury must be satisfied with the evidence of insanity. They were not, I think, intended to convey to the jury the impression that they must arrive at that degree of moral certainty which is necessary to justify a conviction upon a charge of crime. As against these observations may be put the language of Tindal C. J. in addressing the jury in McNaughton's Case[27], where he presided with Williams J. and Coleridge J. The learned Chief Justice used these words:\u2014\nIf on balancing the evidence in your minds you think the prisoner capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, then he was a responsible agent and liable to all the penalties the law imposes. If not so, and if in your judgment the subject should appear involved in very great difficulty, then you will probably not take upon yourselves to find the prisoner guilty. If that is your opinion, then you will acquit the prisoner.\nIt seems clear that there has been no uniform practice of directing the jury on the issue of insanity in the manner adopted by the trial judge in this case and as it appears, as I have said, to be more consistent with principle that the jury should be told that insanity must be clearly proved to their satisfaction but that they are at liberty to find the issue in the affirmative if satisfied that there is a substantial, that is to say, a clear preponderance of evidence, I am constrained to the conclusion that there was substantial error in the conduct of the trial and that a new trial should be directed.\nAnglin J.\u2014Is it misdirection to instruct a jury that to justify a verdict of acquittal on that ground (sec. 966 Crim. Code) in a prosecution for murder the defence of insanity must be established beyond a reasonable doubt? The Supreme Court of Alberta en banc (Harvey C. J. dissenting), held that it was in Rex v. Anderson [28]. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, following its own previous judgment in The King v. Kierstead[29], has unanimously held in this case that it is not. Hence this appeal\u2014the first brought to this court under section 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code, enacted by 10-11 Geo. V., c. 43, s. 16.\nIf this question were entirely open, I should be disposed to accept as more logical and humane than that approved in English law (however defensible the latter may be on grounds of policy) the view which has prevailed in the Supreme Court of the United States and in many states of the Union (Lawson on Presumptive Evidence, p. 537; 16 C.J., 775) that, while the presumption of sanity relieves the prosecutor in the first instance from proving that fact, if, upon the whole evidence, a reasonable doubt remains in the mind of the jury whether at the time of the killing the accused was mentally competent to distinguish between right and wrong or to understand the nature of his act, it cannot properly render a verdict of guilty. Davis v. United States[30]; German v. United States[31]. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the judgment of the court in the Davis Case30, seems to me unanswerable. How can a man rightly be adjudged guilty of a crime\nif upon all the evidence there is reasonable doubt whether in law he was capable of committing crime? (P. 484).\n***\nHow upon principle or consistently with humanity, can a verdict of guilty be properly returned if the jury entertain a reasonable doubt as to the existence of a fact which is essential to guilt, viz., the capacity in law of the accused to commit that crime ? (P. 488). Where, as in murder, intent is an essential element in the crime, if the evidence as a whole so far rebuts the presumption of intent that it is left doubtful whether the accused was capable of forming the necessary intent\u2014could have had mens rea\u2014how can it be held that all the constituent elements of criminality are established beyond reasonable doubt? Professor Thayer in his excellent Treatise on the Law of Evidence (1 ed., pp. 381-4) discusses this question with his customary lucidity.\nThe defence of insanity, which goes to negative an essential ingredient of the crime\u2014criminal intent\u2014just as does the defence of inevitable accident\u2014and as the defence of an alibi goes to negative another essential element, the identity of the accused\u2014is thus put on the same footing as other defences. Evidence in support of them which creates in the minds of the jury a doubt whether some essential element of the crime has been established\u2014a doubt which on the whole evidence is not removed\u2014entitles the accused to an acquittal, since the burden of satisfying the jury of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which always rests on the prosecutor and never changes, has not been discharged. Rex. v. Schama[32]; Rex. v. Stoddart[33]; Rex. v. Myshrall[34].\nBut this is not the law of England with regard to the defence of insanity as is stated by the judges in their answers to questions propounded to them by the House of Lords in McNaghten's Case[35], which, notwithstanding criticism by eminent judges and writers, have ever since been generally accepted in English courts as authoritative. It does not suffice in English law that a defendant pleading insanity should create a doubt as to his sanity in the minds of the jury. He must prove his irresponsibility \"to their satisfaction\"\u2014it must be \"clearly proved.\" So said Lord Chief Justice Tindal, speaking for himself and his fellow judges.\nAs the learned Chief Justice of Alberta says[36] the authority of McNaghten's Case[37] not having been accepted in the United States\na reference to American text writers and cases can furnish no aid in determining the law in Canada on this subject.\nOn the other hand our Parliament has seen fit in s. 19 (3) of the Criminal Code to define the law which is to govern Canadian courts in these terms:\u2014\nEveryone shall be presumed to be sane at the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.\nIt is noteworthy that, although the codifiers undoubtedly had the language of McNaghten's Case37 before them, our legislators have not said that, in order to overcome the presumption of sanity, mental irresponsibility must be \"clearly proved\" or even that it must be \"established to the satisfaction of the jury\"\u2014but merely that it must be \"proved.\"\nAnother point of difference between our statutory law and that of England, perhaps not devoid of significance, is that whereas here on insanity being \"proved\" the verdict is to be \"not guilty\", (the jury being required to find the insanity specially and, if that be the case, to state that the acquittal is on account of it s. 966), thus indicating that insanity with us goes to the question of guilt or innocence, in England since 1883 (46-47 Vic., c. 38) in like circumstances the verdict must be guilty of the act or omission charged but insane at the time when he did the act or made the omission, thus indicating that insanity is there not an absolute defence but rather matter available in arrest of judgment. This would seem to be a logical outcome of the view that, notwithstanding reasonable doubt as to sanity raised by the evidence, criminality involving intent may exist beyond reasonable doubt.\nNo doubt, however, \"proved\" in subsection 3 of section 19 of our Code must mean \"proved to the satisfaction of the jury,\" which, in turn, means to its reasonable satisfaction. Braunstein v. Accidental Death Ins. Co.[38]. It may possibly have been meant to cover the phrase \"clearly proved\" used in McNaghten's Case[39]. \"Clear and positive proof,\" however, was held in an Indian case cited in Stroud's Jud. Dict. (2 ed.), 323, (the report is not available here) to mean \"such evidence as leaves no reasonable doubt.\" If the adverb \"clearly\" adds to the force of the participle \"proved\" its use, in my opinion, is not warranted under our Code. Still less is it justifiable to add to the \"proved\" of the Code such a distinctly qualifying phrase as \"beyond all reasonable doubt,\" if a higher degree of certainty is thereby required than the word \"proved\" itself imports.\n\"Proved\" is not a word of art. Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[40]. It may have different shades of meaning varying according to the subject matter in connection with, and the context in which, it is used. \"Tested\" or \"made good\" or \"established\" are its ordinary equivalents. Murray's Dict. Crampton v. Swete[41]; It may require only evidence of the factum probandum sufficient to be left to a jury. Tatam v. Haslar[42]; see too The People v. Winters[43]. Here I find nothing to warrant requiring evidence of greater weight than would ordinarily satisfy a jury in a civil case that a burden of proof had been discharged\u2014that, balancing the probabilities upon the whole case, there was such a preponderance of evidence as would warrant them as reasonable men in concluding that it had been established that the accused when he committed the act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality, or if he did know it, did not know that he was doing what was wrong. That I believe to be the law of Canada, as it appears to be that of most of the states of the American Union. Und\u00e9rhill on Criminal Evidence, s. 158.\nThe latter clause of the ancient maxim, stabit praesumptio donec probetur in contrarium, does not import that any special amount or degree of evidence is required to rebut the presumption. Its whole office is to shift to him against whom it operates the burden of adducing such evidence as will satisfy the tribunal that the presumption should not prevail (Best on Evidence, 11 ed., p. 314), such proof as may render the view which he supports reasonably probable. To require that a particular presumption must be negatived beyond reasonable doubt is to super-add to the force of the presumption a rule of substantive law\u2014and that has been done in the case of the presumption of innocence. Thayer, Law of Evidence, 1st ed., pages 336 and 384. The history of this presumption of law and the distinction between it and the doctrine of reasonable doubt is dealt with by Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) White in Coffin v. United States[44], at pages 452-60. I quite appreciate the difficulty experienced by Harvey C. J.[45], and by White J.[46], in formulating the distinction between proof to the satisfaction of the jury and proof beyond reasonable doubt. How can I be satisfied of a fact if I have reasonable doubt that it is so? But, with Mr. Justice Beck, (p. 117) I am convinced that the expression \"proved beyond reasonable doubt\" has become consecrated by long judicial usage as pointing to an amount or degree of proof greater than is imported by the word \"proved\" standing alone or by the expression \"established to the satisfaction of the jury,\" or even by \"clearly proved\"\u2014certainly greater than is required to discharge the burden of proof in civil matters. That learned judge quotes an extract from the judgment delivered by Sir John Patteson in Doe d. Devine v. Wilson[47], at page 531, and a passage from Taylor on Evidence (par. 112) as illustrating this difference. But the actuality of the distinction in law between an instruction that the existence of a fact or condition must be proved and that it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is perhaps best tested by the inquiry whether an accused would not have ground for complaint if the trial judge having charged that the jury must be satisfied of his guilt\u2014that it is clearly proven\u2014should refuse to direct them that they must be so satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. I put that question to counsel for the Crown during the argument. It was not answered. I find it was anticipated by Mr. Justice Stuart in Andersons's case (pp. 113-4). With that learned judge\nI think the rule is well established that an accused person is entitled to have such a direction given, accompanied by an explanation of what is reasonable doubt. Rex. v. Stoddart[48]; Rex. v. Schama[49]; Reg. v. White[50], are instances of the recognition of this right in English law. In R. v. Sterne, cited in Best on Evidence (11 ed.) 84, Baron Parke instructed that there should be\nsuch moral certainty as convinces the mind of the tribunal as reasonable men, beyond all reasonable doubt.\nI also agree with Mr. Justice Stuart that\nif the expression (beyond reasonable doubt) was not improper in the present case, then it inevitably follows that it is not necessary in the ordinary case,\ni.e., in directing the jury as to the burden of the prosecution.\nThe case of Reg. v. Layton[51], in which the trial took place shortly after McNaghten's Case[52], where the direction given by Rolfe B. was\nthe question therefore for the jury would be not whether the prisoner was of sound mind but whether he had made out to their satisfaction that he was not of sound mind,\nmay perhaps be referred to as an instance of a correct appreciation of the effect of the McNaghten Case. Lord Lyndhurst had delivered a similar charge in Rex v. Offord[53]. The charge of Bigham J. in R. v. Jefferson[54], that the prisoner has to make out the charge of insanity\nto your satisfaction without any reasonable doubt; if you have reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was doing wrong or not you must find him guilty.\nthough similar to that in Bellingham's Case, as noted in53, and to that in. R. v. Stokes[55], was, I venture to think, a misapprehension of the effect of the answer of the judges in the House of Lords. Such a charge, would, in my opinion, be clearly wrong in Canada. These Nisi Prius reports, however, are really of little value.\nOn appeal in Jefferson's Case[56], Lawrence J., delivering the opinion of the court setting aside the verdict on another ground, was careful to state that no question had been raised as to the direction of the trial judge (p. 470), probably to make it clear that approval of it was not to be inferred.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that there was misdirection at the trial of the appellant and that it is not possible to say that substantial wrong did not result therefrom. The application of the appellant for leave to appeal should, therefore, be granted and his conviction set aside and a new trial directed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff.\nMignault J.\u2014A presumption being, by definition, a deduction from a known or ascertained fact, or, as the old writers expressed it, ex eo quod plerumque fit, it is clear that the presumption of sanity of mind, entailing civil and criminal responsibility, would be fully recognized even if it had not been made the subject of a statutory declaration. So paragraph 3 of section 19 of the Criminal Code, which states that\nevery one shall be presumed to be sane at the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved,\nmerely gives an unnecessary, I do not say a useless, legislative sanction to a universally recognized presumption of fact, entitling us to consider it as a presumption of law\u2014although that does not add to its evidential force\u2014which will stand as proof of the basic element of criminal responsibility, until it is rebutted or, to use the words of the Code, \"until the contrary is proved.\"\nThis shews that although we have an express declaration by the legislature, the Code really adds nothing to the common law; in fact the presumption of sanity of mind, involving criminal responsibility, is recognized in England as well as in all countries, and our inquiries need not carry us further, which are subject to the common law.\nWe may, therefore, take the rule stated by the judges in McNaghten's Case[57], that the jurors should be told that every man is presumed to be sane until the contrary is proved to their satisfaction, (I do not here refer to the further statement of the judges, speaking by Tindal C. J., that insanity must be \"clearly proved\") as being in effect the rule of our criminal code, for although the words \"to the satisfaction of the jury\" are not contained in paragraph 3 of section 19, inasmuch as the contrary of the presumption must be proved, and the proof must be passed on by the jury, this proof must be sufficient to satisfy the jury that the presumption has been rebutted.\nI do not think that it is necessary to consider cases that have been decided in the United States, although I have read with interest and with some measure of sympathetic consideration the able opinion of the late Mr. Justice Harlan in Davis v. United States[58], to the effect that if on the whole evidence any reasonable doubt exists as to the sanity of the accused the jury should acquit. This manifestly would transgress the rule of our Code, for instead of proving his insanity, it would be sufficient for the accused to create in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt whether he was sane when he committed the crime, which would, in my judgment, deprive the legal presumption of its legitimate effect.\nHere the learned trial judge in charging the jury emphasized that it was their duty to convict the accused unless in their opinion he had proved his insanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Is this misdirection in law? The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, whose judgment in the case of The King v. Kierstead[59], the learned trial judge followed, has unanimously held that it was not. Inasmuch, however, as the Appellate Division of Alberta, in Rex v. Anderson[60], had decided that such a direction was wrong, the appellant was enabled to appeal to this court by reason of a recent amendment of the Criminal Code 10-11 Geo. V., ch. 43, sec. 16.\nMy first impression at the hearing was that if the jury entertained a reasonable doubt whether the plea of insanity was proved, the legal presumption was not rebutted. Further reflection has, however, led me to think that it is sufficient that the jury be satisfied on all the evidence that the plea of insanity has been established, and for that reason I fear that the direction which was given in this case may have been, to say the least, misleading. It is, moreover, open to the objection that something is added to the law, which is content with requiring that the contrary be proved, without specifying the degree of proof to be adduced. It is unquestionable that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, so that the presumption of innocence is stronger, and rightly so, than the presumption of sanity. Proof in ordinary matters does not suppose that the evidence removes all doubt; it is the result of a preponderance of evidence, or of the acceptance on reasonable grounds of one probability in preference to another, and, in the case of insanity, the evidence generally is largely a matter of expert opinion. To say that insanity must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury does not weaken the legal presumption, but it places the plea of insanity on the same footing as all other defences which must be established so as to satisfy the jury. I would certainly not say that if the jury be in doubt whether the accused was sane or insane they should acquit him, because, if they accept his plea of insanity, they must expressly find that he was insane and return a verdict of not guilty because of insanity (sect. 966 Crim. Code). But while unquestionably all the onus here is on the accused, still the jury may accept his evidence as having greater weight than that of the Crown, although they might not feel that all reasonable doubt has been removed. Such a doubt might be caused by the testimony of one reputable expert against the opinion of other experts, and, in such a case, it is certainly within the province of the jury to accept the views of the latter in preference to those of the former. I would therefore think that a proper direction would be to call the attention of the jury to the legal presumption of sanity and to inform them, the onus being on the accused, that insanity must be proved by him to their satisfaction. Further than that I would not go.\nA serious wrong or miscarriage may have resulted from the direction given by the learned trial judge, so on full consideration I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] 45 N.

P. made several subdivisions and sold lots in one with a covenant by his grantees to erect only residential buildings. The grantees conveyed the lots to a church corporation who proceeded to build a church thereon. In an action by P., in his personal capacity, for an injunction and demolition of the church building.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that P. had no interest to maintain the action having before the trial sold all his holdings in the subdivision containing the church. Brodeur J. held that he owned and continued to own one lot in the area affected by the covenant of P.\u2019s grantees.\nHeld also, per Idington and Anglin JJ., that as the injunction was not applied for until the church was practically completed P. was probably estopped by laches from bringing an action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, reversing the judgment on the trial in favour of the appellant.\nThe only question raised on this appeal is whether or not the appellant could maintain his action under the circumstances set out in the head-note. The trial judge held that he could but was reversed by the Appellate Division. F.D. Davis for the appellant.\nWigle K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by Chief Justice Sir William Meredith in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division. The grounds on which the learned Chief Justice based his opinion are succinctly and clearly stated in the following paragraph of his reasons for judgment:\nIn my opinion the respondent is not entitled to the relief awarded to him. He has no interest in the question raised, and does not represent any one who has an interest. If the owners of the other lots have rights, the dismissal of the action will not affect them. The extraordinary remedy sought ought not to be awarded even if the respondent had a technical right to enforce the covenant, especially in the circumstances to which I have referred, and he has not been damnified by what the appellants have done.\nI concur in these conclusions alike of law and fact and have nothing useful to add to them.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant and others were owners of some farm lands, of which, by and through him, as their trustee, they made a subdivision for residential purposes.\nAll of said subdivisions had been sold before this action except two lots, and at the beginning of the action those two were sold.\nHence at the trial he had no interest in the maintenance of such an action as this, which is brought against the respondents, as trustees and owners of some lots in said sub-division upon which a church was being built, to restrain their building there because doing so is alleged to be in violation of a restrictive covenant given appellant by some of his grantees from whom respondents acquired their title. The substance of the said covenant is thus set forth in the appellant\u2019s factum:\u2014\nThe grantees, for themselves, their heirs and assigns, hereby covenant and agree with the grantor, his heirs and assigns, that no buildings shall be erected upon the said lands except for residences and their necessary outhouses, such residences to be erected as single residences or double tenements only, and all such residences, if they be single residences, are to be erected at a cost of not less than $1,500.00, and if they be double tenements are to be erected at a cost of not less than $2,500.00, and no buildings are to be erected on the said lands at a distance of less than twelve feet from the street line of the said Moy Avenue.\nThe decision in the case of London County Council v. Allen[1], seems conclusively to restrict the right recognized in Tulk v. Moxhay[2], and asserted by appellant herein to enforce such a covenant to one who owns part of the land in question.\nSurely all that was within the contemplation of him and the parties giving such like covenants was to protect the area of the sub-division of which each so covenanting was buying a part. Appellant pretends herein that he holds under the trust deed from his fellow adventurers other lands not subdivided and hence owns part of the land in question and therefore comes within the terms of the judgment in the said London County Council Case1.\nThe trust deed to him and under which he acted imposes no such restrictive scheme as part of his trust.\nIt would seem as if the restrictive covenant scheme was a development of his own and was limited to the area of the sub-division in question, and though presumably his cestuis que trustent assented to the use thereof so far as that area was in question, it by no means follows that they would assent to it in regard to other sub-divisions and he certainly, in execution of his trust, could not impose it, without their consent, in relation to other subdivisions. That might in one section of the property be advantageous to the sellers but in another quite the reverse.\nAgain it is urged that he is a trustee for those who bought other lots than those immediately in same subdivision.\nI fail to find the trust anywhere expressed. Indeed the appellant seems to have carefully avoided creating such a trust, or having it imposed upon him.\nThough the covenant is made with the appellant \u201chis heirs and assigns\u201d there is no evidence of his having assigned it, or of ever having given the purchasers of other lots the benefit thereof in any deed.\nI fail to find, therefore, how any of those he pretends to be taking a paternal interest in, could set up any such claim.\nHence in light of the above cited cases appellant has no interest in equity to assert such right as he does and cannot properly pretend he is acting as trustee for such others as suggested in argument.\nIn conclusion the acquiescence and delay from at least some time in November until the 24th January, whilst the church was being built, should debar him seeking any injunction when the building was almost completed.\nThe purpose of so building was evident in October and if an injunction was to be the remedy, it should have been applied for promptly.\nThe covenant does not run with the land and hence the only possible remedy was in equity which does not countenance such a course of conduct.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014That as owners deriving title under the covenantor the defendants are not bound to the plaintiff covenantee if he does not retain any land for the benefit of which the restrictive covenant sued upon was entered into is clearly established by London County Council v. Allen[3], and Formby v. Barker[4], Decisions of the English Court of Appeal.\nThe doctrine of Tulk v. Moxhay[5], does not extend to the case in which the covenantee has no land capable of enjoying as against the land of the covenantor the benefit of the restrictive covenant. * * * Where the covenantee has no land, the derivative owner claiming under the covenantor is bound neither in contract nor by the equitable doctrine which attaches in the case where there is land capable of enjoying the restrictive covenant. Per Buckley L.J.\nThe plaintiff and certain co-adventurers formed a syndicate to purchase the Davis farm, a property in the city of Windsor, for the purpose of subdividing and disposing of it in building lots. The title was vested in the plaintiff as trustee for sale on behalf of himself and the other members of the syndicate. Three plans of subdivision of parts of the farm were prepared and registered in the following order as Nos. 579, 591, and 648 respectively. It does not appear whether any lot on plan 579 was disposed of before the registration of plan 648. The lots owned by the defendants they acquired from the original purchasers from the plaintiff, and on them they built the church which the plaintiff seeks to have removed. These lots are within subdivision 579 and front on Moy Avenue.\nWhen the action was begun the plaintiff had some interest in a lot in this street and in another in Hall Avenue, both within subdivision 579, but he has since parted with both these lots and neither he nor his co-adventurers have any interest now in any lot fronting either on Moy Avenue or Hall Avenue within subdivision 579. Personally he owns no land whatever within the subdivision.\nHe and his co-adventurers some time since divided amongst themselves all the unsold lands shewn on plan No. 579 and his trust as to that subdivision thereupon terminated. He still owns lot No. 605 in Moy Avenue within subdivision 648.\nThe purpose of the covenant sued upon would seem to have been to require the owners of lots 138 and 139, Moy Avenue, on which the offending church is built, to conform to the building scheme of the syndicate whereby Hall Avenue and Moy Avenue within the subdivision covered by plan No. 579 were to remain exclusively residential streets. It would appear to have been the lands abutting on these two streets within this subdivision and no others that were intended to be benefited thereby. While this is not explicitly stated in the record the following extract from the examination-in-chief of the plaintiff makes it tolerably clear that the trial proceeded on that footing.\nQ. Which of these subdivisions are the lands in question in? A. 579.\nQ. The lots are included in registered subdivision 579? A. Yes.\nQ. There were restrictions included in your conveyance of the lots? A. Yes.\nQ. Tell us how that happened? A. Certain streets, Moy and Hall, were restricted to residential property only.\nHis Lordship: Is not that a matter of written record?\nMr. Davis: I wish to show the general scheme. We say it was restricted property.\nHis Lordship: The deeds put in, I take it, contain the restrictions on which you rely?\nMr. Davis: Yes, my lord.\nQ. Were all the lots sold under restrictions? A. Yes. Every individual lot was sold with a restriction of some kind on it.\nHis Lordship: It might be helpful to know over what land or lands the restrictions now in issue extended.\nWitness: I can show it from the plan. Mr. Davis: Q. What portion of the lands covered by these plans was subject to restrictions?\nMr. Wigle: Confine yourself to 579. That is the only one in question.\nMr. Davis: What portion of 579 was subject to restrictions? A. All of it except the one large block that was sold for a large home\u2014everything except that.\nHis Lordship: Subject to what restrictions?\nMr. Davis: What restrictions were there? A. Moy and Hall avenues were restricted to residential streets.\nThe plaintiff therefore appears to have no status to maintain this action.\nMoreover he represented to the church authorities, through the defendant Allworth, before the church was erected, that personally he had no objection to its being built\u2014that his opposition was solely because as trustee of the farm he deemed it his duty to protect customers to whom he had sold. In his evidence he says that it is in their interest that this action, although not purporting to be brought by him as a trustee or in any other representative capacity, is maintained. In view of the subsequent change in the defendants\u2019 position by the erection of the church, even if he still held land within the benefit of the covenant, it would seem not improbable that suing as an individual he would be confronted by an awkward estoppel.\nHe never was trustee for his vendees and has no status to assert any rights they may have. His trust for the syndicate, if still subsisting, would not seem to help his position, since the syndicate retains no land for the benefit of which the covenant was obtained. That trust, however, has come to an end.\nFinally the fact that this action was brought only when the defendants\u2019 building was nearing completion would probably afford a defence on the ground of laches to the claim for the extraordinary remedy of a mandatory injunction for its removal.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant\u2019s action is for an injunction restraining the defendants from erecting on the corner of Moy and Niagara Streets, in the City of Windsor, a church, contrary to the building restrictions which were stipulated in the deed of sale which the appellant made of the lots of land on which this church was to be built.\nThe appellant was the owner with some others of a farm which is within the boundaries of Windsor and they decided to subdivide it into building lots and the appellant was appointed trustee for his co-owners to make the sale of these lots; and a conveyance to that effect was made to him on the express covenant that building restrictions should be placed upon the lots fronting Moy Street. This covenant was fully carried out by the appellant in all the grants which he made.\nIn 1913, a sale was made of the lots in question in this case to the Turners, with the usual building restrictions; that sale was duly registered and the defendants purchased these lots from the Turners with notice of those building restrictions. The defendants tried to obtain the consent of several of their neighbours to the construction of the church because they realized that such an edifice would be a violation of those building restrictions. They failed to obtain the consent of a larger number of interested parties who petitioned the appellant to institute proceedings to restrain the trustees from constructing the church. Hence the present action, which was maintained by the trial judge but whose decision was reversed by the first Appellate Division on the ground that the plaintiff has no interest in the question raised since he has no lots on Moy Street. The evidence shews that the plaintiff, after his co-owners entrusted him with the sale of the farm in question, had four subdivision plans prepared. The first one was made by Owner McKay on the 24th of April, 1911, and was registered under No. 579. It covered the front part of the farm to Erie Street and contained lots which were numbered 1 to 445. It contained on Moy Street the lots 138 and 139 in dispute in this case. At the time of the institution of the action, the plaintiff was personally the owner of lots 228 and 229 which were shewn on this survey plan No. 579, but he had sold them before the trial took place.\nOn the 22nd of March, 1912, the plaintiff went on with the survey of the farm from Erie Street. The same land surveyor, McKay, prepared a plan which was registered as plan No. 591. The lots described on this plan were known as Nos. 450 to 562. Moy Street was continued on this new plan as a prolongation of the one shewn on plan 579. There was on this latter plan a block of land called \u201cBlock A,\u201d which was then left without being subdivided; but on the 16th of November, 1912, the subdivision of this Block A was made and registered. The lots covered by this subdivision of Block A were numbered 566 to 591 inclusively.\nOn the 30th of January, 1913, plaintiff had the work of the subdivision of the farm continued from above Erie Street to Ottawa Street and a plan giving a description of the lots 592 to 707 was prepared by the same surveyor and registered under the number 648. On this survey is shewn the lot 605 which was situate on Moy Avenue and which was purchased by the plaintiff on the 17th of December, 1915, and which was at the time of the institution of the action and of the trial, and which is still, his property. Those three surveys covered a great part of the farm which the plaintiff and his associates had purchased in 1911.\nWhen the plaintiff sold to the Turners on the 5th of August, 1913, the lots 138 and 139 situate on Moy Street, the three subdivision plans had been registered and the purchasers covenanted that they would not erect buildings upon these lots 138 and 139, except for residences.\nWhen the plaintiff acquired lot 605, it was on a restrictive agreement of about the same nature as the one stipulated in the Turner contract.\nThe respondents acquired lots 138 and 139 from the Turners in Sept. 1917 and got notice of the restrictive clauses affecting these lots, though no formal covenant was stipulated in their deed of acquisition. They tried to obtain the consent of their neighbours for the erection of a church on these lots. Some of them acquiesced and waived their rights. Some others, amongst whom is the plaintiff, refused to give the necessary consent. It is possible that if the church authorities had been willing to erect a stone or brick building all the objections would have vanished. It is not very clear in the evidence, but it may be surmised that a large construction of inflammable materials would be of such a dangerous character that these neighbours would not feel disposed to waive their rights under the building scheme which had been devised as to the nature of the constructions on Moy Avenue.\nI cannot see how the Appellate Division has made the mistake of stating that the respondent had no interest in any lot on Moy Avenue. There has been perhaps a confusion as to some lots, viz., 228 and 229, which appear on the plan 579 which the plaintiff possessed at the institution of the action but which he sold before the trial. He is asked the following:\nQ. Do you own any lands now in the subdivision where the lots in question are? A. At the present time, no sir.\nThe witness evidently refers as we may see by the context to the subdivision plan No. 579. But he makes it very clear that he is still the owner of a lot, No. 605, on Moy Avenue.\nThis lot, No. 605, appears on the subdivision plan No. 648, of the 30th January, 1913, which was the continuation of the two previous plans Nos. 579 and 591, made respectively in 1911 and 1912. These three plans had been registered long before the Turners purchased in 1913, and long, also, before the respondent purchased in 1917.\nThis Moy Street was running in a straight line from Sandwich Street to Ottawa Street and all the lots sold on this street, including No. 605, were sold with building restrictions.\nThis is a case in which we should refuse to apply the principles laid down in the cases of Formby v. Barker[6]; London County Council v. Allen[7]; Milbourn v. Lyons[8], relied upon by the respondent, because in those cases the plaintiff had no interest in any land situate near the one in dispute.\nIn the present case the appellant is still the owner of a lot situate on Moy Avenue. He is himself under restrictive obligations. He is then entitled to rely on Tulk v. Moxhay[9], and to ask that the respondents, the subsequent purchasers of the lots 138 and 139 on Moy Avenue, be ordered to demolish the building which they have erected contrary to the covenant contained in their vendor\u2019s title. The respondents contended also that the plaintiff should not succeed because when the church was constructed he stood by and allowed the respondents to complete their building. The work began in December and the plaintiff almost immediately saw the respondents and made his objections to the building being erected. Correspondence was exchanged between the parties until January and, not being able to agree, the present action was instituted on the 16th of January. It cannot be contended in those circumstances, that the respondents may effectively say that the plaintiff stood by.\nThe judgment a quo should be reversed and the Decision of the trial judge restored with costs of this court and of the Appellate Division.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014On the ground that the appellant at the time of the trial owned no lots in the subdivision where the church erected by the respondents is situated, and therefore had no interest in the restrictions imposed when the lots were first sold by him, I think the appeal fails and should be dismissed.\nHe clearly says that he owns no land in this subdivision:\nQ. Do you own any lands now in the subdivision where the lots in question are? A. At the present time, no, sir.\nHis Lordship: In 579? A. I did when this action was started, but they have since been sold.\nMr. Davis: Have you no lands at all in the subdivision? A. No, sir, not at the present time. They have been sold since this action was started.\nThe restrictions preventing the erection of buildings not of a residential character had been imposed by the appellant on the predecessors in title of the respondents. The latter purchased the property with know- ledge of these restrictions but without having, by their deed of purchase, covenanted to observe them. There is therefore no privity of contract between the appellant and the respondents.\nOn the authority, however, of Tulk v. Moxhay[10] the appellant contends that he is entitled in equity to enforce this covenant against the respondents who purchased with notice of the building restrictions.\nThe answer is that having disposed of all land in the subdivision, he is without interest to enforce the covenant, and that therefore the doctrine of Tulk v. Moxhay10, does not apply; London County Council v. Allen[11]; Milbourn v. Lyons[12].\nThe appellant when asked what interest he had in the enforcement of the covenant, answered that, as trustee of the farm, it was his duty to protect the customers to whom he sold lots. It seems to me that these customers, if they are aggrieved by the erection of the respondents\u2019 church, should assert their own rights. I am clear, however, that the appellant, having no longer any interest in the land to be benefited by the covenant, cannot now enforce the restrictions.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis & Healy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Rodd, Wigle & McHugh.\n[1] [1914] 3 K.B. 642.\n[2] 2 Phillips, 774.\n[3] [1914] 3 K.B. 642.\n[4] [1903] 2 Ch. 539.\n[5] 2 Ph. 774.\n[6] [1903] 2 Ch. 539.\n[7] [1914] 3 K.B. 642.\n[8] [1914] 2 Ch. 231.\n[9] 2 Ph. 774.\n[10] 2 Ph. 774.\n[11] [1914] 3 K.B. 642.\n[12] [1914] 2 Ch. 231.\n"

Forbes (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: February 11; 1921: March 11.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Work and labour\u2014Repugnant provisions\u2014Rule of construction.\nIn a contract for altering a building the contractor covenanted \u201cin consideration of the sum of $3,000 * * * that he will furnish the materials hereinafter mentioned and will perform services as hereinafter set forth.\u201d After setting out the character of such work and materials the contract provided that in case the cost should be more or less than $3,000, payment would be made on the basis of cost plus a percentage and that the contractor should be entitled \u201cto the amount ascertained as paid by him for labour and material, plus 12\u00bd per cent.\nHeld, Davies C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that this last mentioned provision for payment is repugnant to that by which the contractor made an absolute covenant to do the work and furnish the material for $3,000, and there being no special reason for departing from the general rule the later clause must be rejected. Per Davies C.J. and Duff J.\u2014The clauses are not repugnant but assuming that they are the fact that the intention of the parties as disclosed by the contract was that the sum of $3,000 was only an estimate of the cost and that the contractor was to be paid the price of his labour and materials plus a reasonable profit, constitutes a special reason for refusing to reject the later clause.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellants.\nThe appeal involved the construction of a contract for altering a building so that it could be used as a restaurant. The material portions of the contract are set out in the head-note and appear in full in the opinions of the judges herein. The case was tried by the County Court Judge under the Mechanics Lien Act and His Honour held that the clauses were repugnant and effect should be given to the earlier. The Appellate Division held that they should be read together and effect given to the later.\nWashington K.C. and E.E. Gallagher for the appellants.\nJ.L. Counsell for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent brought an action upon a contract dated 5th March, 1919, made between him and the appellants whereby he agreed in consideration of the sum of $3,000 that he would furnish materials and perform the services thereinafter set forth. The work thereinafter set forth consisted of carpenter work, plumbing, electric wiring, plastering, stairs, painting and decorating, as specified.\nThe respondent\u2019s statement of claim is somewhat ambiguous and may be read as if discarding said contract and relying upon an alternative contract in said agreement, presently to be referred to.\nAnd the manner of presenting the evidence in support of his claim indicates a possible reliance upon such alternative contract as I tentatively express it.\nBut in the course of the trial counsel for respondent when challenged as to this, boldly took the following position:\u2014\nMr. Counsell: Mr. Washington admits that we were entitled to claim for extras. There is not a thing in the original contract that there is to-day. Mr. Washington overlooks entirely the fact that this bill of Mr. Forbes rendered is a bill for the whole work and not anything to do with the contract. He goes on the third clause in that contract, that is to say, that Mr. Git was to pay him for his time and material supplied. Both of them disregarded that contract.\nThat was so persisted in as to render the trial rather confusing.\nThe respondent claimed and claims he was to be paid for all the costs of work and material, plus 12\u00bd% to be added thereto.\nIt seems rather a startling proposition in face of such an elaborate contract and specifications and the absolute covenant of the respondent with which the agreement set out binding him expressly to do the work and supply the materials for which he is to be paid the sum of $3,000 as follows:\u2014 Now this agreement witnesseth that in consideration of the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) to be paid as follows: one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) on the signing of this agreement, further sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) when it appears to the satisfaction of all the parties hereto that materials have been furnished and services performed to the extent of twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) and the balance or sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) thirty days after the completion of this agreement, the party of the second part covenants, promises and agrees to and with the parties of the first part that he will furnish the materials hereinafter mentioned and will perform the services as hereinafter set forth.\nImmediately after that follows the entire contract regarding what has to be done by respondent for said consideration.\nThen follows a provision in the agreement that if on examination of the building as disclosed by part of the work thus to be done it would not be consistent with the safety of the building to proceed, the work was to be abandoned and respondent entitled to compensation out of said $1,000.00 cash payment, and he to return balance thereof. Nothing arose out of this and its only possible use is as shewing what the nature of the contract was.\nNext after that comes the following:\u2014\nThe parties of the first part covenant with the party of the second part that in the event of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed amounting in value to more than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the parties of the first part will reimburse the party of the second part for such excess. The party of the second part covenants that in the event of such labour and materials being less in value than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the final payment will be the actual amount expended by the party of the second part over two thousand ($2,000.00) plus twelve and one half per cent. instead of one thousand as above stated. In estimating the value of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed the party of the second part on the final settlement of the amount due under this agreement shall produce all accounts paid by him for labour and materials and shall be entitled to the amount ascertained as paid by him for labour and materials plus twelve and one half per cent. The learned trial judge held this inconsistent with the express contract to do all the said work and supply all materials necessary therefor for the fixed sum of $3,000.00.\nHe proceeded on that basis of the incompatibility of the above quoted covenant in the contract and that which followed, and determined accordingly that the work done under the terms of that part of the contract covered by the said covenant could not exceed the sum named, and found as a fact that it fell below the sum named, and then allowed for extras on that basis.\nOn appeal the Second Appellate Division directed a variation in his formal judgment of which the following is what directly concerns us now in appeal therefrom.\nIt reads as follows:\u2014\n2. This Court doth order that the said appeal be and the same is hereby allowed and that the said judgment dated the 19th day of February, 1920, be varied and as varied be as follows:\n(1) This Court doth declare that according to the true construction of the agreement between the parties, dated the 5th day of March, A.D. 1919, the covenant contained in paragraph one of the said agreement and the subsequent covenant providing for the case of materials and labour amounting in value to more or less than three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) are to be read together and effect to be given to the later covenant.\nI am, with great respect, unable, in light of the authorities I am about to cite, to accept the foregoing as the true construction in law of said agreement.\nIt seems impossible for me to read the first covenant to do the work and supply the materials, which I have set out above, for three thousand dollars, and the later agreement together, as the learned trial judge is directed to do. The latter, if adhered to, abrogates the first contrary to the general rule in such cases that the first must be observed and the latter discarded. Counsel for appellant relied on the decision in the case of Furnivall v. Coombes[1], and a number of later decisions and text books adopting that decision as law. I prefer to anything else I have seen the interpretation of same decision and text which appears in the case of Williams v. Hathaway[2], at page 549 et seq., and applied with due discrimination in Watling v. Lewis[3], as safe guides.\nThe former is a decision of Jessel M.R., who in his opinion judgment seems, as usual with him, to go directly to the root of the matter and briefly, in terse language, to distinguish between a subsidiary provision which does not destroy the covenant and one which does. He says:\u2014\nThe first question is one of law. It is said that if you find a personal covenant, followed by a proviso that the covenantor shall not be personally liable under the covenant, the proviso is repugnant and void. I agree that that is the law; but that by no means applies to a case where the proviso limits the personal liability under the covenant without destroying it, thus leaving a portion of the original covenant remaining; in that case the proviso is perfectly valid.\nIf the covenant to do the specified work and supply the necessary material herein for three thousand dollars is not destroyed by the substituted bargain, then I fail to know how it could be destroyed.\nThe entire basis of a complicated contract and one of which the range might ultimately be difficult to determine is by a stroke of the pen obliterated, as it were, and another so simple in its character that it needed nothing more than the verbal expression\u2014go ahead, do as I tell you and I will pay your expenditure and twelve and a half per cent. for your care and supervision. Surely these are irreconcilable contracts in everyway. Even in applying the test which the Master of the Rolls gives, lawyers and judges may differ, as these cases illustrate.\nBut the test, nevertheless, seems a good one and if it can be said not to destroy the covenant herein I fail to see what could.\nSo convinced was able counsel for respondent that he felt driven to assert his client\u2019s position in the language quoted above. I agree with him that if you can substitute in one and the same contract an alternative and harmonize them as one, he may be right.\nI do not dispute that parties may in the same agreement provide for alternatives if the purview thereof makes it clear that such is their purpose.\nThat, however, is not this case, but one of an absolute covenant not anticipating by a line or word thereof departure therefrom followed by another and distinctively alternative contract in substitution of the former, although using one element thereof as an alternative basis of the latter.\nIt is, I repeat, impossible for the court to do as directed by this judgment of the Appellate Division.\nThe judgment thereof should therefore be set aside and that of the learned trial judge restored with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal raises questions turning upon the construction of a deed the material clauses of which are as follows:\u2014\nNow this agreement witnesseth that in consideration of the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00), to be paid as follows: One thousand dollars ($1,000.00), on the signing of this agreement, further sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), when it appears to the satisfaction of all the parties hereto that materials have been furnished and services performed to the extent of twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), and the balance or sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) thirty days after the completion of this agreement, the party of the second part covenants, promises and agrees to and with the parties of the first part that he will furnish the materials hereinafter mentioned and will perform services as hereinafter set forth.\n* * *\nThe parties of the first part covenant with the party of the second part that in the event of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed amounting in value to more than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the parties of the first part will reimburse the party of the second part for such excess. The party of the second part covenants that in the event of such labour and materials being less in value than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the final payment will be the actual amount expended by the party of the second part over two thousand ($2,000.00) plus twelve and one half per cent. instead of one thousand as above stated. In estimating the value of the materials to be supplied, and the labour performed the party of the second part on the final settlement of the amount due under this agreement shall produce all accounts paid by him for labour and materials and shall be entitled to the amount ascertained as paid by him for labour and materials plus twelve and one half per cent.\nThe County Court Judge at Hamilton, by whom the action was tried, held that the second paragraph being repugnant to the first must be rejected. The Appellate Division has held that the two paragraphs must be read together and effect given to the later covenant as a modification of the earlier one. The question to be decided is whether the Appellate Division was right in reversing the decision of the judge. The case, in my opinion, is governed by two rules of construction. The first is laid down in Shelley\u2019s Case[4] at page 95b.\nSuch construction is always to be made of a deed that all the words (if possible) agreeable to reason and conformable to law may take effect according to the intent of the parties without rejecting of any, or by any construction to make them void.\nThe second is the rule laid down in Grey v. Pearson[5], at page 106, by Lord Wensleydale, namely, that the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is not to be adhered to if that would lead to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument; and that in such case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be modified so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency. I confess I see no difficulty in reading these two paragraphs together in precisely the way in which the Appellate Division has done. In the event of the cost being less than $3,000 or exceeding $3,000 then the remuneration is to be upon \u201ca cost plus percentage basis.\u201d True, since the chances of the cost being precisely $3,000, are very remote, the practical effect of reading the two clauses together, in this way, is to treat that sum as an estimate; and that is precisely what I think the parties intended and considering, as we are bound to do, the necessary uncertainty both as to the extent and as to the cost of the changes which might be required to carry into effect the object of the contract, it is precisely the meaning, in my judgment, which the tribunal called upon to construe the deed is entitled to ascribe to it and must ascribe to it.\nAs against this way of construing the deed there is brought into play an ancient maxim which is given in Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, 88, in these words:\u2014\nIf there be two clauses or parts of the deed repugnant the one to the other the first part shall be received and the latter rejected except there be some special reason to the contrary.\nIt is to be observed that this rule of construction is given in the chapter on the Exposition of Deeds and that on the preceding page there are two rules laid down which are virtually the two to which I have already referred. 1st, that the construction must be upon the entire deed and that \u201cone part of it doth help to expound another;\u201d and 2nd, that where the deed cannot take effect according to the letter it must, if possible, be so expounded as to take effect according to the intention to be collected from the whole deed. The rule as to repugnancy, therefore, is obviously a rule to be applied only in the last resort and when there is no reasonable way of reconciling the two passages and bringing them into harmony with some intention to be collected from the deed as a whole.\nThis, as might have been expected, has more than once been decided. Bush v. Watkins[6]. The rule has indeed been put into operation where by giving effect to the second of two inconsistent clauses the intention, as disclosed by the deed as a whole would be defeated or where the rejected clause was repugnant to the very nature of the transaction the parties were engaged in. But in Walker v. Giles[7], at page 702, it was laid down that where there are inconsistent parts, that part, without regard to their order, which is calculated to carry into effect the real intention of the parties as collected from the instrument should be given effect to. Indeed it would appear that the disclosure of the general intention of the deed when read alone, or when read in light of the circumstances where the circumstances can, as in the present case, properly be resorted to, may constitute a \u201cspecial reason\u201d within the meaning of the very words of the rule itself as given in Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone for refusing to reject the later clause.\nThe cases relied on present no real difficulty. In Furnivall v. Coombes[8], the effect of the proviso, if effect was to be given it at all, was of necessity to relieve the covenantors from any sort of personal obligation, a result held to be obviously inconsistent with the intention of the transaction. In Solly v. Forbes[9], a deed professing to be a release but reserv- ing rights against the sureties, was given effect to by treating the words of release as amounting to a covenant not to sue and the Court of King\u2019s Bench cited and applied the language of Lord Hobart in Clanrickard\u2019s Case[10] at page 277:\nI exceedingly commend the judges that are curious and almost subtil to invent reasons and means to make Acts, according to the just intent of the parties.\nAgain, Sir George Jessel, who afterwards in Re Bywater[11], at pages 19-20, described the converse rule governing the construction of wills as a mere rule of thumb, laid down in Williams v. Hathaway[12], at page 549, that the rule now under consideration \u201cby no means applies\u201d where the proviso limits the liability under the covenant without destroying it, thus leaving some portion of the original covenant remaining. Again in Watling v. Lewis[13], a proviso was rejected because it was held that the only effect that could be given to it would be to destroy the original covenant; and in Re Tewekesbury Gas Co.[14], at page 285, Parker J. considered that when there was an unqualified covenant to pay with a proviso that it should only be enforced at the \u201coption of the covenantor\u201d the proviso must be rejected as obviously destructive of the object of the instrument.\nIn all these cases the clause rejected was one incapable of reconciliation with the general intention of the instrument; and indeed the operation of the rule seems to be limited to those cases in which there are two clauses so inconsistent that effect cannot be given to the second without annihilating the first and that neither the nature of the transaction nor the terms of the instrument sufficiently discloses an overriding intention affording a guide to the tribunal. The tribunal being thus left to the alternative of holding that the mutually repugnant clauses or the whole instrument must be inoperative for uncertainty or, on the other hand, rejecting one of the clauses, rejects the later clause.\nIt may be doubted whether it would not have been more consistent with sound sense to have adopted the former alternative; but the rule, although of limited application, seems to be a settled one and can only be altered by statute.\nI repeat that I can entertain no doubt that it has no application to the instrument before us.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014By the first clause of a contract under seal the plaintiff \u201ccovenanted, promised and agreed\u201d to do certain specified work in the nature of alterations to a building for the sum of $3,000.00 payable in three instalments of $1,000.00 each. The document set out the specifications in detail and made provision for an abandonment of the work should it be found on removal or attempted removal of partitions that it would entail \u201cserious damage\u201d to the structure, and for payment in that event of the cost of labour expended. This clause followed:\u2014\nThe parties of the first part covenant with the party of the second part that in the event of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed amounting in value to more than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the parties of the first part will reimburse the party of the second part for such excess. The party of the second part covenants that in the event of such labour and materials being less in value than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the final payment will be the actual amount expended by the party of the second part over two thousand ($2,000.00) plus twelve and one half per cent. instead of one thousand as above stated. In estimating the value of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed the party of the second part on the final settlement of the amount due under this agreement shall produce all accounts paid by him for labour and materials and shall be entitled to the amount ascertained as paid by him for labour and materials plus twelve and one-half per cent.\nThe plaintiff claims to recover $7,010.36 as the cost of the materials furnished and labour expended plus 12\u00bd% thereon, less $3,180 already paid. The County Court Judge at Hamilton, by whom the action was tried under the provisions of the Mechanics Lien Act, held that the clause above quoted should be rejected as repugnant to the absolute agreement to do the work for $3,000, and gave judgment for the latter sum plus $1,040.50 to which he held the plaintiff entitled for extras arising out of a number of changes in and departures from the specifications sanctioned by the defendants, less the $3,180 already paid.\nThe Appellate Division, after declaring that the covenant to furnish materials and do the work for $3,000.00 and the subsequent covenant providing for payment of the value of such materials and labour if amounting to more or less than $3,000.00 must\nbe read together and effect given to the latter covenant,\nreferred the matter to the local Master to ascertain the amount due to the plaintiff in accordance with this declaration. The defendants appeal and ask the restoration of the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe question presented is whether the later covenant in the contract, if given effect to, destroys the earlier one, or merely limits or qualifies its operation. In the latter case the cardinal rule of construction, that you must give effect to every part of a document if you can, must undoubtedly prevail; Elderslie SS. Co. v. Borthwick[15]; Williams v. Hathaway[16]; in the former the rule stated in Shepard\u2019s Touchstone at p. 38 (No. 7), that if there be two clauses or parts of the deed repugnant, the one to the other, the first part shall be preferred and the latter rejected, except there be some special reason to the contrary.\nappears to be so clearly established that, as the later clause, the covenant providing for payment of cost plus percentage must be rejected. Watling v. Lewis[17]; Cheshire Lines v. Lewis & Co.[18]; Furnivall v. Coombes[19]\u2014authorities cited by the appellants\u2014are in point.\nIf the later covenant in the contract now before us were given effect to, the only possible operation of the first covenant would be in the event of the cost of the materials supplied and the labour expended, plus 12\u00bd% thereon, amounting to precisely $3,000.00. In other words the contract would impose on the defendants a simple and unrestricted obligation to pay the cost of materials and labour plus 12\u00bd%, the minimum being $2,000.00. That which was an absolute covenant to do the work for $3,000.00 thus becomes, if effect be given to the later covenant, conditional upon the cost plus 12\u00bd% amounting to exactly that sum. That in my opinion is not merely an alteration or qualification of the covenant to furnish the materials and do the work specified for $3,000.00. It is wholly inconsistent with and repugnant to that covenant and destroys it.\nThere is no ground for interference with the disallowance by the judge of a portion of the amounts which the plaintiff in the alternative claimed to be due to him for extras. He obviously accepted and acted on the evidence of Evans and McNeill, two experts employed by the defendants to report on the items preferred by the plaintiff as extras, and there is no ground for rejecting his appreciation of their testimony. I would allow the appeal and restore the findings of the County Court Judge. The judgment directed by the Divisional Court should be varied accordingly. The appellants are entitled to their costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The appellants are Chinese restaurateurs and the respondent is a contractor.\nAt the beginning of the year 1919 the appellants, who were already running a restaurant in the City of Hamilton, leased from the defendant Mills a property situate on King street in that city for the purpose of establishing another restaurant in the same city. Alterations and repairs were needed since the property as laid down was not suitable for a restaurant. Partitions had to be removed; hard wood flooring had to be put in; private dining rooms, pantry, kitchen, a small sleeping room, and an archway at the entrance were needed. A contract was made on the 5th of March, 1919, between the appellants and the respondent for making the alterations and repairs therein specified for the sum of $3,000.00 payable in instalments, viz., $1,000.00 cash, $1,000.00 when the value of the work would have reached $2,500.00 and the remaining $1,000.00, thirty days after the completion of the work. This contract ends with the following clause, which is the cause of the whole trouble and which can hardly be reconciled with the fixed sum of $3,000 above mentioned:\u2014\nThe parties of the first part (Jean Git, Jean B. Hong and Jean S. Wing) covenant with the party of the second part (Sidney S. Forbes) that in the event of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed amounting in value to more than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the parties of the first part will reimburse the party of the second part for such excess. The party of the second part covenants that in the event of such labour and materials being less in value than three thousand ($3,000.00) then the final payment will be the actual amount expended by the party of the second part over two thousand ($2,000.00) plus twelve and one-half per cent. instead of one thousand as above stated. In estimating the value of the materials to be supplied and the labour performed the party of the second part on the final settlement of the amount due under this agreement shall produce all accounts paid by him for labour and materials and shall be entitled to the amount ascertained as paid by him for labour and materials plus twelve and one-half per cent.\nIn the first part of the contract we have, then, a formal agreement that the work was to be done for a fixed sum, $3,000.00, and then in the latter clause we have a stipulation that if the work done is worth less than $3,000.00 a certain deduction would be made, or, in other words, the owner would not pay the $3,000.00 specifically stipulated. On the other hand, if the work was worth more than $3,000.00, then the owners would have to pay the amount actually expended by the builder plus 12\u00bd%, which would be his profit on the job.\nThe repairs were made and, as is usual in cases of that kind, extras were put in by the contractor but for most, if not all, of these extras, agreements were made as to the price. In the course of the progress of the work the contractor said at one time that those extras would not amount to more than $500.00, then later, on May 15th, when all the work was finished Git made the last payment due under the contract and he asked Forbes to bring in the bill for the extras, and he asked him how much they would cost and Forbes said in a jocular way, about $1,000.00. Git expressed his surprise at that but he was still more surprised when Forbes came with a total bill not only of $4,000.00, including the contract price and $1,000 for extras, but he presented a bill totalling $7,010.36, or more than double the contract price. The contractor claimed that he was entitled to all that under the clause in the contract above quoted. The appellants, defendants, were very willing to pay $500.00 for extras, but refused to pay the rest. The present action was instituted claiming $3,830.36 after having deducted $3,180.00, which had already been paid. The action was based upon the contract though the plaintiff did not specifically rely upon the later clause. The action also claimed that in addition to the contract the plaintiff was requested to furnish other materials and to perform services not stated in the written contract.\nThe defendant pleaded that the agreement was for three thousand dollars and that they were willing to pay $500 for the extras.\nThe trial judge came to the conclusion that the clauses of the contract providing the first for a fixed sum and the later for a sliding scale were repugnant and gave effect to the first clause and in addition to that he found that there were extras to the extent of $1,632.05. But he found that on the contract proper work to the extent of $591.55 had not been performed. He gave judgment therefore in favour of the plaintiff for $1,040.50.\nThe Appellate Division reversed this decision, and came to the conclusion that the two clauses of the contract should be read together and that effect should be given to the later clause. Reference was ordered to determine the amount due under such a construction of the contract.\nThe case comes now before us.\nIt seems to me that these two clauses of the contract cannot be reconciled and that they are absolutely repugnant. In one case it is stated that the work is to be done for a fixed price, viz., $3,000.00, and later on we find a clause that this price will be increased or decreased according to the value of the work done. If we give effect to the latter clause the first one means nothing and I cannot see how we can read them together as ordered by the Appellate Division. Unfortunately we have no notes of the Appellate Division which could guide us. The parties evidently intended that the work would be done for $3,000.00. The proviso as to a sliding scale was inconsistent with this covenant and it becomes void and should be rejected. Furnivall v. Coombes[20]; Halsbury, Vol. 7, pages 517, 518; Cheshire Lines v. Lewis[21].\nThe conduct of the parties later on shews that this second covenant was not intended to be carried out. Payments were made on a basis of the $3,000.00 contract. Extras were ordered and the contractor was asked how much in excess of the $3,000.00 these extras would amount to and he said about $500.00. This answer puts on the contract a construction which should not be departed from. Later on he seemed to be almost ashamed of himself when he suggested these extras could amount to $1,000. But now when he comes to claim $3,830.36 his action could not be reasonably maintained for such a large amount. The judgment of the trial judge has done full justice to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The judgment a quo should be reversed with costs of this court and of the court below, and the judge\u2019s decision should be restored.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The two courts below arrived at different results mainly because they differed as to the rule of construction which should be applied to the contract between the parties. The first court considered absolutely irreconcilable the clause in the contract that the respondent would for the sum of $3,000.00 perform the work and furnish the materials specified, and the subsequent clause that if the work and materials would cost more than $3,000.00, the appellants would pay the excess, with 12\u00bd%, and if less, that they would pay the actual amount expended by the respondent, over and above $2,000.00, plus 12\u00bd%. And the learned trial judge applied the rule of construction which in such a case rejects the second of two clauses which are so repugnant that they cannot stand together (Corpus Juris, Vol. 13, page 536).\nThe Appellate Division, on the contrary, held that the two clauses should be read together and that effect should be given to the later covenant.\nIt appears to me absolutely impossible to give effect to the two clauses. For on the one hand the work specified is to be done for a lump sum of $3,000.00, and on the other, if it costs more than $3,000.00, the respondent is to have the excess cost, with 12\u00bd%, and if less, the appellants are to pay him a minimum of $2,000.00, plus the actual amount expended over that amount with 12\u00bd% added thereto. In other words, the work, by the first clause, is to be performed for a fixed price, while, by the second, it is to be paid for on the basis of a quantum meruit, with a minimum of $2,000.00, and a percentage on actual cost of 12\u00bd%.\nI fully recognize that when it is at all possible, it is the duty of the court to read together all the clauses of a contract, giving to each the meaning derived from the whole instrument. But where two clauses are irreconcilable, so as to be destructive the one of the other, one of these clauses must necessarily be disregarded, unless the whole contract is treated as void for uncertainty, and the rule appears to be to give effect to the first clause and to reject the other. Thus a proviso destroying a previously assumed personal liability, being repugnant to the covenant to pay and indemnify, was declared void of effect. Watling v. Lewis[22]. Applying this rule I must find that there is absolute repugnancy between these two clauses and therefore I must disregard the second clause.\nI therefore think that the basis of the judgment of the learned trial judge was the correct one, and that being the case I would not interfere with his decision with regard to the amount which is payable to the respondent for extra work not comprised in the contract, for which the respondent was granted a substantial sum.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the appellate division and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown & Gallagher.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bruce, Bruce & Counsell.\n[1] 5 Man. & G. 736.\n[2] [1877] 6 Ch.

Idington J. dissenting. Murray v. Town of Westmount (27 Can. S.C.R. 579) followed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action to quash a proc\u00e8s-verbal and a resolution homologating same, passed by the appellant for the purpose of opening a road and acquiring land by expropriation or otherwise. The material facts of the case are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of the registrar of this court on a motion to affirm jurisdiction, which motion was granted.\nThe Registrar.\u2014This is a motion to affirm the jurisdiction of the Court. The facts of the case are in part as follows:\u2014\nOn the 15th August, 1917, Jos. N. Poirier, named surintendent sp\u00e9cial of the municipal council of the county of Arthabaska by virtue of a resolution passed on 13th of June of the same year, made a proc\u00e8s verbal for the construction of a road as therein set out. The said proc\u00e8s verbal recited the regularity of the proceedings which led up to the same and ordered that a road should be opened and that certain lands should be expropriated for the highway and that the work should be executed by the appellant as provided by the municipal code, but at the cost and charges of the respondent and mise-en-cause. On the 12th September, 1917, this proc\u00e8s verbal was homologated and public notice thereof as required by the municipal code was duly given on the 19th September. By by-law No. 60 of the appellants, dated 11th September, 1918, a delay was granted for the completion of the work. On February 19th, 1919, an action was instituted by the present respondents to have the said proc\u00e8s verbal declared illegal and ultra vires and asking to have the resolution homologating the same annulled on a number of grounds. The case was inscribed en droit and argued before Mr. Justice Pouliot, who states in his judgment that the mayors of the respondent and mise-en-cause corporations had concurred in the resolution appointing Poirier as surintendent sp\u00e9cial of the projected work and in the resolution of Sept. 12th, 1917, of the appellants which homologated the proc\u00e8s verbal. The learned judge also says that the respondent corporation, by resolution of 10th Sept., 1917, supported the request of certain inhabitants of the respondent corporation who would be contributories to the expense of this work asking that some amendments should be made to the proc\u00e8s verbal in order that the road should be declared a county road and be at the charge of the county for opening and maintenance or at the charge of the petitioners, Boulanger et al, or to declare it a local road at the charge of the Corporation of St. Norbert, the mise-en-cause, and that consequently the plaintiff corporation could not be permitted to ask that the proc\u00e8s verbal be declared illegal as it had implicitly admitted its legality.\nThe said judgment also states that the proceedings in the expropriation had been made in execution of the said proc\u00e8s verbal, that arbitrators had been appointed, the lands valued and that indemnities had been accorded to the various proprietors, which indemnities had been paid to the parties expropriated and accepted by them and that the monies so paid amounted to $2,825, and the learned judge concludes his judgment by dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nOn appeal to the Court of King's Bench, the judgment of Mr. Justice Pouliot was reversed and from this judgment the present appeal is taken to the Supreme Court of Canada. The respondents in this court oppose the motion relying strongly upon the decision of Toussignant v. Nicolet[1], the head-note of which says:\u2014\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in a suit to annul a proc\u00e8s verbal establishing a public highway notwithstanding that the effect of the proc\u00e8s verbal in question maybe to involve an expenditure of over $2,000 for which the appellant's lands would be liable to assessment by the municipal corporation. The judgment of the court was pronounced by Sir Henri, then Mr. Justice, Taschereau in which he held that the jurisprudence of the court was against the right to entertain the appeal. He says:\u2014\nThe fact that the proc\u00e8s verbal attacked by the appellants' action may have the result to put upon them the cost of the work in question, alleged to be over $2,000, does not make the controversy one of $2,000. There is no pecuniary amount in controversy; in other words there is no controversy as to a pecuniary amount or of a pecuniary nature.\nIt is settled law that neither the probative force of a judgment, nor its collateral effects, nor any contingent loss that a party may suffer by reason of a judgment are to be taken into consideration when our jurisdiction depends upon the pecuniary amount or upon any of the subjects mentioned in sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act.\nAt the conclusion of his judgment he says that certain decisions of the court are authorities against the appellants' claim to an appeal based upon s.s. (g) of sec. 24 of the Act, (now sec. 39 (e)) and proceeds:\u2014\nThen this is not a case of a by-law, but of a proc\u00e8s verbal. And it is a private action, not a petition to annul under the Municipal Act. The distinction between these two proceedings was made in Webster v. The City of Sherbrooke[2], and McKay v. Township of Hinchinbrooke[3].\nI am of the opinion that the authority of this decision has been much shaken by subsequent decisions. So far as it holds that where a municipal by-law is attacked in a private action that the judgment quashing the by-law would only be binding as between the parties it is seriously controverted by some of the judges in the case of Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water & Power Co.[4]. In the latter case also the majority of the court held that although the proceeding was one nominally for an injunction, the court would look at the substance of the appeal which in that case was the validity of a contract involving $40,000 and on that ground held that the court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. More recently in the case of Bisaillon v. the City of Montreal[5], it was held in an action brought to annul a resolution of the City of Montreal and for an injunction to restrain the city from proceeding to expropriate lands, that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction under sect. 46 s.s. e of the \"Supreme Court Act\" ont he ground that it involved title to lands and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound. The most recent case of all is that of La Ville de La Tuque v. Desbien, decided in February, 1920, and reported shortly in the Supplement to Cameron's Supreme Court Practice, p. 35. At the time of the publication of the supplement the reasons for judgment were not available. I have them now so far as any were delivered, viz., those of Mr. Justice Brodeur (concurred in by Mr. Justice Idington) and of Mr. Justice Mignault. In that case the declaration alleges that the municipal council of La Tuque had passed a resolution ordering the opening of a new road according to the terms of the petition. The declaration alleged that the road had been opened to the public for three or four weeks; the resolution of the council was attacked on the ground that it was illegal and ultra vires, as the municipality had no power to buy the land required for the opening of the road; and that the proceeding by way of by-law and resolution was not sufficient to make valid the procedure of the municipal council. Mr. Justice Gibsone in the Superior Court found in favour of the plaintiff and declared the resolution illegal and ultra vires and ordered the road to be closed and his judgment was confirmed by the Court of King's Bench. Thereupon an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada and the respondent moved to quash for want of jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Brodeur says:\u2014 S'il s'agissait que de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution ordonnant l'ouver ture d'une rue, il n'y aurait pas de doute que nous n'aurions pas juridiction. Verch\u00e8res v. Varennes[6]; Bell Telephone Co. v. Qu\u00e9bec[7]; Dubois v. Ste. Rose[8].\nMais cette r\u00e9solution comporte l'acceptation de donation et l'achat des terrains pour une somme exc\u00e9dant $2,000. Ces terrains, dont le titre \u00e9tait en faveur de la corporation, cessent par l\u00e0 m\u00eame d'\u00eatre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la corporation municipale et les vendeurs ou les donateurs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause redeviennent les propri\u00e9taires des terrains qu'ils avaient c\u00e9d\u00e9s.\nJe ne vois pas la diff\u00e9rence entre la pr\u00e9sente cause et celle de Murray v. Westmount[9], o\u00f9 nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que dans une action pour annuler un r\u00e8glement pour l'expropriation d'un terrain le litige a trait \u00e0 un droit immobilier, \"title to lands.\"\nJe pourrais aussi citer la cause de Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water & Power Co.[10], o\u00f9 il s'agissait d'un r\u00e8glement ordonnant l'achat de certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. La majorit\u00e9 de la cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que nous avions jurisdiction.\nLa cause de Bisaillon v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[11] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e pour annuler une r\u00e9solution par laquelle la cit\u00e9 se d\u00e9sistait de l'expropriation de certains terrains et limitait son expropriation \u00e0 d'autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s; et nous en sommes venus \u00e0 la conclusion que cette cour avait jurisdiction.\nLa motion doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nMr. Justice Mignault in his judgment states:\u2014\nJe suis d'opinion que l'affaire en litige s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 la somme ou valeur d'au moins deux mille dollars.\nLe maintien de l'action de l'intim\u00e9 a n\u00e9cessairement l'effet de rendre nulles les ventes de terrains que les mis-en-cause ont fait \u00e0 l'appelante, car s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que la r\u00e9solution en question est ill\u00e9gale, ultra vires et nulle, et s'il est fait d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'appelante de donner suite \u00e0 la dite r\u00e9solution, il restera d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'appelante n'avait pas le droit d'acheter ces terrains pour l'ouverture de la nouvelle rue, et elle ne pourra pas payer la balance qui reste due sur les achats, car ce serait donner suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution qu'elle a adopt\u00e9e. Le montant ou valeur en contestation est d'au moins $2,000.\nPour cette raison je suis d'avis que le droit d'appel existe, mais ce droit d'appel pourrait \u00e9galement se justifier sous l'op\u00e9ration du paragraphe (b) de l'article 46 de l'\"Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame,\" car l'affaire en litige \"a rapport \u00e0 un titre de terres ou tenements\".\nJe suis donc d'avis que la motion de l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. The present case, I think, is clearly distinguishable from Toussignant v. Nicolet[12] in this regard that in the latter the proceedings were taken as soon as the resolution of the municipal council was passed homologating the proc\u00e8s verbal. In the present case after homologation the road was laid out, lands were expropriated, moneys paid to the property owners in amount exceeding $2,000 and the lands became the property of the municipality. If the present judgment appealed from should stand it would mean that the municipality will have no title to the lands expropriated. There is therefore clearly a title to lands involved and a sum of money exceeding $2,000 and these are not matters collateral to the proc\u00e8s verbal but are the very substance and essence of the matter in controversy between the parties.\nI am therefore of opinion that there is jurisdiction in this court to hear the appeal. At any rate the question of jurisdiction is sufficiently doubtful, putting it most favourably to the respondent, that I conceive it my duty to allow the application because no special prejudice will arise to respondent. He still has the right to move to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction at the opening of the court. April 8th, 1921, E. R. Cameron, Registrar.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. and W. Girouard for the motion.\nAntonio Perreault K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014This suit being essentially nothing but a struggle between appellant, a county municipality, and the respondents, which are other municipal corporations within same, as to the validity of a proc\u00e8s verbal of the appellant and proceedings pursuant thereto for the purpose of constituting a county highway and of imposing the burden of creating and maintaining same, or respective parts thereof, upon the respondents, I fail to understand how either the title to land or the amount which might be involved in the execution of the project if carried out, are at all in question. Probably some day we will hear the argument put forward that we have jurisdiction because two thousand dollars had been spent by the parties in litigation and that hence it is necessary to see which party we should direct to pay that sum.\nI am of the opinion that we have no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and that the affirmation by the registrar's order of such right must be reversed with costs of the application before him and of this motion.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nMignault J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9e demande la cassation de cet appel, pr\u00e9tendant que nous sommes sans juridiction pour en conna\u00eetre. Le savant greffier de cette cour, M. Cameron, sur une motion de l'appelante, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que nous avions juridiction, mais l'intim\u00e9e n'en demande pas moins que l'appel soit cass\u00e9.\nL'action de l'intim\u00e9e, rejet\u00e9e par la cour sup\u00e9rieure mais maintenue par la cour du Banc du Roi, est en cassation d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal homologu\u00e9 par le conseil de l'appelante, et par ses conclusions l'intim\u00e9e demande l'annulation du proc\u00e8s-verbal et de la r\u00e9solution d'homologation. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal ordonne l'ouverture d'un chemin et l'acquisition \u00e0 l'amiable ou par expropriation du terrain n\u00e9cessaire, et la r\u00e9solution du conseil de l'appelante, en homologuant ce proc\u00e8s-verbal, ordonne par l\u00e0-m\u00eame cette acquisition ou cette expropriation. L'intim\u00e9e a attendu si longtemps avant d'intenter son action que le terrain \u00e0 \u00eatre occup\u00e9 par le chemin avait \u00e9t\u00e9, lors de la signification des proc\u00e9dures, non seulement expropri\u00e9 mais pay\u00e9, la d\u00e9pense totale se montant \u00e0 $2,825.00.\nJe suis d'opinion qu'il y a lieu d'appliquer ici la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans Murray v. The Town of Westmount[13]. Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause une r\u00e9solution du conseil municipal ordonnait l'\u00e9largissement d'une rue et l'acquisition ou l'expropriation du terrain requis. Ici c'est une route qu'on veut ouvrir et le proc\u00e8s-verbal et la r\u00e9solution d'homologation d\u00e9cr\u00e8tent l'acquisition \u00e0 l'amiable ou par expropriation de l'emplacement du chemin. Il y a donc parit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te entre les deux esp\u00e8ces, et puisque dans Murray v. Town of Westmount13 nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que nous avions juridiction, le litige se rapportant \"\u00e0 un titre, \u00e0 des terres ou tenements\" (art. 46, \"Loi concernant la cour supr\u00eame\"), il faut n\u00e9cessairement en arriver \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion ici.\nJe suis d'avis de renvoyer la motion de l'intim\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1902] 32 Can.

Finucane (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: May 3, 4; 1921: June 7.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nDebtor and creditor\u2014Banks and banking\u2014Whole output hypothecated to bank\u2014Part given as security for outside loan\u2014Bank's approval\u2014Liability to account.\nThe R. Co., pulp manufacturers, being indebted to the appellant bank, had hypothecated to it their whole output. Respondent made a loan to R. Co. of $5,000; and, as security, R. Co. undertook to pay him \"$10 per ton from the proceeds of each ton of pulp manufactured and sold.\" This agreement was marked approved by the bank. All the proceeds of pulp sales were deposited in the appellant bank to the credit of R. Co. Certain sums were paid to respondent by the bank, pursuant to this agreement; but later the bank refused to honour cheques drawn by R. Co. in favour of the respondent who brought action against the bank.\nHeld, that the appellant bank was liable to account to the respondent for $10 per ton from the proceeds of pulp sales actually received by it from R. Co.\nPer Duff J. and semble Anglin J.\u2014Such agreement was an equitable assignment to the respondent of $10 per ton of the proceeds of pulp sales received by the appellant bank.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014This agreement created an equitable charge on such proceeds to the extent of $10 per ton.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 1 W.W.R. 456) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Morrison J. at the trial (1) and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nE. A. Lucas for the appellant.\nE. P. Davis K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. I do not consider that the construction of the agreement in question admits of any reasonable doubt. The bank was liable under it to account to the Holley Mason Hardware Co. in consideration of that company's advancing $50,000 to the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company, for $10 of the proceeds of each ton of pulp deposited with it by the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company. All the output of that company was hypothecated to the bank as security for the advances made by the bank to this company from time to time. The bank instead of recognising and acting upon its liability under the above agreement with the Holley Mason Hardware Co. paid out the whole of the proceeds of the pulp deposited with it by the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company to third parties on the cheques and orders of the Rainy River Co. and now disputes its liability to the Holley Mason Co. for that $10 per ton of the proceeds of the pulp deposited with it. I cannot doubt their liability so to reserve and account to the Holley Mason Hardware Co. for this $10 per ton of pulp received by it and so would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs. I can have no doubt that the instrument in question operated as an equitable assignment and that it affected the funds which came into the hands of the bank.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nThe document executed by the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company and assented to and approved by the appellant bank, if not an equitable assignment to the plaintiff's assignor of $10 per ton of the proceeds of its product hypothecated to the bank and received by it (as I incline to regard it) was at least an equitable charge to that extent on such proceeds. It was well understood by all parties when the document was executed that the bank would handle, as it did in fact, all the proceeds of the Rainy River Company's output. The purpose of the document given by that company to the plaintiff's assignor was to give the latter effective security on those proceeds for the sum of $50,000 which it was advancing to improve the financial position of the Rainy River Company. In order to make that security effective it was essential that the part of those proceeds intended to go to the plaintiff's assignor should be held for it; and that fact was of course well known to the bank. By its assent to and approval of the instrument the bank, in my opinion, impliedly undertook that out of the monies to be received by it as proceeds of the output of the Rainy River Company there would be withheld from other disposition by that company sums sufficient to satisfy the security on those proceeds given to the plaintiff's assignor. The bank, with full knowledge of what was being done, became a party to the fund so appropriated being diverted, while in its hands, by the Rainy River Company to third parties. The bank probably benefitted indirectly from such diversion. But apart from deriving benefit therefrom, the fact that it became a party to the diversion renders it liable to the plaintiff. Its officers knew that money in its hands belonging in equity to the plaintiff's assignor or which it was entitled to have held for its benefit was being misapplied by the bank's customer and the bank participated in that misapplication by honouring the cheques by which it was made.\nMignault J.\u2014The judgment of the first court contains the following admission of the parties:\u2014\nIt being admitted and agreed in lieu of an accounting that 844 tons of pulp were manufactured and sold by the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company during the months of November and December, 1918, and January, 1919, and that the proceeds of the sale of 724 tons thereof were deposited in the defendant bank to the credit of the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company, and that the proceeds of the balance, 120 tons, were paid to the assignee of the said Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company.\nOn this admission of facts, the learned trial judge, instead of ordering an accounting, condemned the appellant to pay the respondent $10.00 per ton on 724 tons, in all, $7,240.00. The question whether he was right in so doing\u2014and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice McPhillips, dissenting\u2014stands to be determined on the construction of the letter of the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company, to the Holley-Mason Hardware Company (now represented by the respondent), dated May 13th, 1918.\nBy this letter, the former company promised to repay $50,000 loaned to it by the latter company, and as security to pay $10.00 per ton from the proceeds of each ton of pulp manufactured and sold by it from the 1st of June, 1918, until full re-payment. The letter added (I copy textually from the plaintiff's exhibit No. 1):\u2014\nIt is understood that our bankers, the Standard Bank of Canada, to which all our output is hypothecated for advances from time to time, has full knowledge of this arrangement and approves of it, and will waive its security to that extent.\nAt the foot of the letter the approval of the appellant is given by the word \"approved\" followed by the signature of the bank per G. C. Perkins, manager.\nMr. Perkins was replaced as manager of the Vancouver Branch of the appellant bank on October 1st, 1918, by Mr. J. M. Sutherland, who, in his examination on discovery, states that so far as he knows every cent of the money that was received on account of sales of pulp went into the account, in the appellant bank, of the Rainy River Pulp and Paper Company. The latter company issued drafts against the sale and shipment of pulp and discounted them with the appellant, to whom it was indebted and remained so for large advances. One draft appears to have been sent to another bank, the Bank of Kentucky, but this is immaterial in so far as the issues here are concerned. The whole output of the Rainy River Company was hypothecated to the appellant, so that the security obtained by the Holley Mason Hardware Company required the consent of the appellant, and this consent was given no doubt because the loan of $50,000 was for the advantage of the Rainy River Company and presumably also of the bank, its creditor, where the proceeds of the loan were deposited. I may add that the Rainy River Company made monthly returns to the Holley Mason Hardware Company of its sales of pulp, accompanied by its cheques for the 10 per cent, and, although in one instance at least no sufficient funds stood to the credit of the Rainy River Company, these cheques were accepted and paid by the bank until December 1918, when, on the instructions of Mr. Sutherland, further payments were refused, the Rainy River Company not having sufficient funds to meet the cheques issued by it in favour of the Holley Mason Hardware Company.\nThe material facts are therefore, that the proceeds of pulp sales were deposited in the bank to the credit of the Rainy River Company, that the latter was allowed by the bank to draw out these proceeds, that for some months the ten per cent on the pulp sales was paid to the Holley Mason Hardware Company by cheques drawn on the bank, and accepted by the latter, although in one instance at least there were not sufficient funds to the credit of the Rainy River Company, and that from December, 1918, the bank refused to pay any further cheques issued in favour of the Holley Mason Hardware Company, although the Rainy River Company continued to discount its drafts and draw cheques on its account. It does not appear that the debt due the bank was reduced by means of these discounts. I may add that all drafts discounted were charged in the usual course to the Rainy River Company and their payment credited to it.\nNeither of the parties referred us to section 96 of the \"Bank Act,\" the effect of which is to exempt a bank from liability by reason of a trust affecting a bank deposit, although the bank has notice thereof, and the receipt of the depositor is declared to be a sufficient discharge to all concerned for the payment of any money payable in respect of such deposit.\nI am disposed to think that unless the approval given by the bank to the transaction between the Rainy River Company and the Holley Mason Hardware Company is more than a mere acknowledgment of notice of the trust affecting the deposit of the proceeds of the pulp sales, this approval would not give a cause of action to the assignee of the Holley Mason Company against the bank. But this approval seems to me much more than an acknowledgment of notice of this trust. In terms, it waives the bank's security to the extent of ten per cent, and not only this waiver but the approval of the whole transaction in my opinion takes the matter out of the terms of a general provision like section 96. It seems unquestionable that an equitable charge was created on the proceeds of the pulp sales to the extent of the ten per cent, and when these proceeds were deposited in the bank, the latter, in view of its assent to the letter of the 13th of May, 1918, could not, either by asserting its own Hen, or by allowing the Rainy River Company to draw on the proceeds, defeat the claim of the Holley Mason Company to the ten per cent. In other words when the bank received these proceeds of pulp sales on deposit it took them subject to the charge affecting them and became a trustee towards the Holley Mason Hardware Company for the payment to it of the ten per cent. On that ground I think the trial judge and the Court of Appeal rightly held the appellant liable for the ten per cent of the proceeds of pulp sales actually received by it from the Rainy River Company.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lucas, Lucas & Richmond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Zennie & Clark.\n[1] [1921] 1 W.W.R. 456.\n"

Respondent\n1921: May 10.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nAppeal\u2014Certiorari\u2014\"Criminal charge\"\u2014\"Supreme Court Act\" s. 36, as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V., c. 32. A judgment quashing a conviction for an infraction of a provincial liquor act is a judgment in a proceeding arising out of a criminal charge within the exception to section 36 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V., c. 32. Mitchell v. Tracey (58 Can. S.C.R. 640) applied.\nAPPEAL by the intending appellant from an order of the Registrar refusing to affirm the jurisdiction of the court and approve the security.\nThe intended respondent was convicted before a magistrate in the Province of Alberta after the 1st of July, 1920, for unlawfully selling liquor in contravention of the \"Albert a Liquor Act.\" The liquor, which was seized and was of considerable value, was also declared forfeited to His Majesty. The conviction having been brought before Mr. Justice Hyndman of the Supreme Court of Alberta on certiorari was quashed and the order of forfeiture set aside. On appeal, the Appellate Division sustained that judgment, the Chief Justice dissenting. From this latter judgment it is now sought to appeal to this court. THE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is an application to affirm the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe facts shortly are: That an information was laid on the 7th day of October, 1920, against the respondent before Geo. B. McLeod, a magistrate in the Province of Alberta, charging that he did \"unlawfully sell a quantity of liquor contrary to the Liquor Act and amendments thereto.\" After trial the respondent was convicted in the language of the information and was adjudged to pay $200 and costs and at the same time an order was made declaring that the liquor seized, of very considerable quantity and value, should be forfeited to His Majesty to be sold or otherwise disposed of as the Attorney-General might direct. Thereupon a motion by way of certiorari was made before the Honourable Mr. Justice Hyndman to have the conviction quashed which was granted on the 21st of December, 1920, and at the same time an order forfeiting the goods seized was set aside and quashed. From these orders of Mr. Justice Hyndman an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, where his judgment, by a judgment dated Feb. 21st, 1921, was sustained, the Chief Justice dissenting.\nThe contention on behalf of the Crown is that this is not a criminal appeal and that the amount involved exceeds $2,000. The case is one falling under the amendment to the \"Supreme Court Act\" by 1011 Geo. V, ch. 32. I will assume for the purposes of my judgment that the amount involved exceeds $2,000, there being evidence to that effect in the appeal book, as I am of the opinion that this case is one of certiorari arising out of a criminal charge which is excepted from the court's jurisdiction by section 36. Previous to the decisions of Re McNutt[1] and Mitchell v. Tracey[2], a strong argument might have been presented to the Court that an order for certiorari to set aside a conviction under a \"Liquor License Act\" was a civil and not a criminal proceeding. Apparently the case of Bigelow v. the Queen[3], was one of this kind and the court assumed there was jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal. By the recent decisions above mentioned I am of the opinion that the question of the jurisdiction of this court is now settled and that a proceeding by way of prohibition, certiorari or habeas corpus arising out of a conviction made pursuant to the \"Liquor Act\" of Alberta or the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" are proceedings \"on a criminal charge\" within the meaning of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and that a judgment in such case of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta is not the subject of a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. If the conviction falls the order for a forfeiture necessarily accompanies it.\nS. B. Woods K.C., for the intended appellant.\u2014Since the adoption of the new section 36 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" enacted by 10 & 11 Geo. V, c. 32, Mitchell v. Tracey2 is no longer an authority upon the interpretation of the words \"arising out of a criminal charge.\" Those words closely follow the words \"except in criminal causes.\" The adjective \"criminal\" must be given the same meaning throughout the section. The words \"in criminal causes\" replaced the former provision contained in clause (b) of s. 36, \"there shall be no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code.\" It is therefore quite clear that \"criminal causes\" in the new section 36 relates to crimes cognizable under the criminal code. The distinction made between \"criminal case\" in clause (b) and \"criminal charge\" in clause (a) of the former section chiefly depended upon the fact that these terms were found in different contexts and in separate sub-clauses of the section. It being clear that \"criminal causes\" means proceedings instituted under the criminal code, \"proceedings * * arising out of a criminal charge\" should be given the same construction.\nC. C. McCaul K.C., for the intended respondent.\u2014 While it is clear that the exception of \"criminal causes\" in the new section replaced clause (b) of the old s. 36, it is equally clear that the exception of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a \"criminal charge\" replaces the corresponding provision of clause (a) of the former section. The words \"except as provided in the criminal code\" were dropped as tautologous because covered by the provision of new s. 43. In construing it the history of the new section cannot be ignored. There is nothing to indicate that parliament intended to change the law. On the contrary, everything points to consolidation and abbreviation having been the purposes of the change made. Had parliament intended the construction contended for on behalf of the Crown, we should have found the words \"arising thereout\" instead of \"arising out of a criminal charge.\" The fact that the latter words, which had received judicial construction, are re-enacted, cannot be ignored.\nAt the conclusion of the argument the judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014 THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Notwithstanding the ingenious and able argument advanced by Mr. Woods, we are unanimously of the opinion that we are without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and that our decision in Mitchell v. Tracey[4], governs the construction of the words \"arising out of a criminal charge\" in s. 36 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 32.,\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 47 Can. S.C.R. 259.\n[2] 58 Can. S.C.R. 640.\n[3] 31 Can. S.C.R. 128.\n2 58 Can. S.C.R. 640.\n[4] 58 Can. S.C.R. 640.\n"

Leech (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Lethbridge (Defendant) Respondent\n1921: May 12, 13; 1921: June 7.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nNegligence\u2014Collision\u2014Tramways\u2014Right of way\u2014By-law\u2014Obligation to look-out\u2014Jury trial\u2014Misdirection. The appellant, while driving an automobile, was injured by collision with a tram car operated by the respondent. In an action for damages, the jury found that both the appellant and the respondent were at fault. Evidence was adduced of a by-law giving the street car a right of way over other vehicles; and the trial judge in his charge said in substance that this by-law relieved the motorman, when travelling at a proper rate of speed, from the obligation to keep a look-out.\nHeld, Idington J. contra, that this was misdirection; but\nHeld also, Duff J. dissenting, that in view of the findings of the jury, read in the light of the evidence, no substantial wrong or miscarriage resulted therefrom.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. J. H. Leech K.C. for the appellant.\nW. S. Ball for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I think the findings of the jury are fully justified by the evidence.\nA question was properly raised by appellant's counsel to the effect that there was misdirection on the part of the trial judge as to the street cars \"right of way,\" but I do not think, looking at the case as a whole, that the jury were misled by any such misdirection, or that any substantial wrong or miscarriage resulted from it.\nThe plaintiff's negligence found by the jury on evidence fully warranting it was not affected by the misdirection complained of.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant driving an automobile on one of the streets of Lethbridge which crosses at right angles another street a hundred feet wide, whereon the respondent has a double track street railway, attempted to cross said railway. After crossing the first track in safety and getting on the second of said tracks, a street car moving thereon struck his car \"amidships,\" as one of the witnesses aptly describes the results. This happened between one and two o'clock p.m. and not as a result of appellant's car being stalled or hampered in any way, or his vision obscured, unless by his own want of care in closing the side curtains of his automobile.\nThe appellant sued respondent herein for damages arising from said collision alleging they resulted from said street car being operated negligently, carelessly and recklessly, and at excessive speed, and, in contravention of the law, was in charge of a motorman whose physical defects unfitted him for the proper discharge of his duties. These allegations were denied by the pleadings of the defendant (now respondent) and the latter alleged in its defence that the damages claimed were the result of reckless and careless driving by the plaintiff (now appellant) and that he was unable to see the street car by reason of the enclosed sort of car which he was driving and that he was driving at a high rate of speed and drove it into the street car of respondent.\nThe learned trial judge charged the jury in a most fair and impartial spirit though some isolated sentences may contain propositions liable to criticism as possibly capable of better expression of the exact law bearing on the subject. What charge is not?\nNone of such were, if the jury is to be assumed as possessed of common sense, at all likely to mislead in a case which required only the application of such sense to properly dispose of all involved.\nHe submitted five questions to the jury.\nThe only objection taken to the charge was to ask the correction of a statement relative to some minor matter of evidence, which was duly acceded to.\nIt was admitted in argument herein that the said questions had been submitted to the counsel engaged at the trial and no objection of any kind was taken thereto, or any request made for further questions.\nThe first three questions submitted were as follows and answered as appears set opposite each respectively:-\n1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant? A. Yes.\n2. If the answer to the first question be \"Yes,\" in what respect was the defendant negligent? A. Inasmuch as the motorman did not exercise the necessary observation in failing to see plaintiff's car approaching from the north.\n3. If there was any negligence on the part of the defendant, could the plaintiff have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence? A. Decidedly yes. In light of the pleadings, the evidence, and the learned judge's charge, these answers would seem conclusively to dispose of the whole case.\nThe fourth question related to damages if assessed, but in the result no need therefor. I will refer to the fifth question presently.\nIt is to be observed that the first question does not distinctly raise the question of negligence of the defendant causing the accident.\nOne of the peculiarities of the case is that there is nothing proven as to the alleged excessive speed or anything in the way of neglect in way of outlook or otherwise, which could properly be held to have caused the accident if the plaintiff had observed common sense and prudence.\nHence the importance of the answer to the third question. The answers to the first two questions no doubt were the result of evidence as to the defective eyesight of the motorman upon which the learned trial judge made some pointed remarks in his charge.\nThe finding being confined to the outlook question all the other allegations of negligence on the part of respondent presumably failed and hence are impliedly negatived by the answer of the jury.\nWhen we read the evidence of the appellant and find from his own story such a remarkable mass of evidence of neglect, on his part, of the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, we can realize the import of the answer \"Decidedly yes.\"\nThe facts, that there was no objection as now taken to the learned judge's charge, or to the questions put, or request for further questions thus submitted, would have furnished at almost any of said respective stages in the development of these aspects of trial by jury, an impassable barrier to the plaintiff seeking a new trial. But to put an end, if possible, to such departures from that violation thereof as had become too common, an imperative prohibition was introduced in England and other jurisdictions into the rules against granting new \"trials, unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage had been occasioned on the trial.\nThat so far as Alberta is concerned appears in section 329 of its Judicature Ordinance, as follows:\u2014\n329.\u2014A new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question which the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to them, unless in the opinion of the court to which application is made some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned on the trial; and if it appears to such court that such wrong or miscarriage affects part only of the matter in controversy, or some or one only of the parties, the court may give final judgment as to part thereof, or some or one only of the parties and direct a new trial as to the other part only or as to the other party or parties.\nHaving, in order to be able to observe the terms of this rule, read the entire evidence, I fail to understand how any claim can be reasonably made on the part of one so far disregarding, as appellant did, the most ordinary rules of prudence and thereby placing himself where he and his car were injured.\nNot only is it quite obvious that he must not have exercised due care, looking from where he claims he did, to see if a street car was in sight, but that his venturing to cross at a moment when, if he had looked or listened properly, he must have realized collision was inevitable unless he stopped or turned his car aside.\nIndeed the street cars in Lethbridge may, by some secret method unexplained, travel in silence instead of making the noise the like cars make elsewhere, especially if running at high speed as charged, quite enough to awaken any ordinary dreamer gliding quietly along in his auto. There is no evidence on that point, but I rather think from the evidence we have of Commissioner Freedman that the use of whistles and gongs is forbidden unless in case of absolute necessity that might serve a useful purpose, as in the case of an auto driver threatening to intrude upon the right of way of the street cars as they in moving make quite enough noise.\nNotwithstanding the said evidence the appellant swore as to such warnings, as follows.\u2014\nQ.\u2014Do you know whether that is the custom where there is any one crossing the track?\nA.\u2014I could not say as to that; I know it is customary to get a signal at an intersection; I know we have been saved a good many times; I am saying that from my own experience.\nQ.\u2014That is, if crossing a track you get a signal?\nA.\u2014Not always, but I know I have scores of times got a signal as I was approaching a street car on an avenue or street, which has in many cases saved me.\nIs it to be inferred that he must have been habitually an offender by getting in the way of street cars?\nHowever all that may be I am not surprised that the Appellate Division, possessed of local general knowledge which we are not, dismissed his appeal without making any remarks.\nThe fifth question submitted to the jury, and answer thereto is as follows:\u2014\n5. If there was negligence on the part of the defendant and contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, could the motorman have then avoided the accident by reasonable care?\nA.\u2014No. As the motorman had right of way.\nThere was in the evidence no need of this question as very often exists to elicit the facts as to possible ultimate negligence.\nThe appellant's car came in sight of the motorman of the street car when, as he expresses it, the two were within six or eight feet of each other and he instantly reversed and did all possible to save the situation, and that is corroborated by the uncontradicted evidence of the mechanical condition of the street car when examined after the accident.\nThe reference in the answer to the motorman having the right of way must be read in light of the learned judge's charge correctly stating the law as fixed by the bylaws when travelling at a reasonable rate of speed.\nI submit the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting):\u2014The learned trial judge seems to have misstated the law to the jury in a very important point. Nothing in the city by-law could excuse the failure of the motorman to keep a proper lookout; and to tell the jury that this was not required so long as a moderate speed was maintained necessarily must have had the effect of misleading them in respect of the material issues.\nThe failure to take the objection does not, I think, preclude the appellant from raising the point on appeal. Even when the error complained of is misdirection this is not the necessary consequence of failure to take the objection at the trial; White v. Victoria Lumber & Manufacturing Co.[1]; and it seems that, the learned trial judge having explained his view in the clear, precise and concrete terms used by him, no objection taken by counsel was at all likely to lead to an amendment.\nThe point to be considered is whether it is clear that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Now it is plain enough that on the evidence it was quite open to the jury to find excessive speed and furthermore to find that by reason of excessive speed the motorman had disabled himself from avoiding the consequences of appellant's negligence; Columbia Bithulitic Limited v. British Columbia Electric Ry. Co.[2]; and also that the motorman by failing to maintain a proper lookout had negligently prevented himself becoming aware of the appellant's negligence in time to avoid the consequences of it. In other words, on the evidence it was quite open to the jury to have found the facts in such a way as to bring the case within Loach's Case[3]. In truth the jury probably thought there was excessive speed; otherwise the jury's finding is not easily to be understood. And at all events the finding in answer to the last question is obviously the result of the learned judge's erroneous direction as to the necessity of a proper lookout.\nThe appellant has I think suffered substantial wrong and there should be a new trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although there was undoubtedly grave misdirection in telling the jury that the by-law giving right of way to the defendants' street car on the streets of the town relieved their motorman when travelling at a proper rate of speed from keeping a lookout, the findings of the jury read in the fight of all the evidence satisfy me that no substantial wrong or miscarriage on the trial resulted therefrom. (R. 329). The misdirection had to do only with the negligence of the defendants. The jury found that the defendants were negligent in that their \"motorman did not exercise the necessary observation\" and that finding was not challenged. The negligence charged and found against the plaintiff was not affected by the direction complained of. Apart from misdirection no ground for interference with that finding was suggested. The only finding of the jury which could have been affected by the misdirection was that in regard to what has sometimes been termed \"ultimate negligence.\" In answer to the question \"if there was negligence on the part of the defendant and contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, could the motorman have then avoided the accident by reasonable care?\" the jury said:\u2014\"No. As the motorman had right of way.\"\nBut the circumstances of the case were such that no issue of \"ultimate\" negligence on the part of the defendants arose.\nHaving regard to all the circumstances I think the finding that the plaintiff could by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence have avoided the accident was a sufficient finding of contributory negligence on his part.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is not a very satisfactory case. The appellant, who was driving an automobile in the streets of Lethbridge, was injured by coming in collision when crossing the street car line with a tram car operated by the respondent. The appellant's side curtains were closed and the only way he could see was through the glass windshield, which would give him a range of vision on either side of about 150 feet, and he says he looked when approximately 20 feet from the street on which the cars ran, but saw no car. The motorman saw the automobile only when it was on the track and then of course it was too late to avoid the collision. My impression is that he was not keeping a proper lookout, but on the other hand it seems to me that had the appellant acted as a reasonably prudent man would have done he should have seen the tram car in time to stop before reaching the tracks. After hearing the evidence, the jury came to the conclusion that both the appellant and the motorman were at fault, the latter because he did not exercise the necessary observation, and their reply to the third question, whether, if there was negligence on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff could have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, was \"Decidedly yes.\" The appellant's action was dismissed, and the judgment of the learned trial judge was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nThe answer of the jury to the third question would be conclusive against the appellant if the jury were properly directed. That however is the difficulty here. The learned trial judge, referring to a by-law of the City of Lethbridge giving the street cars a right of way over all other vehicles travelling on the highway, said to the jury:\u2014\nThe effect of that is that travelling at a proper rate of speed when approaching a crossing it is the duty of the automobile owner to avoid a collision and not the duty of the motorman in travelling at a proper rate of speed to keep a lookout.\nFurther the learned trial judge stated:\nIt appears to me that, although to a lesser extent, the street car having the right of way and proceeding at a reasonable rate of speed under the circumstances and an automobile comes in contact with it, the owner of the automobile is responsible for the damage sustained and that the owner of the street railway would not incur responsibility. That appears to me to be the effect of this by-law.\nWith all deference I cannot think that this was a proper direction to the jury. The by-law giving right of way to the street cars certainly did not relieve the motorman, even when travelling at a proper rate of speed, from the obligation to keep a proper lookout in order to avoid coming in collision with vehicles crossing the car tracks.\nThe difficulty in the way of the appellant is however twofold.\nIn the first place no objection was taken on behalf of the appellant at the trial to this direction of the learned trial judge, and I cannot but believe that if such an objection had been made the learned judge would have found it advisable to qualify his statement. The appellant by failing to object seems to have taken the chance of the jury's verdict.\nIn the second place, the jury, notwithstanding the statements I have quoted, evidently thought the motorman should have taken a proper observation of the roadway, for they found the respondent negligent because he had not done so. And they considered the appellant guilty of the ultimate negligence which caused the accident. No miscarriage therefore occurred on account of the judge's charge.\nAs a result I would not interfere with the verdict and the appeal should in my opinion be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1910] A.C. 606.\n[2] [1917] 55 Can.

JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nNegligence\u2014Railway\u2014Level crossing\u2014Approaching train\u2014Absence of statutory warnings\u2014Failure to look out\u2014Negligence of driver\u2014Action by injured passenger.\nThe respondents, father and daughter, while driving in a motor car, were about to cross the appellant's railway at rail level, when a train was approaching. The father, who was driving, heard the horn of an automobile behind him, and thinking the driver wished to pass, he proceeded to cross the track, the road being very narrow at that point. The train struck the motor car and the respondents sustained injuries for which they both brought action. The train whistle was not sounded or bell rung as required by statute. The father swore to his belief that he did look for the train, because he always did so instinctively; but he did not \"remember actually turning (his) head and looking to see if there was a train or not.\" The trial judge took the case from the jury on the ground of contributory negligence, but the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial.\nHeld, (reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal), Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that, notwithstanding the assumed negligence of the appellant owing to the absence of statutory warnings, the father must be held negligent in attempting to cross the tracks without looking for the approaching train, as no evidence was given of circumstances which would warrant a jury in finding he was excused from doing so.\nHeld, also, (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal), that the contributory negligence of the driver, of a motor car, when he is neither the servant nor the agent of a passenger injured, is no defence in an action brought by the latter against the party causing the accident; and the action of the daughter should not have been dismissed by the trial judge.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (13 Sask. L.R.. 535), varied. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge with a jury[2], which had dismissed the respondents' action and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nBarr K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The reasonable and salutary rule frequently laid down by the court with respect to persons crossing level railway crossings is that they must act as reasonable persons should act and not attempt to cross without looking for an approaching train to see whether they can safely cross. If they should choose recklessly and foolishly to run into danger, they must take the consequences.\nThe rule so requiring persons crossing railway tracks to look for a possible approaching train may not be an absolutely arbitrary one. Circumstances may exist which might excuse their not looking, but those circumstances must be such as would reasonably warrant a jury in finding they were excused from their duty in that regard. It is not enough to prove that some precautions required on the part of the railway, such as whistling or ringing the bell before coming to the crossing, were not observed or followed by the train officials, of which there was evidence on which a jury might so find in this case. Mr. Tilley, for the company, admitted that he had to argue his case on the basis that the train did not either ring the bell or sound the whistle. But he contended that notwithstanding this assumed negligence on the part of the train officials, the plaintiff's injuries, and those of his daughter in the car with him, were caused by his own contributory negligence in running his car on to the railway track without looking to see whether a train was approaching. The learned trial judge withdrew the case from the jury holding that there was no evidence which would justify them in finding either that the plaintiff did look for the train before attempting to cross the railway track or would excuse his not having done so.\nOn appeal from this judgment of the trial judge the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan, by a majority judgment, allowed the same on the ground, as I understand the reasons of Mr. Justice Lamont, who delivered the judgment of the majority of the court, that\nthere were considerations from which a jury might reasonably conclude that it was the failure to give the statutory warnings rather than the plaintiff's own recklessness that was the causa causans of the injury and that those considerations must be passed upon by the jury.\nIf I could reach such a conclusion, I would gladly do so, but I cannot. The plaintiff's own evidence, coupled with that of the witnesses in the motor which was following that of the plaintiff, removes the possibility of any finding that he did look. If he had looked he could not have failed to have seen the approaching train. The suggestions by counsel as excuses for his not looking, relied on it is true by the majority of the Court of Appeal as sufficient for granting a new trial, seemed never to have entered into the plaintiff's own mind as he in his evidence did not suggest them. On the contrary, he said he believed he did look because he always did but did not remember having done so in this instance, and the inference from his evidence and that of the other witnesses examined is irresistible that he did not look and so justified the trial judge in dismissing his personal action. I am quite unable to accept these suggestions of counsel as constituting any excuse for his not looking.\nWhile, however, I am of opinion that plaintiff's personal action was rightly dismissed, I am also of opinion that the daughter's action stood in an altogether different position. She was simply a passenger in the motor with her father and was in my judgment in no sense responsible for his contributory negligence. Nor can it be said that he was her agent or so identified with her that she was responsible for his negligence. Supposing an action had been brought by some one injured by his negligence in driving, could it be successfully contended that the passenger who had no control or right of control over the driver would be liable? I cannot for a moment think that such a contention could be sustained and I cannot find any authority supporting it.\nI think that the law which must govern in this case is that laid down by the House of Lords in the well-known case of The Bernina[3], where it was held, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal[4], that a collision\nhaving occurred between the steamships Bushire and Bernina through the fault or default of the masters and crews of both, as a result of which two persons on board the Bushire, one of the crew and a passenger, neither of whom had anything to do with the negligent navigating of the steamship, were drowned, * * the deceased persons were not identified in respect of the negligence with those navigating the Bus hire, and that their representatives could maintain the action. This decision overruled Thorogood v. Bryan[5], and decisively settled once and for all the doctrine of \"identification\" on which Thorogood v. Bryan5 was based. The very question, as Lord Herschell said in delivering his judgment in the Bernina case[6], was whether the contributory negligence of the driver of the vehicle was a defence as against the passenger when suing another wrongdoer. In his speech he said:\nIt humbly appears to me that the identification upon which the decision in Thorogood v. Bryan5 is based has no foundation in fact. I am of opinion that there is no relation constituted between the driver of an omnibus and its ordinary passengers which can justify the inference that they are identified to any extent whatever with his negligence. He is the servant of the owner, not their servant; he does not look to them for orders, and they have no right to interfere with his conduct of the vehicle except, perhaps, the right of remonstrance when he is doing, or threatens to do, something which is wrong or inconsistent with their safety. Practically they have no greater measure of control over his actions than the passenger in a railway train has over the conduct of the engine-driver. I am, therefore, unable to assent to the principle upon which the case of Thorogood v. Bryan5 rests. In my opinion an ordinary passenger by an omnibus, or by a ship, is not affected either in a question with contributory wrongdoers or with innocent third parties, by the negligence, in the one case of the driver, and in the other of the master and crew by whom the ship is navigated unless he actually assumes control over their actions, and thereby occasions mischief. In that case he must of course, be responsible for the consequences of his interference. * * * The theory that an adult passenger places himself under the guardianship of the driver so as to be affected by his negligence appears to me to be absolutely without foundation either in fact or law.\nI cannot see any reason why the law as definitely stated in the Bernina case6 with respect to the non-liability of passengers on board of omnibus cabs and steamships is not applicable in the absence of any special facts to the contrary to those travelling in private motors. The reasons which negative such non-liability in the one case are equally cogent and convincing in the other. The case of Dixon v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[7], was cited in the appellant's factum in support of the contention that it was the duty of the girl to look out for an approaching train and if she entrusted that duty to the driver of the car she is affected by his negligence. But the basis of the judgment in that case was that the driver of the motor-car was acting as the agent or servant of his companions and that the five men in the car were the persons having the control of it. The learned Chief Justice Meredith, in delivering the judgment of the court said:\nMy view is that the five men had control of the motor-car. It was hired by them, although Scott was the one who acted for his companions as well as for himself in hiring it. It was they who entrusted the driving to Scott. In my opinion, the Bernina case[8] has no application if Scott in driving the motor-car was acting as the agent or servant of his companions. That he was acting as their agent is clear, I think, because it is also clear that he was entrusted by them with the duty of driving the car. The five men in the motorcar were, in my opinion, the persons having control of it.\nThat decision, of course, therefore, has no bearing on the liability of the daughter Mary for the contributory negligence of the driver of the automobile as he was neither her servant or agent but was the owner and the driver of the car having sole control of it with which she had neither the right nor the power to interfere.\nIn the sixth edition of Shearman and Redfield, Vol. 1, p. 164, 166, I find the following statement of the law on this point in the United States:\n66. Doctrine of Identification. As already stated, the fact that the injury was caused by the joint negligence of the defendant and a mere stranger is universally admitted to be no defence. But in the famous case of Thorogood v. Bryan[9], an English Court invented a new application of the old Roman doctrine of identification, and held that a passenger in a public vehicle, though having no control over the driver, must be held to be so identified with the vehicle as to be chargeable with any negligence on the part of its managers which contributed to an injury inflicted upon such passenger by the negligence of a stranger. In former editions, we devoted much space to the refutation of this doctrine of \"identification.\" But it is needless to do so any longer, since the entire doctrine has, since our first edition, been exploded in every court, beginning with New York and ending with Pennsylvania. It was finally over-ruled in England a few years ago. The only remnant of the doctrine which remains in sight anywhere is the theory that one who rides in a private conveyance thereby makes the driver his agent, and is thus responsible for the driver's negligence, even though he has no power or right to control the driver. This extraordinary theory, which did not even occur to the hair-splitting judges in Thorogood v. Bryan9, was invented in Wisconsin, and sustained by a process of elaborate reasoning; and this Wisconsin decision, in evident ignorance of all decisions to the contrary, was recently followed with similar reasoning in Montana, and in Nebraska without any reasoning whatsoever; which last is certainly the best method of reaching a conclusion directly opposed to common sense and to the decision of twenty other courts. The notion that one is the \"agent\" of another, who has not the smallest right to control or even advise him, is difficult to support by any sensible argument. This theory is universally rejected, except in the three states mentioned, and it must soon be abandoned even there.\nApart, therefore, from the exploded doctrine of \"identification\" I find nothing to justify the theory that the driver in this case was either the servant or the agent of the daughter Mary.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal so far as the plaintiff's personal action is concerned and dismiss such action with costs throughout and would dismiss the appeal as far as the action is brought on behalf of Mary Smith, who was 17 years of age when the action was tried, with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting in part).\u2014The respondent, Thomas W. Smith, was driving his automobile, in which he was accompanied by his two daughters, westward on the highway toward Regina. A passenger train of the appellant company running south toward Regina, at the intersection of the said highway with said railway, struck the said automobile, wrecked it, and so seriously injured one of the said respondent's daughters that she died a few days later, and very seriously injured the surviving daughter, one of the respondents herein, as well as the respondent so driving the automobile.\nFor the respective injuries in question, to the survivors and the said automobile, this action was brought by said Thomas W. Smith and his surviving daughter by him as her next friend, alleging that the accident was caused by reason of the failure of the appellant either to give the statutory warning of whistling, or to ring the bell.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action which was being tried with a jury, at the close of the plaintiff's case, alleging as ground therefor, the contributory negligence of the respondent driver, Thomas W. Smith.\nIn doing so he said:\nIn this case the evidence of negligence is as follows: That the bell did not ring and that the whistle did not blow as provided by statute. In dealing with the question of contributory negligence one must consider the natural situation of the ground. At a point three-quarters of a mile south of a bend in the defendant's railway, the railway is crossed almost at right angles by a road which runs itself for something less than half a mile to another railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific railway. A train on the said C.P.R. track approaching from the north, from the time it passes the bend till it gets to the crossing, is continuously in view of any person who is coming along this road from the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway crossing. There is evidence that it takes a minute and a quarter for the train to travel the distance, and that there is nothing whatsoever in the nature of an obstruction to the view.\nThe appellant's negligence, according to this finding, is clear, and it is equally clear that the entire negligence of the respondent driving (if any) was the failure to have discovered the coming train, within the minute and a quarter that elapsed whilst driving from the point where it first became possible for him to have seen it to the intersection of the highway and railway.\nThe train, it is clearly proven, would be coming along a down grade of the railway track which would accelerate its rate of speed, and would have no steam or smoke assuredly visible, for, as expressly stated by one of the witnesses, it merely coasted along that part of its road.\nThere, of course, is need for a careful driver to look both ways for trains.\nThe respondent driver in this case was seated on the left hand side of his automobile. On one side of him the curtain was drawn but, as the learned judge finds, there was on the side next the train an apron which contained mica glasses described, possibly it was the reverse but that curtain, as I understand respondent's evidence, was on the left side and the front seat not curtained off from the approaching train.\nThe learned trial judge omits entirely to refer to the evidence given by the respondent driver relative to his usual care in looking for the train and belief that he did on this occasion, which ought to have been considered.\nHe testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014What were you giving attention to as you were rising up the grade, or what was occupying your attention as you were rising up the grade just before crossing the track?\nA.\u2014Well, the automobile coming behind me having blown his horn on me, I figured he wanted to pass, and I was considering letting him pass as soon as I got across the railway crossing.\nQ.\u2014Did you look to see if the train was coming as you came along from the Grand Trunk crossing towards the C.P.R. crossing?\nA.\u2014I believe I did.\nQ.\u2014Why do you say that?\nA.\u2014Well I always do that. It is natural. His Lordship: That is not a reason. Do you remember whether you did or not?\nA.\u2014I don't remember actually turning my head and looking, or anything like that, but I believe I did.\nQ.\u2014But you don't know whether you did? You don't remember whether you did or not?\nA.\u2014No. I can't say I remember turning my head and looking to see if there was a train or not.\nand on cross-examination, as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Is Regina your trading town?\nA.\u2014Generally. Sometimes I go to Pilot Butte.\nQ.\u2014But at any rate, Mr. Smith, you have been into Regina during that twenty years a great many times?\nA.\u2014Quite a few, yes.\nQ.\u2014Well, hundreds of times, 1 suppose?\nA.\u2014Well, the average number of times that any farmer would come, I suppose.\n****\nQ.\u2014Let me, then, call your attention to this, Mr. Smith. When would a prudent man look for a train? At what distance would he look for a train coming?\nA.\u2014Well, when he knew that there was a railway crossing he would look probably several times.\n****\nQ.\u2014And, as you said in your examination by my learned friend, you cannot say that you ever looked to see whether there was a train coming or not after you passed over the Grand Trunk Pacific crossing?\nA.\u2014I said that I believe I looked.\nQ.\u2014I know, but you said you could not remember that you did. Is that not correct?\nA.\u2014I said I believe I looked.\nQ.\u2014Never mind that?\nA.\u2014Let me finish my answer, please\u2014please.\nQ.\u2014You can't remember that you looked for the train after you passed over the Grand Trunk Pacific crossing?\nA.\u2014No, I can't remember the actual act of looking.\nThe evidence is clear that if he looked when he would have been distant a space more than a minute and a quarter of time as he travelled, he could not see the coming train by reason of buildings between that point and the coming train obstructing the view. The question of whether he actually looked or not was one for the jury to consider. The probability is that he looked, but possibly at a minute and a quarter too early, and surely it was for the jury to decide whether or not he was negligent, or merely erred in judgment.\nAnd immediately after that narrow margin of time had begun to run, his attention was distracted by a car behind him, and his asking his daughters if the driver thereof seemed desirous of passing, and when they looked back and concluded, and reported, that the driver thereof did not seem desirous of passing, his attention was directed to crossing the railway to get to a better place to pass than the grade approaching the crossing.\nTo make matters more distracting and worse, the driver of the car behind saw the train at that stage and kindly desiring to warn respondent driver, blew his horn loudly and sharply in such a way as calculated to arrest his attention.\nThat had the effect of giving the respondent the impression that the driver of the car behind wished to pass and accordingly hasten on for next fifty feet or so with the purpose of securing the better place to pass when across the railway track.\nBefore reaching that goal the appellant's engine had fifty feet or yards away, given two \"toots\" of its whistle. All that was too late; and if ever there was a case for the jury to have been called upon for its verdict of whether respondent driver had been negligent, or merely mistaken in judgment, which that situation called for the assistance of the jury to determine this was one, and the case should not have been withdrawn from them. Such was the opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan better qualified, by local knowledge of the actual condition of things to be considered, than we can be, as to whether or not the respondent driver was, when due regard is had to the alternative propositions presented by that master of our law, Lord Cairns, in the case of Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Rly. Co. v. Slattery[10], quoted by the majority judgment herein of the Appellate Court below, to have been condemned as clearly guilty of that contributory negligence which deprived him of the right to have his conduct passed upon by a jury.\nThe two alternatives presented by Lord Cairns in said case are quoted in said judgment, and, properly as I think, the second acted upon, as that which fits this case.\nI so entirely agree with the reasoning of the judgment of the majority of the court below, based on other authorities, as well as the speech of Lord Cairns in the House of Lords in said Slattery Case10, that I need not repeat same here.\nIf there is a driver of any vehicle who can be excused from failure to look at the exact moment of time that will be effective, it is the driver of an auto whose mind, if discharging his duty, is concentrated primarily on the safety and rights of those using the same highway as he is himself travelling over.\nI think this respondent driver was far more excusable than the unfortunate in the Slattery Case10 by reason of the absolute necessity for concentration of his mind on the said duties as such devolving upon him. The question is raised by those of my brother judges taking another view than I do of the facts and relevant law, that in any event the alleged contributory negligence does not attach to the case of the infant respondent.\nIn my view that is not necessary to be decided, but, if driven thereto, I agree that there is not that identication of her (an infant being carried) with the case presented by her father.\nI would dismiss the appeal entirely, with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014As regards the infant plaintiff, I am quite unable, to distinguish this case from The Bernina (Mills v. Armstrong[11]. On that point I have nothing to add to the judgment of the Chief Justice in whose opinion I fully concur.\nI am, however, unable to agree with the view of the Court of Appeal as to the claim of the adult plaintiff. Contributory negligence is, I think, virtually admitted. In point of law the case is entirely governed, I think, by the judgment of Lord Cairns in Slattery's Case[12], and the judgments of Campbell C. and O'Connor L.J. in Neenan v. Hosford[13].\nAnglin J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The main question presented on this appeal is whether contributory negligence on the part of the adult plaintiff is such an irresistible inference from the evidence adduced by him that the learned judge was justified in withdrawing the case from the jury on that ground. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan has determined that it is not, and has ordered a new trial. Is that order so clearly wrong that it should be reversed? The alleged contributory negligence consisted in failing to look for an approaching train before driving an automobile upon the railway crossing where it was struck. The appellant alleges that there was evidence upon which a jury might have found that the adult plaintiff did in fact look or that, if he did not, there were attendant circumstances upon which a jury might reasonably have found that his failure to do so did not amount to negligence. Although the case is undoubtedly very close to the line, careful consideration of it has led me to the conclusion that it should have been submitted to the jury, if not upon both issues, at all events upon the latter. The judgment of the House of Lords in Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Rly.Co. v. Slattery[14], and of this court in Wabash Railway Co. v. Follick[15], and in Ottawa Electric Railway Co. v. Booth (not yet reported), go far to support that view.\nThe adult plaintiff himself swore to his belief that he had in fact looked for the train though unable to say as a matter of positive recollection that he had done so. There were circumstances which indicated that he might have looked when within 300 or 400 yards of the crossing and been unable to see the train. There were also circumstances deposed to which indicated that his mind may have been so fully taken up with other duties arising out of his position at the moment that failure to remember that he was approaching a railway crossing and should look out for approaching trains would be excusable. I am not prepared to say that no jury could reasonably so find. As the case should, in my opinion, go back for a new trial I refrain from any discussion of the evidence beyond what is necessary to indicate the grounds on which I think the judgment appealed from may be supported. Not, I confess, without some hesitation, but because I have not been convinced that the judgment a quo is erroneous I would dismiss this appeal.\nBut if I were of the opinion that the defendants should succeed as against the plaintiff Thomas W. Smith because his contributory negligence was so clearly established that his personal claim was properly withdrawn from the jury, for the reasons stated by my Lord the Chief Justice I should nevertheless dismiss the defendants' appeal as to the claim of the infant plaintiff Mary Smith.\nMignault J.\u2014The question here is whether the learned trial judge was justified in withdrawing the case from the jury at the close of the plaintiff's evidence and dismissing the action. On appeal, this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, Elwood J. A. dissenting, and a new trial was ordered.\nThe pertinent facts may be briefly stated. The plaintiff had left his home, some miles from the city of Regina, about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th of September, 1919, to bring his daughters, Mary and Edna, to school in the latter city. He drove himself a two seated Reo car, occupying the front seat with his daughter Edna, the plaintiff being on the left side, and his daughter Mary sat on the rear seat where also their baggage was placed. The curtains were closed on the right side but there were mica windows through which persons sitting on the front and rear seats could see; the other side of the car was open. The road at the place in question runs from east to west (the plaintiff was going west) and is intersected, at a distance of half a mile the one from the other, by two lines of railway; the Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. and the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., the latter being to the west of the former. The country is flat and a person going west along the road has full view of the defendant's line, there being no obstructions of any kind. The plaintiff drove at a speed of from ten to fifteen miles an hour, probably the latter speed, and at the time he crossed the Grand Trunk Pacific line, the defendant's train was about one mile from the place of the accident, and was then travelling in a southerly direction at a speed of thirty miles an hour down a slight grade, where to the plaintiff's knowledge, for he had often used this road, it was customary to close off the steam and the exhaust of the engine. As the plaintiff drove along the road after crossing the Grand Trunk Pacific line, he was followed at a distance of some twenty yards by another car occupied by three persons and which travelled at the same speed as the plaintiff. Two of these persons were called at the trial and swear that they saw the defendant's train from the time they crossed the Grand Trunk Pacific, and that they had no difficulty whatever in seeing it. They also say that the engine did not whistle at any time\u2014there is a whistling post at the usual distance north of the road\u2014until it gave two short blasts immediately before the accident, nor did the bell ring. The plaintiff states he did not hear the whistle or the bell before these two short blasts were blown, and then the front portion of his car was already on the tracks and it was impossible to prevent the accident.\nOn the vital question whether he looked to see if a train was approaching before attempting to cross the railway, the plaintiff stated that he believed he did, but that he did not actually remember turning his head and looking. As this point is extremely important, I will quote the plaintiff's testimony: Q. Did you look to see if the train was coming as you came along from the Grand Trunk crossing towards the C.P.R. crossing?\nA.\u2014I believe I did.\nQ.\u2014Why do you say that?\nA.\u2014Well I always do that. It is natural.\nHis Lordship: That is not a reason. Do you remember whether you did or not?\nA.\u2014I don't remember actually turning my head and looking, or anything like that, but I believe I did.\nQ.\u2014But you don't know whether you did? You don't remember whether you did or not?\nA.\u2014No. I can't say I remember turning my head and looking to see if there was a train or not.\nI think the testimony of the men in the automobile following the plaintiff's car clearly shows that had the plaintiff looked, he would undoubtedly have seen the approaching train, for these men saw it without any difficulty. It is true that the plaintiff states that there are some buildings on the other side of the railway more than \u00e1 mile from the crossing, against and opposite which the train as it rounds a curve appears from the road to come head on and cannot be easily noticed apart from these buildings which serve as a back ground. But while the plaintiff's witnesses say that by a casual glance a person on the road might not notice the approaching train as it stands against this background, they add that if such a person took any precaution other than a casual glance he would be bound to see the train. Surely the plaintiff did not discharge the duty of taking reasonable precautions before crossing the railway or of acting as an ordinary prudent man would have done if he cast a mere casual glance towards the railway, and he is not sure that he even did that. And the fact that the train might be taken at a casual glance to be a part of these buildings and that it generally went down the grade silently and with the steam shut off was well known to the plaintiff who had often travelled along this road, and it was obviously his duty before crossing the railway to look in time so as to be able to stop his car if a train was approaching.\nIt is true that the plaintiff's witnesses prove that the engine did not whistle as it passed the whistling post and that the bell was not rung. But notwithstanding this negligence of the company, had the plaintiff been reasonably careful he would have seen the train in time, and the fact that the statutory warnings were not given cannot, in my opinion, excuse him in rushing with his eyes open to his own destruction. I may simply refer to the often quoted passage from Lord Cairns' judgment in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Ry. Co.v. Slattery[16], as a complete answer to any contention based on the absence of the statutory warnings.\nThe plaintiff also says that when approaching the railway he heard several toots from the automobile behind him, that he thought this automobile wished to pass him as several others had already done, and that as the place was not suitable for crossing, he went ahead with the idea of letting it pass him further on. As a matter of fact, this tooting was resorted to in order to warn the plaintiff of his imminent danger, but it is said that it confused him and that under the circumstances he should not be considered as lacking in ordinary prudence.\nI would indeed be slow to say as my deliberate opinion that even such a circumstance can excuse an automobile driver in rushing across a railway without first looking to see whether the line is clear. Moreover the plaintiff by keeping his position on the road could have prevented any car passing him. And should the defendant under such circumstances be held liable for an accident which, notwithstanding the failure to give the statutory warnings, I must hold was brought about solely by the recklessness of the plaintiff?\nThe learned counsel for the respondent relied on several decisions of this court, and from the bench his attention was called to the recent case of The Ottawa Electric Ry. Co. v. Booth (not yet reported), where I concurred with the majority of the court in sustaining the jury's verdict. It is obvious that the special facts of each case must be considered, and no decision is conclusive unless the circumstances are the same. In the Booth case, probably the nearest in point, the victim crossed behind a tram car which stopped at a street corner, and was struck by another car running on the far track at an excessive speed and without ringing its gong. There certainly the victim had no time for reflection and he followed quite a common though not commendable practice in crossing behind the car from which he had just alighted. Here the plaintiff was in full view of the approaching train for a distance of half a mile and, in my opinion, was the author of his own misfortune. In the words of Lord Cairns, it was the folly and recklessness of the plaintiff, and not the carelessness of the company, which caused the accident.\nNaturally one hesitates before removing from a jury a case of which normally they are the proper judges. But if in such a case no jury could reasonably find in favour of the plaintiff, I think it is the duty of the trial judge, if he feels convinced that a verdict for the plaintiff could not be sustained, to take the responsibility of dismissing the action. I would certainly not say that the learned trial judge was wrong in taking this responsibility in the present case, in so far as Smith's personal action is concerned. With regard to the representative action taken by him on behalf of his daughter Mary, an infant, I think that the latter is not identified with her father and that the contributory negligence of Smith does not disentitle her to recover any damages to which she may be entitled as against the appellant. On this branch of the case I am satisfied to rely on the reasons given by my Lord the Chief Justice.\nI think therefore, that the judgment of the appellate division should be affirmed in so far as it orders a new trial on the issue raised by the action on behalf of Mary Smith, and set aside as to the order of a new trial of the plaintiff's personal action, which should stand dismissed.\nI concur in the disposition of the costs by my Lord the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Allan, Allan & Taylor.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Barr, Stewart, Johnston & Cumming.\n[1] 13 Sask.

C.\u2014Arts. 3438, 3455, 3459 R.S.Q.\nThe appellant was arrested on a charge of highway robbery, and, when brought before a judge of the Sessions of the Peace, he did not elect for a speedy trial, pleaded \"not guilty\" and was duly committed for trial. The Grand Jury found a true bill upon an indictment preferred by the Attorney-General. The appellant was then arraigned and again pleaded \"not guilty.\" On the day of the trial his counsel made an application to have the case postponed to the next term of the assizes to permit the accused to elect for a speedy trial, if he so decided, but the application was refused. Under article 3438 R.S.Q., sixty petit jurors had been summoned; but the sheriff, on receiving notices of claims for exemption, summoned additional jurors and returned before the court the first panel with the additions made to it. As the claims for exemption were disallowed, the names of sixty-six petit jurors remained in the panel box. On the day of the trial, six jurors were absent; none of the jurors called were challenged by the accused and the twelve called were sworn without any objection, except that counsel for appellant objected to the fact that the panel box contained more than the names of sixty jurors. This objection was also overruled, and the appellant was tried and found guilty. A reserve case was granted the appellant; and the questions submitted were as to the constitution of the panel and as to whether the accused had wrongly been refused the right to elect for a speedy trial.\nHeld, that the alleged irregularities are not sufficient to entitle the accused to a new trial.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The appellant, having previously renounced any desire for a speedy trial and having later pleaded to the indictment without raising any objection, had waived any right he had to elect for a speedy trial. Per Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The right of the appellant to elect to be tried summarily had been taken away by the requirement by the Attorney-General for a jury trial, the preferment of the indictment by the Attorney-General under sect. 873 Cr. C., constituting such requirement within the meaning of sect. 825, s.s. 5, as enacted by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9, s. 2.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The application made on behalf of the accused for a postponement of the trial to permit him to re-elect was not an election for a speedy trial; and, therefore, there was no refusal to grant acte of an option made by the accused.\nHeld, also, that, in not discharging the six additional jurors, the trial judge exercised a discretion conferred on him by art. 3459 R.S.Q., and moreover, the appellant, under the circumstances, did not suffer any substantial wrong on that account.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal by the appellant relating to questions of law arising on his trial and upon a stated case.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Marchand K.C. and Lucien Cannon K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The accused having when charged before the magistrate expressly renounced any desire for speedy trial without jury and later notwithstanding pleaded to the indictment without raising any sort of objection thereto, in my opinion, had waived any legal right he had up to that time to elect for a speedy trial.\nSuch was the settled state of the law until the decision of this court in the case of Giroux v. The King[1]. I am not quite sure in light of that decision, what the law so laid down really is, but when applied to this case which is, as it were, the counterpart of that, I think it has no application.\nIf that decision should, necessarily, govern in regard to the point I raise, I would bow to it, though I dissented therein, but it does not, I think, and therefore I hold the pleading to the indictment, under the attendant circumstances, fatal to the appellant's contention herein.\nThere the accused was allowed, even after plea to an indictment, to withdraw his plea and elect to go to trial before a judge without a jury.\nI thought then there was no jurisdiction in the courts to so proceed.\nThis case is quite distinguishable from the case of Minguy v. The King[2], where the accused had indicated his desire to elect, as he was entitled to have done, for a trial without a jury before he was forced to plead to an indictment and thereby, as I held, improperly deprived of his right to elect.\nI am, notwithstanding the doctrine laid down in the case of Giroux v. The King[3], unable to see that it necessarily governs this case.\nI therefore would answer the first question of the stated case in the negative.\nAnd as to the second question I am of the opinion that, under all the attendant circumstances, the error if any, which is disputed, would not necessarily be fatal to the validity of the trial, and therefore answer it also in the negative.\nThe appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed. Duff J.\u2014The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.\n1st. As to the constitution of the panel. In this respect no substantial prejudice was suffered by the accused. It is unnecessary to repeat the observations contained in the case as stated and signed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin with which I concur.\n2nd. As to the right of the accused to elect to be tried by a judge. Admittedly the accused had that right under sections 826 and 827 of the Criminal Code unless by virtue of a requirement by the Attorney-General under s.s. 5 of sec. 825 Cr. C., that right was taken away. In Minguy v. The King[4] I concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice of this court that where the Attorney-General prefers a bill of indictment under sec. 873 or where the bill of indictment is, by the special direction of the Attorney-General, so preferred that in itself constitutes a requirement that the case should be tried by a jury within the meaning of section 825, s.s. 5.\nI am not at all impressed by the argument that the power given by section 873 is a different power from that given by s.s. 5 of sec. 825. They are not the same power, no doubt; but it does not follow that each must be exercised by an independent proceeding. A proceeding under sec. 873 may and prima facie does import a determination that the accused shall be tried by jury, a determination negativing his right to be tried without a jury and at all events, in the absence of some qualifying declaration it is an exercise of the authority given by sec. 825, s.s. 5. I may add that the decision in Giroux v. The King[5] (a case in which the judges who took part in it proceeded upon diverse grounds) is not an authority having any relevancy to this question. I think that in this case there is sufficient evidence and there was sufficient evidence before the trial judge that the Attorney-General had required that the case should be tried by a jury within sec. 825, s.s. 5.\nIt is important, I think, to add that had it not been for s.s. 5 of sec. 825 of the Criminal Code, I should have been constrained to hold that in the language of sec. 1019 Cr. C., \"something not according to law was done at the trial\" and consequently that the conviction must be set aside. The accused, as I have already said, was entitled, in the absence of action by the Attorney-General under sec. 825, to have the benefit of the procedure provided by sections 826 and 827. Through no fault of his own but through the default of the officers of the Crown he was put upon his trial without being given the opportunity to take advantage of those provisions; and had it not been for the intervention of the Attorney-General he could not, I think, have been tried legally in these circumstances.\nIt is not so much a question of jurisdiction. The Court of King's Bench had jurisdiction to decide whether or not the accused could legally be tried as it had jurisdiction to decide all other questions of procedure and substantive law touching the liability of the accused to be tried and convicted of the offence with which he was charged. The point is that the trial of the prisoner in such circumstances would not have been a trial according to law; an objection which could properly be raised by way of stated case and dealt with on appeal under the provisions of the code.\nFor the reasons given I am of opinion, however, that these last-mentioned considerations are without application in the present case. Anglin J.\u2014Two questions are submitted by the reserved case granted the appellant:\n1. Was there error in refusing to grant acte of the option made by the accused for a speedy trial before a judge of the Sessions without the intervention of a jury?\n2. If it was the fact, that cards to the number of 66, bearing the names, numbers and addresses of 66 petit jurymen were placed in the panel box for the purpose provided, did it constitute an irregularity or illegality sufficient to entitle the accused to the relief sought?\nOne of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench dissented from the majority of the court on both points.\n(1) Although the argument travelled over the whole field of the rights of a person committed for trial to elect for a speedy trial\u2014the duties of the sheriff and the judge, under secs. 826-7, to accord him an opportunity to make such an election being specially dwelt upon as imperative and as such affording a basis for the contention that because those sections had not been complied with, the Court of King's Bench lacked jurisdiction to try the appellant\u2014the first of the two questions actually presented for decision lies in a very much narrower compass. The only thing approaching \"an option made by the accused for a speedy trial\" of which the record contains any evidence is to be found in the following extract from the procedure book of the Court of King's Bench:\nAvant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 tirer au sort les cartes contenant les noms et les num\u00e9ros des Petits Jur\u00e9s, Mtre Alleyn Taschereau, procureur de l'accus\u00e9, demande la remise de la cause aux prochaines assises, pour permettre \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9\u00e9lire, s'il le juge \u00e0 propos, suivant le Code Criminel et ses amendments.\nMtrs Lucien Cannon s'oppose de la part de la Couronne \u00e0 cette demande;\nLa Cour d\u00e9cide qu'il faut proc\u00e9der. The only application made to the court was for a postponement of the trial to the next assizes to permit the accused to re-elect, if he should think fit. That motion was simply refused. Apart from the fact that there had been no previous election and the case was therefore not one for re-election, what took place at the assize court certainly did not amount to an election for a speedy trial. There was not even an intimation that such an election would be made if the postponement asked for were granted. There was therefore no refusal \"to grant acte of an option made by the accused for a speedy trial.\" He had made no such option and an acte of such an option therefore was not and could not have been sought or refused. The first question must be answered accordingly. It is not within our province, as was held by a majority of this court in the recent case of Scott v. The King (24th of Feb., 1921), materially to modify, qualify or enlarge the scope of a question in a reserved case merely because it does not cover the ground of appeal which counsel presents to the court, although that should appear to be what the appellant conceives to be his substantial grievance.\n(2) In not discharging the six additional jurors over the required panel of 60 (R.S.Q., Art. 3438) the court exercised a discretion conferred on it by R.S.Q., Art. 3459. The six additional jurors having been lawfully retained I am not satisfied that their names were not properly placed in the panel box (Crim. Code, s. 927), from which the names of the petit jury were drawn. As is pointed out by Mr. Justice Martin, only sixty jurors answered the roll call on the day of the trial. Six were absent. No juror called for the trial was in fact challenged by the appellant. The only objection taken on his behalf on this branch of the case which appeared to be of moment, viz., that the proportion of peremptory challenges which he was entitled to exercise was disturbed by the presence of the six additional jurors, thus appears to be lacking in substance. His right of challenge was not in fact affected. Even if there was something done at the trial not according to law, the right of challenge not having been interfered with, s. 1019 of the Criminal Code precludes the granting of a new trial since no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel dans une cause criminelle. Deux questions nous sont soumises. La premi\u00e8re a trait \u00e0 la juridiction de la cour qui a condamn\u00e9 l'accus\u00e9. La seconde est de savoir si le petit jury a \u00e9t\u00e9 validement constitu\u00e9.\nL'accus\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e sous la disposition de l\u2019article 446 du Code criminel. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix le 18 septembre 1920, pour y subir sommairement son proc\u00e8s: mais, comme il en avait le droit, il a opt\u00e9 pour un proc\u00e8s devant la cour du Banc du Roi (arts. 777-778), c'est-\u00e0-dire, un proc\u00eas par jury.\nLe juge des Sessions de la Paix a alors proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire et l'accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9, le 12 octobre, condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 subir son proc\u00eas. Le dossier constate qu'avant la d\u00e9claration du juge qu'il y avait mati\u00e8re \u00e0 proc\u00e8s (commitment) l'accus\u00e9 s'est \u00e9vad\u00e9 de la prison o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait incarc\u00e9r\u00e9.\nLe 13 octobre, un acte d'accusation (indictment) fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au grand jury par les avocats de la Couronne, qui l\u2019avaient sign\u00e9 comme suit:\nL. A. Taschereau, Attorney-General, by Aim\u00e9 Marchand, Lucien Cannon, duly authorized. Cet acte d'accusation portait en outre sur le dos l'inscription suivante sign\u00e9e de la main du Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral lui-m\u00eame:\nThis indictment is preferred by the undersigned, the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec.\nL. A. Taschereau,\nAttorney-General for the Province of Quebec.\nL'acte d'accusation fut rapport\u00e9 comme fond\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour par le grand jury et de suite l'accus\u00e9 fut mis en jugement (arraigned) et il plaida non-coupable.\nLe 15, au moment o\u00f9 son proc\u00e9s devait commencer et avant que l'on proc\u00e9d\u00e2t \u00e0 choisir le petit jury, l'accus\u00e9 par son avocat a demand\u00e9 verbalement \u00e0 la cour\nla remise de la cause aux prochaines assises pour permettre \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9\u00e9lire s'il le juge \u00e0 propos.\nLa Couronne s'y est object\u00e9e et le proc\u00e8s a eu lieu et l'accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9. Il pr\u00e9tend maintenant qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement priv\u00e9 du droit d'opter pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif et que lorsque les petits jur\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9s au sort il y avait dans la bo\u00eete o\u00f9 les cartes \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9es soixante-six noms, c'est-\u00e0-dire six de plus que le nombre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la loi.\nCe dernier point ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 en temps utile. D'ailleurs rien ne d\u00e9montre qu'aucun texte de loi ait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9.\nLe sh\u00e9rif, sous les dispositions des articles 3438 et 3455 des statuts revis\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec, avait le pouvoir d'assigner plus que soixante jur\u00e9s. Et si apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les demandes d'exemption des jur\u00e9s il reste plus de soixante jur\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents, le juge peut renvoyer le surplus. La loi ne lui en fait pas une obligation: au contraire, elle para\u00eet laisser cela \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion. Il peut arriver, en effet, que le terme soit bien charg\u00e9, qu'un grand nombre de causes aient \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9es et jug\u00e9es: et alors, suivant sa discr\u00e9tion, le juge peut garder plus de soixante jur\u00e9s. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas actuel. Le juge n'a donc viol\u00e9 aucun texte de loi: mais il a simplement exerc\u00e9 une discr\u00e9tion qu'il pouvait exercer.\nL'autre question qui nous est soumise touche \u00e0 la juridiction de la cour et a trait au droit de l'accus\u00e9 d'opter pour un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi avait certainement juridiction pour juger l'accus\u00e9. L'offense qui lui \u00e9tait imput\u00e9e d\u00e9signait ce tribunal comme ayant le droit de juger l'accus\u00e9.\nUn acte d'accusation a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 contre l'accus\u00e9 et le grand jury a rapport\u00e9 cet acte d'accusation comme bien fond\u00e9. Sur le dos de cet acte d'accusation on trouve la signature du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9clarant que cet acte d'accusation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au grand jury sur ses instructions formelles.\nAvant l'amendement du code criminel de 1909, un accus\u00e9 d'une offense comme celle qui est imput\u00e9e \u00e0 Collins avait le droit absolu de demander \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix: mais par l'amendement de 1909 ce droit lui est refus\u00e9 lorsque (825-5) le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral requiert que le proc\u00e8s se fasse devant un jury. La loi ajoute que le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral peut faire cette demande bien que l'accus\u00e9 ait consenti \u00e0 \u00eatre jug\u00e9 par le juge des Sessions.\nIl me semble que la signature du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur l'acte d'accusation constitue cette demande dont parle l'article 825-5 du code criminel. Je serais enclin \u00e0 croire d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00ea \u00e9galement que du moment que le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, sous l'article 873, porte devant la grand jury une accusation, qu'il y ait eu enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire ou non, d\u00e8s ce moment-l\u00e0 la cour du Banc du Roi est d\u00fbment saisie de la cause et qu'elle peut la juger et en disposer. Nous n'avons pas \u00e0 examiner ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement; et si l'accus\u00e9, comme il Ta fait dans le cas actuel, demande un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, la cour a parfaitement le droit de lui refuser ce privil\u00e9ge et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 faire juger la cause par un jury.\nDans le cas actuel, je consid\u00e8re que l'action du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en signant lui-m\u00eame l'acte d'accusation d\u00e9montre d'une mani\u00e8re explicite qu'il requ\u00e9rait que la cause f\u00fbt jug\u00e9e par un jury (825-5 C.C.). C'est l\u00e0 un droit absolu de la part du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et il a suffisamment exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir d'exercer ce droit pour qu'on ne puisse pas pr\u00e9tendre que la cour soit sans juridiction. Il serait d\u00e9sirable cependant que cette r\u00e9quisition f\u00fbt ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le dossier originaire afin d'enlever au juge des Sessions toute apparence de juridiction.\nNous ne pouvons pas mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une condamnation, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quelque chose de non conforme \u00e0 la loi et si des instructions erron\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'en soit r\u00e9sult\u00e9 un tort r\u00e9el ou un d\u00e9ni de justice. Je suis incapable de trouver dans la cause actuelle aucune ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui ait pu constituer un d\u00e9ni de justice (art. 1019 C.Cr.).\nLa Couronne avait le droit de requ\u00e9rir que l'accus\u00e9 subisse son proc\u00e8s devant la Cour Criminelle; la cour, dans sa discr\u00e9tion, \u00e9tait justifiable de refuser \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 un ajournement; le choix des petits jur\u00e9s ne s'est pas fait ill\u00e9galement. La condamnation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 doit \u00eatre maintenue.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014This appeal comes to this court on two questions as to both of which Mr. Justice Greenshields dissented from the majority judgment of the Court of King's Bench: 1. Was there error in refusing to grant acte of the option made by the accused for a speedy trial before the judge of the Sessions without the intervention of a jury?\n2. If it was the fact that cards to the number of 66 bearing the names, numbers and addresses of 66 petit jurymen were placed in the panel box for the purpose provided, did it constitute an irregularity or illegality sufficient to entitle the accused to the relief sought?\nFirst question. The appellant's counsel argued this question as if it were quite a different question, namely, whether under section 826 et seq., Criminal Code, he should have been brought before a judge and the statement required by sect. 827 made to him, at which time and on which statement being made to him he would have been afforded the opportunity of exercising, if he saw fit, an option for a speedy trial or to be tried in the ordinary way. I think I sufficiently stated in Minguy v. The King[6], what procedure should be followed in cases like this one.\nBut this is not the question we have to answer. And I propose to reply to the question submitted in the negative because the appellant never made an option for a speedy trial, and therefore there was no option of which acte (to use the language of the question) should have been granted.\nThis does not necessarily mean that I disagree with what Mr. Justice Greenshields said on this first point, but under the question put to the court there is no necessity of expressing any opinion on this point.\nSecond point. I would also answer this question in the negative for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Martin in the Court of King's Bench, which are entirely satisfactory to me.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1917] 56 Can.

Perras (Defendant) Respondent.\n1921: May 27; 1921: June 20.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Contract\u2014Verbal agreement\u2014Letter sent by purchaser containing it\u2014Silence of the vendor\u2014English doctrine of estoppel\u2014Not part of the law in Quebec.\nWhere one of two parties to a verbal commercial agreement thereafter writes a letter to the other purporting to state the terms of a contract arrived at between them, the failure of the latter to repudiate such contract within a reasonable time does not de jure import an assent to it, and, in this case, the circumstances did not warrant that inference of fact from the silence of the recipient of the letter.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014The doctrine of estoppel, as it exists in England and the common law provinces of Canada, is no part of the law in Quebec.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec,[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe action taken by the appellant was for $74,532.77 for damages for a pretended breach of contract entered into by the appellant with the respondent, by which the latter were to deliver 5,400 sides of chrome patent cow hides. The respondent pleaded that he had received a verbal order from appellant for 1,200 sides, which were delivered and paid for. There was no written contract; but, subsequently to verbal negotiations with an employee of the respondent, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent as follows: \"We herewith beg to confirm our verbal purchase from you of 450 dozen sides * * *. Kindly let us have your confirmation in due course for our records * * * *.\" The letter was delivered to the same employee of the respondent, the latter being then absent from Canada, but it was never answered. At the trial, the employee testified that he left the letter on his desk without paying any more attention to it, and the respondent swore that he knew of its existence only after the institution of the action. The 1,200 sides were delivered to the appellant after the sending of the letter.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. for the appellant.\nErnest Lafontaine for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I do not think I can add anything useful to what has been said in the courts below.\nWithout affirming all that has been so expressed I agree in the result and conclude that having regard to the entire evidence there was no such contract established as contended for by the appellant.\nI therefore think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The questions on this appeal are questions of fact. I can see no adequate ground for differing from the conclusion of the court below. Anglin J.\u2014I cannot accept the appellant's contention that as a matter of law wherever one of two parties to a verbal commercial negotiation immediately thereafter writes a letter to the other purporting to state the terms of a contract arrived at between them the failure of the latter to repudiate such contract within a reasonable time imports an assent to it and affords conclusive evidence that the contract in fact exists in the terms stated. There may no doubt be\u2014perhaps in the majority of such cases there are\u2014circumstances which warrant that inference from the silence of the recipient of the letter. If followed by action on the part of the sender thereby induced, a case of estoppel may arise. But the presumption or inference is one of fact and the circumstances may be such that it should not\u2014often cannot\u2014be drawn.\nThe courts below have so regarded this case; and so far am I from being convinced that their view of it was erroneous that I incline to agree with it. The evidence of the two parties to the oral negotiations is in accord that a contract was made but is in direct conflict as to the quantity of goods agreed to be furnished to the plaintiff by the defendant. The circumstances that the defendant had expressly instructed his agent to make no sale that he had not arranged a purchase to cover and that the agent had arranged such a purchase for the precise quantity which he says he agreed to sell to the plaintiff tend to corroborate his version of the result of the negotiations. Taken with the fact that the plaintiff's letter appears never to have come to the personal notice of the defendant these circumstances go far to preclude the inference of assent that might otherwise have been drawn from the defendant's silence.\nThe plaintiff in my opinion has not established the contract on which he sues. The appeal therefore fails. Brodeur J.\u2014La demanderesse appelante, Grace and Company, pr\u00e9tend que le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9, Perras, s'est oblig\u00e9, en mai 1919, de lui vendre et livrer 5,400 demi peaux de vache. Ce dernier nie l'existence de ce contrat; il pr\u00e9tend en outre qu'il ne s'est oblig\u00e9 de n'en livrer que 1,200 et qu'il a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 son obligation. Il n'y a pas d'\u00e9crit de la part du d\u00e9fendeur. L'article 1235 du code civil d\u00e9clare que dans les mati\u00e8res commerciales exc\u00e9dant cinquante dollars aucune action ne peut \u00eatre maintenue contre une personne sans un \u00e9crit sign\u00e9 par elle dans le cas d'une vente d'effets, \u00e0 moins que l'acheteur n'en ait accept\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u une partie.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause il y a eu livraison d'effets, mais cette livraison s'est-elle faite en ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat de 5,400 articles ou seulement d'un contrat de 1200? Sur ce dernier point la preuve est contradictoire.\nJe serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que la pr\u00e9tention de la demanderesse est bien fond\u00e9e, que le contrat intervenu entre les parties couvrait bien la quantit\u00e9 de 5,400 peaux, vu que la lettre de la demanderesse en date du 13 mai, address\u00e9e \u00e0 la raison sociale du d\u00e9fendeur, dit formellement :\nWe herewith beg to confirm our verbal purchase from you of 450 dozen sides,\net cette lettre est rest\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 le silence de celui \u00e0 qui une d\u00e9claration est faite de l'existence d'un contrat n'implique pas consentement ou obligation de sa part en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Son d\u00e9faut de r\u00e9ponse n'\u00e9quivaut pas en lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 un refus. Pour consentir et s'obliger il faut un fait positif. Baudry Lacantinerie, Obligations, vol. 1er, no. 44. Le m\u00eame auteur cependant dit au no. 515 du m\u00eame trait\u00e9 que l'acceptation peut \u00eatre induite du silence dans certains cas: et il parle de d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 en mati\u00e8re de commerce l'absence de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une lettre \u00e9crite\n\u00e0 l'occasion de relations d'affaires entam\u00e9es doit \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e valoir comme consentement.\nIl d\u00e9clare cependant que cette proposition des tribunaux est trop absolue.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause la demanderesse, \u00e0 la fin de sa lettre demandait la confirmation du contrat dont elle all\u00e9guait l'existence. Il y avait d'autant plus de raison pour elle de demander cette confirmation qu'elle savait n'avoir eu de n\u00e9gotiations qu'avec un subalterne et que le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame, dans une circonstance ant\u00e9rieure, n'avait pas voulu confirmer (et ce \u00e0 la connaissance de la d\u00e9fenderesse) ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par son employ\u00e9.\nLa confirmation du contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la demanderesse ne s'est pas effectu\u00e9e: au contraire, au retour de son voyage, le d\u00e9fendeur a formellement r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 le contrat.\nDe plus la preuve testimoniale est contradictoire et le juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a eu l'avantage de voir les t\u00e9moins et il a pu se former une meilleure opinion que nous sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ces t\u00e9moins. Il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le contrat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait entre les parties n'avait trait qu'\u00e0 1,200 articles.\nDans ces circonstances, nous ne pouvons consid\u00e9rer le d\u00e9fendeur Perras comme s'\u00e9tant oblig\u00e9 de livrer \u00e0 la demanderesse la quantit\u00e9 de peaux qu'elle all\u00e8gue.\nLe jugement qui a renvoy\u00e9 son action doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Mignault J.\u2014This case comes to this court with the findings of facts of the learned trial judge unanimously concurred in by the Court of King's Bench, and the dispute being as to the quantity of sides of chrome patent cow hides which were sold by the respondent to the appellant, is certainly a question of fact. So far as the matter rested on the testimony of Osborne (the plaintiff's representative) on the one hand or of Hubbell (the defendant's employee) and the defendant himself on the other, the trial judge accepted the statements of the latter. And, assuming that under art. 1235 of the civil code the contract could be proved by parol evidence in view of the deliveries which the appellant claims were referable to the larger contract, the respondent to the smaller one, there would be no difficulty whatever had not the appellant written to the respondent the letter of May 13th, 1919, purporting to confirm a contract of sale of 450 dozen sides, which letter was received by Hubbell who never answered it, but is shown not to have come to the knowledge of the respondent who was then absent from Montreal.\nThe value of this letter is of course merely as evidence of a contract which the learned trial judge on the testimony found had not been entered into. It is noteworthy that the appellant has suffered no prejudice by reason of the failure of a reply to its letter, for during the previous month it had committed itself to a Paris firm to which it had undertaken to sell 500 dozen sides, and no action on its part was induced by the respondent's silence. On this phase of the case, Mr. Justice Greenshields suggested that if it was the duty of the respondent to answer this letter, and if his failure to do so induced the appellant to do some- thing which would not otherwise have been done and which resulted in damages, an action might lie, and if an action on these grounds were brought,\nit may be that the respondent would be estopped in his defence upon the principle that where a man has kept silent when he ought to have spoken, he will not be permitted to speak when he ought to keep silent.'\nI have no doubt whatever that Mr. Justice Greenshields will fully agree with me when I venture to observe that the doctrine of estoppel as it exists in England and the common law provinces of the Dominion is no part of the law of the Province of Quebec. This, however, does not mean that in many cases where a person is held to be estopped in England, he would not be held liable in the Province of Quebec. Article 1730 of the civil code is an example of what, in England, is referable to the principle of estoppel, and where a person has by his representation induced another to alter his position to his prejudice, liability, in Quebec, could be predicated under articles 1053 and following of the civil code. Whether such liability could be relied on as a defence to an action, in order to avoid what has been called a \"circuit d'actions,\" is a proposition which, were it necessary to discuss it here, could no doubt be supported on the authority of Pothier. May I merely add, with all due deference, that the use of such a word as \"estoppel,\" coming as it does from another system of law, should be avoided in Quebec cases as possibly involving the recognition of a doctrine which, as it exists to-day, is not a part of the law administered in the Province of Quebec.\nIn this case my opinion is, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, that the appellant could not create a contract by its letter affirming that contract had been entered into, that the failure of an answer, under the same circumstances, cannot serve as evidence of a non-existing contract, and while I would certainly not say that under no circumstances the neglect to answer a letter cannot give rise to liability or serve as a tacit admission, my opinion is that in the present case Hubbell's failure to answer the appellant's letter cannot be used as evidence that the respondent entered into a contract which the learned trial judge, on the evidence, finds was never made.\nThe opinions of the learned judges in the court of King's Bench are so satisfactory to me that I respectfully express my concurrence therein.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Heneker, Chauvin, Walker & Stewart.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ernest Lafontaine.\n[1] Q.R. 31 K.B. 382.\n"

Belcourt K.C. for the appellants.\nG. Barclay for the respondents.\n1921: H\u00e9bert v. School Commissioners of St-F\u00e9licien; 1921: Idington J.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of proceedings taken to quash and annul the resolution of respondent, which reads as follows:\nIl est propos\u00e9 par M. Philippe Tremblay et unanimement r\u00e9solu que la Commission ach\u00e8te l'h\u00f4tel Chibougamou et le terrain attenant au dit h\u00f4tel pour le prix de vingt-six mille piastres ($26,000.00) aux conditions suivantes: quinze cents piastres ($1500.00) comptant et la balance \u00e0 cinq cents piastres ($500.00) par ann\u00e9e sans int\u00e9r\u00eats; il est convenu avec les vendeurs de payer le comptant dans l'espace de cinq ans (5) moyennant int\u00e9r\u00eat de (7%) et que le pr\u00e9sident et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier soient autoris\u00e9s de signer le contrat apr\u00e8s que la dite r\u00e9solution sera en force.\nI have grave doubts of our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\nThe case of Shawinigan Hydro Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water & Power Co.[3], relied upon was differently constituted, for there the action was brought not only against the municipality but also the company that had contracted with the said municipality and that contract was impeached by a ratepayer as plaintiff and an injunction was sought restraining the carrying out of such an ultra vires contract, as that was, for several reasons. See that case as reported[4], on motion to quash.\nHere the vendor is not a party and what we are asked to interfere with is a mere resolution of the council which may be executed by the adoption of proper methods even if there is anything objectionable in the initital step. It may be quite competent for the courts below acting under Art. 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or other like legislation giving a superintending power to deal with such a resolution, yet be quite incompetent for us, who are not given the right to hear appeals in that regard, to attempt to do so.\nThe whole matter involved is, as Mr. Justice Allard in the reasons he assigns in support of the judgment appealed from says, purely a matter of administration.\nPassing that objection I made to hearing the appeal, but for which I got no support, and therefore to the merits of the appeal, I am unable to see how the express terms of section 2723, R.S.Q. 1909, can be overruled.\nSections 2 and 3 thereof are as follows:\u2014\n2. To acquire and hold for the corporation all moveable or immoveable property, moneys or income, and to apply the same for the purposes for which they are intended;\n3. To select and acquire the land necessary for school sites; to build, repair, and keep in order all school-houses and their dependencies; to purchase or repair school furniture; to lease temporarily or accept the gratuitous use of houses and other buildings, fulfilling the conditions required by the regulations of the committees, for the purpose of keeping school therein.\nThere is no such restriction upon these express powers as to entitle us to interfere.\nThe implications sought in other sections do not seem to me available.\nAnd when we find counsel for appellant driven to the resort of submitting that the credit given for a term of years must be read as if a loan, I cannot follow him.\nIt might well be that legislation declaring that to be the effect or implication of such a bargain as before us would be wise, but to so read the Act seems to me would be to legislate, and that is not within our province. I am unable either to read these subsections as implying that land bought for such a purpose must be free from buildings or structures of any kind, either useful or useless.\nIt is quite conceivable that the draftsman of the Act never contemplated such a good bargain chance as this possibly is. But that surmise does not help us for where are we to draw the line\nThe other objections, certainly at this stage of the litigation, are not such as would entitle us to reverse the court below.\nIn the Shawinigan Case[5], relied upon, there were involved such express statutory restrictions upon both the nature of the bargain and the term of credit, as are not to be found in the legislation invoked by the appellants to help out their contentions, so far as we are entitled to consider them.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with the view of the Court of King's Bench that the authority given by the third sub-section of art. 2723 R.S.Q. is not conditioned by art. 2724 in such fashion as to require the school authorities to obtain the sanction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council before exercising it. Art. 2724 confers, in my opinion, supplementary powers.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Mr. Justice Allard has dealt so satisfactorily with the several objections taken by the appellant to the validity and legality of the resolution in question in this action that I feel I cannot do better than adopt his reasons for holding those objections ill founded. It may be that a transaction such as that before us is one which the law might very properly make subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, or, at least, to that of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in order that School Commissioners may not find themselves loaded with a costly building which may not be approved of as suitable for school purposes. But the law has not so provided. On the contrary it has entrusted the acquisition of immovables for their purposes to the discretion of the School Commissioners.\nThere may also be some ground for suspecting the wisdom or even the singleness of purpose of the acquisition of a hotel property for school purposes. The appellant would invoke in that connection the supervisory power conferred by Art. 50 C.C.P. on the Superior Court. But since the Court of King's Bench did not regard this as a case calling for intervention under that extraordinary jurisdiction, I cannot but think it would be a mistake for this court to attempt to exercise it even were there in the record evidence of facts from which indiscretion or a lack of good faith on the part of the Commissioners might be inferred. No such facts are shewn and not a single witness has deposed to his belief either that the projected purchase is improvident or that the Commissioners in undertaking it were actuated by any motive other than a desire to discharge their duty to those whom they represent.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Les demandeurs poursuivent les Commissaires d'\u00e9coles de St F\u00e9licien pour faire d\u00e9clarer nulle une r\u00e9solution que ces derniers avaient adopt\u00e9e le 12 octobre 1919. Cette r\u00e9solution pourvoyait \u00e0 l\u2019achat de l'h\u00f4tel Chibougamou au prix de $26,000, dont $1,500 devaient \u00eatre pay\u00e9s durant les cinq ann\u00e9es suivantes et la balance $500 par ann\u00e9e sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il \u00e9tait bien compris que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait achet\u00e9e pour la convertir en maison d'\u00e9cole.\nL'article 2610 des statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec fait un devoir aux commissaires de maintenir une \u00e9cole dans chaque arrondissement.\nOr comme la maison d'\u00e9cole dans l'arrondissement en question \u00e9tait en mauvais \u00e9tat et ne r\u00e9pondait plus aux exigences de la loi, qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s sanitaires, qu'elle \u00e9tait construite sur un terrain qui ne leur appartenait pas, il devenait n\u00e9cessaire pour les commissaires d'en construire une autre; et alors ils ont jet\u00e9 les yeux sur cet h\u00f4tel et ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'en porter acqu\u00e9reurs.\nL'avis public requis par l'article 2787 S.R.P.Q. a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment donn\u00e9 le 2 novembre 1919. Les contribuables int\u00e9ress\u00e9s avaient trente jours pour appeler \u00e0 la cour de circuit de cette d\u00e9cision des commissaires (arts. 2981-2982 S.R.P.Q.) mais ils n'en ont rien fait. Ce droit d'appel donne \u00e0 la cour de circuit le droit de rendre la d\u00e9cision que les commissaires auraient d\u00fb rendre et donne, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 ce tribunal les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires d'emp\u00eacher toute ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 ou injustice que les commissaires pourraient commettre (art. 2988). Tant que le jugement n'est pas rendu sur cet appel, la d\u00e9cision des commissaires est suspendue (art. 2990 S.R.P.Q.).\nAucun appel n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9 par les appelants H\u00e9bert & al. ou par d'autres contribuables. Les demandeurs ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 proc\u00e9der par action devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure et ils demandent que la r\u00e9solution soit cass\u00e9e et annul\u00e9e \"comme \u00e9tant ill\u00e9gale, injuste et ultra vires.\" La cour sup\u00e9rieure n'est pas un tribunal d'appel des d\u00e9cisions des commissaires d'\u00e9coles. La juridiction de la cour sup\u00e9rieure dans les affaires scolaires lui est donn\u00e9e par l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile. C'est un pouvoir de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance seulement, bien diff\u00e9rent des pouvoirs d'une cour d'appel. Une cour d'appel substitue son opinion sur le m\u00e9rite de la cause \u00e0 l'opinion de la cour qui a rendu le jugement originaire, tandis que la cour sup\u00e9rieure, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'article 50 C.P.C. n'a pas le droit d'empi\u00e9ter sur les attributions qui appartiennent exclusivement aux autorit\u00e9s scolaires et de substituer son opinion \u00e0 celle de ces autorit\u00e9s sur le m\u00e9rite de leurs ordonnances pass\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et dans les limites de leurs attributions (Th\u00e9riault v. Corporation de St-Alexandre[6].\nAinsi dans le cas actuel la cour de circuit aurait eu pleine et enti\u00e8re juridiction pour s'enqu\u00e9rir de l'injustice de la r\u00e9solution attaqu\u00e9e, mais la cour sup\u00e9rieure peut tout au plus rechercher si la corporation scolaire a agi au del\u00e0 de ses pouvoirs, si elle a commis une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 ou bien si la r\u00e9solution attaqu\u00e9e constitue un d\u00e9ni absolu de justice. Brunelle v. Corporation de Princeville[7], Corporation de St-Pierre v. Marcoux[8], Gigu\u00e8re v. Corporation de Beauce[9], Corporation de Ste-Julie v. Massue[10], Th\u00e9riault v. Corporation de St-Alexandre6, Nous avons donc \u00e0 rechercher d'abord si l'achat du terrain en question est ultra vires.\nComme je l'ai dit plus haut, les commissaires sont tenus d'avoir dans chaque arrondissement une maison d'\u00e9cole (art. 2610). Ils doivent voir \u00e0 y faire mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution les r\u00e8glements concernant l'hygi\u00e8ne (art. 2707-9). Or il est en preuve que la maison o\u00f9 on faisait l'\u00e9cole \u00e9tait devenue insalubre. C'\u00e9tait donc un devoir imp\u00e9rieux pour eux de construire une nouvelle maison d'\u00e9cole. Le terrain sur lequel \u00e9tait cette vieille maison d'\u00e9cole ne leur appartenait pas; et alors ils ont cru devoir acheter l'h\u00f4tel Chibougamou qui probablement pourrait \u00eatre convertie en une maison d'\u00e9cole.\nAvaient-ils le pouvoir d'acheter cet immeuble? On a beaucoup discut\u00e9 l'article 2723 des lois scolaires, mais suivant moi ce n'est pas dans cet article qu'il faut rechercher le pouvoir des corporations scolaires. Cet article 2723 en effet se trouve sous la rubrique \"Des devoirs des commissaires et des syndics relativement aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s scolaires.\" Il faut plut\u00f4t rechercher la nomenclature des pouvoirs des corporations scolaires; et nous la trouvons \u00e0 l'article 2635 des Statuts Refondus. Cet article 2635, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les commissaires forment une corporation, ajoute:\nIls ont succession perp\u00e9tuelle, sont habiles \u00e0 ester en justice et font tous les actes qu'une corporation peut faire pour les fins pour lesquelles ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9s.\nNous retrouvons au code civil (art. 358) qu'une corporation peut exercer tous les droits qui lui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour atteindre le but de sa destination. Ainsi elle peut acqu\u00e9rir, ali\u00e9ner et poss\u00e9der des biens, contracter, s'obliger et obliger les autres envers elle. Si par les lois g\u00e9n\u00e9rales applicables \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce ces pouvoirs d'acheter ou d'ali\u00e9ner \u00e9taient restreints, une corporation serait naturellement oblig\u00e9e de respecter ces lois. De m\u00eame, si des devoirs lui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9s par la loi qui la r\u00e9git, elle devrait les respecter.\nQuant aux corporations scolaires, elles ont le pouvoir d'acheter des terrains pour des fins scolaires, ainsi que je viens de le d\u00e9montrer. Nous avons maintenant \u00e0 voir si dans les lois scolaires il y a quelques articles qui peuvent restreindre son droit. L'article 2723-3, qui est invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelant, bien loin de restreindre ces pouvoirs, fait au contraire un devoir aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles d'acqu\u00e9rir les terrains n\u00e9cessaires pour les emplacements de leurs \u00e9coles. La loi exige cependant que leurs maisons d'\u00e9coles soient construites conform\u00e9ment aux plans et devis fournis par le surintendant. Mais rien ne restreint le pouvoir des commissaires d'acheter un terrain sur lequel il y aurait une maison. Ils ne pourraient cependant faire l'\u00e9cole dans cette maison que si elle est construite de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rencontrer les exigences des autorit\u00e9s d\u00e9partementales (art. 2746 S.R.Q.). Mais ces dispositions ne sauraient affecter le droit des commissaires d'acheter une maison. Il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 dans cette cause que cette maison qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e ne peut pas faire une excellente maison d'\u00e9cole. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y a rien dans la cause qui puisse nous justifier m\u00eame de dire que cette vente n'est pas d\u00e9sirable.\nOn invoque aussi, au soutien de l'id\u00e9e que la r\u00e9solution est ultra vires, l'article 2724 des S.R.P.Q. Cet article d\u00e9clare que les commissaires d'\u00e9coles ne\npeuvent conclure des conventions pour des fins scolaires avec toute personne, institution ou corporation qu'avec l'autorisation du Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil donn\u00e9e sur la recommandation du surintendant.\nCet article n'est peut-\u00eatre pas aussi clair qu'on voudrait le voir. Si on l'interpr\u00e9tait \u00e0 la lettre, il pourrait vouloir dire que les commissaires seraient pratiment incapables d'adopter une r\u00e9solution sans aller devant le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil pour se faire autoriser. Il s'agit \u00e9videmment, dans cet article, comme le disent plusieurs juges dans les cours inf\u00e9rieures, d'une restriction impos\u00e9e aux commissaires de ne pas conclure de conventions avec une maison d'\u00e9ducation pour instruire leurs enfants pour une p\u00e9riode couvrant plusieurs ann\u00e9es sans avoir l'autorisation voulue, On est anxieux de voir \u00e0 ce que l'instruction qui est donn\u00e9e dans les \u00e9coles r\u00e9ponde aux exigences de la morale et de la religion; et alors les autorit\u00e9s d\u00e9partementales se r\u00e9servent le pouvoir d'aviser les commissaires avant qu'ils ne s'engagent et qu'ils ne lient la corporation scolaire. Voil\u00e0 l'objet de l'article 2724.\nLa r\u00e9solution n'est donc pas ultra vires.\nOn dit aussi que la r\u00e9solution est ill\u00e9gale parce que l'achat a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit, que cela constitue un emprunt et que les corporations scolaires ne peuvent pas emprunter sans l'autorisation du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil (art. 2727 S.R.Q.).\nNous sommes ici non pas en pr\u00e9sence d'un contrat de pr\u00eat, mais d'un contrat de vente \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit. Ce sont deux choses bien diff\u00e9rentes. Qu'est-ce qu'un pr\u00eat? C'est un contrat par lequel le pr\u00eateur livre \u00e0 l'emprunteur une certaine quantit\u00e9 de choses \u00e0 la charge par ce dernier de lui rendre autant de la m\u00eame esp\u00e8ce (art. 1777 C.C.). La vente est un contrat par lequel une personne donne une chose \u00e0 une autre moyennant un prix en argent (art. 1472 C.C.). L'acqu\u00e9reur peut avoir d\u00e9lai pour le paiement du prix (art. 1533 C.C.). Il y a attach\u00e9s \u00e0 ce contrat de vente des droits que nous ne retrouvons pas dans le cas du pr\u00eat (art. 2008-9 C.C.).\nLe pr\u00eat \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat et la vente \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit avec stipulation d'int\u00e9r\u00eat ont, je l'admets, beaucoup de similitude; mais il ne faudrait pas les confondre l'un avec l'autre, surtout quand il s'agit d'ultra vires ou d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Si la loi d\u00e9fend \u00e0 une personne d'emprunter, cela ne veut pas dire que cette personne-l\u00e0 est \u00e9galement incapable d'acheter. Au contraire, si on lui a donn\u00e9 formellement le pouvoir d'acheter, elle ne commettra pas d'acte outrepassant ses pouvoirs en se portant acqu\u00e9reur d'une chose. Les appelants pr\u00e9tendent aussi que la r\u00e9solution aurait d\u00fb pourvoir au mode de paiement, soit par une imposition, un emprunt ou une \u00e9mission d'obligations.\nL'article 2903 S.R.Q. semble admettre qu'une dette peut \u00eatre contract\u00e9e sans la formalit\u00e9 d'un emprunt. Les commissaires peuvent acqu\u00e9rir une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par vente \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit et, par cons\u00e9quent, endetter la municipalit\u00e9 scolaire.\nUne d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet effet a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en 1881 par la cour d'appel dans une cause de La Corporation du Village de l'Assomption v. Baker[11]. Cette jurisprudence para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e et la l\u00e9gislature n'est jamais intervenue pour la mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9, du moins en tant que les corporations scolaires sont concern\u00e9es.\nQuant \u00e0 la question d'injustice soulev\u00e9e par l'appelant, je crois que cette question est du ressort presqu'exclusif de la cour de circuit comme cour d'appel. Il n'y a rien dans la cause qui puisse nous induire \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer qu'il y a eu un d\u00e9ni absolu de justice.\nPour toutes ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Cette cause, o\u00f9 on demande l'annulation pour ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9solution des intim\u00e9s pour l'achat d'un h\u00f4tel qui devra \u00eatre transform\u00e9 en maison d'\u00e9cole, a atteint cette cour apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 par trois tribunaux. La cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour d'appel se sont prononc\u00e9es en faveur des intim\u00e9s; la cour de revision, au contraire, a donn\u00e9 raison aux appelants, et tant en cour de revision qu'en cour d'appel il y a eu des opinions dissidentes. Il me semble que lorsque tous les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 d'actes administratifs ou autres d'une corporation municipale ou scolaire, le d\u00e9bat devrait se trouver \u00e9puis\u00e9, et sans qu'il y ait lieu, sous la loi qui r\u00e9gissait le droit d'appel \u00e0 cette cour lors de l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action, de douter de notre juridiction \u00e0 nous prononcer en quatri\u00e8me lieu sur la contestation mue entre les parties, ce n'est qu'avec regret que je constate la persistance des parties \u00e0 se ruiner ainsi en frais pour faire d\u00e9cider une question qui est d'une importance locale tr\u00e8s minime. Je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de regarder le d\u00e9bat comme \u00e9tant au fond une querelle de village. D'autre part, les commissaires d'\u00e9coles pour la municipalit\u00e9 de Saint-F\u00e9licien me paraissent avoir recherch\u00e9 de bonne foi \u00e0 se procurer un local plus convenable que celui qui sert actuellement d'\u00e9cole pour l'arrondissement n\u00b0 1 de cette municipalit\u00e9, et que l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente a condamn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant insalubre.\nJ'ai lu tout le dossier et je n'ai aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 renvoyer l'appel pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Allard auxquelles j'adh\u00e8re compl\u00e8tement.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Thos.

C.\nThe appellant was tried for murder and found guilty. The victim had been killed by the appellant's son, at the instigation of his father. The son, having had his trial 'previously, had been found guilty of manslaughter.\nHeld, that the appellant could be convicted of murder.\nThe trial judge in his charge, after reading section 259 Cr. C., explained to the jurors the nature of murder and instructed them that they could find one of three verdicts against the accused, murder, manslaughter or acquittal. While he did not read section 262 Cr. C. which refers to manslaughter, in discussing provocation and the defences set up by the appellant of self-defence and protection of the home, he explained under what circumstances the verdict might be one of manslaughter.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the trial judge sufficiently instructed the jury as to what in law constitutes the offence of manslaughter.\nPer Brodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014There was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding a verdict of manslaughter, if they had been properly instructed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal by the appellant relating to questions of law arising on his trial for murder and upon a stated case. The appellant was charged with having murdered one Morissette and found guilty. Morissette was killed as the result of a rifle shot which was fired by the son of the appellant at the victim, who had called late at night under peculiar circumstances. The trial of the son was held first upon an indictment of murder; and he was found guilty of manslaughter. At the trial of the appellant the judge, in his charge to the jury, explained the nature of murder, quoting section 259 Cr. C. He also cited section 261 Cr. C., on the defence of provocation, section 53 Cr. C. dealing with self defence against assaults and section 60 Cr. C. on the defence of dwelling-house at night. The judge did not read section 262 Cr. C. as to manslaughter. The two questions submitted to the courts were: 1, as the son was convicted of manslaughter, the appellant, as aider and abettor, could not be found guilty of murder; and 2, the charge was illegal as the jury were not sufficiently instructed as to the distinction between murder and manslaughter.\nN. K. Laflamme K.C. and M. A. Lemieux K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Marchand K.C. and Lucien Cannon K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was indicted for murder and convicted therefor.\nThe Court of King's Bench has, with the exception of Mr. Justice Guerin, so answered the questions submitted in a reserved case relative thereto as to maintain the conviction. The pith of the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Guerin in said court which gives appellant the right to come here, and is the measure of our jurisdiction to interfere, is that because appellant's son on another indictment for murder, resting on same killing, had on his trial been only found guilty of manslaughter, therefore the appellant cannot be found guilty of any greater offence than that of manslaughter.\nThe contention is a most remarkable one and seems to me to have been so well and effectually answered by the several opinions of the other judges in the court below writing opinions with which I substantially agree, that I do not feel at liberty to repeat same here. Some of them illustrate the unfounded nature of such pretensions as made, by various alternatives.\nI only add another and that is if this case, as it might have been in law, had been tried before the other, despite what appellant's counsel suggests is customary in such cases, how could he have invoked the pretension of law now set up?\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014I have carefully considered the charge of the trial judge and I am by no means satisfied that he instructed the jury insufficiently touching the elements of the offence of manslaughter and the distinctions between that offence and murder.\nI am unable to perceive any force in the argument founded upon the verdict and judgment against the younger Remillard.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal fails. The fact that in another trial another jury passing upon evidence which may have been somewhat different decided that the offence committed by Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard in killing Lucien Morissette amounted only to manslaughter is wholly irrelevant to the question whether Joseph R\u00e9millard could rightly be put on trial for, and could upon proof that he had aided, abetted or instigated, the homicide, be convicted of murder. As between Romeo R\u00e9millard and the Crown the verdict of the jury who tried him is no doubt conclusive as to the nature of his crime. As between Joseph R\u00e9millard and the Crown it determines nothing. The character of the offence actually committed by each must be decided by the jury charged with the disposition of the indictment gainst him. To the first question in the reserved case the only possible answer was in the negative.\nThe learned judge, in my opinion, sufficiently instructed the jury as to the three verdicts which may be rendered on an indictment for murder and as to the distinction between murder and manslaughter. He discussed adequately and correctly all the relevant grounds on which in this case the culpable homicide charged to have been aided, abetted or instigated by Joseph R\u00e9millard might possibly have been reduced from murder to manslaughter. Having read to the jury the definitive provisions of s. 259 of the Criminal Code dealing with murder, he instructed them that, if the homicide were not excusable, their verdict should be guilty of manslaughter, unless the facts proved warranted a verdict of murder. That was equivalent to a reading to them of s. 262 of the Code\u2014the omission of which from the charge was made the subject of serious complaint. The learned judge also read and explained s. 261, which deals with the effect of provocation, and discussed the several matters suggested in the course of the defence by way of excuse and in palliation. Without characterizing the charge as a model presentation of the case to the jury, with Mr. Justice Carroll I regard it as fulfilling the requirements of the law and not warranting interference by an appellate court on any ground covered by the reserved case.\nThe second and third questions should, in my opinion, be answered as they were by the Court of King's Bench.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014Trois questions principales nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises. La premi\u00e8re porte sur la validit\u00e9 d'un verdict de meurtre contre un complice quand l'auteur de l'homicide n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable que de manslaughter. Par les deux autres questions on nous demande si le juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s a suffisamment expliqu\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence entre le meurtre et le manslaughter.\nL'appelant est accus\u00e9 d'avoir tu\u00e9 un nomm\u00e9 Morissette, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre. Ce n'est pas lui cependant qui a tir\u00e9 le coup de fusil qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 malheureusement fatal, mais c'est son fils Rom\u00e9o. L'accus\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 que le complice de l'infraction.\nCertains t\u00e9moins, qui, je le suppose, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 crus par le jury mais dont le t\u00e9moignage est contredit par d'autres t\u00e9moins, ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le p\u00e8re, l'accus\u00e9 en la pr\u00e9sente cause, avait incit\u00e9 son fils \u00e0 tirer sur la victime. C'est \u00e0 raison de cette circonstance, je suppose, que la Couronne a persist\u00e9 tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 proc\u00e9der sur une accusation de meurtre contre le complice quand l'auteur lui-m\u00eame du crime n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable que de manslaughter.\nL'article 69 du code criminel justifie cette proc\u00e9dure, vu qu'il met sur le m\u00eame pied l'auteur et le complice d'une infraction et il les d\u00e9clare tous les deux coupables de l'offence elle-m\u00eame. Celui qui aide, provoque ou conseille un assassinat peut donc \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre lui-m\u00eame, malgr\u00e9 qu'il n'ait pas perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame le fait qui a produit la mort.\nNos lois criminelles depuis leur codification ont fait dispara\u00eetre cette classification un peu subtile des accus\u00e9s en principaux au premier degr\u00e9, en principaux au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9 et en complices avant le fait. Elles ont mis tous ces criminels sur le m\u00eame pied. Chacun d'eux peut \u00eatre poursuivi pour l'offense principale elle-m\u00eame, quand bien m\u00eame il n'aurait qu'aid\u00e9, assist\u00e9 ou conseill\u00e9 l'auteur du forfait (Russell on Crime, 6\u00e8me \u00e9dition, pp. 176-177).\nAinsi dans le cas d'assassinat, celui qui a simplement provoqu\u00e9 une personne \u00e0 tuer peut \u00eatre mis en accusation de meurtre comme s'il avait port\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame le coup qui a terrass\u00e9 la victime. Hawkins, \"Pleas of the Crown,\" 8\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol. 2 p. 439, d\u00e9clare que, m\u00eame dans un cas d'homicide, le complice pourrait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre lorsque l'auteur lui-m\u00eame du crime ne serait coupable que de manslaughter.\nAll those who are present when a felony is committed and abet the doing of it, as by holding the party while another strikes him or by delivering a weapon to him that strikes him, or by moving him to strike, are principal in the highest degree in respect of such abetment, as much as the person who does the act, which in judgment of law is as much the act of them all as if they had actually done it: and if there were malice in the abettor and none in the person who struck the party *** it will be murder as to the abettor and manslaughter as to the other.\nDans le cas actuellement devant nous le jury pouvait rendre un verdict de meurtre m\u00eame si l'accus\u00e9 n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 que le complice et n'eut pas port\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame le coup fatal. Chaque cause pouvait \u00eatre jug\u00e9e suivant son propre m\u00e9rite et suivant la preuve qui serait faite dans chacune d'elle sur la nature de l'offense. Le verdict dans l'une ne devait pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 dans l'autre cause.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui nous est soumise devrait donc recevoir une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative.\nQuant aux deux autres questions qui ont trait aux instructions du juge au jury, je ne puis pas en venir \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nLa question dans la cause \u00e9tait de savoir d'abord s'il y avait eu homicide coupable. L'accus\u00e9 a tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir que l'assassinat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sous l'effet d'une provocation et qu'il \u00e9tait accidentel. Ces deux moyens de d\u00e9fense auraient pu le lib\u00e9rer de toute offence criminelle s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s.\nLe juge, dans son allocution aux jur\u00e9s, s'est attach\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la provocation n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour justifier Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard de faire l'acte qu'il a commis et que le coup de feu qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9 ne pouvait pas \u00eatre rang\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie des accidents.\nApr\u00e8s avoir lu soigneusement toute la preuve, je me suis convaincu moi-m\u00eame que la provocation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour pouvoir justifier l'homicide; et je ne crois pas non plus que les circonstances o\u00f9 le coup de feu a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9 peuvent ranger l'acte accompli dans la cat\u00e9gorie d'actions qui, purement accidentelles, peuvent lib\u00e9rer compl\u00e8tement l'auteur de l'acte ou ses complices. Il y a donc, suivant moi, homicide coupable. L'homicide n'\u00e9tait pas justifiable ni excusable.\nMais cet homicide \u00e9tait-il volontaire ou involontaire? En d'autres termes y a-t-il eu meurtre ou simplement manslaughter?\nLe juge malheureusement ne para\u00eet pas avoir fait ressortir suffisamment la distinction entre ces deux offenses de meurtre et de manslaughter. L'honorable juge Carroll qui pr\u00e9sidait la Cour du Banc du Roi et qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 contre l'appelant, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans ses notes que l'allocution du juge est l\u00e9gale dans son ensemble, ajoute cependant qu'elle a pu\nproduire chez les jur\u00e9s l'impression qu'aucun autre verdict que celui de meurtre ne pouvait \u00eatre rendu.\nDans ce cas, peut-on dire que le juge a suffisamment renseign\u00e9 le jur\u00e9 sur les faits de la cause dans leurs rapports avec le crime de manslaughter? Il n'y a pas de doute, suivant moi, comme je l'ai dit plus haut, que la provocation et le caract\u00e8re accidentel du coup de feu ne pouvaient pas emp\u00eacher l'accus\u00e9 d'\u00eatre coupable d'homicide; car quand bien m\u00eame des personnes auraient jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de venir faire visite \u00e0 sa femme \u00e0 une heure indue de la nuit, l'accus\u00e9 n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifiable de prendre un fusil et de les tuer. La provocation n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour cela.\nMais si dans le but de prot\u00e9ger son foyer contre la mauvaise r\u00e9putation que la visite nocturne de ces jeunes gens peut lui imputer et si prenant un fusil il tente de leur tirer dans les jambes et si comme r\u00e9sultat de l'excitation ou par maladresse le coup va porter sur une partie vitale de l'un de ces visiteurs, sans aucune intention de sa part de causer la mort, n'y a-t-il pas lieu alors pour le juge de bien faire la distinction entre l'offense qui constitue un meurtre et celle qui constitue un manslaughter?\nC'est ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans cette cause-ci. L'allocution, au contraire, a port\u00e9 sur ces incidents comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crime de meurtre, lorsque la preuve d\u00e9montrait plut\u00f4t que les jur\u00e9s \u00e9taient en pr\u00e9sence d'un crime de manslaughter. Il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident, pour ma part, qu'il n'y avait pas intention de tuer mais simplement de faire une d\u00e9monstration qui emp\u00eacheraient ces visiteurs de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter leurs visites nocturnes et de les forcer, eux et leurs semblables, de respecter le foyer de l'accus\u00e9. Sa pauvre femme \u00e9tait malheureusement victime de la boisson et ses moeurs, comme il arrive d'ordinaire dans tous ces cas, \u00e9taient un objet de scandale pour sa propre famille. Alors l'accus\u00e9 a voulu la prot\u00e9ger contre ceux qui seraient tent\u00e9s de profiter de ces faiblesses pour d\u00e9shonorer son foyer.\nCela ne saurait justifier un droit cependant de prendre une arme \u00e0 feu et de tuer ces visiteurs. Mais si, comme dans le cas actuel, le juge doit insister pour dire aux jur\u00e9s qu'il y a crime, il doit le faire de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 leur faire bien comprendre ce qu'est le meurtre, ce qu'est le manslaughter. Prenant la phrase que j'ai d\u00e9tach\u00e9e de l'opinion du juge Carroll, je dis que si l'allocution du juge a pu produire chez les jur\u00e9s l'impression qu'aucun autre verdict que celui de meurtre pouvait \u00e9tre rendu, il doit y avoir an nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nLe juge ne doit pas se contenter de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le texte du code qui nous dit que sur une accusation de meurtre un accus\u00e9 peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre, de manslaughter, ou acquitt\u00e9; il ne doit pas non plus donner une d\u00e9finition plus ou moins vague de ces deux offenses, mais il doit consid\u00e9rer ces deux offenses \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits prouv\u00e9s et dire aux jur\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re claire et pr\u00e9cise les relations des faits prouv\u00e9s avec le crime de meurtre et de manslaughter. Le but de l'allocution du juge aux jur\u00e9s est de leur expliquer la loi qui gouverne la cause, de montrer les points essentiels qui doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et d'autre, les relations de la preuve aux points en litige. Aussi dans un cas o\u00f9 les faits prouv\u00e9s sont tout \u00e0 la fois susceptibles de produire un verdict pour deux offenses diff\u00e9rentes, il devient n\u00e9cessaire pour le juge de d\u00e9terminer qu'il y a criminalit\u00e9 et aussi de montrer clairement le degr\u00e9 de cette criminalit\u00e9 en rapport avec les offenses dont l'accus\u00e9 peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 coupable.\nLe juge doit d\u00e9finir le crime imput\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 et il doit \u00e9galement expliquer la diff\u00e9rence entre ce crime et tout autre dont il pourrait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 coupable. Le d\u00e9faut pour le juge de renseigner le jury sur le meurtre et le manslaughter a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 suffisant dans la cause de The King v. Wong On[1], pour ordonner nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nSir James Stephen, dans son ouvrage \"General View of Criminal Law,\" 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 170, dit ceci:\nI think that a judge who merely states to the jury certain propositions of law and then reads over his notes does not discharge his duty.\nUne cause \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en Angleterre il n'y a que quelques ann\u00e9es; c'est celle de King v. Hopper[2].\nIl s'agissait, dans cette cause de Hopper, d'une accusation de meurtre; et l'accus\u00e9, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, plaidait provocation et accident. Au proc\u00e8s, le juge a fermement exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que c'\u00e9tait un cas de meurtre ou d'acquittement. Il n'a pas voulu d\u00e9clarer que la provocation et l'accident pouvaient \u00eatre tels que l'offense p\u00fbt \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme manslaughter. Lord Reading, qui a rendu le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les circonstances prouv\u00e9es pouvaient justifier un verdict de manslaughter et que le juge aurait d\u00fb instruire le jury en cons\u00e9quence. Dans le cause actuelle, le juge, il est vrai, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi positif que dans la cause de Hopper; mais il a tout de m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 le jury sous l'impression que le seul verdict qui pouvait \u00eatre rendu \u00e9tait celui de meurtre.\nJe suis d'opinion, pour ces raisons, que les instructions du juge au jury \u00e9taient incompl\u00e8tes et par cons\u00e9quent ill\u00e9gales.\nIl devrait y avoir un nouveau proc\u00e8s et l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant having been tried at Quebec on an indictment for the murder of one Lucien Morissette before Mr. Justice D\u00e9sy and a jury, was found guilty and death sentence was passed on him. The learned trial judge refused to state certain questions for the opinion of the Court of King's Bench sitting in appeal, but on appeal to the latter court, he was ordered to state for the opinion of that court the following questions:\n1\u00b0. Should I have told the jury, as a matter of law, that the author of the crime, Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard, having been by another jury previously convicted of the crime of manslaughter, the accused (if in the opinion of the jury he was an aider and abettor) could not be convicted of the crime of murder; but the only verdict that could be rendered was one for manslaughter or acquittal?\n2\u00b0. (a) Should I have pointed out to the jury the three verdicts that could be rendered upon a charge of murder, viz.: guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty?\n(b) If yes, did I sufficiently so instruct the jury?\n3\u00b0. (a) Should I have pointed out to the jury what in law constituted the offence of manslaughter?\n(b) If yes, did I sufficiently so instruct the jury?\nAfter hearing counsel, the Court of King's Bench answered the first question in the negative, the two branches of question two in the affirmative and the two branches of question three also in the affirmative. Mr. Justice Guerin dissented and would have answered question one in the affirmative, the first branches of question two and three in the affirmative and the second branches of these questions in the negative.\nThis dissent permitted the further appeal which has been taken to this court, and, in view of its terms, the whole case is open for review. It should be remarked, as to questions two and three, that the five judges were of opinion that it was the duty of the trial judge to direct the jury in the manner stated in the first branches of these questions, the majority of the learned judges being of opinion that the trial judge had sufficiently instructed the jury on the points referred to.\nFirst question. Briefly stated the contention of counsel for the appellant is that the learned trial judge should have told the jury that inasmuch as Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard, the appellant's son, who fired the fatal shot, was previously tried on an indictment for the murder of Lucien Morissette, and found guilty of manslaughter only, the appellant, if in the opinion of the jury he was an aider and abettor, could not be convicted of the crime of murder, but that the only verdict that could be rendered was one for manslaughter or acquittal.\nThe circumstances under which the jury found a verdict of murder against the appellant are not mentioned in the reserved case, and cannot be perfectly ascertained by reading the charge to the jury, in which the learned trial judge commented on facts well known to the jury. I think however that we have only to deal with the facts assumed in question one, that is to say that Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard was the author of the crime, and was previously convicted by another jury of manslaughter. We must also assume that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the appellant was an aider and abettor in the crime committed by Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard.\nAssuming these facts, in order to determine whether it was the duty of the learned trial judge to direct the jury that the only verdict they could find against the appellant was one for manslaughter or acquittal, it is necessary to consider certain sections of the Criminal Code. The old distinction between accessories before the fact and principals has been abolished, and section 69, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code enumerates those who are parties to, and guilty of, an offence.\nEvery one is a party to and guilty of an offence who,\u2014\n(a) actually commits it; or\n(b) does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence; or,\n(c) abets any person in commission of the offence; or,\n(d) counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.\nParagraph (a) of subsection 1 applies to Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard, who actually committed the offence, and the other paragraphs comprise those who formerly were termed accessories before the fact, and who are now, equally with the perpetrator, parties to and guilty of the offence. If the jury were of the opinion that the appellant was an aider and abettor in the offence committed by Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard, they could undoubtedly find him a party to and guilty of this offence.\nTo aid or abet is defined as follows in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 64:\nTo constitute an aider or abettor, some active steps must be taken, by word or action, with intent to instigate the principal or principals. Encouragement does not, of necessity, amount to aiding and abetting. It may be intentional or unintentional. A man may unwittingly encourage another in fact by his presence, by misinterpreted words or gestures, or by his silence or non-interference:\u2014or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures, or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets; in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by a mere passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reasonably be expected to prevent it and had the power so to do or at least to express his dissent, might, under some circumstances, afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully encouraged, and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the jury whether he did so or not (per Hawkins, J., The Queen v. Coney[3]).\nIt is obvious here that it was for the jury to determine whether a case of aiding and abetting was made out.\nBut it is contended that the offence committed by Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard was manslaughter, as shewn by the verdict rendered against him and which must be taken to have been justified by the evidence, and that therefore they could not find the appellant guilty of the greater offence, that of murder.\nThis reasoning necessarily implies that the verdict found in another trial against Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard is conclusive evidence in the trial of Joseph R\u00e9millard of the nature of the offence committed by the former, of which offence question one assumes that the latter could be found to have been an aider and abettor. I think that this shews the fallacy of the appellant's contention, for what was decided in Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard's case was entirely irrelevant in the trial of his father, and the learned trial judge would have erred had he told the jury that because the son in another case had been found guilty of manslaughter, the father, when separately tried, could not be convicted of the greater offence of murder, for that would have been giving to the verdict in the Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard case a conclusive effect in the Joseph R\u00e9millard trial; in other words, treating it as res judicata, which it certainly is not. Unless the provisions of sect. 69 Crim. Code are borne in mind, confusion may be caused by treating the one as the actual perpetrator, the other as the aider and abettor, and measuring the guilt of the latter by the guilt of the former. Both are principals or rather parties to and guilty of the offence committed (sect. 69), that is to say culpable homicide, and culpable homicide is murder when committed with intent actual, or presumed in the cases mentioned in section 259, subsection (b), (c) and (d), to cause death, and manslaughter when that intent does not exist. So between two parties, within the meaning of sect. 69, to a culpable homicide, it is conceivable that one may be shewn to be guilty of murder and the other of manslaughter. And on the trial of the appellant, the jury could certainly determine what was the crime committed and, if the evidence justified the verdict, find the appellant guilty of murder, notwithstanding the fact that Rom\u00e9o R\u00e9millard in another trial was, for the same culpable homicide, convicted of manslaughter.\nMy opinion therefore is that question one must be answered in the negative.\nQuestion two. I would answer both branches of this question in the affirmative. It is common ground that it was the duty of the learned trial judge to tell the jury that three verdicts could be rendered upon a charge of murder, to wit, murder, manslaughter, or acquittal, and the learned judge did so. Question three. The appellant's counsel greatly insisted on this question, contending that the evidence was such as would have rendered a verdict of manslaughter possible, and that the jury were not sufficiently instructed as to what constitutes the offence of manslaughter.\nI have twice read the learned judge's charge. He very particularly explained to the jury the nature of murder, quoting the different provisions of the code which deal with this crime. There is no definition in the code of manslaughter, and section 262, stating that culpable homicide, not amounting to murder, is manslaughter, even if it could be regarded as a definition, was not read to the jury. However, at different parts of his charge, while discussing the defences urged by the appellant, the learned judge referred to manslaughter. Thus, on the defence of provocation, the learned judge cited section 261 of the code, the effect of which is that culpable homicide may be reduced to manslaughter where death is caused in the heat of passion occasioned by a sudden provocation. After reading the first and second paragraphs of section 261, he said:\nVous vous demanderez si nous sommes dans ce cas l\u00e0, et si on a eu le temps de reprendre son sang-froid avant que le coup de feu ne soit tire.\nAnd after reading the third paragraph of this section, he adds:\nPar cons\u00e9quent, c'est une question qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par vous-m\u00eames si une action quelconque qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e ici, ou une insulte particuli\u00e8re, constitue une provocation, et si la personne provoqu\u00e9e a r\u00e9ellement perdu son sang-froid par la provocation. Ce sont l\u00e0 des questions de fait dont vous \u00eates les seuls ma\u00eetres et que vous devez d\u00e9terminer apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes de droit qui vous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s. Further on, the learned trial judge quoted from Russell on Crimes, vol. 1, p. 693, translating as follows:\u2014\nPour r\u00e9duire le crime de meurtre \u00e0 l'homicide involontaire, la provocation, il faut que les circonstances justifient la conclusion que l'acte fait avec l'intention de causer la mort ou des blessures corporelles graves, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une d\u00e9cision froidement prise apr\u00e8s d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration et d'une malice r\u00e9flective, et n'est imputable qu'\u00e0 la faiblesse de la nature humaine.\nAnd the learned judge thus commented on this passage:\nVous vous demanderez si la preuve d\u00e9montre en dehors de tout doute que le projet qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 entre minuit et une heure du matin le vingt-huit janvier n'\u00e9tait pas un projet qui avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se former et \u00e0 s'ex\u00e9cuter graduellement depuis la veille au matin.\nVous examinerez les faits et gestes, pas et d\u00e9marches de l'accus\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre, les d\u00e9clarations qu'il a faites, vous examinerez toute sa conduite et vous donnerez la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question.\nImmediately following the passage I have quoted, the learned trial judge instructed the jury as to the claim made that the accused was justified in using force to prevent the breaking into of his house at night. He said:\nL'article 60 du Code Criminel dit:\nQuiconque est en paisible possession d'une maison d'habitation, et quiconque lui pr\u00eate l\u00e9galement main-forte ou agit sous son autorit\u00e9, sont justifiables d'employer la force n\u00e9cessaire pour emp\u00eacher l'effraction de cette maison d'habitation, de nuit, par qui que ce soit, s'il croit, pour des motifs raisonnables et plausibles, que cette effraction est tent\u00e9e dans le but d'y commettre quelque acte criminel.\nEst-ce que dans ce cas ici aucune personne a essay\u00e9 \u00e0 commettre une effraction chez l'accus\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre?\nEst-ce qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 hors de tout doute que Morissette apr\u00e9s avoir d\u00e9pass\u00e9 de quelques pieds la maison de R\u00e9millard en se dirigeant vers chez les Baker, et \u00e9tant dans le doute que la maison de Baker f\u00fbt r\u00e9ellement ce qu'elle \u00e9tait et basant ce doute sur le fait que Baker ne les avait laiss\u00e9s qu'une demi-heure avant et qu'il n'y avait pas de lumi\u00e8re dans la maison de Baker puisqu'il y en avait dans la maison de R\u00e9millard, est-ce que, dis-je, il y a eu effraction de la part de Morissette? N'est-il pas vrai que Morissette a fait comme tout homme bien \u00e9lev\u00e9 qui arrive dans une maison respectable; qu'il a sonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte avant d'entrer? Est-ce qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il a enlev\u00e9 son chapeau et qu'il a pos\u00e9 poliment une question \u00e0 la personne qui lui ouvrait la porte?\nAgain the learned judge, referring to the suggestion of the defence that the prisoner's wife was a prostitute and that the deceased and his companions had come to the prisoner's house at night in order to commit adultery with her, quoted from some unnamed authority as follows :\nSi un homme en trouve un autre commettant l'adult\u00e8re et le tue ou le tire dans le premier transport de sa passion, il n'est coupable que d'homicide involontaire, car la provocation est grave et la loi pr\u00e9sume que le mari n'a pu se contr\u00f4ler. Mais celui qui tue l'adult\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment et par vengeance est coupable de meurtre. Ainsi, si un p\u00e8re voit quelqu'un commettre avec son fils un acte contre nature et le tue instantan\u00e9ment ce ne sera qu'un homicide involontaire. Mais s'il en entend parler seulement, recherche ensuite cette personne et la tue, ayant eu le temps de reprendre ses sens, ce sera un meurtre.\nAnd as to the claim made that the accused had acted in self defence, the learned judge said:\nSi une personne recevant un coup se revenge imm\u00e9diatement avec une arme ou autre instrument qui lui tombe sous la main, l'offense ne sera qu'homicide involontaire, pourvu que le coup ait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 sous le coup de la col\u00e8re r\u00e9sultant de la provocation, car la col\u00e8re est une passion \u00e0 laquelle sont sujets les bons comme les m\u00e9chants. Mais la loi exige deux choses:\n1\u00b0. Qu'il y ait eu provocation; 2\u00b0, que le coup puisse clairement \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'influence de la passion r\u00e9sultant de la provocation.\nY a-t-il eu assaut dans le cas actuel?\nLe coup a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9 sous le coup de la col\u00e8re, col\u00e8re provoqu\u00e9e par cet assaut, le tout \u00e0 la connaissance de l'accus\u00e9 en cette cause?\nSi vous en arrivez \u00e0 la conclusion que ce drame s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 sous l'influence soudaine de la passion, vous devrez appliquer la loi que je viens de vous exposer, mais si vous en arrivez \u00e0 la conclusion que l'accus\u00e9 d'abord a fait quelques actes d'omission ou de commission conform\u00e9ment aux principes de la loi que je viens de vous citer, et qu'il a agi ou refus\u00e9 d'agir sans \u00eatre sous l'influence soudaine de la passion, mais bien sous l'influence de cette disposition d\u00e9prav\u00e9e et de ce mauvais esprit que la loi nomme \"malice\" dans la d\u00e9finition du meurtre, alors l'offense ne sera pas l'homicide involontaire mais ce sera le meurtre. In view of all this I cannot come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge did not sufficiently instruct the jury as to what in law constitutes the offence of manslaughter, at least in so far as was necessary to decide upon the different defences relied on by the accused, and as to these defences the learned judge told the jury under what circumstances, if they thought them established, a verdict of manslaughter could be returned. Such a method of instruction was probably more useful to the jury than citing to them sect. 262 of the Criminal Code, or theoretically explaining the differences between murder and manslaughter. The charge as a whole was a strong one against the prisoner and may have given the jury the impression that the proper verdict to return was a verdict of murder, while leaving them entirely free to appreciate the evidence and come to their own conclusions thereon. Even if I thought that this amounts to misdirection, and I cannot say that, I would not be justified in setting aside the verdict unless I felt convinced that some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the judge's charge (sect. 1019 Criminal Code). I cannot come to this conclusion after carefully reading the learned judge's charge and the circumstances there referred to as far as disclosed, and if the learned trial judge's comments on the facts are fair, and no objection thereto was taken at the trial, my opinion is that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned, even if the impression was left on the minds of the members of the jury that the proper verdict to return was one of guilty of murder.\nI would therefore answer both branches of question three in the affirmative.\nAs a result the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1904] 8 Can.

(1909).\nOn the 24th day of December, 1913, the appellant agreed to sell to the respondent the right to cut timber during 99 years on four lots then classified by the Crown for colonization purposes, for the sum of $400 payable after the appellant would have obtained letters patent. Section 1572 R.S.Q. (1909) provides that: \"lots sold or otherwise granted for settlement after 1st July, 1909, shall not for five years following the date of the location ticket, be sold by the holder of the location ticket or otherwise alienated, wholly or in part.\" Location tickets for these lots were applied for on the date of the agreement by the appellant and relatives. On the 29th December, 1913, the Crown's Lands agent received authority to issue the location tickets but only upon the applicants making the statutory sworn statement that they were acquiring these lots in order to become bona fide settlers, that they were not lending their names to any other person and that they were not acquiring the lots for the sole purpose of cutting the timber or having it cut for sale by others. The applicants, having given the above affidavits, did clear part of the lots but did not comply with the statutory condition of permanent residence and letters patent could not be granted. On the 2nd July, 1918, an order-in-council was passed declaring these lots to be unsuitable for settlement and that they could be sold without conditions for a sum of $2.00 an acre. This price was paid by the appellant and letters patent were issued to him. The respondent then brought an action to enforce his contract.\nHeld, that the contract had been made with the intent of effecting a result contrary to the policy of the statute concerning colonization lands and was null and void ab initio, and that the subsequent order-in-council did not render such an agreement valid.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 30 K.B. 372) reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of Roy J. at the trial, and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. St.-Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Perreault K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of the legality of the following contract between the parties hereto, who signed same:\nL'an mil neuf cent treize, le vingt-quatre d\u00e9cembre.\nMonsieur Daniel Bernier, cultivateur, de la paroisse du Cap. St. Ignace.\nLequel reconna\u00eet par les pr\u00e9sentes avoir vendu, avec garantie et franc et quitte, \u00e0 Monsieur Alfred A. Paradis, Ing\u00e9nieur Civil, de DuGueslin, pr\u00e9sent et acceptant acqu\u00e9reur, le droit de la coupe de tout le bois, pour le terme de quatre-vingt-dix-neuf ans (99) \u00e0 compter d'aujourd'hui sur les lots Nos. (16 & 17) seize et dix-sept rang B. du Canton Bourdages, avec droit de passer et vaquer et d'\u00e9riger toutes constructions sur les dits lots pour l'exploitation de cette coupe de bois.\nCette vente de coupe de bois est faite pour le prix de quatre cent piastres ($400.00) payable quand le vendeur aura obtenu les lettres patentes du Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour les dits lots. Le vendeur s'engage \u00e0 faire tous les travaux n\u00e9cessaires y compris r\u00e9sidence, etc., sous le plus court d\u00e9lai possible. Il s'engage aussi \u00e0 faire ses obligations aux endroits que l'acqu\u00e9reur lui indiquera, et ne devra pas couper un seul arbre en dehors de ces obligations sans \u00eatre responsable des dommages.\nEn foi de quoi les partis ont sign\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence de messieurs Henri Michon et Ad\u00e9lard Morneau, tous deux de la paroisse du Cap St. Ignace, qui ont sign\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moins apr\u00e8s lecture faite.\nThe lands in question therein were at the date thereof Crown lands set apart with other like lands for the purposes of colonization and offered on such terms as to encourage those acquiring same to become actual settlers. A scheme far from being in harmony with the said public policy and more calculated to retard settlement and to promote speculation in timber on said lands, seems to have been conceived by the respondent and presented to the mind of the appellant, whereby each of four lots should be applied for in the respective names of appellant and others likely to co-operate in carrying out said scheme and secure to the respondent the timber on the two lots named in the said agreement.\nArticle 1572 of the R.S.Q. 1909, contains the relevant law governing the appellant and others in becoming locatees of the Crown in order to carry out anything like unto the said scheme.\nIt reads:\u2014\nLots sold or otherwise granted for settlement after the first day of July, 1909, shall not, for five years, following the date of the location ticket, be sold by the holder of the location ticket or otherwise alienated, wholly or in part, except by gift inter vivos or by will in the direct line ascending or descending or in the collateral line, or by abintestate succession, and in that case the donee, heir, or legatee shall be subject to the same prohibition as the original grantee.\nThe location tickets for each of the lots in question herein were duly applied for on the date of above agreement and the Crown Land's agent received authority on the 29th Dec, 1913, to issue location tickets to each of the respective applicants, but only upon his swearing to an affidavit in the form which the regulation required containing ten paragraphs intended to secure the execution of the public policy I have above adverted to.\nThose bearing directly on the question raised herein, are as follows:\u2014\n4th. Je veux acqu\u00e9rir ce lot en mon nom, pour le d\u00e9fricher et le cultiver pour mon b\u00e9nifice personnel.\n7th.\u2014Je ne suis le pr\u00eate-nom d'aucune personne pour faire l'acquisition de ce lot.\n8th. Je ne fais pas l'acquisition de ce lot dans le seul but d'y exploiter le bois ou de le faire exploiter par d'autres, mais dans le but d'en faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole s\u00e9rieux. The respondent, notwithstanding the rather formidable obstacles in his way by reason of the article 1572 above quoted, and the said paragraphs in the oath taken by the respective applicant for each of said lots, named in the above quoted agreement, saw fit to bring this action after the patents had issued for the said lots.\nThe learned trial judge properly dismissed said action on the grounds of the illegality of the contract.\nThe Court of King's Bench, by a majority, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Carroll dissenting, reversed said judgment of dismissal.\nHence this appeal.\nI have no hesitation in holding that the contract was null and void by reason of its violation of the article 1572 above set forth, and the impropriety of the affidavits upon which the title of respondent rests to acquire the cut of timber for ninety-nine years from the date of the agreement.\nIt seems to me idle to pretend that a sale of the most valuable part of the whole property to be acquired was not a sale of part of those lots.\nAnd a sale that bound the patentee to refrain, for ninety odd years, from clearing and cultivation of the greater part of the land in question, seems directly in conflict with the public policy of promoting reclamation of the land pursuant to which, and that alone, the patent was to issue.\nThe pretension that discovery was made before the five years prescribed for doing settlement duties had expired that the land in fact should have been otherwise classified does not and cannot touch the question of the original illegality of the contract from the time it was executed or validate it. The case of Howard v. Stewart[2], is partly relied upon by some of the judges comprising the majority of the court below. The argument therein, it is said, is applicable herein in great part.\nFor my part in that case, I may be permitted to refer to the following paragraph:\nI am unable to see how we can find such alleged policy of the law unless by express legislation, or clear implication thereof, cutting out the usual operative effect which the law gives to the contracts between parties.\nClearly that is against any use of that case to support the judgment appealed from.\nAnd as to the affidavit in use at that time I said as follows :\u2014\nIn argument stress has been laid upon this affidavit. All it amounts to is that the applicant has an honest purpose at the time of making the application as specified in the affidavit. There is no pledging or promising in reference to the future disposition of the lot or the improvements. If it had been shewn that this locatee, Thibault, had conceived the purpose of selling to the Austin Lumber Company when he made his affidavit, the transaction, of course, would be fraudulent. Nothing of the kind appears in this transaction. I, therefore, fail to see any argument that can be founded upon this affidavit when we have in view the actual facts of this case. The affidavit itself is in harmony with the general expressions relative to sales used in the foregoing statutes.\nI evidently had there the same conception as I have now as to the one in use at the time when the contract in question herein was made, and adopt here my language there as expressive of what I then and still think of such a project as respondent had in view in promoting such a bargain as he relies upon.\nThe law upon which that case was decided was changed by the Legislature just after the party there concerned had got his location ticket, and made, as result of experience, radically more restrictive as to what a locatee could do or could not do. This question of trying to defeat the public policy in regard to Crown Lands' sales, has come up in other provinces. See the case of Brownlee v. Mcintosh[3]. And incidentally I had to consider it and cases thereon in another case heard before us this term.\nI think the honest observance of such policy once legislatively declared should be rigorously enforced by the courts and all attempts such as in question herein of defeating it by circuitous methods defeated.\nThis appeal, should, therefore, be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is not I think strictly the question which was so much discussed on the argument, namely whether the agreement was an agreement transferring a droit r\u00e9el in the lands to which it related. The agreement is, in my judgment, inoperative for a much more fundamental reason. The statutes of the Province relating to the disposal of the public lands provides for the acquisition of land suitable for settlement by persons intending in good faith to become settlers upon very advantageous terms. Under these provisions the consideration received by the public who are the owners of the lands in reality arises from the fact that the applicant for them is a person who does so intend and who presumably will carry out such intention by becoming a permanent resident upon them and making his livelihood by the cultivation of them. Such expectations no doubt frequently are not realized, but the form of the affidavit required from the applicant abundantly manifests the policy of the Legislature and the Government of Quebec and makes it abundantly clear that under that policy only bona fide intending settlers are to be given the benefit of the enactments touching this subject. The agreement which is in question in this litigation was, beyond all question, a part of a scheme by which lands which were not really suited for settlement were to be acquired\u2014through the instrumentality of applications by applicants lending their names for the purpose of the scheme\u2014with the object of enabling the respondent and the appellant to get possession of the timber on terms less onerous than those which would have been imposed had they attempted to buy the timber as such from the Government. The scheme necessarily involved the making of a statement by each of the applicants\u2014a sworn statement\u2014that he was acquiring the lot for which he applied in order to become a bona fide settler and further that he was not lending his name to any other person for the purpose of acquiring the lot. It is undisputed that the respondent understood all that would be involved in carrying out this scheme. It is impossible to contend, it seems to me, that an agreement so conceived having such intended consequences can be enforced by legal proceedings.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014The contract sued upon was made with the intent and for the purpose on the part of the parties to it of effecting a result contrary to the policy of the law. It was on this ground null and void ab initio. The property dealt with was to be obtained from the Crown under location tickets on applications purporting to be those of four bona fide intending settlers. The applicants did not in fact intend to become such settlers. The real purpose of the scheme to which they became parties at the instance of the respondent was to obtain for him and the appellant the timber upon the lots to be applied for. The applications were supported by affidavits containing misrepresentations of fact and intention. Each applicant was required to swear that he wished to acquire the lot applied for for the purpose of clearing and cultivating it for his own personal benefit; that he had not lent his name to any other person for the purpose of acquiring such lot; and that he was acquiring it in order to bona fide settle thereon and not for the sole purpose of cutting the timber thereon or having it cut for sale by others. These statements must have been false to the knowledge of the affiants as well as to that of the plaintiff by whom the making of such affidavits was induced. That the lands were subsequently found by the department to be unsuitable for settlement or cultivation cannot render valid an agreement which was void for illegality and fraud upon the Crown when it was made. While the defendant appellant, who sets up the defence of invalidity is certainly entitled to no sympathy, the courts may not lend their aid to a plaintiff seeking to enforce such a contract as that sued upon. I would, with respect, allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Paradis \u00e9tait en 1913 ing\u00e9nieur pour la construction du chemin de fer du Transcontinental dans le comt\u00e9 de Montmagny. Il a trouv\u00e9 que certains lots de terre de la Couronne qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d'un des stations du chemin de fer dans le canton de Bourdages pouvaient \u00eatre avantageusement exploit\u00e9s comme terrains \u00e0 bois. Et alors il s'en est ouvert \u00e0 Bernier, cultivateur d'une des vieilles paroisses du comt\u00e9, pour l'inciter \u00e0 prendre ces lots comme colon. Bernier savait probablement qu'il ne pourrait pas remplir les conditions que les lois imposent \u00e0 ceux qui veulent obtenir des lots de colonisation, mais Paradis lui repr\u00e9senta que ses relations avec certaines personnes influentes dans le d\u00e9partement des terres et en dehors lui permettraient de passer outre. Bernier crut \u00e0 ces repr\u00e9sentations et il fit faire par ses parents et son associ\u00e9 les affidavits n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir des billets de location de ces lots. Auparavant cependant Paradis lui fit signer un acte par lequel il lui vendait\nle droit de la coupe de tout le bois pour le terme de quatre-vingt-dix-neuf (99) ans \u00e0 compter d'aujourd'hui sur les lots 16 et 17, canton Bourdages\npour quatre cents dollars ($400) qui seraient payables quand Bernier aurait eu ses lettres patentes.\nBernier, ayant obtenu ses billets de location, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire couper du bois en quantit\u00e9 suffisante pour rencontrer les exigences de la loi des terres, mais son exploitation \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t commerciale que colonisatrice. Il n'a pas, par exemple, rempli les conditions de r\u00e9sidence que son billet de location et la loi lui imposaient. Il ne pouvait donc pas obtenir ses lettres patentes. Cependant il a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que les lots \u00e9taient impropres \u00e0 la culture; et il a pu induire le d\u00e9partement \u00e0 les classifier comme terrains forestiers, et moyennant une redevance additionnelle il a obtenu des lettres patentes. Il est bien \u00e9vident pour moi qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas un colon de bonne foi et que d\u00e8s le commencement Paradis et lui avaient l'intention de se pr\u00e9valoir des lois de colonisation pour mettre ill\u00e9galement la main sur des terres dont ils enl\u00e8veraient tout le bois, Bernier recevant quatre cents dollars ($400) pour sa part dans cette op\u00e9ration et Paradis recevant tout les profits qui seraient faits par la coupe et la vente du bois.\nParadis demande maintenant l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat qu'il a fait avec Bernier; et ce dernier plaide, entr'autres choses, que ce contrat est absolument nul.\nLa L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, voulant mettre fin \u00e0 des sp\u00e9culations d\u00e9plorables qui se faisaient autour des terres de colonisation par de pr\u00e9tendus colons qui n'\u00e9taient que des commer\u00e7ants de bois d\u00e9guis\u00e9s, a, en 1909, cru bon d'amender sa loi en d\u00e9clarant que les colons ne pourraient pas pendant cinq ans \u00e0 compter du billet de location vendre les lots qu'ils avaient obtenus du d\u00e9partement, except\u00e9 avec l'autorisation du ministre quand ce dernier serait convaincu qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la colonisation que ce transport soit fait. Et la loi ajoutait:\nTout transport fait en contravention avec le pr\u00e9sent article est radicalement nul entre les parties.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le contrat intervenu entre Paradis et Bernier \u00e9tait nul. La cour d'appel, \u00e0 une majorit\u00e9 de trois contre deux, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le contrat pouvait valoir, vu qu'il s'agissait de la vente de droits post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'octroi des lettres patentes.\nIl est bon de remarquer \u00e0 ce sujet que le contrat en question d\u00e9clare formellement que le droit de la coupe du bois est vendu \u00e0 compter du jour du contrat, c'est-\u00e0-dire depuis 1913. Il est vrai que le paiement ne devait s'en faire que lorsque les lettres patentes seraient \u00e9mises; mais il est incontestable que Paradis, si toutefois le contrat \u00e9tait valable, avait des droits sur le bois qu'il y avait sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il r\u00e9sulte donc que Bernier aurait vendu et transport\u00e9 des droits qu'il avait dans les lots en question.\nLa vente de ces droits \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale en vertu de la loi de 1909 parce qu'il \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment d\u00e9fendu au colon de disposer par vente de ses droits, except\u00e9 sur l'autorisation du ministre des terres. Sans discuter la moralit\u00e9 de la transaction intervenue entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur, sans rechercher si cette transaction \u00e9tait faite dans le but de frauder la loi des terres, je consid\u00e8re qu'un contrat par lequel Bernier entreprenait de disposer du droit de coupe sur les lots de terre qu'il avait sur billet de location, ou qu'il devait avoir sous peu sur billet de location, \u00e9tait un contrat qui, comme la loi le d\u00e9clare, \u00e9tait radicalement nul et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, ne peut \u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution par les tribunaux.\nSi un tel contrat pouvait avoir force de loi, ce serait simplement mettre \u00e0 n\u00e9ant l'intention \u00e9vidente du l\u00e9gislateur de ne donner ces lots de colonisation qu'\u00e0 des colons de bonne foi. On pourrait, en effet, comme on a fait dans le cas actuel, couper un peu de bois, ne pas r\u00e9sider sur les lots, et ce dans l'expectative de pouvoir faire un profit consid\u00e9rable avec le bois qui s'y trouverait. L'intention bien \u00e9vidente de la l\u00e9gislature \u00e9tait que ces terres de la couronne que l'on donnait pour rien ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s rien ne seraient donn\u00e9es qu'\u00e0 des colons de bonne foi, et non pas \u00e0 des personnes qui para\u00eetraient faire quelques op\u00e9rations de colonisation mais qui en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 n'auraient en vue que de faire le commerce de bois. Monsieur Antonio Perrault a, avec beaucoup d'habilet\u00e9, plaid\u00e9 que cette vente de 1913 \u00e9tait valable parce qu'il y avait eu en 1918 un ordre en conseil par lequel ces lots avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 virtuellement classifi\u00e9s comme terrains forestiers. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que cet ordre en conseil avait un effet r\u00e9troactif qui pouvait rendre valide le contrat fait en 1913 par Paradis et Bernier.\nJe ne puis partager cette opinion. Rien dans la loi ne d\u00e9montre que Tordre en conseil pouvait avoir un effet r\u00e9troactif. Nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le contrat de 1913 \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Or, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, on vendait un terrain de colonisation ou une partie d'un terrain de colonisation. La loi d\u00e9fendait des ventes de cette nature; et ce contrat, par cons\u00e9quent, se trouvait nul ab initio, et rien ne pouvait \u00eatre fait pour le faire revivre.\nPour ces raisons, le jugement de la cour d'appel doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli, le tout avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour.\nMignault J.\u2014Le 24 d\u00e9cembre, 1913, l'appelant a vendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9\nle droit de la coupe de tout le bois pour le terme de quatre-vingt-dix-neuf (99) ans \u00e0 compter d'aujourd'hui sur les lots 16 et 17, rang B, canton Bourdages, avec droit de passer et vaquer et d'\u00e9riger toutes constructions sur les dits lots pour l'exploitation de cette coupe de bois.\nCette vente de coupe de bois est faite pour le prix de $400.00 payable quand le vendeur aura obtenu les lettres patentes du gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour les dit lots. Le vendeur s'engage \u00e0 faire tous les travaux n\u00e9cessaires, y compris la r\u00e9sidence, etc., sous le plus court d\u00e9lai possible. Il s'engage aussi \u00e0 faire ses obligations aux endroits que l'acqu\u00e9reur lui indiquera, et ne devra pas couper un seul arbre en dehors de ces obligations sans \u00eatre responsable des dommages.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que cette vente est nulle, et plusieurs textes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention. Avant d'entrer dans l'examen de la question de validit\u00e9, il convient de dire sous quelles circonstances la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Il faut bien convenir que ces circonstances paraissent assez \u00e9tranges, pour ne pas me servir d'une expression plus forte.\nL'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait ing\u00e9nieur en chef du chemin de fer Transcontinental. L'appelant \u00e9tait cultivateur de la paroisse du Cap St-Ignace. L'intim\u00e9 lui proposa de se rendre acqu\u00e9reur de certains terrains du gouvernement en vue de lui en vendre la coupe du bois. Il se chargea de faire tous les arrangements n\u00e9cessaires avec le gouvernement et, de fait, le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1913, il recommanda \u00e0 l'honorable M. Joseph-Ed. Caron, ministre de l'agriculture et de la voirie, que les lots 15, 16, 17 et 18 fussent conc\u00e9d\u00e9s \"\u00e0 de bons colons\" savoir M. Ad\u00e9lard Morneau, M. Daniel Bernier (l'appelant), M. Joseph Bernier (fils mineur de l'appelant) et M. Phil\u00e9as Bernier (fr\u00e8re de l'appelant),\nqui offriront le plus de garantie au gouvernement pour bien remplir les obligations requises.\nM. Caron envoya la lettre de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son coll\u00e8gue l'honorable M. Jules Allard, ministre des terres et for\u00eats, et le sous-ministre de ce dernier autorisa l'agent \u00e0 Montmagny \u00e0 faire cette vente.\nAvant ces d\u00e9marches, l'inspecteur du d\u00e9partement, M. Frs Pouliot, avait certifi\u00e9, le 1er d\u00e9cembre, 1913, au ministre des terres et for\u00eats que ces quatre lots, d'apr\u00e8s sa connaisaance personnelle, contenaient chacun d'eux 50% de terre \u00e0 culture.\nLors de la vente de la coupe du bois, le 24 d\u00e9cembre, 1913, il n'y avait m\u00eame pas de billets de location pour ces lots. Ces billets de location ont \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9s le 29 d\u00e9cembre, 1913, et contiennent les conditions ordinaires de la concession des lots de colonisation. Dans l'affidavit requis pour la concession, chaque concessionnaire jura qu'il ne faisait pas l'acquisition dans le seul but d'y exploiter le bois ou de le faire exploiter par d'autres, mais dans le but d'en faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole s\u00e9rieux. Il d\u00e9clara de plus qu'apr\u00e8s avoir visit\u00e9 le lot il le jugeait propre \u00e0 faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole.\nLes conditions que le billet de location impose aux colons paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, sauf la r\u00e9sidence qui n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 que de huit mois par ann\u00e9e. Mais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour le d\u00e9faut de r\u00e9sidence continue sur les lots, les officiers du d\u00e9partement d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent que les lettres patentes de ces lots ne pourraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9es aux concessionnaires.\nC'est alors qu'on fit intervenir des influences aupr\u00e8s du gouvernement pour obtenir que des lettres patentes fussent octroy\u00e9es sans les conditions de la concession des lots de colonisation, et que les lots fussent vendus aux concessionnaires \u00e0 $2.00 l'acre. Nous voyons au dossier plusieurs lettres \u00e9crites au ministre par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 du comt\u00e9 recommandant la concession. Il y a \u00e9galement au dossier une lettre adress\u00e9e par le sous-ministre \u00e0 un autre d\u00e9put\u00e9 qui para\u00eet s'\u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affaire. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare aussi \u00eatre all\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement pour demander l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes.\nPour surmonter la difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut de r\u00e9sidence suffisante, on imagina de faire vendre aux concessionnaires ces lots pour le prix que j'ai mentionn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant dans leur ensemble impropres \u00e0 faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole. Ces d\u00e9marches r\u00e9ussirent, et, le 2 juillet 1918, le gouvernement adopta un arr\u00eate-en-conseil, constatant\nqu'il appert que ce lot, est, dans son ensemble, impropre \u00e0 faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole;\nqu'il convient de convertir cette vente en une vente sans les conditions ordinaires du billet de location. Et il fut ordonn\u00e9 que les lettres patentes fussent octroy\u00e9es sans conditions, pourvu que le propri\u00e9taire pay\u00e2t un prix additionnel \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 $2.00 l'acre.\nCe prix fut pay\u00e9 par l'appelant qui re\u00e7ut alors ses lettres patentes.\nCependant lorsqu'il se trouva muni de ces lettres patentes, l'appelant refusa d'accepter le prix de $400 que l'intim\u00e9 lui offrait. Il para\u00eet que le prix du bois avait tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9, et l'appelant ne voyait plus l'affaire du m\u00eame oeil qu'en d\u00e9cembre 1913.\nC'est alors que la justice fut saisie du diff\u00e9rend.\nJ'ai racont\u00e9 les faits ci-dessus sans en faire le moindre commentaire. De fait, ils peuvent tr\u00e8s bien se passer de commentaires. Il m'est absolument impossible de croire que M. Pouliot s'est tromp\u00e9 en 1913 quand il certifiait, d'apr\u00e8s les connaissances personnelles qu'il avait de ce territoire, qu'il y avait bien 50% de terre \u00e0 culture sur chacun des lots. L'appelant, du reste, d\u00e9clara dans son affidavit pour l'obtention du billet de location qu'apr\u00e8s avoir visit\u00e9 son lot il le jugeait propre \u00e0 faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole. Et que dire du serment qu'il fit, le 29 d\u00e9cembre, 1913, qu'il ne faisait pas l'acquisition du lot dans le seul but d'y exploiter le bois ou de le faire exploiter par d'autres, quand cinq jours auparavant il avait vendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 la coupe de bois pour 99 ans? D'ailleurs, le certificat asserment\u00e9, en date du 13 septembre 1917, de M. L\u00e9tourneau, qui visita le lot \u00e0 la demande de l'appelant, affirme que le terrain avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9 pour une culture profitable et qu'il y avait alors 15\u2153 acres en foin. C'est apr\u00e8s cela qu'on vient d\u00e9clarer les lots impropres, dans leur ensemble, \u00e0 faire un \u00e9tablissement agricole.\nMaintenant il s'agit de savoir si l'intim\u00e9 peut r\u00e9clamer la coupe de bois ou si cette vente est nulle. On a invoqu\u00e9 ici divers moyens de nullit\u00e9 de la vente du droit de coupe. On dit qu'on a vendu la chose d'autrui, bien plus, une chose hors du commerce puisqu'elle appartenait alors au gouvernement. On r\u00e9clame aussi l'application de l'article 1572 S.R.Q., qui d\u00e9fend aux colons de vendre ou autrement ali\u00e9ner avant l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes les lots qu'ils tiennent sous billet de location.\nD'apr\u00e8s mon opinion, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter ces moyens de nullit\u00e9, car il y a une objection autrement grave contre l'action de l'intim\u00e9. D\u00e8s le commencement, celui-ci para\u00eet avoir eu l'intention de se faire donner un droit de coupe de bois sur des terres destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la colonisation, et cela au m\u00e9pris des lois qui prot\u00e8gent \u00e0 la fois les colons contre les sp\u00e9culateurs qui veulent s'emparer du bois, et le gouvernement qui, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, conc\u00e8de \u00e0 des conditions tr\u00e8s favorables des terres appartenant \u00e0 la couronne dans le but de les faire ouvrir \u00e0 la colonisation. Je ne puis croire que sans les instances de l'intim\u00e9 l'appelant aurait jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 demander cette concession. Et quand on lui oppose le d\u00e9faut de r\u00e9sidence, l'intim\u00e9 et d'autres personnages interviennent pour lui faire vendre ces lots sans les conditions tr\u00e8s sages appos\u00e9es aux octrois pour fins de colonisation. Tout cela visiblement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour permettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de profiter de la coupe de bois, car, d'apr\u00e8s le contrat, l'appelant et ses h\u00e9ritiers n'y auraient aucun droit, et cela pour quatre-vingt-dix-neuf ans. Le gouvernement malheureusement para\u00eet avoir facilit\u00e9 la fraude contre la loi en adoptant l'arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil du 2 juillet 1918, mais il est possible qu'il ait ignor\u00e9 l'achat fait par l'intim\u00e9 qu'on a probablement eu la prudence de ne point lui d\u00e9noncer. Dans tous les cas, il y a eu fraude, et celui qui en profite, si la vente du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1913 est maintenue, c'est l'intim\u00e9 et non l'appelant. Cependant l'appelant s'est pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 cette combinaison frauduleuse, et il a ainsi obtenu une concession de terres publiques \u00e0 laquelle il n'avait aucun droit.\nJe ne puis consentir \u00e0 maintenir l'action de l'intim\u00e9, mais en m\u00eame temps l'appelant ne devrait pas avoir de frais contre ce dernier, car il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la fraude, et maintenant il est le seul \u00e0 en profiter, la vente du droit de coupe \u00e9tant annul\u00e9e. Il peut se consid\u00e9rer heureux si le gouvernement ne r\u00e9voque pas la concession qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit \u00e0 lui faire.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli, sans frais devant cette cour et la cour du banc du roi.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R\u00e9al Laverque.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perrault & Perrault.\n[1] Q.R. 30 K.B. 372.\n[2] [1914] 50 Can.

V, c. 32.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada should not be granted by the highest court of final resort in the provinces under section 41 \"Supreme Court Act,\" as enacted by 10 & 11 Geo. V, c. 32, if neither an important principle of law, nor the construction of a public Act, nor any question of public interest is involved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe appellant brought an action to annul a by-law passed by the respondent for the opening of a street. The street was lying entirely within the municipality, but at its limits had no issue. The Court of King's Bench, affirming the judgment of the trial court, held that the power to open the road was within the jurisdiction of the respondent ; and special leave to appeal having been granted by the appellate court, this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada. G. Barclay and A. Boily for the appellant.\nBelcourt K.C. and T. Lefebvre for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. It appears to me hardly arguable that the power to open a road over land lying entirely within a municipality is not in every respect within the jurisdiction of its council.\nAnd the other objection as to its description being defective seems, if possible, less so when we turn thereto and find its boundaries so clearly defined as they are. The bit of land taken would hardly warrant a prudent litigant pushing such a case so far.\nDuff J.\u2014I can discover no valid reason for differing from the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nBrodeur J.\u2014L'appelant a demand\u00e9 par son action que le r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par le conseil municipal de l'intim\u00e9e le 30 juillet 1919, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait l'ouverture d'une route fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et de nul effet. L'appelant est propri\u00e9taire de l'un des lots qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9s pour l'ouverture de cette route. Cette route devait se continuer dans la municipalit\u00e9 voisine pour atteindre la gare de chemin de fer de Val Jalbert; mais le demandeur appelant all\u00e8gue que la route qui est maintenant ouverte et qui traverse sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s'arr\u00eate \u00e0 la limite de la municipalit\u00e9 de Roberval et qu'elle forme un cul-de-sac.\nIl est fort possible que la corporation de Roberval ait commis une erreur administrative en ouvrant cette nouvelle route; mais elle agissait certainement dans les limites de ses attributions et il n'appartient pas \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par action directe l'exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion.\nLa route dont le conseil de Roberval a ordonn\u00e9 l'ouverture se trouve enti\u00e8rement dans les limites de son territoire. Tout chemin situ\u00e9 dans une municipalit\u00e9 locale est de par la loi chemin local et en conserve le caract\u00e8re tant et aussi longtemps que le conseil de comt\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9vaut pas des pr\u00e9rogatives que lui conf\u00e8re le code municipal (Brunet v. Hainault[1], Art. 445 C.M.)\nJe suis d'opinion que le conseil de Roberval avait jurisdiction pour ouvrir sur son territoire la route en question. Le jugement a quo doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nJe regrette de voir que cette cause ait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant cette cour. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat en litige ne para\u00eet pas justifier la permission d'appeler qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par la cour du Banc du Roi. Jusqu'\u00e0 l'an dernier, nombre de causes affectant des droits immobiliers nous venaient de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ces causes, pour la plupart, \u00e9taient \u00e0 propos de mis\u00e9rables petites lisi\u00e8res de terre \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s sans valeur et n'avaient trait qu'\u00e0 l'exercice de certaines servitudes peu importantes. La plupart du temps il s'agissait d'arr\u00eat d'esp\u00e8ce qui ne pouvaient offrir aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou public.\nLe parlement a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos l'an dernier (en 1920) d'amender la juridiction de la Cour Supr\u00eame de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que l'affaire en litige soit d'au moins deux mille dollars ($2,000). Cela \u00e9cartait du coup tous ces appels au sujet de droits immobiliers qui \u00e9taient d'une valeur insignifiante. Cependant le parlement d\u00e9clarait en m\u00eame temps que la Cour d'Appel pouvait permettre au plaideur malheureux de porter sa cause en Cour Supr\u00eame. Il peut arriver, en effet, que la cause soul\u00e8ve une question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, ou une question de droit importante, ou bien l'interpr\u00e9tation d'un statut; et alors la cause peut \u00eatre port\u00e9e ici sur permission sp\u00e9ciale.\nIl me semble que dans une cause comme la pr\u00e9sente il n'y avait pas de raison pour donner la permission demand\u00e9e. Il n'y avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat public en jeu. L'affaire en litige \u00e9tait d'une valeur insignifiante. La raison donn\u00e9e par la cour inf\u00e9rieure pour donner la permission d'appeler est qu'il s'agissait d'une action p\u00e9titoire \"involving a title to land.\" Cette raison ne me para\u00eet pas suffisante, car le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu \u00e9videmment refuser le droit d'appel dans les actions p\u00e9titoires \"involving a title to land,\" except\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en litige vaudrait au moins deux mille dollars ($2,000) ou bien dans un proc\u00e8s o\u00f9 le litige soul\u00e8verait une question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nMignault J.\u2014Dans cette cause, qui a origine subs\u00e9quemment au 1er juillet 1920, date \u00e0 laquelle la loi 10-11 Geo. V, ch. 32 modifiant la loi de la cour supr\u00eame est entr\u00e9e en vigueur, le droit d'appel \u00e0 cette cour n'existait qu'\u00e0 la condition que la plus haute cour de dernier ressort dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u2014 c'est-\u00e0-dire la Cour du Banc du Roi, juridiction d'appel\u2014 e\u00fbt accord\u00e9 une permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appel (art. 41).\nAvant la passation de la loi de 1920, le droit d'appel existait de plano si l'affaire en litige impliquait, entre autres choses, le titre \u00e0 un bien fonds ou quelque int\u00e9r\u00eat dans ce bien fonds. Gr\u00e2ce cependant \u00e0 l'esprit processif des plaideurs, on avait tr\u00e8s souvent port\u00e9 devant cette cour des appels o\u00f9 il s'agissait bien de titres \u00e0 des biens fonds ou de quelque int\u00e9r\u00eat dans ces biens fonds, mais o\u00f9 la valeur du droit en litige \u00e9tait insignifiante, de telle sorte que les frais du proc\u00e8s \u00e9taient devenus l'objet principal du d\u00e9bat entre les parties et le droit immobilier en dispute l'accessoire.\nPour pr\u00e9venir ce f\u00e2cheux r\u00e9sultat, la loi de 1920 exige, pour que le droit d'appel existe de plano, que la valeur de l'affaire en litige port\u00e9e en appel (the value of the matter in controversy in the appeal) d\u00e9passe $2,000 (art. 39). Cette disposition s'applique \u00e0 toutes les provinces du Dominion.\nCependant, comme il peut tr\u00e8s bien arriver qu'une question d'une tr\u00e8s grande importance se pr\u00e9sente dans une cause o\u00f9 la valeur de l'affaire en litige port\u00e9e en appel ne d\u00e9passe pas $2,000.00, la loi de 1920 rend l'appel \u00e0 la cour supr\u00eame possible si l'appelant a obtenu de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort de la province o\u00f9 les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9es originairement une permission d'appel. Et si cette permission a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, la cour supr\u00eame peut l'accorder dans les cas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s par l'article 41 de la loi de 1920.\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce la cour du Banc du Roi, juridiction d'appel, a accord\u00e9, l'honorable juge Flynn diff\u00e9rant, la permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appel pour le motif suivant:\u2014\nWhereas the action is a petitory action involving the title to real estate and special leave to appeal from such final judgment of this court should be granted.\nJe suis d'opinion, tr\u00e8s respectueusement, que cette permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appel n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Le motif qu'il s'agit d'un titre d'immeuble est manifestement insuffisant, car, m\u00eame dans ce cas la loi de 1920 exige (sauf le cas d'une permission sp\u00e9ciale) que le droit immobilier en question dans l'appel vaille plus de $2,000.00. Et si un tel motif \u00e9tait suffisant, on obtiendrait, par voie de permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appel, ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a cru bon de ne plus accorder de plein droit. D'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie de cette cour, lorsque le droit d'appel d\u00e9pend d'une permission sp\u00e9ciale laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion d'un juge ou d'un tribunal, cette discr\u00e9tion d'accorder ou de refuser l'appel doit s'exercer judiciairement, c'est-\u00e0-dire pour des raisons suffisantes pour convaincre le juge ou le tribunal que cette permission devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e ou refus\u00e9e.\nDans la cause de Lake Erie and Detroit River Ry. Co. v. Marsh[2], l'honorable juge Nesbitt, parlant au nom de cette cour, sans toutefois pr\u00e9tendre faire une \u00e9num\u00e9ration exclusive, a indiqu\u00e9 quelques cas o\u00f9 la permission d'appeler \u00e0 la cour supr\u00eame pouvait bien \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Il disait:\nWhere the case involves matter of public interest, or some important question of law, or the construction of Imperial or domestic statutes, or a conflict of Provincial or Dominion authority, or questions of law applicable to the whole Dominion, leave may well be granted.\nDans une autre cause, In re The Ontario Sugar Company (McKinnon's case) [3], l'honorable juge Anglin a refus\u00e9 la permission de porter un appel de la cour d'appel d'Ontario disant:\u2014\nThe proposed appeal raises no question of public importance. Dominion Council of Royal Templars of Temperance v. Hargrove[4]. The affirmance or reversal by this Court of the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal would not settle any important question of law or dispose of any matter of public interest. White Packing Co. v. Pringle[5]. These usual grounds for seeking leave to appeal are therefore absent.\nPour des motifs analogues, j'ai moi-m\u00eame refus\u00e9 la permission d'appeler dans la cause de Riley v. Curtis's and Harvey (of Canada) Limited, and Apedaile[6], o\u00f9 l'on poursuivait en recouvrement de la somme de $50,000.00, mais o\u00f9 il n'\u00e9tait question que de l'interpr\u00e9tation d'un contrat priv\u00e9. De tout cela il r\u00e9sulte que quand il s'agit d'accorder la permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appeler \u00e0 cette cour, on doit se demander si la question en litige est assez importante, malgr\u00e9 l'insuffisance du montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 ou de l'objet du proc\u00e8s, pour que la cause soit port\u00e9e devant la plus haute cour du pays. Il pourrait notamment en \u00eatre ainsi s'il s'agissait de mettre un terme \u00e0 un conflit de jurisprudence.\nJe crois donc\u2014et comme il est question d'une loi nouvelle, il me semble que je dois exprimer mon opinion avec une enti\u00e8re franchise, mais avec beaucoup de respect\u2014que dans le cas actuel on n'aurait pas d\u00fb accorder la permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appel qui a permis \u00e0 l'appelant de porter sa cause devant cette cour, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 parcouru deux degr\u00e9s de la hi\u00e9rarchie judiciaire sans avoir obtenu une seule opinion en sa faveur.\nAu m\u00e9rite, je renverrais l'appel comme mal fond\u00e9. Il s'agit d'un petit bout de chemin enti\u00e8rement situ\u00e9 dans la municipalit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e et on attaque le r\u00e8glement qui a ordonn\u00e9 l'ouverture de ce chemin. L'opportunit\u00e9 d'ordonner cette ouverture est une question qui doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du conseil municipal, qui ne me para\u00eet pas avoir abus\u00e9 de cette discr\u00e9tion. Et le conseil municipal avait manifestement juridiction dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : Armand Boily.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas Lefebvre.\n[1] [1911] 18 Rev. de Jur. 141.\n[2] [1904] 35 Can.

VII, c. 62\u2014(Que.) 1916, 6 Geo. V, c. 43, s. 11.\nBy c. 233 of 16 Vict., a statutory liability was imposed upon the city appellant \"in case of injury to property by any mob or during riots in the said city,\" and this statute has never been expressly repealed. Article 310 of the charter of the city of Quebec, as enacted by s.s. 16 of sect. 39 of 29 Vict., c. 57, gives to the city appellant the power to pass a by-law providing for the payment of damages caused to property by riot; and it also declares that if such a by-law is not passed within six months from the day of the riot, the party who has suffered damages has a right of action against the city appellant.\nHeld, that there is no incompatibility between the provisions of the two statutes, and that, under both, the city appellant is liable for the damages to property by a mob, even without any fault or negligence on the part of the appellant.\nArticle 561 of the Charter of the City of Quebec provides that \"every action, suit or claim against the city is prescribed by six months counting from the day when the right of action arose,\" and that notice of action should \"be previously given to the city within thirty days from the date on which the cause of the damage happened.\"\nHeld, that the provisions of article 561 do not apply in a case of liability such as that enacted by article 310 of the charter of the city appellant.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 30 K.B. 281) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of Sir F. X. Lemieux C. J. at the trial, and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. Roy K.C. for the appellant.\nL. St.-Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The decision of this appeal turns upon two points: 1\u00b0 Was 16 Vict., ch. 233, repealed by s.s. 16, sec. 29 of 29 Vict., ch. 57? The answer to this question depends upon whether or not s.s. 3 of sec. 39 is \"inconsistent\" with the provisions of the former Act. It seems beyond argument that the later provision can stand and be read together with the earlier Act without any sort of incompatibility. This question must be answered in the negative.\n2\u00b0. Is the present Act within sec. 11 of 6, Geo. V, ch. 43, which is in the following words:\u2014\n11. Section 8 of the Act 55-56 Victoria, chapter 50, as replaced by section 45 of the Act 7 Edward VII, chapter 62, is again replaced by the following:\u2014\n8. Every action suit or claim against the city for damages is prescribed by six months, counting from the day when the right of action arose, any article or provision of the Civil Code to the contrary notwithstanding. But no such action, suit or claim can be instituted unless a notice containing the particulars of such claim and the address of the domicile of the claimant, be previously given to the said city within thirty days from the date on which the cause of the damage happened, and no such action or suit can be taken before the expiration of thirty days from the date of such notice. The failure to give the above notice shall not deprive the claimants of their right of action, if they prove that they were prevented from giving such notice by irresistible force or other reasons deemed valid by the judge or the court, subject to the Act 29 Vict., ch. 57, sec. 39, paragraph 35.\nIt seems improbable that the legislature could have intended to require notice of action before a cause of action has arisen and that part of the enactment which relates to notice of claim seems to apply only to cases where the cause of action arises upon the happening of the \"cause of damage.\" This probability is strengthened by the circumstance that in the French version \"fait dommageable\" in the first sentence is evidently regarded as the equivalent of \"right of action.\"\nMy conclusion is that a right of action arising under the special statute upon which the plaintiff relies in this case does not fall within the class of cases contemplated by this section.\nAnglin J.\u2014After giving to this case careful consideration I find myself driven to the conclusion that neither the prescriptive provision nor the provision for notice of Art. 561 of the Charter of the City of Quebec (6 Geo. V, c. 43, s. 11) applies to a case in which the plaintiff's right to claim damages from the city can arise only six months after the happening of the injurious act for the consequences of which damages are sought.\nAs first enacted by 55-56 V., c. 50, s. 8, this provision probably did not extend to actions for damages caused by rioters. As it now stands the prescriptive clause cannot be meant to apply to a cause of action which only arises on the expiry of the prescriptive period. The provision for notice because found in the same section and introduced by the words \"no such action\" is almost certainly restricted in its application to actions that are subject to the prescription. It is unlikely that the legislature meant to require notice to be given containing particulars of a claim in respect of which a cause of action may never arise and cannot in any event come into existence until the expiry of five months from the period within which the notice is required to be given. The application of article 561 of the charter must, I think, be confined to cases in which the right to claim and sue for the damages sustained arises immediately upon their being incurred. I find nothing in this provision inconsistent with or repugnant to the provision of the statute, 29 Vict., c. 57 (3), by which the right of action originally conferred by the statute.16 Vict., c. 233, in circumstances such as exist in the case at bar appears to be reaffirmed.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Les faits de la cause sont les suivants:\nLa compagnie United Typewriter a lou\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral un certain nombre de dactylographes pour l'usage du bureau du r\u00e9gistraire \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Le 29 mars 1918, des troubles eurent lieu dans cette ville et les \u00e9meutiers ont saccag\u00e9 et pill\u00e9 le bureau du r\u00e9gistraire et ont d\u00e9truit ou endommag\u00e9 plusieurs de ces dactylographes. La compagnie propri\u00e9taire de ces machines poursuit la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec pour se faire indemniser des pertes qu'elle a subies aux mains de ces \u00e9meutiers.\nLa Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu des lois sp\u00e9ciales qui la r\u00e9gissent et notamment de l'article 310 de sa charte, a le pouvoir de faire des r\u00e8glements pour payer les dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des victimes des \u00e9meutes, et il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si ce r\u00e8glement n'est pas pass\u00e9 dans les six mois qui suivent le jour o\u00f9 ces dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi faits, la personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e a droit d'action contre la corporation. Je crois que cette disposition de l'article 310 est suffisamment explicite pour que la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec soit tenue responsable des dommages qui sont caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cas d'\u00e9meute. S'il y avait doute \u00e0 ce sujet, nous n'aurions qu'\u00e0 consulter les sources de cette charte, et notamment l'acte 16 Vict., ch. 233, qui indique clairement l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\nMais la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec dit que l'action doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e parce qu'un avis de la r\u00e9clamation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en temps utile et parce que l'action n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e dans les six mois qui ont suivi le fait dommageable; et elle invoque \u00e0 cette fin l'article 561 de sa charte (6 Geo. V, ch. 43, s. 11).\nCet article se lit comme suit:\nToute action contre la cit\u00e9, pour dommages, est prescrite par six mois \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 s'est produit le fait dommageable, nonobstant tout article ou disposition du code civil \u00e0 ce contraire. Mais nulle telle action, poursuite ou r\u00e9clamation, ne pourra \u00eatre intent\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu'un avis contenant les particularit\u00e9s de telle r\u00e9clamation, et l'adresse du domicile du r\u00e9clamant, ne soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 dans les trente jours \u00e0 compter de celui o\u00f9 le fait dommageable est arriv\u00e9, et telle action ne pourra \u00eatre prise avant l'expiration des trente jours \u00e0 compter du dit avis.\nLe d\u00e9faut d'avis ne privera pas cependant les r\u00e9clamants de leur droit d'action, s'ils prouvent qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9s de donner cet avis par force majeure ou pour d'autres raisons jug\u00e9es valables par le juge ou le tribunal.\nCette disposition de la charte peut-elle s'appliquer \u00e0 un cas comme celui-ci? Je ne le crois pas.\nL'obligation pour la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec de payer les dommages r\u00e9sultant d'\u00e9meutes est une obligation impos\u00e9e par la loi. En vertu des principes ordinaires concernant les d\u00e9lits, la cit\u00e9 ne pouvait pas \u00eatre tenue responsable' de ces dommages pour la bonne raison qu'il n'y a pas faute de sa part.\nL'avis que les r\u00e9clamants doivent donner sous les dispositions de l'article 561 de la charte ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 ceux qui veulent se pr\u00e9valoir de la faute d\u00e9lictuelle de la cit\u00e9. Il est possible m\u00eame que cet avis serait exigible dans le cas de faute contractuelle, ainsi que M. Roy nous l'a dit. Mais ce dernier point n'est pas en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire alors de le d\u00e9cider.\nMais cet avis n'est certainement pas requis dans le cas o\u00f9 la r\u00e9clamation est bas\u00e9e sur une obligation impos\u00e9e par la loi. La jurisprudence est \u00e0 l'effet que ces avis constituent une exception aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires qui r\u00e9gissent les personnes dans leurs relations entr'elles et alors ils ne doivent \u00eatre donn\u00e9s que dans les cas qui tombent clairement sous les dispositions du statut. Robin v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[2]; Newman v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[3]; Del Sole v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[4]; Qu\u00e9bec v. Bastien[5].\nMais quand ce d\u00e9faut d'avis doit-il \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9? Est-ce par d\u00e9fense au fond, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas actuel, ou par d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9liminaire?\nL'article 177 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile \u00e9nonce que la d\u00e9fenderesse peut par exception dilatoire arr\u00eater la poursuite si le d\u00e9fendeur a le droit d'exiger l'ex\u00e9cution de quelque obligation pr\u00e9judicielle.\nL'avis qui doit pr\u00e9c\u00e9der l'exercice d'un droit constitue-t-il une obligation pr\u00e9judicielle?\nCette question s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans une cause de Mattice v. Montreal Street Railway Company[6], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le d\u00e9faut d'avis que les victimes d'un accident sont oblig\u00e9es de donner \u00e0 la Montreal Street Railway avant d'instituer leur action est une obligation pr\u00e9judicielle dont l'inaccomplissement doit \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 par exception dilatoire. L'honorable juge B\u00e9langer, dans la cause de Kelly v. Montreal Street Railway Company[7], avait \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le d\u00e9faut d'avis d'action doit s'opposer par exception pr\u00e9liminaire.\nDans la cause actuelle, un avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, il est vrai, non pas par la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame, mais par celui qui avait les machines avari\u00e9es en sa possession et qui comme locataire pouvait \u00eatre tenu de r\u00e9pondre des d\u00e9gradations et des pertes qui arriveraient \u00e0 la chose lou\u00e9e. L'avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9lais accord\u00e9s par la charte. Quatre mois plus tard, la demanderesse a produit une d\u00e9claration asserment\u00e9e d\u00e9montrant exactement la nature des dommages qu'elle avait soufferts. En exer\u00e7ant la discr\u00e9tion que la loi laisse au tribunal, les circonstances de la cause peuvent nous justifier de d\u00e9clarer que l'avis r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en temps utile (art. 561 de la charte).\nMaintenant l'action est-elle prescrite par six mois?\nLa prescription de six mois que la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec invoque sous les dispositions de cet article 561 de sa charte ne peut emp\u00eacher la demanderesse de r\u00e9ussir. En effet, par cet article 561, la prescription commencerait \u00e0 courir du jour o\u00f9 l'\u00e9meute a eu lieu. Cependant l'article 310 de la m\u00eame charte dit que le droit d'action ne peut s'exercer qu'apr\u00e8s six mois de la date de l'\u00e9meute. Il est vrai que cet article 561 a une r\u00e9daction diff\u00e9rente en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Dans la version anglaise on parle d'une prescription qui serait acquise du jour o\u00f9 le droit d'action aurait pu \u00eatre exerc\u00e9. Dans la version fran\u00e7aise on mentionne, au contraire, une prescription qui partirait du jour o\u00f9 le fait dommageable se serait produit. Il y a divergence entre ces deux textes. Toute loi de prescription doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e strictement. Si m\u00eame l'article 561 s'appliquait \u00e0 la cause actuelle, je serais oblig\u00e9 de dire que Taction a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e en temps utile, car il n'y avait pas encore six mois que le droit d'action \u00e9tait n\u00e9 quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9.\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu que, le droit municipal d\u00e9rivant du droit anglais et du droit am\u00e9rican, ce sont les d\u00e9cisions de ces deux pays qui doivent nous servir de guides.\nJe dois dire que je ne partage pas cette opinion. Les autorit\u00e9s anglaises et am\u00e9ricaines peuvent nous \u00eatre sans doute d'un grand secours pour interpr\u00e9ter notre code municipal parce que ce dernier est copi\u00e9 en grande partie sur le droit anglais et le droit am\u00e9ricain. Mais il ne faudrait pas conclure de l\u00e0 que toutes les lois anglaises sur la mati\u00e8re s'appliquent et notamment que les questions concernant les d\u00e9lits et les quasi-d\u00e9lits doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s les principes du droit anglais ou du droit am\u00e9ricain. Notre code civil a des dispositions formelles sur la mati\u00e8re et il y a \u00e9galement dans nos statuts des d\u00e9clarations tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer cette responsabilit\u00e9. C'est, suivant moi, dans le code civil et dans ces statuts qu'il nous faut rechercher la responsabilit\u00e9, car il est toujours dangereux de s'en rapporter \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions qui bien souvent violent des principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de nos propres lois telles que nous les retrouvons dans notre code civil ou encore dans notre code municipal.\nLe jugement a quo doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9e en cette cause se base sur une obligation impos\u00e9e par statut obligeant la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 indemniser ceux qui souffrent des dommages par suite d'une \u00e9meute. Il s'agit de la loi 16 Vict., ch. 233 (1853) qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment abrog\u00e9e, et qui, dans le but de pourvoir aux moyens de cotiser les citoyens r\u00e9sidant dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec pour les dommages provenant de torts caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par des attroupements ou durant des \u00e9meutes, donne au conseil de cette cit\u00e9 le pouvoir de faire des r\u00e8glements pour imposer une cotisation sp\u00e9ciale pour couvrir et d\u00e9frayer la d\u00e9pense d'indemniser le propri\u00e9taire de tout \u00e9difice ou autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quelconque qui pourront \u00eatre d\u00e9molis, d\u00e9truits ou d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s par tout attroupement, assembl\u00e9e tumultueuse ou \u00e9meutiers quelconques dans la dite cit\u00e9, et cette loi, dont j'ai reproduit la phras\u00e9ologie m\u00eame, ajoute:\nPourvu que dans le cas de d\u00e9molition, destruction ou d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration ou endommagement de quelque propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la dite cit\u00e9 par tout attroupement, assembl\u00e9e tumultueuse ou \u00e9meutiers, alors si le dit conseil omet de pourvoir par telle cotisation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 d\u00e9frayer les d\u00e9penses n\u00e9cessaires pour indemniser le propri\u00e9taire d'icelle dans le cours des six mois qui suivront la destruction ou endommagement de telle propri\u00e9t\u00e9, la corporation du maire et des conseillers de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec sera tenu de les payer, et le propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truite ou endommag\u00e9e pourra recouvrer le montant des dommages soufferts par la destruction ou l'endommageaient d'icelle, au moyen d'une action contre la dite corporation.\nCette loi cr\u00e9e, \u00e0 la charge de la cit\u00e9 de Quebec, une obligation d\u00e9rivant de la loi seule (art. 983 code civil), et les conditions qui donnent lieu \u00e0 cette obligation (pour m'exprimer plus bri\u00e8vement que ne le fait la loi en question) sont: 1. le dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par des attroupements, ou pendant des \u00e9meutes; 2. l'omission du conseil de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, dans les six mois \u00e0 compter des dommages, de pourvoir par une cotisation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 d\u00e9frayer les d\u00e9penses n\u00e9cessaires pour indemniser le propri\u00e9taire.\nDonc l'action du propri\u00e9taire ne prend naissance que lorsque le conseil municipal a laiss\u00e9 passer six mois sans imposer cette cotisation. A l'encontre de l'action de la compagnie intim\u00e9e\u2014 qui a souffert des dommages par suite de la destruction de certaines machines \u00e0 \u00e9crire lui appartenant, pendant une \u00e9meute, le 29 mars 1918, quand une foule tumultueuse d'\u00e9meutiers a envahi les bureaux \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec du r\u00e9gistraire sous la loi du service militaire \u00e0 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9es ces machines\u2014l'appelante plaide: 1. prescription de six mois: 2. d\u00e9faut d'avis d'action en recouvrement des dommages dans les trente jours apr\u00e8s qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soufferts.\nL'appelante se base sur l'article 561 de sa charte, tel qu'\u00e9dict\u00e9 par la loi 6, Geo. V, ch. 43, art. 11, et qui se lit comme suit:\nToute action contre la cit\u00e9, pour dommages, est prescrite par six mois \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 s'est produit le fait dommageable, nonobstant tout article ou disposition du Code civil \u00e0 ce contraire. Mais nulle telle action, poursuite ou r\u00e9clamation, ne pourra \u00eatre intent\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu'un avis, contenant les particularit\u00e9s de telle r\u00e9clamation, et l'adresse du domicile du r\u00e9clamant, ne soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 dans les trente jours \u00e0 compter de celui o\u00f9 le fait dommageable est arriv\u00e9, et telle action ne pourra \u00eatre prise avant l'expiration des trente jours \u00e0 compter dudit avis.\nLe d\u00e9faut d'avis ne privera pas cependant les r\u00e9clamants de leur droit d'action, s'ils prouvent qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9s de donner cet avis par force majeure, ou pour d'autres raisons jug\u00e9es valables par le juge ou le tribunal, sujet \u00e0 la loi 29 Victoria, chapitre 57, article 36, paragraphe 35.\nL'appelante a attir\u00e9 notre attention sur le fait que la version anglaise de cet article, au lieu des mots\n\u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 s'est produit le fait dommageable,\ndit \u2014\ncounting from the day when the right of action arose.\nEt au lieu des mots de la version fran\u00e7aise, concernant l'avis d'action:\ndans les trente jours \u00e0 compter de celui o\u00f9 le fait dommageable est arriv\u00e9, nous lisons dans la version anglaise:\nwithin thirty days from the date on which the cause of the damage happened.\nAvant la loi 6 Geo. V, ch. 43, l'article 561, ou plut\u00f4t l'article 8 de la loi 55-56 Vict., ch. 50 (qui est la source de l'article 561) tel qu'on le lit dans la loi 7 Edouard VII, ch. 62, sect. 45, disait, dans sa version fran\u00e7aise, en parlant de l'avis d'action,\ndans les trente jours \u00e0 compter de celui o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9.\net dans la version anglaise,\nwithin thirty days from the date on which the accident happened.\nLe principal changement sur lequel on se base, c'est le remplacement du mot \"accident\" par l'expression \"fait dommageable.\"\nCette derni\u00e8re expression est sans doute plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et comprendrait probablement\u2014mais pour les fins de cette cause il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de le d\u00e9cider formellement \u2014 une cause de dommages que l'on pourrait distinguer d'un pur accident.\nMais sans m'attarder \u00e0 des distinctions, d'un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat th\u00e9orique peut-\u00eatre, entre la cause d'une obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement parlant et les conditions exig\u00e9es pour qu'une responsabilit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par la loi prenne naissance, je dirai\u2014et cela suffit pour les besoins de la cause\u2014que la loi qui impose l'obligation dont il s'agit ici, c'est-\u00e0-dire la loi 16 Vict., ch. 233, n'a pas \u00e9tabli une prescription courte ayant pour effet d'\u00e9teindre l'obligation l\u00e9gale qu'elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9e, et n'exige pas qu'un avis d'action soit donn\u00e9.\nIl serait absurde d'appliquer \u00e0 une action comme celle de l'intim\u00e9e une prescription de six mois \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 s'est produit le fait dommageable, car le droit d'action ne prend naissance que lorsque six mois se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis le fait dommageable sans que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ait pourvu par une cotisation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 d\u00e9frayer les d\u00e9penses n\u00e9cessaires pour indemniser le propri\u00e9taire. Si l'appelante a raison, la naissance du droit d'action co\u00efnciderait avec l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode de la prescription, et le droit d'action serait mort-n\u00e9. Cela suffit pour disposer du plaidoyer de prescription.\nEt quant \u00e0 l'avis d'action, on peut dire\u2014et ce serait un argument tr\u00e8s fort\u2014que si l'article 561 de la charte de Qu\u00e9bec ne s'applique pas \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation comme celle de l'intim\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer la p\u00e9riode de la prescription, il ne doit pas s'y appliquer pour donner une fin de non-recevoir r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut d'avis d'action. Du reste, les termes m\u00eames de l'article 561 d\u00e9montrent qu'il est sans application \u00e0 l'obligation l\u00e9gale d\u00e9rivant de la loi 16 Vict., ch. 233, car l'avis d'action doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 dans les trente jours \u00e0 compter du fait dommageable, et alors l'action de l'intim\u00e9e, bas\u00e9e sur l'omission de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec d'imposer la cotisation dans les six mois du dommage, n'\u00e9tait pas encore n\u00e9e. Du reste, il n'y a pas, selon l'article 561, d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance absolue, mais le tribunal peut, selon le deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de cet article, d\u00e9cider que l'avis n'\u00e9tait pas indispensable dans les circonstances.\nMais ce qui suffit surabondamment pour les besoins de cette cause, c'est que la loi 16 Vict., ch. 233, n'exige pas l'avis d'action. On suppose, bien entendu, que le propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9s\u00e9 a fait conna\u00eetre \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 le chiffre de ses dommages, car il s'agit pour le conseil de les pr\u00e9lever par cotisation sp\u00e9ciale, et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Mais il n'y est pas question d'un avis d'action dans un d\u00e9lai quelconque. Je conclus donc que la d\u00e9fense de prescription et de d\u00e9faut d'avis d'action est mal fond\u00e9e.\nL'appelante n'a pas \u00e9tabli l'abrogation implicite de la loi 16 Vict., ch. 233, par suite de dispositions subs\u00e9quentes incompatibles avec cette loi, et il n'y a pas eu d'abrogation expresse.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chapleau & Th\u00e9riault.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fergus Murphy.\n[1] Q.R. 30 K.B. 281.\n[2] [1914] Q.R. 54 S.C. 2.\n[3] [1912] Q.R. 53 S.C. 481.\n[4] [1915] Q.R. 24 K.B. 550.\n[5] [1916] Q.R. 25 K.B. 539.\n[6] [1901] Q.R. 20 S.C. 222.\n[7] [1898] Q.R. 13 S.C. 385.\n"

The lease was expiring on the 1st of May, 1920. On the 20th of February, 1920, St. D., acting personally and as agent of L., rented the same property to G. for five years from the 1st of May with the option to buy it for $60,000. On the 22nd of March, 1920, S. notified L. and St. D. that he was exercising his option to buy the property for $60,000. On the 24th of April, 1920, two actions were brought to annul the lease by St. D. to G. one by S. against St. D. with L. and G. as mis-en-cause and one by L. against St. D. and G. On the 8th of May, 1920, G. tendering a sum representing the rent for one month, brought an action against St. D., L. and S. in order to be put into possession of the hotel. The two first actions were dismissed by the trial court and no appeal taken. The third one by G. was maintained by the Superior Court, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench.\nHeld, Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that there was jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal. MOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the motion.\nT. Rinfret K.C. contra.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of opinion that the motion to quash this appeal should be dismissed with costs on the grounds that, as sworn to, there is involved in the matter in controversy what amounts to the value of two thousand dollars, and that the matters in controversy relate to the title to lands or tenements, as interpreted according to the jurisprudence of this court, touching the right of appeal.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of opinion that the motion should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am unable to find a subject matter of the value of $2,000 directly involved in this action.\nThe weight of authority seems to support the view that in the Province of Quebec an action to recover possession from an overholding tenant should be regarded as a personal action, and does not involve title to land in the sense necessary to maintain the jurisdiction of this Court under s. 46 (b) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nI am therefore of opinion that the motion to quash should prevail. Brodeur J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9 Gari\u00e9py fait motion pour casser l'appel faute de juridiction.\nLes faits de la cause sont un peu compliqu\u00e9s et il devient n\u00e9cessaire d'en faire une courte analyse pour rendre jugement sur cette motion.\nLes appelants, les Laferri\u00e8re, et St.-Denis, le d\u00e9fendeur, sont propri\u00e9taires indivis de l'H\u00f4tel Riendeau \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\nEn 1914, les Laferri\u00e8re et St.-Denis ont lou\u00e9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour cinq ans aux d\u00e9fendeurs-appelants Gervais et Samson et ont stipul\u00e9 dans le bail que ces derniers auraient la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de se porter acqu\u00e9reurs de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 si les locateurs trouvaient un acheteur.\nLe bail expirait au 1er mai 1920.\nLe 20 f\u00e9vrier 1920, St.-Denis, agissant tant personnellement que comme mandataire de ses co-propri\u00e9taires, les Laferri\u00e8re, louait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Gari\u00e9py pour cinq ans \u00e0 compter du 1er mai 1920, et en m\u00eame temps il donnait personnellement \u00e0 ce dernier une promesse de lui vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour $60,000.00.\nLes Laferri\u00e8re pr\u00e9tendirent alors qu'ils n'avaient pas autoris\u00e9 St.-Denis \u00e0 faire bail de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de Gari\u00e9py et ils institu\u00e8rent une action pour demander l'annulation de ce bail St.-Denis-Gari\u00e9py du 20 f\u00e9vrier 1920.\nLe 12 mars 1920, Gervais et Samson notifi\u00e8rent leurs locateurs qu'ils d\u00e9siraient exercer le pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence stipul\u00e9 dans leur bail et qu'ils \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux conditions de la promesse de vente faite par St.-Denis \u00e0 Gari\u00e9py le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1920 et \u00e0 signer \u00e0 cette fin tous les contrats n\u00e9cessaires.\nLes Laferri\u00e8re se d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent pr\u00eats \u00e0 donner suite \u00e0 cette promesse de vente et \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 Gervais et Samson d'exercer leur pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Comme St.-Denis et Laferri\u00e8re ne livraient pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Gari\u00e9py le 1er mai 1920 et comme Gervais et Samson continuaient \u00e0 l'habiter apr\u00e8s le 1er mai 1920, Gari\u00e9py a, le 14 mai 1920, institu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action o\u00f9 il conclut \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9fendeurs St.-Denis, Laferri\u00e8re, Gervais et Samson soient condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 lui livrer le dit immeuble.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs, les Laferri\u00e8re et Gervais et Samson, ont plaid\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, mais leur d\u00e9fense est au m\u00eame effet, c'est qu'ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 par une premi\u00e8re action l'annulation du bail consenti par St.-Denis \u00e0 Gari\u00e9py, le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1920, qu'ils r\u00e9it\u00e8rent les conclusions qu'ils ont prises dans cette premi\u00e8re action et que Gervais et Samson ayant exerc\u00e9 leur pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence ils ont droit de rester en possession de cet immeuble et qu'ils en sont les propri\u00e9taires.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour d'appel[2] ont maintenu l'action de Gari\u00e9py et la question qui nous est soumise est de savoir si cette cour a juridiction pour entendre l'appel qui est port\u00e9 devant nous.\nCette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e a d\u00e9cider cette question de juridiction dans une cause de Blackford v. McBain[3], o\u00f9 les faits sont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 ceux de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Dans cette cause de Blachford v. McBain3, le locataire r\u00e9clamait qu'il avait le droit de garder la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu d'une promesse de vente contenue dans son bail; le locateur pr\u00e9tendait, au contraire, qu'il devait en \u00eatre expuls\u00e9. La cour en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion suivante :\nThat as upon the face of the proceedings the right to the possession and property of an immovable property is involved, an appeal lies. S'il n'y avait pas la promesse de vente et le pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence en question en la pr\u00e9sente cause, s'il n'y avait, au contraire, que les relations de locateur et de locataire, il pourrait se faire que nous serions en pr\u00e9sence non pas d'un droit immobilier mais d'un droit personnel et qu'en cons\u00e9quence on devrait appliquer la d\u00e9cision de Fr\u00e9chette v. Simmoneau[4]. Cependant je dois reconna\u00eetre que la question de savoir si le droit du locateur de recouvrer la possession d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e est un droit mobilier ou immobilier, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement r\u00e9solue et qu'elle a fait dans la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise la cause de vives controverses.\nVide: Troplong, vol. 1er, Louage, nos. 6 \u00e0 14; Art. 1743 Code Napol\u00e9on; Guillouard, vol. 1er, Louage, nos. 17 & suivants; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vo. Action possessore, no. 25; Dalloz, 1848-1-39.\nIl serait int\u00e9ressant de conna\u00eetre la port\u00e9e de nos articles 1663 et 2128 du Code Civil sur la solution de cette question de savoir si les droits du locateur ou du locataire sur l'immeuble lou\u00e9 sont des droits personnels ou r\u00e9els.\nPour un autre motif que celui \u00e9nonc\u00e9 plus haut, je crois que nous avons juridiction parce qu'il s'agit d'une mati\u00e8re dont la valeur est de plus de deux mille dollars. La loi permet maintenant, depuis 1913, de faire la preuve par affidavit de cette mati\u00e8re en litige. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nIl me para\u00eet incontestable que le droit de poss\u00e9der et d'occuper cet immeuble vaut au moins cette somme.\nPour ces raisons la motion pour casser l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. Il est fort possible que les d\u00e9fendeurs n'aient aucun droit d'invoquer cette promesse de vente, et que la possession des d\u00e9fendeurs Gervais et Samson, en possession de cet immeuble, soit sans justification. Mais c'est l\u00e0 une question qui touche au m\u00e9rite de la cause et qui ne saurait affecter le point de savoir si nous avons le droit d'entendre une cause m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9sire faire un appel pour d\u00e9lai.\nMignault J.\u2014J'accorderais les conclusions de la motion de l'intim\u00e9 pour casser cet appel pour d\u00e9faut de juridiction.\nL'intim\u00e9 Gari\u00e9py\u2014qui avait lou\u00e9 pour cinq ans un immeuble \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, connu sous le nom d'H\u00f4tel Riendeau, du nomm\u00e9 St. Denis, propri\u00e9taire des sept-huiti\u00e8mes indivis de cet immeuble, les appelants Laferri\u00e8re \u00e9tant propri\u00e9taires d'un huiti\u00e8me, et qui a trouv\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la prise de possession stipul\u00e9e en son bail, que les locataires, les appelants Gervais et Samson, dont le bail \u00e9tait expir\u00e9, ne voulaient pas livrer possession de l'h\u00f4tel, et que St. Denis ne prenait pas les mesures de les en expulser\u2014a intent\u00e9 en cour sup\u00e9rieure une action contre les appelants par laquelle il offrait \u00e0 St. Denis et aux Laferri\u00e8re un mois de son loyer, et o\u00f9 il concluait, comme exer\u00e7ant, sous l'article 1031 du Code Civil, les droits de son d\u00e9biteur St. Denis, \u00e0 l'expulsion de Gervais et Samson de l'h\u00f4tel. Cette action fut contest\u00e9e par Laferri\u00e8re et par Gervais et Samson. Tous les d\u00e9fendeurs all\u00e8guent dans leur d\u00e9fense avoir pris une action pour faire annuler le bail consenti par St. Denis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Ils concluent au renvoi de l'action de l'intim\u00e9, demandant acte de l'action qu'ils ont intent\u00e9e contre lui pour faire annuler ce bail, et d\u00e9clarant en r\u00e9it\u00e9rer les conclusions. Les appelants Gervais et Samson pr\u00e9tendent avoir lou\u00e9 l'immeuble des Laferri\u00e8re et disent aussi que dans leur bail \u00e0 eux, alors expir\u00e9, St. Denis leur avait consenti un pacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la vente de l'h\u00f4tel au cas o\u00f9 il se d\u00e9ciderait \u00e0 le vendre.\nIl est tr\u00e8s important de constater que les appellants Laferri\u00e8re et Gervais et Samson, ayant intent\u00e9 une autre action pour faire annuler le bail sur lequel l'intim\u00e9 se base en l'action pr\u00e9sente, la validit\u00e9 de ce bail et de la promesse de vente qu'il contient, en question dans l'autre action, ne l'est pas en l'action dont il s'agit ici. Tout ce que les appelants pouvaient faire, sans s'exposer \u00e0 l'objection de litispendance, c'\u00e9tait de demander, dans leur d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'action actuelle, acte de l'action qu'ils avaient intent\u00e9e pour faire annuler le bail, et c'est ce qu'ils ont fait. Ils auraient pu encore demander la r\u00e9union des deux causes, mais ils ne paraissent pas l'avoir fait. R\u00e9it\u00e9rer dans cette action les conclusions qu'ils avaient prises dans l'autre action, ne donnait pas juridiction \u00e0 la cour dans Faction actuelle d'annuler le bail. Cette question ne pouvait se d\u00e9cider que dans l'autre action et n'est pas et ne peut \u00eatre soumise sur l'action pr\u00e9sente. De fait, M. Geoffrion, avocat de l'intim\u00e9, a affirm\u00e9, sans contradiction, que l'autre action des appelants en annulation du bail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e et qu'il n'y avait pas eu appel.\nDans ces circonstances, nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une action personnelle, offrant $270.84 pour un mois de loyer et demandant, comme locataire, la possession de l'immeuble contre certains locataires dont le bail est expir\u00e9. Le droit du locataire est \u00e9videmment un droit personnel. Je ne puis voir dans cette cause rien qui ressemble \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce de Blachford v. McBain.[5], cit\u00e9e par les appelants, o\u00f9 la d\u00e9fenderesse all\u00e9guait, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une saisie-gagerie en expulsion, \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, la validit\u00e9 du bail et le droit d'avoir la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, au cas d'ali\u00e9nation de l'immeuble ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soul\u00e9v\u00e9s par les appelants dans une autre action qui n'est pas devant nous, et ils ne peuvent \u00eatre mis en question sur cet appel. Il n'appert m\u00eame pas, je l'ai dit, que les deux actions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies, et elles n'ont pas d\u00fb l'\u00eatre, car autrement le jugement le mentionnerait.[6] Le fait que le loyer entier des cinq ann\u00e9es du bail de l'intim\u00e9, dont il n'offre qu'un mois, d\u00e9passe $2,000.00, ne suffit pas. Et l'affidavit de M. Laporte ne fait qu'additionner ce loyer et \u00e9valuer l'immeuble dont le titre n'est pas en question. Je ne vois d'autre montant en contestation, s'il peut y avoir contestation \u00e0 ce sujet, que le loyer d'un mois offert par l'action. Il n'y a non plus, au proc\u00e8s, aucune question concernant un titre \u00e0 des biens-fonds.\nJe maintiendrais la motion de l'intim\u00e9 et je casserais l'appel.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] Q.R. 31 K.B. 256.\n[2] Q.R. 31 K.B. 256.\n[3] [1890] 19 Can.

An order of the Governor General in Council passed in 1920, after reciting that under the Treaty Canada has the right to liquidate certain enemy property vested in the Custodian (appellant) but power is reserved to relinquish any of the same, which power should be exercised in respect to property of British born women who acquired German nationality by marriage only, provided that any such woman could apply to the Exchequer Court for a declaration as to what property formerly owned by her could be relinquished without rendering Canada liable to Germany under the treaty. Pursuant to this order the respective respondents applied to the Exchequer Court which declared that all their property could be relinquished as not constituting \"debts payable before the war\" or \"debts which became payable during the war\" within the terms of the treaty. On appeal from such declaration.\nHeld that deposits of money with the National Trust Co. for investment in securities, repayment of which was guaranteed on dates which fell during the war, are debts payable during the war within the meaning of the above provision of the Treaty and could not be relinquished.\nHeld also, Brodeur J. contra, that deposits in a Savings Bank and moneys invested with a Loan Co. to be withdrawn on notice and from the bank on presentment of the bank book also, are not \"debts\" it not being established that the right to such notice and presentment was abandoned.\nHeld, per Davies C. J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ., Brodeur J. contra, that moneys deposited with a trust company with instructions that all sums of capital and interest so received should be held by the company to the credit of the owner until further advice by her which was never given were not \"debts payable\" as provided by the Treaty.\nHeld, per Davies C. J. and Duff and Brodeur JJ., Anglin and Mignault JJ. contra, that dividends and interest from investments or securities which became payable during the war were \"debts.\"\nPer Duff J. The word \"debts\" should receive a broad construction and includes moneys held under a legal or equitable obligation to pay at any time on demand.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ. Interest on moneys placed with the National Trust Co. on guaranteed trust investment receipts is a \"debt.\"\nIdington J. did not deal with the specific claims presented but was of opinion that there was so much doubt in respect to them that the court should report to the Governor in Council that no relief could be granted at present to either claimant.\nDeclaration of the Exchequer Court (20 Ex.C.R. 219) approved in part.\nAPPEAL from the declaration of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], that none of the property rights and interests of the respective respondents vested in the appellant as custodian are \"debts payable\" under the terms of section 296 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany and all may be relinquished. The terms of the Treaty and of the Order in Council respecting the respondent's property are sufficiently indicated in the above head-note.\nChristopher C. Robinson for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In re Neitzke.\nAfter much consideration of the facts of this appeal from the Exchequer Court, I am of opinion that\n1. The deposits with the National Trust Co. are debts within Article 296;\n2. The deposit with the Central Canada Loan and Savings Co. is not a debt within the Article; and\n3. That the dividends and interest are debts within Article 296.\nI concur in the reasoning of Mr. Justice Anglin with respect to the first and second items, but I am unable to agree with him with respect to the item concerning dividends and interest.\nIn re Wiehmayer.\nI concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin that neither the deposits with the Bank of Toronto nor the Mary Prue Mara trust moneys are debts within the article 296, but I am unable to agree with him as regards the dividends and interest which I hold are debts within Article 296.\nIdington J.\u2014In each of these cases an appeal is presented from the judgment therein of Mr. Justice Cassels. It seems to me that if the final determination of either is to be undertaken it must turn, in the last analysis, upon the interpretation to be given article 296 of the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles June 28th, 1919, and certain subsidiary provisions of said Treaty.\nSaid article 296, by the introductory clause and four following paragraphs, reads as follows:\u2014\nThere shall be settled through the intervention of clearing offices to be established by each of the high contracting parties within three months of the notification referred to in paragraph (e) hereafter the following classes of pecuniary obligations:\n(1) Debts payable before the war and due by a national of one of the contracting powers, residing within its territory, to a national of an opposing power, residing within its territory;\n(2) Debts which became payable during the war to nationals of one contracting power residing within its territory, and arose out of transactions or contracts with the nationals of an opposing power, resident within its territory, of which the total or partial execution was suspended on account of the declaration of war;\n(3) Interest which has accrued due before and during the war to a national of one of the contracting powers in respect of securities issued by an opposing power, provided that the payment of interest on such securities to the nationals of that power or to neutrals has not been suspended during the war;\n(4) Capital sums which have become payable before and during the war to nationals of one of the contracting powers in respect of securities issued by one of the opposing powers, provided that the payment of such capital sums to nationals of that power or to neutrals has not been suspended during the war.\nIt is to be observed that neither was the Exchequer Court, nor are we, deciding any cause between the parties to the said Treaty.\nIt seems to have occurred to the appellant or the Government of Canada that under this provision certain cases of hardship were likely to arise; and by virtue of an order in council the possibility of a relinquishment to members of such class of persons was directed subject, however, to a reference to the Exchequer Court of Canada to declare the rights of such persons to so claim, and appellant to assent to the said relinquishment.\nThe\" Exchequer Court declared accordingly that each of the respective respondents in question is entitled to claim from appellant the relinquishment of her share of funds held by him as custodian.\nIt seems to me clear that the Exchequer Court must be acting in an advisory capacity and its judgment cannot be of any higher value than that may give it.\nI am in doubt how such a case can be brought by way of appeal here. It is not from a final judgment within the meaning of either the Supreme Court Act or the Exchequer Court Act. It is probably quite competent for the Crown to submit directly to us such a question as submitted to the Exchequer Court.\nAnd if, passing the doubt I have as to the said right of appeal under such very peculiar circumstances, I applied my mind as I have to the arguments addressed to us, and much else bearing upon the case, I regret to say I still remain, with great respect, in grave doubt as to the correctness of the opinion of the learned trial judge.\nI am quite unable to give the word \"debt\" in said article the narrow meaning in the sense contended for, as if restricted to what our common law courts might classify as such.\nIf I resort to dictionaries, such as Stroud, and Bouvier, I find it might reasonably be given in such a document as presented a much more extended meaning.\nCuriously enough, though sometimes driven by mere doubt to maintain a judgment of the court below which I cannot satisfy myself is clearly wrong, I feel impelled, in a mere advisory judgment such as this, to hold that the appellant is entitled to rest upon such doubt and to claim he is entitled to act thereon if such be the conclusion of the majority of the court. In truth, however, the more I consider the meaning of the word \"debt\" and the relevant words in the article 296 and the annex, the less reason I see for the restricted meaning applied below.\nSince writing the foregoing I find much difference of opinion in this court and that coupled with my own doubts as to the correctness of the opinion of Mr. Justice Cassels, leads me to the conclusion that the so-called appeals should be answered by submitting that amid so much doubt and difficulty the appellant cannot on the case presented act in such a way as to give either respondent any relief at present.\nIn re Weihmayer.\nDuff J.\u2014I am disposed to think that the opinion or judgment of Mr. Justice Cassels is not appealable to this court but as the questions submitted to him could be submitted directly to this court by an order in council, it seems to be proper that we should treat the appeal as in the nature of a submission and give such assistance as we can for the determination of the questions involved. I think the word \"debts\" in Art. 296 ought to receive a broad construction and I think it includes moneys held under a legal or equitable obligation to pay at any time on demand. On the other hand debts payable at a fixed date or at the expiration of notice are not, in the absence of such notice or prior to such date, within the terms of the article; and deposits in respect of which the depositee is entitled to require notice before payment are therefore not debts payable within those terms. In the result, dealing seriatim with the items in respect of which dispute arises:\u2014\n(a) The deposit in the Bank of Toronto does not fall within Art. 296. (b) As to the cash held by the National Trust Co. for the Mary Prue Mara trust and the proceeds of the mortgages I think that the memorandum of the 14th of October, 1914, although it does not in terms refer to these funds, indicates the terms upon which they were in fact held and that, applying the criterion above indicated, they fall within Art. 296.\n(c) Speaking generally, dividends and interest being moneys which somebody was under a legal obligation to pay, were, in my opinion, debts within the meaning of Arts. 296. As regards interest which became payable during the war whether by contract or by statute the legal obligation to pay was one of the legal incidents of the \"transaction\" or \"contract\" the execution of which in respect of such incident was suspended on account of the war. The phrase \"on account of the war\" expresses in my judgment the meaning of the words \"on account of the declaration of war.\" As respects dividends: The word \"transaction\" in my judgment is broad enough to embrace the acts or proceedings by which Mrs. Wiehmayer's right to the respective dividends in question became constituted and the obligation to pay dividends is under the criterion above indicated a debt within Art. 296.\nSome difficulty arises in respect of dividends and interest paid by Mr. McMurray into the Bank of Toronto account. I am disposed to think, not without a great deal of doubt, that as these moneys appear to have been thus dealt with by him with the authority of Mrs. Weihmayer, they must be held to stand in the same category as the other moneys in that account; and in consequence of the term of the deposit which entitled the bank to require notice before payment, they ought not to be considered to have constituted a debt \"payable\" within the meaning of the article. In re Neitzke.\nApplying the criterion mentioned in Mrs. Wiehmayer's case it follows: 1st, that the deposits with the National Trust Company are within Art. 296; 2nd, that the deposit with the Central Canada Company does not fall within Art. 296.\nAs to interest and dividends: Interest and dividends generally are to be considered within the article, but any sum representing such interest and dividends as may have been credited by the Central Canada Company to Mrs. Neitzke's deposit account under the terms mentioned in paragraph 13 of the case, is, I am disposed to think with a great deal of doubt, not to be considered as a debt payable within the article.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appeals in these two actions, which raise very similar questions, were argued together. By a special case stated in each the parties seek to have it determined whether certain property of the respondents, German subjects through marriage only, or any part of it is or is not of such a character that the Government of Canada may renounce claim to it without becoming accountable therefor to the Government of Germany. The answer depends primarily, if not entirely, on whether the several items of property in question were at the date of the Treaty of Peace with Germany (10th of January, 1920), \"debts (which had been) payable before the war\" or \"debts which became payable during the war\" within Art. 296 of that treaty, or were then not such debts but rather \"property rights (or) interests * * * belonging to German nationals\" within Art. 297. If they were the former they cannot be so relinquished; the treaty forbids it (Art. 296, pars. (a) and (b)); if the latter they may be abandoned to the respondents without accountability to Germany being incurred, the allied powers having merely \"reserve (d) the right\"\u2014not undertaken responsibility\u2014\"to retain and liquidate\" such property and give credit for its proceeds.\nIt seems abundantly clear that the liabilities to the respondents arose out of transactions of which the partial execution was suspended \"on account of the declaration of war.\" These latter words of clause (2) of Art. 296, in my opinion, clearly mean on account of the situation (i.e., the state of war) created by the declaration of war. That situation and the disabilities it entailed existed up to the 10th of January, 1920, \"on account of the declaration of war.\"\nThe heading of Art. 296 is \"Debts,\" which, if not misleading, can scarcely be termed definite or precise, (37 L.Q.R., p. 59). The article deals not with all pecuniary obligations but only with certain classes of them. In considering what pecuniary obligation it was intended to comprise within the category of debts it must first be observed that there are certain restrictions on the broad meaning of that word, viz.,\nthat which is owed or due; anything, as money, goods or service, which one person is under obligation to pay or render another; a sum of money or a material thing. Murray's Dict., vbo., Debt,\nimposed by the qualifying statements of the article that the debts dealt with are \"pecuniary obligations\" and that they must either have been \"payable before the war\" or have \"become payable during the war.\" In the French version the word \"payable\" is rendered as \"exigibles\" in par. No. 1 and as \"exigibles et dues\" in par. No. 2. The special mention made in clauses (3) and (4) of capital sums and interest payable \"in respect of securities issued by an opposing power\" is also significant. Such obligations are classed with \"debts\" due by the nationals of such power. The legitimate inference would seem to be that capital and interest payable in respect of private securities issued by such nationals, whether persons or corporations, were not meant to be within the purview of the article.\nThe Treaty does not declare by what law its terms are to be construed. Having regard to its international character, however, it should perhaps not be too readily assumed that merely because English municipal law differentiates between a debt and the obligation of a trustee to account that distinction should obtain in construing the word \"debts\" used in Art. 296. Yet when the nature of the relations of the cestui que trust and the trustee to trust property are carefully considered the distinction would not seem to depend upon considerations peculiar to English law but rather to be of universal application. The cestui que trust is not a mere creditor of his trustee in respect of trust moneys, but has a beneficial proprietary interest in them while in the trustee's hands. They are his moneys, not the trustee's. They are not exigible to satisfy a judgment for the claim of any other person who is a creditor of the trustee as they would be if the latter was merely a debtor for them to his cestui que trust\n\"Payable\" is a word susceptible of more than one shade of meaning; Massy v. Lloyd[2], at pages 267-8, per Westbury L.C. Counsel for the Crown in his factum, and again at bar took the position that a debt is \"payable\" only when it may be sued for without any previous demand or other act of the creditor\u2014 but not otherwise.\nNorth J. in In re Tidd[3], at page 156, quotes with approval the following passage from Evans' Commentary on Pothier, Vol. II, page 126:\nWhere a man deposits money in the hands of another to be kept for his use, the possession of the custodee ought to be deemed the possession of the owner until an application and refusal, or other denial of the right; for, until then, there is nothing adverse, and I conceive that, upon principle, no action should be allowed in this case without a previous demand; consequently, that no limitation should be computed further back than such demand.\nThe Wiehmayer Case.\nAssets of three descriptions are in question in this case:\n(1) Moneys of Mrs. Wiehmayer deposited in a savings bank account with the Bank of Toronto.\n(2) Mrs. Wiehmayer's share of cash held by a trustee company at the date of her mother's death and of moneys received by it as the proceeds of mortgage securities in its hands\u2014both covered by a trust of which Mrs. Wiehmayer and her sister, a British subject, were beneficiaries subject to a life interest in their mother.\n(3) Interest and dividends which became payable to Mrs. Wiehmayer while a state of war subsisted.\n(1) As a \"deposit * * * established before or after the declaration of war\" the money on deposit in the Bank of Toronto seems to be a \"cash asset\" within clause (h) (1) of Art. 297, as defined by section 11 of the annex to that article, rather than a \"debt\" within Art. 296. It was payable by the terms of the contract of deposit only on production of the bank book, and, if required by the bank, after fifteen days' notice. A demand for payment accompanied by production of the bank book and the fifteen days' notice, if exacted, were conditions precedent to a cause of action to recover it arising. Until these conditions were fulfilled, if a \"debt\" it was not \"payable.\" I cannot distinguish the case as to these moneys from Atkinson v. Bradford Third Equitable Society[4], and In re Tidd, supra[5].\nIt is true that the special case states tha\nit was not the practice of the bank in dealing with this account or with similar accounts to insist that requests for withdrawals were to be accompanied by the bank book.\nThere is no admission, however, that the bank had relinquished or abandoned its right to do so or to exact the notice and I am not prepared to draw that inference from the mere existence of the practice stated. There are no other circumstances before us pointing to an equitable right on the part of the respondent to rely on that practice as having established such an abandonment\u2014nothing to indicate that in suing to recover the amount to the credit of her savings account it would be unnecessary for the plaintiff to aver performance of the condition precedent as to presentation of the bank book or inequitable on the part of the bank to set up against her the express stipulations of its contract with her.\nAlthough counsel for the appellant expressly confined his appeal to such items as fall within Art. 296, it has been suggested in the course of the consideration of these cases that for all \"cash assets\" there is a like obligation to account through the clearing office, imposed by clause (h) of Art. 297 and sub-clause (1) thereof. The argument urged is that \"all cash assets in general\" are by clause (h) put in the same category with \"net proceeds of sales of enemy property\" which has been retained and liquidated, and that \"sub-clause (1), in the case of powers adopting section III (Art. 296) and the annex thereto, imperatively requires that such proceeds and \"cash assets\" shall alike be credited to the power of which the owner is a national, through the clearing office. But that construction would impose on the allied or associated powers the obligation to \"retain\" all cash assets within their territories belonging to German nationals, whereas such \"cash assets\" form part of the \"property, rights and interests,\" which the allied or associated powers by clause (b) merely reserved the right\u2014impliedly refused to assume any obligation\u2014\"to retain and liquidate.\" Clause (b) is, in my opinion, the dominant provision, and clause (h) and sub-clause (1) thereof must be read subject to it. The latter clauses therefore apply in the case of the Allied or associated powers only to \"cash assets\" in respect of which such powers shall have exercised their reserved right of retention.\nAs to item No. 1 the appeal in my opinion fails.\n(2) and (3). Because of the relations to them of the trustee and the cestui que trust above stated the trust funds covered by item No. 2 I also think cannot be regarded as \"debts\" and neither these moneys nor interest or revenues accruing from them, comprised in item No. 3, as I view them, \"became payable during the war\" to the plaintiff. While there is nothing in the terms of the trust instrument that would have precluded her calling upon her trustee to account to her at her mother's death for her share of the moneys covered by the trust then in its hands and afterwards for the other moneys included in the second item and for interest and revenues arising therefrom when and as they were received by it, a memorandum of instructions of the 14th October, 1914, that all sums, either of capital or income, received on the plaintiff's account by her trustee were to be retained by it to her credit until further advice by her, at least serves to negative the existence from that date forward of any arrangement or standing instructions that such moneys were to be remitted or paid over by the trustee on receipt, which might be tantamount to a demand. There was a further act to be done by the creditor in regard to all these moneys before a right of action to recover them from the trustee would have arisen. In my opinion they were not \"debts,\" which \"became payable during the war\" to the plaintiff.\nNeither are dividends \"debts\" within Art. 296. They are the share or interest of the stockholder' to whom they are payable in the distributable profits of the corporation and are his property quite as much as are the shares in the capital stock he holds. They are \"cash assets\" as defined by clause 11 of the Annex to Art. 297.\nThe appeal therefore also fails as to items (2) and (3).\nThe Neitzke Case.\nThere are also three distinct items involved in this appeal:\n(1) An amount deposited on the 4th of August, 1914, to the credit of the plaintiff in the Central Canada Loan and Savings Company;\n(2) Sums represented by two guaranteed trust investment receipts issued by the National Trust Company, Limited, to the plaintiff;\n(3) Interest and dividends which became payable between the 4th of August, 1914, and the 11th of January, 1920, on property, rights and interests of the plaintiff. (1) Item No. 1 seems to be in the same position as the corresponding item in the Wiehmayer case. The money was placed in a special deposit account bearing interest and was withdrawable only on 30 days' notice if required by the loan and savings company. This would appear to be a \"deposit established before or after the declaration of war\" within the purview of clause 11 of the annex, and therefore a \"cash asset\" within Art. 297 (h) (1). No abandonment of the right to exact the 30 days' notice is alleged or shewn.\nInterest which accrued due on these moneys as \"assets coming from a deposit\" (Annex, cl. No. 11), covered by item No. 3, would be subject to the same disposition as the principal.\n(2) The substance of the transactions between the plaintiff and the National Trust Company must be considered rather than the name given them by the company\u2014\"Guaranteed Trust Investments.\" When the trust company received each of the two sums from the plaintiff it gave her an absolute undertaking to repay the principal at the end of five years and to pay her interest thereon in the meantime half-yearly at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent per annum. The dates for payment of the principal and interest as well as the rate of the latter were fixed quite independently of the terms of any security in which the moneys might be invested by the company. The only liability to the plaintiff was that of the company. Her sole recourse was against it. No specific security was allotted to her investment or in any manner ear-marked as one on which she should have an exclusive claim. Her only right, apart from that of enforcing payment by the trust company according to the terms of the receipts given her, would be to require the company at all times before repayment of the principal to hold allocated to such \"trust investments\" of the plaintiff and others in like plight an amount of securities of face value equal to the total amount of moneys received by it upon similar terms. Of the sufficiency of such securities, however, the company was the sole judge. In the event of its making default in payment and going into liquidation there would, no doubt, be a mass of its securities on which all customers from whom it had obtained money on terms similar to those arranged with the plaintiff would alike have liens entitling them to share pari passu in their proceeds up to the amount of the company's liability to each of them respectively. But at no time was there any part of that mass of securities held by the company which was hers. Her sole recourse, so long as the company remained solvent, was to look to it for payment of the amount advanced by her with interest thereon at the rate stipulated in the receipt given her, and in the event of insolvency or liquidation to rank for that amount as a secured creditor upon the fund represented by the securities that had been allocated by the company to its \"trust investments\" of the class to which hers belonged.\nIn substance these transactions, in my opinion, were not deposits of money by the plaintiff in trust for investment by the company on her account but loans to the company of the amounts handed over by her to it, of which payment was to be collaterally secured by Kens, held in common with other lenders in like plight as above stated, on certain assets of the company set aside for that purpose. The plaintiff was a lender and as such a creditor; the company a borrower and as such a debtor\u2014 and the sole debtor\u2014of the plaintiff. Both the principal and the interest are \"debts\" of the company to the plaintiff which \"became payable during the war\" and as such, I think, fall within Art. 296 of the Peace Treaty. (3) The position of any dividends to which the plaintiff became entitled is the same as that of the dividends in the Wiehmayer case. Interest on investments or securities, other than the money lent to the National Trust Company and that on deposit with the Central Canada Savings Co., which have already been dealt with, would seem to be \"cash assets\" within the definition of that term in the annex to Art. 297.\n\u2014\u2014\nI have assumed that we have jurisdiction to entertain these appeals from the opinion expressed by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court under the jurisdiction conferred upon that court by section 1 (i) of c. 14, 10 Geo. V. In the result the opinion expressed by the learned judge in the Wiehmayer case should in my opinion be confirmed; that expressed in the Neitzke case should also be confirmed except as to the moneys received by the National Trust Company on \"guaranteed investment receipts\" and interest accrued thereon.\nBrodeur J.\u2014As these two appeals have been argued together and as they raise practically the same issues, they might be both decided at the same time.\nThese actions have been instituted by two women who were of British nationality by birth and who married men of German nationality before the war and went to reside in Germany. They had money invested in Canada and their Canadian properties and rights were, by order of the court, vested in the Minister of Finance under the provisions of the consolidated orders respecting trading with the enemies, 1916.\nBy the Treaty of Peace order of 1920 all the properties and rights vested in the Minister of Finance were transferred to the Secretary of State of Canada, the appellant, as custodian. Now the respondents claim by their action that their property, rights and interest, which they possess in some investments, be returned by the appellant to them and that it be declared that these investments should not be considered as falling under the provisions of Article 296 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany.\nThe Secretary of State is willing to relinquish these properties and hand them to their former owners provided such relinquishment shall not be contrary to certain provisions of the Treaty which require that the payment of certain debts should be made through a clearing office to Germany itself and not to the original owners thereof.\nWe have then in that respect to construe the provisions of Article 296 of the Treaty which determines how certain debts due by a national of one contracting power to a national of an opposite power shall be settled. The question submitted in this case is whether the word \"debts\" of this article 296 would include the investments which the respondents possessed in Canada.\nThese investments are of three classes:\nFirst, the investments made in the Canadian trust companies and represented by \"guaranteed trust investment receipts;\" secondly, the deposits in loan and savings companies, or in banks in their savings account; thirdly, interest and dividends which became due or were paid during the war.\nThere is also in the case of Mrs. Wiehmayer a trust investment under special agreements which will have to be dealt with. I.\nGuaranteed Trust Investments.\nThis is an agreement by which sums of money are received by a trust company for investment for the repayment of which this trust company becomes liable. The trust company then invests the money in its own name and no specific mortgage is allocated to the trust investment receipts but the mortgages representing the total amounts invested by the trust company are simply set apart and are held in a special account.\nWe are not much concerned as to the manner in which the trust company manages or invests the funds which its clients put in its hands for investment. We have in the agreement or receipt an obligation to pay or reimburse the amount which has been put in its hands. There is established then between the investor and the trust company the relation of debtor and creditor and the investor has a right to claim from the company the reimbursement of his money. It becomes an ordinary pecuniary obligation.\nWhat is a pecuniary obligation? It is a personal engagement which gives to the person in whose favour it is contracted the right to claim a sum of money. It is a vinculum juris which obliges a person to give some money to another.\nI am of opinion that under the Treaty these trust investments should be paid through the clearing house and that the custodian, the Secretary of State, should not pay these pecuniary obligations to the respondent. Deposits in Savings Banks in Loan Companies.\nThese deposits are generally made with the condition that the money will be paid after certain days' notice or when the bank book is presented. As a matter of practice, however, the amounts so deposited are reimbursed without requiring that notice or the presentation of the book.\nIt seems to me that any deposit in a bank constitutes a pecuniary debt by the bank from the moment of the deposit; Pott v. Clegg[6]. The respondent relies on the case of Atkinson v. The Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society, (2), where it was decided by the Court of Appeal in England that the condition that the sum should be repayable after the lender had given notice of his intention to withdraw it and that no money would be payable except on presentation of a pass book; that the condition as to the production of the book was a condition precedent and that until it was produced, the Statute of Limitations did not begin to run against the lender. But the Atkinson Case[7], has reference only to the operation of the Statute of Limitations.\nThe Treaty is in more general words and of more general application than the Statute of Limitations referred to in the Atkinson Case7. According to my view, those deposits constitute debts which under section 296 of the Treaty would have to pass through the clearing house.\nI have stated before in discussing the guaranteed trust investments what is the essence of a pecuniary obligation. Nobody can say that there was not an obligation on the part of the banks, of the loan companies or of the others to pay a certain sum of money. That money could, in some cases, be claimed before the war and if it was not demanded that is not a reason to say that there was no debt. As to the money which became due during the war, if it was not claimed, that was due to the declaration of war. In each case, these debts constitute the pecuniary obligations mentioned in Art. 296 of the Treaty.\nDividends and Interest.\nAs to the dividends and interest, they were certainly debts which became payable during the war and they arose out of agreements entered into before the war and the payment of the interest contracted for or the dividends which might have been declared was suspended on account of the declaration of the war.\nThere is besides in paragraph 22 of the annex to article 296 a formal reference as to interest which shews that capital and interest should be considered as one.\nTrust Investment Wiehmayer Case.\nBy a certain agreement, the National Trust Company held certain mortgages in trust to pay the income to Mary Prou Mara during her life and after her death part to the respondent and part to her sister in equal shares. Upon the death of Mary Prou Mara in June, 1913, the National Trust Company became obliged to divide between the respondent and her sister the capital held by it under this agreement.\nThe question is whether that sum became a debt payable and should be considered as such under the Treaty.\nThe trust company was not forced during the war to pay to the respondent her share of the capital, but I fail to see how these sums could not be considered as a debt.\nI am of opinion that the judgment a quo should be reversed. In re Neitzke.\nMignault J.\u2014The question under this appeal is whether certain rights or claims of the respondent, as being \"debts\" within the meaning of article 296 of the Treaty of Peace signed at Versailles, on the 28th June, 1919, between the allied and associated powers and Germany, are subject to the provisions of the said article. Article 296 is among the economic clauses of the Treaty and, as far as material to the present inquiry, provides as follows:\u2014\nThere shall be settled through the intervention of clearing offices to be established by each of the high contracting parties within three months of the notification referred to in paragraph (e) hereafter the following classes of pecuniary obligations:\n(1) Debts payable before the war and due by a national of one of the contracting powers, residing within its territory, to a national of an opposing power, residing within its territory;\n(2) Debts which became payable during the war to nationals of one contracting power residing within its territory and arose out of transactions or contracts with the nationals of an opposing power, residing within its territory, of which the total or partial execution was suspended on account of the declaration of war.\nParagraphs (3) and (4) are immaterial on this appeal.\nThis question was submitted to the Exchequer Court by means of a special case under rule 160. The respondent succeeded as to all the items mentioned in the schedule annexed to the case, and the appellant now asks this court to reverse the judgment of the court below as to three of these items, viz.:\u2014\n(a) The sums represented by the two guaranteed trust investment receipts issued by National Trust Company, Limited, to the respondent;\n(b) The amount on deposit on the 4th of August, 1914, to the credit of the respondent in the Central Canada Loan and Savings Company; and (c) The interest and dividends which became payable between the 4th of August, 1914, and the 11th of January, 1920, on the property, rights and interests of the respondent.\nThe appellant seeks also to have it held that, if these items fall under Article 296, Canada is or may be liable to Germany for or in respect of such of them as are relinquished to the respondent.\nThe answer to be given depends on the construction of Article 296 of the Peace Treaty, which must be read in connection with the two following articles.\nIn arriving at this construction, a broad distinction must be made between \"debts\" referred to in Article 296 of the Treaty of Peace and \"property, rights and interests\" which are the subject of Articles 297 and 298. The latter expressions are wide enough to comprise any kind of \"debts,\" and the word \"debts\" lato sensu would include any species of claim whether for money or other property to which one person is entitled as against any other. It is noticeable, however, that the \"debts\" referred to in Article 296 are stated to be certain classes of \"pecuniary obligations,\" so that nothing which cannot be described as a pecuniary obligation can come within the meaning of the word \"debts\" as used in Article 296.\n\"Cash assets\" are included among the \"property, rights and interests\" of Article 297 and are expressly mentioned in paragraph (h) of that article. In the annex to Articles 297 and 298, they are defined, by paragraph 11, as including all deposits or funds established before or after the declaration of war, as well as all assets coming from deposits, revenues, or profits collected by administrators, sequestrators, or others from funds placed on deposit or otherwise, but not to include sums belonging to the allied or associated powers or their component states, provinces, or municipalities. I must confess that the reference to \"cash assets\" in Article 297, and in the annex to Articles 297 and 298, is more confusing than helpful. This is especially so when the different provisions of Article 297 are carefully studied. As the parties presented their case, the question was whether the property in question fell within the provisions of Article 296, paragraphs 1 and 2. Still it is impossible to overlook Article 297, and, as I have said, its reference to cash assets is confusing. Thus paragraph (h), subparagraph (1), seems to require that in general all cash assets of enemies, as regards powers adopting article 296, shall be credited to the power of which the owner is a national, through the clearing office established under the latter article. But the collocation of the expression \"cash assets\" with the words \"the net proceeds of sales of enemy property\" sufficiently shows that what was intended was that where, under paragraph (b) of article 297, an allied or associated power has elected to retain and liquidate property, rights and interests (which would include \"cash assets\") belonging to German nationals, the proceeds of such liquidation and all cash assets, as regards powers adopting article 296, shall be credited to Germany through the clearing house, any credit balance being applicable to the payment of Germany's reparation obligations under article 243. If an allied and associated power has not elected to retain and liquidate the property) rights and interests of German nationals, and Canada has not done so with respect to British born wives of German nationals, the only question is whether the property to be dealt with is or is not a \"debt\" within the meaning of article 296. I can now deal with the amounts claimed by the respondent in order to determine whether they should be considered as being \"debts,\" or, I may say in contradistinction thereto, \"cash assets,\" which term has now been sufficiently explained. And it seems entirely proper to distinguish moneys in hand or moneys recovered and deposited for safe keeping from moneys due under a pecuniary obligation, whether such obligation be created for investment purposes or otherwise. It is in the latter sense that I construe the word \"debts.\"\nArticle 296 refers to debts payable before the war or during the war. Does this mean debts for which an action would lie without any previous demand? This seems to be the construction which the appellant places on the word \"payable,\" for in his factum he says:\nIt is further submitted that a debt \"became payable\" before or during the war within the meaning of these paragraphs if at any time before or (but for the war) during the war it could have been sued for without any previous demand or other act by the creditor.\nI cannot agree with this construction, for it seems inconceivable that the negotiators of the Treaty were concerned with the question whether a debt was suable without demand or only after a previous notice to the debtor. What seems entirely likely is that the debts with which they intended to deal were those of which the payment had been prevented by the war, and this payment was prevented in case of all debts between belligerents, irrespective of the question whether or not a previous demand was necessary. In my opinion, all moneys due under a pecuniary obligation of which the war prevented the payment, and which therefore had not, on that account, been recovered, are debts within the meaning of Article 296. Applying therefore Article 296 to the items which are the subject of this appeal, my opinion is that:\u2014\nA. The sums represented by the two guaranteed trust receipts issued to the respondent by the National Trust Company, Limited, are \"debts\" within the meaning of Article 296. The moneys received from the respondent under these receipts, to wit, $11,000.00 and $2,000.00, were to be invested by the Trust Company in securities taken in its name, the surplus of interest over five per cent to be retained by the company for its own benefit, and the company guaranteed the payment of the principal money, in the case of the $11,000.00, on the 1st of January, 1917, and, in the case of the $2,000.00, on the 2nd of January, 1919. Both these days fell \"during the war.\" See the construction of these words in the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, section 2, subsection (c). In my opinion, were it necessary to so hold, the capital sums for which these receipts were given were payable and suable without any previous demand, but it will suffice to say that they were debts of which the payment was prevented by the war and therefore they come within Article 296.\nB. The amount on deposit on the 4th August, 1914, to the credit of the respondent in the Central Canada Loan and Savings Company was not a debt payable before the war within the meaning of Article 296. This amount was deposited in a savings bank account and the form of the question shews that at the time of the declaration of war no order for its payment had been given by the respondent. It would further come within the expression \"cash assets\" as used in Article 297. The want of a demand of payment here is important only as shewing that at the date of the declaration of war there was merely an existing savings account in favour of the respondent on which, as to the sum then standing to her credit, no cheque had been issued by her.\nC. In so far only as this item comprises interest or dividends on item A, I would think it would fall under Article 296 of the Treaty, being an accessory of the capital sums of $11,000.00 and $2,000.00 represented by the National Trust Company's guaranteed trust investment receipts.\nThe appeal also raises the question whether, if any of the said items do fall within Article 296, Canada is or may be liable to Germany for and in respect of such of them as are relinquished to the respondent.\nI would answer in the affirmative. Article 296 renders it compulsory to settle through the intervention of clearing houses the classes of pecuniary obligations mentioned therein. Should Canada relinquish to the respondent any debts which come under the operation of Art. 296, it would undoubtedly incur liability towards Germany for the debts so relinquished.\nI would therefore allow the appeal to the extent of declaring that the capital sums of $11,000.00 and $2,000.00 represented by the guaranteed trust investment receipts of the National Trust Company, Limited, as well as all interest or dividends thereon accrued, are \"debts\" within the meaning of Article 296 of the Treaty.\nIn re Wiehmayer.\nInasmuch as in the case of The Secretary of State v. Neitzke I have explained what construction should be placed on Articles 296 and 297 of the Treaty of Peace between the allied and associated powers and Germany, it will suffice to say that, in my opinion, none of the items which the appellant claims are \"debts\" within the meaning of Article 296, or should be so considered.\nAs a consequence the appeal should be dismissed.\nAdjudged accordingly.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Christopher C.

The contract then provided that B. would completely lumber the property and deliver all the lumber to McK. at a price to be settled or, in default of agreement, on consignment for sale on the customary commissions. B. eventually paid all the advances and demanded a reconveyance from appellant (McK. having died) which was refused on the ground that all the lumber had not been cut and delivered. In an action for an order directing the appellants to reconvey and for damages B. tendered evidence of a representation made by McK. when the agreement was presented and he objected to the requirement to cut all the lumber that the meaning of it was that McK. would hold the lumber until paid all the advances with interest; that B. could not sell any until enough was cut to pay him off. The evidence was admitted and the trial judge, accepting it as true, gave judgment for a reconveyance and damages to be assessed. On appeal from the Court en banc affirming his decision.\nHeld, per Davies C. J. and Idington J., that the evidence was admissible and sufficiently corroborated by the provisions of the document. Per Idington J. The document was a mortgage with the usual right of redemption and respondents were entitled to succeed without this evidence.\nPer Duff J. Parol evidence is always admissible when its object is to show that the transaction is one of loan and that the conveyance though absolute in form is intended to be security only.\nPer Anglin J. The contract was not ambiguous and the evidence not admissible for the reason that it needed explanation. But it could be received to support a claim for reformation or a plea of estoppel based on misrepresentation innocent or fraudulent. The corroboration relied on below was too slight to satisfy the provision of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act but the admission by the appellants that for the purposes of the action they should be deemed to be in the same position as if McK. was alive and was the defendant obviated the necessity for any corroboration.\nPer Mignault J. Two courts having received and believed the evidence of B. and held that there was sufficient corroboration of it, the decision appealed against should stand.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondents.\nThe material facts are set out in the above head-note.\nF.

Taylor K.C. and Jenks K.C. for the appellants.\nHenry K.C. for the respondents The Chief Justice.\u2014I think this appeal fails and should be dismissed. The action was one brought by Black against the heirs and representatives of the late George McKean in which the plaintiff claimed a reconveyance to him of a certain lumber property which he had conveyed and assigned to McKean as security, as he contended, for certain advances then and afterwards to be made to him and certain guarantees to be given on his behalf to enable him to complete his purchase of the property and to enable him further to carry on his lumbering operations, and which advances had all been repaid. The defence was practically a denial that the plaintiff had carried out the obligations imposed upon him by the agreement in other respects than the repayment of the moneys advanced or guaranteed and which it was essential he should carry out before he was entitled to the reconveyance claimed. The repayment of all advances and interest which McKean had made to Black or guaranteed for him, was not challenged or denied, but it was claimed that it was a condition and a term of the agreement that before Black could claim a reconveyance of the property he was obliged completely to lumber the property and to cut, saw and manufacture and deliver to McKean all the lumber on aid property at a price to be agreed upon, or that said lumber should be shipped on terms in paragraph one (1) of the agreement stated. It was agreed that this had not been done and Black's contention was that it was not obligatory on him to do this, once he had paid McKean all advances made by him with interest and discharged him from all guarantees and liabilities he had incurred in this respect by the agreement. Apart from the legal construction of the agreement itself, a question arose as to the statement said to have been made by McKean to Black as to the meaning of the agreement, which statement Black swore was what induced him to sign the agreement. This evidence is as follows:\u2014\n(Charles O. Black, Direct Examination).\nAfter we had bargained, Mr. McKean, the young man, went out and got that agreement drawn up by a lawyer; I had no lawyer, and I am not one myself, and have a limited education; there was a clause where it said we hold all the lumber on this property estimated at thirty million; I said there might not be thirty million on the property, in fact, I know there is not; it is only an estimate, and I might not be able to cut all that lumber, and it is a bad thing for me to sign things like that. He said, \"the meaning and intention of this agreement is that we hold all the lumber on this property? until we are paid off all our advances with interest; that means to say, you can't sell any lumber off this property until you cut enough to pay us all off, because if you did we would not have security, and that is what the agreement means.\" I said, \"if that is what it means, all right.\" That is what I thought it was, but now it seems it is interpreted they hold it all after it is paid off; he said the meaning and intention of the agreement was that.\nQ. You then signed the agreement? A. Yes, with young McKean.\nQ. On the understanding you had with Mr. George McKean, as you have just told us about? A. Yes.\nThe learned trial judge accepted this statement of fact as proved, and also held that there was sufficient corroboration of it and the question for our consideration is whether the statement was admissible as evidence, and if so, whether McKean being then dead there was sufficient corroboration under the statute and what effect, if any, was to be given to it.\nI am of the opinion that the learned trial judge was right in holding that the agreement in question was an ambiguous one the real meaning of which, considering the apparently conflicting clauses of it, was most difficult to determine. I must say I myself have found it so and agree fully with the learned trial judge as to its ambiguity. I think the evidence was properly admitted and that there was sufficient corroboration of it under the statute.\nIn my judgment the agreement in question was in reality a mortgage intended to secure to McKean all moneys advanced or guaranteed by him together with interest and charges and as these were conceded to have been fully repaid to McKean when the action was commenced and he was discharged from all liability in respect of them, the equity of redemption of Black in the property was complete and entitled Black to the reconveyance claimed.\nOnce the evidence of McKean's statement, as to the meaning and intent of the agreement before set out, is accepted, and that such meaning and intent were indeed the inducements which led Black to sign it, the controversy would be at an end and Black's claim to a reconveyance would, in my opinion, be complete.\nI accept fully the findings of the trial judge confirmed by the majority of the court on appeal on this point, and think that it is a reasonable construction of the agreement that all its other provisions relating to the cutting of the limber on the land were at an end when McKean's advances and guarantees were fully paid and discharged In other words, I hold that the statement of McKean as to the intent and meaning of the agreement and which formed the inducement on which Black signed it, was a correct statement and was accepted by the parties as such. If and when Black paid off all advances and interest and discharged McKean from his guarantees, he became at once entitled to a reconveyance. The other provisions of the contract as to the cutting of the lumber by Black and handing it over to McKean for sale on a commission were, in my judgment, intended to be in force only while McKean's advances to Black, or his guarantees to the bank for Black, or some part of them, were still outstanding, and were intended as securities to McKean as against such liability and guarantees.\nSection six (6) of the agreement provides for a condition which never arose, namely: Black \"desiring to sell the property free from the agreement,\" and need not now be considered.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The late Charles O. Black, engaged in the lumber business and, as the learned trial judge finds, in course thereof bought from the Nova Scotia Lumber Company a large property for $40,000, of which all had been paid but $5,000. Having met with some business reverses he needed help in order to pay that and raise $18,000 to carry on his lumbering business on said property.\nThe late George McKean agreed to go his surety to the Bank of Montreal for such amount as thus needed.\nThe Nova Scotia Lumber Company had given Black a bond to convey the said land upon the payment of the price and that was indorsed over, as Black expresses it, to the late George McKean at the time of entering into the agreement presently to be referred to. By virtue thereof the said company, three months later, conveyed the land to said McKean. Under the circumstances an ordinary form of mortgage might have easily been framed to express all that the parties intended, but, instead thereof, an agreement was entered into between said Black and said McKean (whom I shall hereinafter call the mortgagor and mortgagee respectively) drawn up by the latter's solicitor, dated 29th January, 1914, which recited the facts that the mortgagee had agreed to guarantee\na certain advance to be made by the Bank of Montreal to the said party of the first part, and has also agreed to arrange for further advances to the said party of the first part during the lumbering season of 1914,\nand also had entered into an agreement to purchase certain lumber from the said mortgagor, and, as security, said mortgagor had agreed to assign the said agreement for purchase of the said land to said mortgagee.\nThen the operative part of the agreement contained a half dozen covenants such as might have been inserted in an ordinary mortgage had the parties taken that method of carrying out their arrangement.\nIf we have regard to what the parties were about these several instruments must be read together, and so read, the transaction was nothing more nor less than a mortgage accompanied by these covenants to secure the mortgagee against loss and incidentally get the profits to be derived from handling the mortgagor's entire lumber from timber on said land, until the advances and six per cent per annum thereon had been repaid.\nThat product for a year would seem to have been likely to be about three million feet of lumber.\nFrom the expressions in the agreement the term of the year 1914 would seem to be all that was in the minds of the parties. The first paragraph provided for the said mortgagor completely lumbering the property and selling the lumber to the mortgagee at such prices as they might agree on, or commission named.\nThe second provided that no other lumber should be cut on the premises nor should any cut there be sold to any one else than the mortgagee, his assigns or representatives.\nThese provisions the appellants contend entitle them as the successors in title of the mortgagee (who died in 1915) to hold the property free from the redemption by the said mortgagor who instituted this suit for the redemption of said mortgage.\nThis contention I will presently consider, after stating the substance of the other paragraphs.\nThe third paragraph was for quiet enjoyment and will be set forth later in full.\nThe fourth paragraph provided for the payment by the said mortgagor to the mortgagee of\nall loss or damage which may be caused to the said timber lands, lumber or property by fire or other casualty, and will hold the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators and assigns, harmless and indemnified therefrom.\nThe fifth bound the mortgagor to pay all rates and assessments on the property.\nThe sixth provided for the case of the mortgagor wishing to sell the property doing so on the terms of paying fifty cents a thousand on a basis of there being thiry million feet thereon.\nThese were followed by the following power of sale given McKean:\u2014\nProvided always and it is hereby agreed, that on default in the repayment of the sums so guaranteed by the said party of the second part and all other sums that hereafter may be guaranteed by the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, and all expenses, charges, costs, rates, taxes and assessments with interest at six per cent as aforesaid on the said property or any portion thereof, or the said lumber thereon, or any portion thereof, or in case of the loss or destruction of said property or any portion thereof or the lumber thereon or any portion thereof, by fire or other casualty, or in case of the breach by the party of the first part, his heirs, executors or administrators of any of the covenants or agreements herein contained it shall be lawful for the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, either by public auction or private sale to sell and convey the said property hereinbefore referred to or any portion thereof and either in one block or in separate parcels as he or they may deem fit, and upon such terms as he or they in their discretion may deem advisable after giving notice to the said party of the first part of such sale by mailing at least seven days prior thereto at some post office in the province of New Brunswick by registered mail addressed \"C. O. Black, Oxford, N.S.\" written notice of the time and place of such sale and no other or further notice or demand shall be necessary, and such notice shall be effectual whether the said Charles O. Black be living or dead; and the proceeds of such sale or sales the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, shall apply in the first place to the expenses of such sale or sales and necessary conveyances, and, secondly, so far as they will go to or towards the repayment to the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, of any sums that he may have paid or be liable for under said guarantee or may have advanced hereunder, together with interest, expenses, costs, charges, rates, assessments, moneys paid on account of rates, taxes and impositions or such portion thereof as may remain unpaid; and thirdly, to or towards any sums otherwise accruing due by the said party of the first part or his aforesaid to the said party of the second part, and shall pay the balance, if any, to the party of the first part, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and that all contracts which shall be entered into, and all conveyances which shall be executed by the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, for the purpose of effecting any such sale or sales shall be valid and effectual notwithstanding that the party of the first part, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, shall not join therein or assent thereto, and that it shall not be incumbent on the respective purchasers of said lands, property or premises or\" any part thereof, to ascertain or inquire whether such notice of sale shall have been given or to see to the application of the proceeds thereof.\nThis certainly (in the third part regarding the application of such proceeds of sale) does not countenance anything like the contentions of the present appellants. It should have provided expressly tor that fifty cents a thousand or for the commissions provided for in foregoing or something like thereunto, if the contentions set up are sound.\nIn the argument much was said by counsel for appellants about this agreement being unambiguous and not ambiguous as suggested by some of those dealing with it in the courts below.\nIt is contended that the language is plain and express.\nSo I answer is the third paragraph of the agreement, which reads as follows:\u2014\n3. That the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, shall quietly and peaceably enjoy the said property and the said timber and lumber, and that the same are free from incumbrances.\nIf the sort of argument applied to paragraphs 1 and 2 is valid, why not rely on this one and simplify the whole business by setting up that least ambiguous of all.\nThereby the appellants are entitled to enjoy forever, as there is no limit of time named, the land in question.\nOf course the answer thereto is that such was not within the contemplation of the parties.\nThe question thus raised as to the first and second paragraphs is whether the remarkable contentions set up by the appellants can be imagined as within the like contemplation of the parties when due regard is had to the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the mortgagor and much more so of the appellants in later years.\nI think the intention was made quite clear by the first part of the recital as quoted above that the mortgage was simply to indemnify the mortgagee for his suretyship for the contemplated advances by the bank. No doubt the parties intended that the mortgagee, as part of the inducement to him to become surety, was to get the benefit to be derived from handling the lumber produced so long as the advances made within the scope of said recital or interest thereon remained unpaid.\nBut I cannot imagine such a proposition as appellants contended for, that the advantages so implied during that period were to extend for ten years or more, being the length of time probably required to complete the lumbering.\nIt is not only inconsistent with the recital but also with the terms of the power of sale, and with the correlative right of redemption which the mortgagor would have the moment the condition came into existence, which would render the power of sale capable of operation.\nThe curiosities presented in the document shewing others like to the first two giving rise to these contentions of the appellants, do not end there or in the covenant number three, above quoted, for the pith of the fourth covenant, above quoted in part, provides, not for the protection of the mortgagee against his loss by reason of any fire, but for the payment to him\nof the damage which may be caused to the said timber lands.\nIn as plain, unambiguous language as appellants claim for these other covenants in question the mortgagee would hereunder be entitled to claim the whole value of the timber destroyed by fire.\nOf course no one ever imagined that such was the intention of the parties, but such is its literal meaning and we are left to guess what could be claimed under this covenant. There is much to be said in favour of all these covenants presenting curiosities demonstrating such an inconsistency with the right of redemption as to render them null and void within many cases to be found when mortgagees had attempted to bar or render impossible the right of redemption.\nI mean, of course, on the assumption that the results appellants claim are the true meaning thereof, interpreting and construing, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, as I do, that these first two covenants were only to be operative during the existence of the indebtedness for or in; respect of the advances contemplated and then to cease. Though they are no models of accurate draftmanship, they are consistent with the creation of a mortgage and only a mortgage as being all that was intended by those concerned.\nIn the sense contended for by appellants they might be such as might be found in a partnership agreement but are hardly consistent with being part of a mortgage.\nEvidently the explanation given the mortgagor, (who never met the solicitor who drew this document) who asked the mortgagee its meaning before its execution, and was told by him what he swore to and the learned trial judge believed, did not need much corroboration, if any needed in such a case.\nMoreover the maxim relied upon in respondents' factum\u2014Verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem\u2014may, under such circumstances, be borne in mind.\nThe chances are, I suspect, that if the mortgagee had survived no one would have heard him set up such contention as appellants make. The unfortunate slips so evidently the result of haste in preparation of the document are cogent warnings against taking those now in question as literally correct.\nParts of any document, and especially one so prepared, may have in it sentences and covenants clear and unambiguous if taken alone, yet be most ambiguous when read in light of surrounding circumstances clearly demonstrating its real purpose.\nThen as to the appellants, and relative thereto, it is to be borne in mind that their own conduct, as set forth in correspondence and accounts against them, is quite inconsistent with such claims as they set up.\nIn regard thereto I think the following passage in Fisher on Mortgages (Can. Ed.) relative to the analogous subject of mortgage or no mortgage, to be found in the 14th paragraph of that work, is worth quoting as a guide herein as against appellants' contention for what, I submit, is a claim for partnership.\n14. And while the courts protect a bona fide purchaser, and will not lightly infer an intention to make a mere security, if none be expressed they will give effect to an intention, if proved, to create a security, and will also take care that a borrower shall not suffer from the omission by fraud, mistake, or accident, of the usual requisites of a mortgage.\nAn instrument which purports to be an absolute conveyance, may therefore be construed as a mortgage, where, according to the true intention of the parties, it was intended to be regarded as a mortgage.\nIn conclusion I take the conduct of the mortgagor and mortgagee, the nature of the business they had in hand and the fact that by the hypothecation of the product of the lumber to the bank by the mortgagor with the knowledge and assent of the mortgagee to secure payment of the advances by the bank, to be cogent evidence of the transaction being a redeemable mortgage and not a partnership, or something akin thereto. And the conduct of appellants in relation thereto after the death of the mortgagor, renders it clear that respondents are entitled to succeed quite independently of the evidence of the mortgagor of what the mortgagee told him.\nBut I do not doubt that such evidence may well be received on the basis of what transpired being used in regard to the right of redemption denied by the appellants on the strength of a most ambiguous provision, if room for the contentions set up, and that there is abundant corroboration in the other provisions of the document.\nSuppose the case of a mortgagor bound by the terms of his mortgage to insure, having assigned his policy to the mortgagee by an instrument that was absolute in orm and expressed as made for due consideration, but nothing else disclosing the actual consideration, and the insurers saw fit to pay what became due thereon, as result of fire, to such assignee next day after all the money due on the mortgage had been paid, and he died immediately after the receipt of such insurance money, how much and what kind of corroboration would be needed for the mortgagor to establish his rights to recover same from the representatives if the innocent mortgagee's representatives chose to insist as appellants do that the mortgagor's version of his rights must be corroborated?\nI submit the surrounding facts and circumstances might suffice as they ought to do herein.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed. Parol evidence is, I think, admissible in all cases where the question arises whether a covenant absolute in form is intended as security and whether the real transaction is or is not a transaction of loan, that is to say, whether the property was to stand as security for the repayment of money advanced. The trial judge had held that such was the nature of this transaction and that according to the true intent of the parties the provisions of the agreement notwithstanding their form were intended to stand as security for the repayment of money advanced or to be advanced. I have discovered no satisfactory ground upon which that finding could be reversed.\nAnglin J.\u2014Not, I confess, without some lingering doubt, I concur in the conclusion of the learned trial judge affirmed by the majority of the learned judges of the Nova Scotia Appellate Court as to the nature and scope of the agreement between the late Charles Black and the late George McKean; but the award of damages to the plaintiff for the defendants' refusal to reconvey the land in question I think cannot be upheld.\nThis is not the comparatively familiar case of a defendant maintaining that a deed of conveyance in form absolute truly represents the transaction it purports to evidence against the plaintiff's assertion that it was intended to be held merely as security and is therefore in reality a mortgage. That the transfer to the late George McKean of the property in question was merely as security is common ground. The controversy between the parties is rather as to what it was given to secure\u2014whether merely repayment of advances made by McKean with interest, as the plaintiffs assert, or also performance of an agreement, which the defendants maintain that the plaintiffs' testator, the late Charles Black, made, to lumber the property completely and either to sell and deliver the entire product to McKean at prices to be agreed upon, or, if such agreement should not be reached, to ship such product to him on consignment and commission at stated rates. The parties also differ as to the extent and duration of the right conferred on McKean to handle the lumber produced by Black from the property. The plaintiffs maintain that that right was given merely as security for the repayment of McKean's advances and interest and was to terminate upon such repayment being completed. The defendants insist that it was absolute, that it formed the inducement for making the advances, and that it was to subsist after they were repaid and until all the lumber on the land had been cut by Black and delivered to McKean either as its purchaser or as commission agent, even though Black should sooner become entitled to a reconveyance of the land.\nWhile the omissions from the recital in the contract under consideration of any reference to the cutting of lumber subsequent to the year 1914, and from its concluding clause of all provision for compensation to McKean for loss of profit on the sale of lumber still uncut should his power of sale for default be exercised, may be open to observation, as is pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, I am disposed to agree with Mr. Justice Russell that they scarcely created an ambiguity sufficient to justify a refusal to give effect to the plain and unambiguous covenant of Black to cut, manufacture and deliver to McKean all the lumber on the land, etc. The evidence of W. K. McKean, if accepted, would make it reasonably clear that the obtaining of this business advantage was the chief, if not the sole, consideration which moved his father to enter into the agreement and at least one passage in the cross-examination of Black would support that view. The provision of the agreement for the payment by Black to McKean, in the event of the former selling the property, of 50 cents per M for 30,000,000 feet of lumber, estimated to be standing on the property, less what might have been already shipped to or handled by McKean, also tends to indicate that the defendants' contention as to the real intent of the parties in making the arrangement is sound.\nWhile the recital declares that the property is to stand as security for advances, it also states that it is to serve as security \"for the performance of this * * agreement,\" the first operative provision of which, immediately following the recital, is the covenant of Black \"to completely lumber the said property\" and to \"saw, manufacture and deliver all the lumber on the said property\" to McKean, at prices to be agreed upon, or, in default, of such agreement, \"on consignment and commission\" at stated rates. But for the findings of the learned trial judge based on the oral evidence of Black, and accepted by the appellate court, that it had been represented to him by the late George McKean immediately before the execution of the agreement that this was not its purport or intent, but, on the contrary, that the meaning and scope of the agreement was that McKean should hold the lumber on the property only until he should be repaid all advances with interest and that Black executed the document under the belief, so induced, that this was its effect, I should probably have felt constrained to uphold the contention, ably and forcefully presented by Mr. Taylor and Mr. Jenks on behalf of the appellants, that the covenant for cutting and delivering all the lumber on the premises must be given effect according to its tenor and that Black's property had been pledged as security for its performance. But I am inclined to think we should not interfere with the findings made by the learned trial judge and affirmed on appeal unless the evidence on which they are based was inadmissible, or s. 35 of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act (R.S.N.S., 1900, c. 165) prevents effect being given to it.\nThe admissibility of the evidence cannot, I think, be rested on ambiguity in the agreement. In the first place, as already stated, I do not find any such ambiguity. But if, as held by the learned trial judge and the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, there is inconsistency between the recital and the final proviso on the one hand and the covenant invoked by the defendants on the other which renders the whole instrument equivocal, that, with respect, would seem to be a patent ambiguity and as such, in the quaint language of Lord Bacon, not to be \"holpen by averment.\" Saunderson v. Piper[8].\nBut in support of a claim for reformation or of a plea of estoppel grounded on misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or innocent, the evidence under consideration was, I think, admissible. Its sufficiency is of course another question.\nFraud, it is true, is not alleged, and there may therefore be a difficulty in the way of the plaintiffs recovering on that ground without amendment. But the defendants seem to me to be in this dilemma. Accepting the finding that the representation deposed to by Black was made to and acted upon by him, it was either honestly and innocently, or dishonestly and fraudulently made. If the latter, the defendants would scarcely be heard to allege the turpitude of the party through whom they claim. If the former, there was mutual mistake such as would afford a ground for reformation. Moreover, for a party who had made such a misrepresentation or for those claiming under him to insist upon holding the other party to the terms of a contract his execution of which was so induced, however innocently, would be the ex post facto fraud dealt with by Jessel M. R., in Redgrave v. Hurd[9], at page 12. We had to consider the admissibility of somewhat similar evidence and the effect of such a misrepresentation as raising an equitable estoppel in the recent case of Bathurst Lumber Co. v. Harris (23rd of Nov. 1920).\nThe learned trial judge found in the circumstances and in the terms of the agreement itself corroboration sufficient to satisfy s. 35 of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act. The learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, and Longley and Ritchie JJ. and also (with some doubt) Chisholm J. concurred in that view, and I do not understand Russell J. to express any dissent from it. I am not convinced that the conclusion reached on this point was wrong. Yet the corroboration relied on, if any, is very slight and while, as was held in Radford v. Macdonald[10], all that the statute requires is that the evidence to be corrorobated shall be\nstrengthened by some evidence which appreciably helps the judicial mind to believe one or more of the material statements or facts deposed to,\nand, as was said in Green v. McLeod[11],\nthe \"material evidence\" in corroboration may consist of inferences or probabilities arising from other facts and circumstances,\nI share Mr. Justice Chisholm's doubt as to the value as corroboration of an agreement alleged by the plaintiffs to be ambiguous and were it not for the aid on this branch of the case afforded to them by the letter of the defendants' agent, C. H. Read, of the 28th of December, 1918, I should doubt whether the statute had been satisfied. But I find in the record that at the close of the trial\nit was agreed between the parties that for the purpose of this action the defendants are to be taken to be in the same position as if the defendant were George McKean and he was still alive.\nIf that were the situation no question of corroboration would arise and I am disposed to think that this agreement, although that may possibly be a result which the parties did not contemplate, wholly excludes the application of s. 35 of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act.\nDuring the course of the argument the suggestion was made from the Bench that if the contract should be held to give to the defendants the right for which they contend it would be unenforceable as obnoxious to the rule of equity prohibiting the clogging or fettering of the mortgagor's equity of redemption. Counsel, however, did not discuss this aspect of the case, and, in the absence of argument, I should not be disposed to express a concluded opinion upon it. It might be a very nice question whether the right asserted by the defendants that after repayment of all advances and interest they should still control the output of the mortgaged property either as purchasers at a price to be agreed upon, or as commission agents at fixed rates, was inconsistent with Black's contractual and equitable rights to have his property restored unfettered upon such repayment, as was held to be the case in Bradley v. Carritt[12], or was merely a stipulation for an independent collateral advantage not in itself unfair or unconscionable, not in the nature of a penalty clogging the equity of redemption, and not inconsistent with or repugnant to the contractual and equitable right to redeem as, in Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co.[13], at page 61, a provision for an option of pre-emption was deemed to be under the circumstances of that case.\nAs at present advised I should be disposed to regard the transaction as evidenced by the written instrument as fair and businesslike and not within the mischief aimed at by any equitable rule or maxim relating to the clogging or fettering of the equity to redeem a mortgage. If the evidence of Black, on the strength of which the contrary view has prevailed, were not in the record I should have said the intention of the parties as shewn by their contract was that Black should not by repaying the McKean advances and interest be entitled to put an end to McKean's stipulated right to handle the entire output of the mortgaged property either as purchaser or as commission agent. As put by Lord Parker in the Kreglinger Case13, at p. 61:\nI doubt whether even before the repeal of the usury laws, this perfectly fair and businesslike transaction would have been considered a mortgage within any equitable rule or maxim relating to mortgages. The only possible way of deciding whether a transaction is a mortgage within any such rule or maxim is by reference to the intention of the parties. It never was intended by the parties that if the defendant company exercised their right to pay off the loan they should get rid of the option. The option was not in the nature of a penalty nor was it nor could it ever become inconsistent with or repugnant to any part of the real bargain within any such rule or maxim. The same is true of the commission payable on the sale of skins as to which the option was not exercised. Mutatis mutandis this language seems to fit the case at bar. But it is unnecessary to pass upon this aspect of the case and, as I have said, I prefer not to do so without the assistance of argument upon it.\nSubject to modifying it by striking out the clauses awarding damages and providing for a reference to assess them the judgment in appeal should be affirmed.\nMignault J.\u2014In my opinion, clause one of the agreement signed by the parties, obliging the plaintiff, Charles O. Black, to completely lumber the property and sell the timber to the appellants, is not ambiguous nor should it be construed as being merely a guarantee to secure the repayment of the advances made to Black, and as ceasing to produce effect when these advances are repaid. It is, in my opinion, an independent covenant. See Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co., Ltd.[14], where a somewhat similar covenant was made.\nThe case of the plaintiff, now represented by the respondents, is however that he was induced to sign this agreement by the representations of the late George McKean that\nthe meaning and intention of this agreement is that we hold all the lumber on this property until we are paid off all our advances with interest, that means to say, you can't sell any lumber off this property until you cut enough to pay us all off, because if you did we would not have enough security, and that is what the agreement means.\nThe learned trial judge believed Black's evidence that this representation was made to him. It is contended that the matter could not be proved by parol evidence. The learned trial judge decided otherwise and under all the circumstances of the case I do not think he was in error in allowing this evidence. He also considered that there was sufficient corroboration under the statute requiring corroboration as to statements alleged to have been made by deceased persons. This is the only point on which I entertain any doubt, but this doubt is not sufficient in my judgment to justify me in reversing the finding of the trial judge. The question of corroboration has already been passed upon by two courts and I am satisfied to abide by their decision.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

The defendant was holder of a licence to cut lumber on Crown lands with a right of annual renewal for a number of years on complying with all stipulated conditions. The licence was subject to, and contained, the following regulation passed by the Governor in Council.\u2014\n\"As a protection to the Government against lands being held under licence for speculative purposes, and not operated on, all licensees shall make such operations annually on the lands held by them under licence as may be deemed reasonable to the Minister of Lands and Mines, and the Minister of Lands and Mines shall have the power to call upon any licensee to cut an amount equal to at least ten thousand superficial feet of lumber for each square mile of licensed land held by the licensee as the Minister of Lands and Mines may determine or direct. Should the licensee prefer to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of lumber at ten thousand superficial feet per mile, instead of making the required operation or cut, he shall have the right to do so in any year, on his notifying the Minister of Lands and Mines to that effect, and obtaining his consent thereto, and such charge in lieu of stumpage shall be payable on or before the first day of August. On failure of the licensee to comply with any of the foregoing conditions, the licences shall be forfeited and the berths held under them shall become vacant, and be open for application by any other person.\"\nFor three years the defendant paid the stumpage dues without cutting. In the fourth year the lumber was cut and the stumpage paid without question, but the next year when operations were continued the claim was set up that the amounts paid in the first three years should be credited to defendant and deducted from the stumpage for that season's cut. This claim was allowed by the trial judge but his judgment was reversed on appeal to the Appeal Division.\nH. A. Powell K.C., for the appellant: Regulation 17 is ultra vires of the Governor in Council. Power is given to make regulations in regard to the cutting and removing of lumber which only covers the mode of operating and does not authorize compulsion or restriction as to quantities to be cut.\nAssuming it to be intra vires, it is not reasonable. If the 10,000 feet per mile is cut the Crown has the stumpage fees and the licensee the lumber. If not cut the Crown has both the money and the timber since it is possible that the licensee may never cut it. If he does the Crown gets the same amount again as the regulation has been construed.\nThe principle that should govern in this case, if necessary to invoke it, has been laid down in several judicial decisions. It is that where the construction of an Act according to its ordinary meaning would work a manifest injustice an interpretation that would not have that effect should be adopted if a grammatical and reasonable construction of the language so permits. See In re Brocklebank[1]; Plumpstead Board of Works v. Spackman[2]; Moon v. Burden[3].\nJ. J. F. Winslow for the respondent: The right of the defendant to pay without cutting is one to be exercised \"in any year.\" He holds only an annual licence and the right to renewal does not make it anything else. Lakefield Lumber Co. v. Shairpe[4]. Hence the right exercised in any year is exhausted when that year ends. The intention of this regulation is to have the licensee pay for the privilege of leaving the timber standing. The defendant recognized this when in the fourth year the lumber was cut and the stumpage dues paid without any claim for deduction.\nThe rule of the maxim verba fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem does not apply to Crown grants which are construed more strongly against the grantee. Buhner v. The Queen[5].\nH. A. Powell K.C., for the appellant\nJ. J. F. Winslow for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This was an action brought by the Attorney General of New Brunswick to recover the sum of $5,616.68, being the alleged balance due for \"stumpage\" on Crown lands during the year ending August 1st, 1919, with interest.\nThe defence was that this sum had already been paid by the defendant appellant to the Crown in the years 1913, 1914 and 1915, excepting $619.20 which was admitted to be due, and paid before action.\nIn the year 1913, pursuant to c. XI of the Acts of Assembly of New Brunswick of that year, the then holders of licences were permitted to take out new licences very similar to the old ones, but providing for annual renewals for 20 years from August 1st, 1913.\nIn addition to \"stumpage\" on lumber cut, the province charges annual mileage at $8.00 per mile and other fees, and it was stated and was not denied that from these stumpage, mileage and other fees, the province derives about one-half of its total annual revenue.\nThe whole contest in this appeal turns upon the construction of Regulation 17 issued under and pursuant to the statute before referred to. Shortly put it is this: Is the licensee of any area having elected not to cut timber under his licence in any year, and having paid to the Crown the \"charge in lieu of stumpage,\" provided for in the regulation for that year, entitled, in a subsequent year when he has elected to cut lumber on his lot, to set off or deduct from the amount payable under the regulation for such cutting the amounts he had paid in previous years when he had elected not to cut as and for stumpage, or \"in lieu of stumpage.\"\nMr. Powell contended very strongly for the appellant that to hold he was not so entitled was tantamount to asking him to pay stumpage twice over.\nSection 17, on the construction of which the controversy between the parties depends, reads as follows:\u2014\nAs a protection to the Government against lands being held under licence for speculative purposes, and not operated on, all licensees shall make such operations annually on the lands held by them under licence as may be deemed reasonable to the Minister of Lands and Mines, and the Minister of Lands and Mines shall have the power to call upon any licensee to cut an amount equal to at least ten (10) M superficial feet of lumber for each square mile of licensed land held by him, and may require that such operation or cut shall be made on such blocks of timber lands held by the licensee as the Minister of Lands and Mines may determine or direct. Should the licensee prefer to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of lumber at 10 M superficial feet per mile, instead of making the required operation or cut, he shall have the right to do so in any year, on his notifying the Minister of Lands and Mines to that effect, and obtaining his consent thereto; and such charge in lieu of stumpage shall be payable on or before the first day of August. On failure of the licensee to comply with any of the foregoing conditions, the licences shall be forfeited and the berths held under them shall become vacant, and be open for application by any other person.\nThe learned trial judge held that under the true construction of this section the licensee having once paid the charge for stumpage, or, as the regulation states, \"in lieu of stumpage\" for a specific year, he could, in a subsequent year when he elected to cut, claim to have the sum so previously paid by him credited to the charge he was liable to pay in the year he elected to cut.\nOn appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that court unanimously reversed the finding of the trial judge. Mr. Justice Grimmer, in delivering the judgment of the court, puts the question very clearly and I fully agree with his construction of the section.\nHe says:\u2014\nIn my opinion the intention of this section is clear. It enabled the Crown to secure a certain amount of protection as far as revenue was concerned, from the lands held by the licensee thus preventing the tendency to speculation and it conferred upon the licensee an option either to cut or to pay for the privilege of not cutting, which option if elected by the licensee, in my opinion simply entitled him to retain his licence and prevent the forfeiture, which otherwise would take place under the provisions of the regulation. The words \"such charge in lieu of stumpage\" are to my mind clear and unmistakable, and the choice once made by the licensee and consented to by the Minister became final, the licensee thereby paying for the option which he enjoyed as hereinbefore stated * * *. I cannot and do not consider that Section 17 requires a payment from the licensee in any sense as a penalty for not making the operation or cut required by the Minister, but it does confer upon him, as stated, the privilege of holding his lands without making a cut or operation, upon payment of a sum fixed by the Minister. In such a case an election to pay would not be in the nature of an anticipated payment for stumpage, but would be simply for the enjoyment of the privilege which was conferred. Should there be any uncertainty in the words \"the stumpage that would be due\" in my opinion it is fully explained and the purpose and intention made plain by the other words \"such charge in lieu of stumpage\" which to my mind place upon the object of the section a construction clear, plain and unequivocal.\nI do not consider it necessary to elaborate upon the learned judge's remarks. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014The respondent sued appellant for stumpage dues it had become responsible for, as holder of a licence to cut timber in the Province of New Brunswick in the year from 1st August, 1918, to 1st August, 1919, which amounted to $6,070.25, but was reduced before action by the payment of $602.75.\nThe appellant's licence was one of the kind that was renewable from year to year and the annual stumpage dues might be increased from year to year without the consent of the licensee by the Minister of Lands and Mines as he saw fit.\nSection 4 of the Act of 1913 relative to such Crown timber lands and licences to cut thereon, reads as follows:\u2014\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council shall from time to time fix and determine the rates of stumpage to be paid upon the various kinds of lumber cut from the Crown lands by the licensees, and shall determine the mileage to be paid annually by the licensee, and shall make such other rules and regulations in regard to the cutting and removing of lumber from the Crown land areas as may seem to him just, wise and prudent.\nThereunder the Lieutenant Governor in Council made the following amongst other regulations.\u2014\n(c) As a protection to the Government against lands being held under license for speculative purposes, and not operated on, all licensees shall make such operations annually on the lands held by them under licence as may be deemed reasonable to the Minister of Lands and Mines, and the Minister of Lands and Mines shall have the power to call upon any licensee to cut an amount equal to at least ten thousand superficial feet of lumber for each square mile of licensed land held by the licensee as the Minister of lands and Mines may determine or direct. Should the licensee prefer to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of lumber at ten thousand superficial feet per mile, instead of making the required operation or cut, he shall have the right to do so in any year, on his notifying the Minister of Lands and Mines to that effect, and obtaining his consent thereto, and such charge in lieu of stumpage shall be payable on or before the first day of August. On failure of the licensee to comply with any of the foregoing conditions, the licences shall be forfeited and the berths held under them shall become vacant, and be open for application by any other person. That was set forth in full in the licence issued to the appellant in 1913 as part of the terms upon which the licence was continued in force; and also in each succeeding renewal thereof.\nThe parties hereto at the trial agreed upon the facts to be had in view in determining the issue raised.\nThat remarkable issue is that the appellant, after having acted upon the said regulation not only for the year 1913-1914, but also for each of the two succeeding years, and paid each year the sum of $1,822.50 as the yearly price for the privilege of refraining from cutting, without any resistance, now sets up the contention that such payments were mere payments on account of future cutting under later licences.\nThe amusing feature of appellant's claim is that it did cut in the fourth year and paid the full amount of the dues for and in respect of said year's actual cut, and never suggested what now is claimed until settlement demanded for the actual cutting of the fifth year.\nNot only did it forget to raise the question when paying for the dues it owed for its actual cut of the year August 1917 to August, 1918, but in the admissions made at the trial it described what had transpired in respect to the first year's exercise of a privilege of refraining from cutting, as follows:\u2014\nAnd the Minister, after the issuing of such renewal licences called upon the defendant, as licensee, to cut during the said term upon the said lands 1,225,000 superficial feet of timber, an amount equal to 10,000 superficial feet of timber, for each square mile of the same, and the defendant preferring to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of timber, namely, 1,225,000 superficial feet, instead of making the said required operation or cut during the said term thereupon notified the Minister of its said preference and the Minister consented that the defendant should exercise such preference and fixed at $1,822.50 the amount of stumpage the defendant should pay on such quantity of timber in accordance with the rates of stumpage then payable by licensees of Crown timber lands for timber cut thereon by the licensees thereof, and the defendant accordingly did not cut during the said term any timber on the said lands but paid to the provincial treasurer the sum of $1,822.50, being the amount of stumpage so fixed to be paid * * *\nThere does not seem to have been a shadow of doubt in the minds of those concerned at the times of the several renewals and payments made by appellant of the nature of the transaction being what respondent contends. Nor was any pretension to the contrary set up till two years of cutting had taken place.\nHad such a pretension been set up at an earlier date doubtless it would have been ended by the Minister advising an increase of the stumpage dues under the licence to what was necessary to cure the complaint.\nThe appellant, I submit, cannot now, properly, steer in silence past such a danger for two years and then set up what rests on nothing but a war of words, regardless of the conduct of appellant in paying on the actual basis of what was clearly a common mutual understanding quite inconsistent with what is now contended for.\nI always prefer the interpretation so given, to results to be got by doubtful argument as to words, suggested by afterthought, of what either might have claimed long ago.\nHowever, I doubt if the interest to be saved the province would ever have occurred to its Minister as worth taking such pains for or as an effectual check upon speculation.\nFor these reasons, and adopting in the main the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014My opinion touching the questions in controversy accords with that of Mr, Justice Grimmer whose reasoning is, I think, conclusive. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the construction of Regulation 17 made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of New Brunswick concerning the persons having saw mill licences on Crown lands,\nA licence was issued in 1913 in favour of the Royal Bank in trust for different persons and it contained a provision that the licensee would carry out the rules and regulations made in connection with the Crown land areas.\nRegulation 17 in dispute reads as follows:\u2014\n17. As a protection to the Government against lands being held under licence for speculative purposes, and not operated on, all licensees shall make such operations annually on the lands held by them under licence as may be deemed reasonable to the Minister of Lands and Mines, and the Minister of Lands and Mines shall have the power to call upon any licensee to cut an amount equal to at least ten (10) M superficial feet of lumber for each square mile of licensed land held by him, and may require that such operation or cut shall be made on such blocks of timber lands held by the licensee as the Minister of Lands and Mines may determine or direct. Should the licensee prefer to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of lumber at 10 M superficial feet per mile, instead of making the required operation or cut, he shall have the right to do so in any year, on his notifying the Minister of Lands and Mines to that effect, and obtaining his consent thereto, and such charge in lieu of stumpage shall be payable on or before the first day of August.\nIt appears that before the legislation of 1913 there was no disposition by which the Government could get the timber limits under licence exploited, and the licensees could for years and years keep the limits without making any cutting. This regulation 17 remedied this undesirable state of affairs and gave the Minister of Lands the power of forcing the licensees to make a certain quantity of cutting. However, the right of the Minister was not absolute, for the regulation provided that if the licensee preferred not to do the cutting required by the Minister then he would have to pay\nthe stumpage that would be due on the quantity of timber which he had been ordered to cut\nand such charge in lieu of stumpage should be payable on the first day of August.\nFor three years the appellant did not make the operations ordered by the Minister and paid to the Government the charge stipulated in the regulation. In the fourth, the appellant cut a larger quantity than the one required by the Minister for that year and paid the stumpage dues on the whole quantity he cut. In the fifth year, he still cut a much larger quantity than the one required; but this time, instead of paying the dues, he claimed that he should be given credit for the sums which he had paid in the first three years. It is contended on the contrary by the Government that the amount which was paid did not form part of the stumpage dues but that it was an additional charge.\nIf the first part of the regulation in which is mentioned the payment of stumpage were alone, there would be no doubt, according to my opinion, that the licensee would be entitled to claim that the money which he paid was an advance payment of stumpage on lumber to be cut, but the last part of the regulation makes it very clear that the payment which he makes is a charge in lieu of stumpage. This charge or payment is for the privilege which he acquires to have his licence renewed in paying a sum of money representing the dues which he would have paid if he had cut the quantity of timber required by the Minister. This payment is not an advance payment, but it is a charge which he is called upon to pay if he does not fulfil the obligation imposed upon him by the Minister.\nThe appellant itself appears to have so construed the agreement, since, in the fourth year, it did not claim, when it paid its dues, that the previous payments were to be considered as advance payments.\nI, therefore, agree with the construction made by the court below of this regulation 17 and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The learned counsel for the appellant left nothing unsaid that could serve as an argument against the judgment appealed from. At first sight, there appeared to be a certain plausibility in his contentions which prevailed before the trial court, but when carefully scrutinized, I cannot accept these contentions as being sound. The whole question turns upon the construction to be placed upon the licence under which the appellant held from the Crown the right to cut timber on 122\u00bd square miles of land belonging to His Majesty in right of the province of New Brunswick.\nThe clause which gave rise to the difficulty is section 17, which reads as follows.\u2014\nAs a protection to the Government against lands being held under licence for speculative purposes, and not operated on, all licensees shall make such operations annually on the lands held by them under licence as may be deemed reasonable to the Minister of Lands and Mines, and the Minister of Lands and Mines shall have the power to call upon any licensee to cut an amount equal to at least ten (10) M superficial feet of lumber for each square mile of licensed land held by him, and may require that such operation or cut shall be made on such blocks of timber lands held by the licensee as the Minister of Lands and Mines may determine or direct. Should the licensee prefer to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of lumber at 10 M superficial feet per mile, instead of making the required operation or cut, he shall have the right to do so in any year, on his notifying the Minister of Lands and Mines to that effect, and obtaining his consent thereto; and such charge in lieu of stumpage shall be payable on or before the first day of August. On failure of the licensee to comply I with any of the foregoing conditions, the licenses shall be forfeited and the berths held under them shall become vacant, and be open for application by any other person.\nI may add that the licence was also subject, as a condition of its renewal, to the payment of $8.00 per square mile over and above all stumpage dues, and this mileage has been regularly paid.\nIn February, 1912, Hilyard Brothers assigned to the appellant a saw mill licence for the territory in question. In the two years ending August 1st, 1912, and 1913, no lumber was cut on these lands and a new licence was issued to the appellant on August 1st, 1913, for another year ending August 1st, 1914. In the latter and subsequent licences was inserted section 17 above quoted.\nDuring the years beginning on August 1st, 1914, 1915, and 1916, the licensee was called upon by the Minister of Lands and Mines to cut an amount of at least ten thousand superficial feet of lumber for each square mile. The appellant did not cut this lumber but under section 17 paid to the Government $1,822.50 in each year, which would correspond to the stumpage on the quantity which it had been required to cut. In the year beginning on August 1st, 1917, the appellant being again called upon to cut this quantity of lumber, cut an excess amount and paid the stumpage thereon without asserting any right to set off previous payments.\nThe claim to offset these previous payments was first made in answer to the demand of stumpage dues on lumber cut during the year beginning on August 1st, 1918. Whether the appellant is entitled to have these payments applied so as to reduce the stumpage due for the latter year is the question to be decided. Briefly the appellant's contention is that although it cut no lumber during the three years beginning on August 1st, 1914, 1915, and 1916, it paid the stumpage dues that would have been payable on the required cut of ten thousand superficial feet per square mile, and that when it subsequently did cut lumber, these stumpage dues should be credited on the lumber then cut. It lays stress on the words in section 17:\u2014\nShould the licensee prefer to pay the stumpage that would be due on such quantity of lumber * * *\nThe respondent answers that the amounts paid for the years wherein lumber was not cut were paid for the privilege of holding the lands without cutting lumber thereon, and relies on the words\nsuch charge in lieu of stumpage shall be payable, etc.,\nas shewing that the appellant paid a charge, not for stumpage but in lieu thereof, for this privilege.\nSection 17 expressly states that its purpose is to protect the Government against lands being held under licence for speculative purposes and not operated on. Reading the whole clause, it appears clear that the intention was to require the payment each year of a minimum amount whether or not the licensee cut any lumber. Had the required quantity been cut, this payment would undoubtedly be for stumpage, but where no lumber was cut, I cannot, on my construction of this clause, come to the conclusion that the payment was on account of stumpage, for stumpage being by definition \"a tax charged for the privilege of cutting timber on State lands\" (New English Dictionary), there could be no stumpage in the absence of the cutting of any lumber. And although the licensee, to use the language of this clause, was allowed to pay the stumpage that would be due on the minimum quantity required to be cut instead of making the required operation or cut, he really paid a charge in lieu of stumpage, for it would be an abuse of language to term such a payment as one made for stumpage when no lumber was cut and no stumpage had accrued, and the only meaning it can have is that it was made for the privilege of not cutting the quantity specified by the Minister.\nAnother consideration is that stumpage dues might increase and did in fact increase in the subsequent years, and it would be unreasonable to allow the licensee, when he actually did cut lumber, to escape from paying the increased stumpage, by reason of previous payments at a lower rate for the privilege of making no cut of lumber.\nFor these reasons my conclusion is that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

[1906] c. 37, s. 340.\nBy sec. 340 of the Railway Act a railway company cannot, by contract or otherwise, limit its liability in respect to the carriage of traffic unless authorized by the Board of Railway Commissioners; the Board may, by regulation, determine the extent to which the liability may be limited (s.s. 2), and it may prescribe the terms and conditions under which any traffic may be carried.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 237) that a regulation, providing that a carrier shall not be liable for loss of or damage to personal baggage caused by negligence or otherwise to an amount greater than one hundred dollars unless greater values are declared and extra charges paid at time of checking, is intra vires of the powers of the Board.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the respondent. The appellant is a commercial traveller residing in the City of Hamilton, and on the 7th day of May, 1919, she purchased a ticket from Hamilton to Toronto, which ticket was the ordinary ticket issued by the respondent, and contained no conditions or restrictions whatever either on its face or back. After she had purchased her ticket, the appellant went to the baggage office and checked her trunk containing her wearing apparel and personal belongings and received in return a check. There was nothing said to her by the clerk who handed her the check to draw her attention to the fact that this check was anything more than a mere receipt for the trunk and the plaintiff herself did not notice that the check contained thereon any terms or conditions whatever.\nThe trunk was lost on the journey and has not yet been recovered, and the appellant brought this action for the value of same. The respondent paid the sum of one hundred dollars into court but denied further liability, relying on the terms and conditions which were printed on the back of the check and pleaded that the said conditions were authorized by and contained in General Order 151 of the Railway Board of Canada, dated the 8th day of November, 1915, and that said order was duly published in the Canada Gazette and had therefore the same effect as if contained in the Railway Act. The substance of this order is given in the above head-note.\nThe case was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Rose and judgment was delivered on the 4th day of May, 1920, giving effect to the respondent\u2019s contention and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action with costs. This judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division. Hellmuth K.C. and J.Y. Murdoch for the appellant. The relation of passenger and agent entitles the passenger to have his luggage transported without additional charge. Spencer v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[3]; Carlisle v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[4]\nNo limitation of the carrier\u2019s liability would have effect unless it is shown that it was read by the appellant or her attention was called to it when the check was delivered. Lamont v. Canadian Transfer Co.[5]; Spencer v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.3\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondent. The appellant must be deemed to have had knowledge of the limitation of liability. See Grand Trunk Ry. Co.v. Robinson[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I think this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe action was brought by a passenger claiming the value of the contents of a trunk checked as personal luggage and lost by the company. The question to be determined was whether the liability of the company is limited in the matter of a passenger\u2019s personal baggage by General Order No. 151 of the Board of Railway Commissioners dated November 8th, 1915. The order was duly published in the Canada Gazette and by sec. 31 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 37, if there was power to make it, it has, while it remains in force, the like effect as if enacted in the Act itself.\nI concur in the reasons for his judgment of Mr. Justice Rose, the trial judge, which judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Second Divisional Court of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario and to which I have nothing to add. IDINGTON J. The appellant sued the respondent for damages arising from its having lost her baggage for which it has given her a check on presentation of an ordinary ticket as a passenger entitled to travel on its train.\nIt was assumed on argument that there was no condition expressed on the ticket as to the terms upon which her baggage was to be carried.\nOn the check for baggage there was expressed something which it is said by respondent should have informed her that she was only entitled to claim, in case of loss, one hundred dollars, unless she had declared on getting the check the value of the baggage beyond that sum and paid an increased charge for such excess in value.\nThe counsel for appellant argues that the basis of the liability is contract and that, he submitted, was contained in the ticket.\nI am afraid the reasoning is rather technical and omits reading into the contract what the law nowadays imputes as knowledge of all implied in a mere ticket, by virtue of the regulation No. 151 of the Board of Railway Commissioners, and imputes to her knowledge thereof and all else that ensued, or was to ensue, before she had got a check for her baggage, and all inscribed on such check hence part of the contract. These several imputations of knowledge of what her ticket implied, and especially the rights thereby acquired to get her baggage carried, cannot be overlooked, and she got a check for same so inscribed which she must be held in law to have known and assented to.\nIf any one doubts these several imputations of knowledge let him read the facts set out in my judgment in the case of Robinson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[7], as well as what is said therein by my brother judges. I refer to my own because it appears therein that the form never was filled up, yet the court above reversed us and the decision of that case as reported in[8], binds us.\nSurely it goes much further in imputing knowledge than anything required herein to bind the appellant thus presumed in law to have had knowledge of the condition and to have given her assent thereto by accepting the check inscribed as above stated.\nIn regard to the validity of the regulation as part of a contract so interpreted, there is no question but the appellant must fail herein.\nApart from all that, can it be said that the power of the Board to fix tolls for any and every service by a railway does not cover the case of baggage?\nAnd does not section 340 give the Board almost unlimited powers in the way of impairing, restricting or limiting the liability of a railway company within its jurisdiction?\nIt reads as follows:\u2014\n340. No contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice made or given by the company, impairing, restricting or limiting its liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic, shall, except as hereinafter provided, relieve the company from such liability, unless such class of contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice shall have been first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board.\n2. The Board, may, in any case, or by regulation, determine the extent to which the liability of the company may be so impaired, restricted or limited.\n3. The Board may by regulation prescribe the terms and conditions under which any traffic may be carried by the company.\nThe exact thing in question herein seems within these powers, or some one of them, and I need say no more in regard thereto. The framing of Rule No. 151 which I think was intended to be an exercise of the power it was asked by the railway company to exercise, may be open for the criticism that it might have been better expressed if intended to reach the understanding of ordinary people, but its legal import, assuming what was done in way of its publication was all that the Act requires to give it vitality, seems clear.\nI am almost tempted to suggest that contract as a basis for such dealings as in question is fast becoming a fiction of law.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014It was competent, in my opinion, to the Board, acting under section 340, subsection 3, to limit the value of the personal baggage or other property to be carried on a passenger train for a passenger and to require a declaration by the passenger as to the value of his baggage in excess of $100.00 and further that the charges for such declared excess should be pre paid. Where the value of the passenger\u2019s baggage exceeds the sum mentioned and no declaration is made in respect of it then, as the company is under no obligation to receive such baggage for carriage and does not knowingly consent to carry that which it is not bound to carry, I am unable myself to understand upon what foundation the responsibility of the company for such baggage can be based. I do not think section 284, subsection 1 applies to such case nor do I think subsection 7 applies.\nIf such excess baggage were accepted knowingly by the company\u2019s servants without declaration and without payment of tolls a very different situation would arise; but where there is no declaration and the company is ignorant of the facts the company\u2019s responsibility is, in my judgment, neither more nor less than its responsibility in respect of property wrongfully placed in one of the company\u2019s cars.\nIf this be the correct view the basis of Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s argument fails because the order does no more than declare the legal consequences of the conditions laid down and validly laid down in respect of the reception of such \u201ctraffic.\u201d\nANGLIN J.\u2014The question for determination on this appeal is whether the Board of Railway Commissioners has the power by general regulation to relieve a railway company from liability consequent upon loss of, or damage or delay to, personal baggage ascribable to negligence of its servants for any amount exceeding a stated sum, unless such baggage has been declared to be of greater value and extra charges therefor, according to a tariff approved by the Board, paid at the time of delivery to the company for checking. The Board passed such a regulation (No. 151) on the 8th of November, 1915, restricting the value of baggage entitled to free carriage to the sum of $100. The governing statute is the Railway Act of 1906 (R.S.C., c. 37) and amendments thereto made prior to the year 1919.\nThe plaintiff sues to recover damages for loss of personal baggage valued by her at $2,000. The existence of the conditions limiting the company\u2019s liability to $100, if the impugned regulation be valid, is admitted; if it is invalid the company\u2019s liability for damages beyond that sum, to be assessed on a reference, is conceded. Sec. 283 of the Railway Act requires every railway company to check each parcel of baggage equipped with suitable means for attaching a check to it which is delivered by a passenger for transport and provides for the collection by the company of such tolls for excess baggage as may be authorized. By sec. 284 the company is required to receive, carry and deliver all traffic offered without delay and with due care and diligence (s.s. 1) and any person aggrieved by any breach of that duty is given a right of action from which the company cannot relieve itself by any notice, condition or declaration where the damage arises from its negligence or omission or that of its servants (s.s. 7). This right, however, as is pointed out in Robinson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[9], at page 744, is explicitly made \u201csubject to this Act.\u201d\nBy sec. 340 any contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice purporting to impair, restrict or limit the company\u2019s liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic is declared ineffectual unless of a class authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board of Railway Commissioners (s.s. 1); the Board is empowered to determine the extent to which the company\u2019s liability may be so impaired, restricted or limited (s.s. 2); and, by regulation, to\nprescribe the terms and conditions under which any traffic may be carried by the company (s.s. 3).\nBy sec. 30 the Board is empowered to make orders and regulations governing a number of enumerated matters and, inter alia,\n(h) with respect to any matter, or thing which by this or the special Act is sanctioned, required to be done, or prohibited; and (i) generally for carrying this Act into effect. It is apparent, therefore, that the Board\u2019s powers are very comprehensive. By sec. 31 it is provided that any regulation, etc., of the Board shall when published for three weeks in the Canada Gazette have the like effect as if enacted in the Railway Act. Due publication of regulation No. 151 is admitted.\nI think it is unnecessary to determine whether personal baggage of such weight and dimensions as would, under the regulation of the Board, entitle the passenger owning it to have it carried free may properly be classified as \u201cexcess baggage\u201d within section 283 because its value exceeds a sum fixed by regulation of the Railway Commissioners as that of baggage which a passenger is entitled to have carried free. Whether that section does or does not apply, it is in my opinion within the competence of the Board under section 340 (3) to prescribe the terms and conditions under which baggage may be carried by railway companies\u2014that if under a certain weight, of less than fixed dimensions and of value not exceeding a stated sum (all to be prescribed by the Board) it shall be carried free, and that if not within the limits set in any one or more of these particulars, tolls according to approved tariffs shall be paid for its carriage. I find nothing to preclude the Board ordering that in the event of the passenger failing to declare the value of his baggage, if it exceeds the amount within which he is entitled to have it carried free, and to pay or tender the approved toll in respect of such excess when presenting it to be checked, his right of recovery under section 284 (7) in respect of it shall be limited to the amount prescribed by the Board as the value up to which he was entitled to have it carried free. That seems to me to be nothing more than fixing\nterms and conditions under which (this) traffic may be carried by the company as authorized by sec. 340 (3). Notwithstanding the presence in s.s. 2 of the word \u201cso,\u201d which I read as intended merely to carry into it the words \u201cin respect of the carriage of any traffic\u201d found in s.s. 1, rather than to restrict the application of s.s. 2 to cases in which the company, proceeding under s.s. 1, should attempt to impair, restrict or limit its liability by contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice, I incline to think that regulation No. 151 may also be sustained as an exercise of the power which that subsection confers. Sec. 340 is one of the provisions of the Act to which s.s 7 of s. 284 is made subject. The impeached regulation was therefore in my opinion intra vires of the Board and effectual to limit the respondent company\u2019s liability to the appellant.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I think the regulation relied on by the respondents was within the power of the Board of Railway Commissioners under subsection 3 of section 340 of the Railway Act (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 37). That the liability of the railway company can be restricted by order of the Board, even where the damage arises from the negligence or omission of the company or of its servants, notwithstanding subsection 7 of section 284, which, however, is stated to be \u201csubject to this Act,\u201d is shewn by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Robinson[10]. This removes the doubt which I otherwise would have felt, and I therefore concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Holden & Murdoch.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.H.

The King, (1921) 62 S.C.R. 338\nDate: 1921-06-27\nThe Halifax Graving Dock. Company (Suppliant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Respondent) Respondent.\n1921: May 16; 1921: June 27.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nContract\u2014Offer\u2014Acceptance\u2014Consensus ad idem.\nThe Halifax Graving Dock and plant were wrecked by the explosion in the harbour in 1917 and in Jan. 1918 the Government of Canada passed an order in council providing that the work of repair and reconstruction should be entrusted to the appellant company on the condition, inter alia, that the latter should contribute $111,000 (the amount of the insurance it carried) and the Government pay the balance. A letter was sent to the company enclosing a copy of the order and stating that \"an agreement is being prepared and will be submitted to you shortly for your signature,\" but no agreement was ever executed. Two days later the company wrote the Minister of Public Works saying that the terms of the order were satisfactory land adding \"but in order that all will be quite clear our understanding is that we are to assign our insurance policies to the Government and that the temporary buildings now being constructed are to be replaced by permanent buildings of the same kind as the original.\" The company did some of the work on the dock but the Minister was not satisfied with its progress and the Government took it over, practically completed it and eventually expropriated the property. In proceedings by the company to recover the amount expended on the work.\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court (20 Ex.C.R. 67), Duff J. dissenting, that the letter of the company to the Minister did not contain an unqualified acceptance of the terms set out in the order in council; that there never was a consensus ad idem between the parties; and the company could not recover. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing the suppliant's petition of right.\nThe facts, so far as material, are set out sufficiently in the above head-note.\"\nJenks K.C. and Roper for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. and W. L. Hall K.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This was an appeal from the Court of Exchequer in an action brought by the suppliants, appellants, to recover the sum of $195,638 under the provisions of an order in council dated 15th January, 1918, for the expenditure upon the work of repair and reconstruction of the dock and shops, etc., at Halifax, damaged by the explosion of December, 1917.\nThe learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Audette, dismissed the suppliant's petition having come to the conclusion that there existed no legal contract between the parties on which a recovery could be maintained.\nIn his reasons for judgment the learned judge has set out the order in council above referred to and all the correspondence and documents which followed which renders it unnecessary for me to repeat them now.\nAfter hearing the lengthy argument at Bar I have given this order in council and all the correspondence and documents my most careful attention and consideration and have had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that there never was any unqualified acceptance by the appellant of the only terms upon which the Government agreed to reconstruct the graving dock. The parties never were ad idem as to the amount the appellant was to contribute to the cost of reconstruction. In order that the suppliant's action should be sustained, it was essential that such a contract should exist.\n[20 Ex. C. R. 67]. Some reference was made by the trial judge as to the suppliant having been paid already, in the expropriation proceedings of the dock already taken by the Government, for whatever outlay they incurred. Mr. Tilley, however, at the argument did not press this point, the two proceedings, as he said, being quite distinct.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was the owner of a dock in Halifax Harbour which was materially injured by the explosion which took place there during the war.\nThe respondent was deeply interested by reason of the war in having the said dock restored.\nIn consequence thereof there ensued some negotiations between the Dominion Government's Department of Public Works and the appellant.\nThese resulted in the passing of an order in council resting solely upon the powers conferred upon the said government relative to war emergencies, whereby, after writing that and other facts, the appellant was offered as follows:\u2014\n1. The Halifax Graving Dock Company, Limited, the owners of the dock damaged, to contribute towards the cost thereof the sum of $111,000.\n2. The balance of the outlay required to be defrayed by the Government from the War Appropriation.\n3. The final decision as to the exact nature and extent of the repair, reconstruction and re-equipment of the dock and plant as well as the actual work of reconstruction and purchase of material therefor, to be under the inspection, supervision and control of the representative of the Minister of Public Works.\nThe only acceptance, so called, of this offer, which was presented in reply thereto, was the following letter:\u2014 Jan. 19th, 1918.\nHon. F. B. Carvell,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\nWe beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 17th enclosing a copy of the order in council with reference to the reconstruction of the Halifax Dry Dock, which is satisfactory; but in order that all will be quite clear our understanding is that we are to assign our insurance policies to the Government and that the temporary buildings now being constructed are to be replaced by permanent buildings of the same kind as the original.\nYours very truly,\nHalifax Graving Dock Co., Ltd.,\n(Sgd.) Saml. M. Brookfield, Chairman.\nI am unable to hold that the said letter was a clear and unconditional acceptance of the offer made by said order in council. It was clearly a substitution of the assignment of some policies of insurance for an absolute contribution of $111,000 in cash. And that cannot be amended by anything passing afterwards going beyond the limitations set forth in said order in council.\nThe writer of the said letter, persistently, throughout the later correspondence and the litigation which has ensued, seemed determined to have his own way and to be taken as absolute interpreter of the language used and the law bearing thereon.\nI cannot agree with him and hence conclude that there never was, as appellant claims, any binding contract.\nAnother incident is significant that there was to have been drawn up a formal contract which, if drawn, never was executed.\nI cannot see any useful purpose to be served by following the history of what ensued. I may be permitted, however, to express the hope that the work done by the appellant, though not recoverable on the basis of a quantum meruit as it might have been in a case of a like history transpiring between private individuals, was amply covered by the amount awarded appellant in the expropriation proceedings.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I am unable to agree in the view of the trial judge that there was no acceptance. I think there was an acceptance.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I am satisfied that there never was an acceptance by the appellant of the only terms on which the Government agreed to reconstruct the graving dock. The parties appear never to have been ad idem as to the amount to be contributed by the appellant to the cost of reconstruction. The existence of such a contract is admittedly a sine qua non of the suppliant's right to recover.\nMignault J.\u2014In so far as it could be contended that the order in council of the 15th of January, 1918, constituted a contract between the Crown and the appellant, the latter admittedly did not contribute in money the sum of $111,000, said to be the amount of the insurance on the dry dock, which contribution, according to the order in council, was the condition on which the Government decided to furnish the balance required for the reconstruction. It is indeed as to this contribution that the chief difficulty arose from the very beginning, and this difficulty shews that between the appellant and the Crown there was never that consensus ad idem which is essential for the existence of a valid contract. The order in council referred to two proposals, a main one and an alternative one, which the appellant had made to the Government. The alternative proposal, which was the one given effect to, is stated in the following terms:\nThat an alternative proposal has, however, been made by the owners in which they offer to proceed with the reconstruction of the dock and to furnish the sum of $111,000, which is the amount of the insurance, towards the cost, provided the Government supply the balance of the cost of reconstruction by way of a subsidy, relieving the Government of any further liability, as well as responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the dock. It is understood that the work of repair and reconstruction shall not consist of anything beyond the replacement of the dock and shops, etc., in the same condition in which they existed at the time of the disaster. The final decision as to the exact nature and extent of such repair, reconstruction and re-equipment, of the dock and plant to rest entirely with the Minister of Public Works or his delegated representative on the work; the actual work of reconstruction and purchase of material therefor to be under the inspection, supervision and control of the representative of the Department of Public Works.\nThe order in council concluded as follows:\u2014\nThe Minister, in view of the foregoing and of the imperative necessity that docking and repairing facilities at Halifax be forthwith re-established and made available at once for ships awaiting repairs in that port, recommends that authority be given, under the War Measures Act, to proceed with the repairing, reconstruction and re-equipment of the dock and plant at that place under the following conditions:\u2014\n1. The Halifax Graving Dock Company, Limited, the owners of the dock damaged, to contribute towards the cost thereof the sum of $111,000.\n2. The balance of the outlay required to be defrayed by the Government from the war appropriation.\n3. The final decision as to the exact nature and extent of the repair, reconstruction and re-equipment of the dock and plant as well as the actual work of reconstruction and purchase of material therefor to be under the inspection, supervision and control of the representative of the Minister of Public Works.\nThe Committee submit the same for approval. A copy of this order in council was in due course sent to the appellant, but the latter took exception to the clause concerning the contribution of $111,000, and in a letter of January 19th, 1918, to the Honourable Mr. F. B. Carvel, Minister of Public Works, stated that\nour understanding is that we are to assign out insurance policies to the Government.\nMr. Hunter, Deputy Minister of Public Works, on January 30th, answered that this was not the arrangement at all, adding:\u2014\nYou are to collect your own insurance policies and hand over the cash results to the Government.\nOn February 2nd, the appellant's chairman answered Mr. Hunter:\n1. have just received your letter of the 30th of January with reference to the insurance policies and temporary and permanent buildings. Both clauses in your letter are quite satisfactory.\nThe appellant relies on this correspondence as constituting the contract whereby it was merely to collect what insurance it could and hand over the cash results to the Government. But obviously the deputy minister could not change the order in council which imposed on the appellant a contribution of $111,000 in money and not of the cash results of its collection of the insurance policies. On the other hand, the appellant did not accept purely and simply the order in council, but qualified its acceptance by insisting on a modification which could only be made by another order in council, and not by the mere acquiescence of the Minister of Public Works. I think this shews that the parties were never ad idem, and therefore that no contract existed between them for the reconstruction of the dry dock. What the Government did was not for the purpose of carrying out any binding contract, but solely to further public interests. And if there was no contract, the appellant's action fails.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. S. Roper.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. L. Hall.\n"

The information given to the solicitor placed before the debtor constituted notice.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment on the trial in favour of the plaintiff bank\nThe only question dealt with on the decision of this appeal was whether or not the appellant had notice of the assignment to the bank of the claim of the respondent The Hibbard Company. The notice to appellant's solicitor was given in the manner set out in the judgments reported. W. P Jones K.C. and T. M. Jones for the appellant. Express notice in writing of the assignment had to be given to the appellant. Dell v. Saunders[1] 4 Hals. Laws of England, page 372, par. 790.\nF. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondents. Notice to the solicitor is notice to the client. Le Neve v. Le Neve [2]; Bradley v. Richer[3].\nW. P Jones K.C. and T. M. Jones for the appellant\nF. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014After much consideration of the facts of this appeal and of the argument of counsel at bar I have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nI concur substantially in the reasons for the judgment of the Appeal Division of New Brunswick, delivered by Sir Douglas Hazen, Chief Justice, where all the material facts are stated, confirming that of Mr. Justice Chandler, the trial judge.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent sued as assignee of several choses in action owing by the appellant, and which had been assigned to the respondent by the Hibbard Company, Limited, as security for advances made to said company.\nThe respondent bank, by notice in writing accompanied by a copy of the said assignment, duly served by mail the Provincial Treasurer of New Brunswick and beyond doubt intended that the like notice should be mailed the appellant's secretary.\nThe proof of the latter mailing of notice is claimed to be rather weak inasmuch as it depends only on the evidence of the stenographer in the office of the said Hibbard Company, in which she testifies as follows:\u2014 Q. Whose work did you mostly do while you were in their office?\nA. Mr. Hibbard's work.\nQ. Will you take communication of the document now shewn you marked No. 33, September 11th, 1914, initialed W.B.C., and state if you recognize that in any way?\nA. Yes, I recognize that as a letter I wrote.\nQ. What would be the date of the writing of that letter?\nA. The date would be exactly the date that is on the letter.\nQ. Do you know whether the letter was mailed or not?\nA. Well I could not say as to the mailing of the letter.\nQ. What would be the ordinary procedure in the office regarding the typing and other details concerning a letter like that?\nA. The ordinary routine generally was that I would take the letter in, you would sign the letter, I would write the envelope and if there was any enclosures put the enclosures in the envelope, get the letter from you signed, and leave the envelope and the letter on the boy's desk. That was the usual procedure.\nQ. Do you recall whether you followed that procedure in regard to this particular letter or not?\nA. I could not positively say in regard to that particular letter, but as a general rule that was the procedure I always followed.\nQ. In what way were copies of letters kept at that time?\nA. Well a carbon copy such as that one would be put into the folder or claim.\nQ. By whom?\nA. By myself.\nThe boy, whoever he was, whose duty it was to do the mailing, is not called. Why is not explained.\nIt is however urged, and with much force, that the Provincial Treasurer was served in same way and received his copy, but I cannot see this fact attested to in such a manner as to shew that the actual writing of that letter and its mailing was concurrent with the other.\nI am, therefore, unable to find that reliance on the routine of business as proof of the mailing is quite as satisfactory as I should wish, but if the courts below had clearly accepted it as such I should not feel inclined to disturb\/?\/ch finding.\nThe courts below do not seem to have relied so much th\/?\/on as upon the notice to the appellant by the knowledge of the attorney under the following peculiar circumstances. There had been suggestions made of a meeting for a settlement between the said company and appellant. In bringing that about there certainly was on the part of appellant's officers, or some of them, a want of courtesy in failing to notify the solicitor for the respondent bank, though he had specially so requested. That has justly given rise to much suspicion and charges needless to consider herein.\nThe solicitor for appellant drew up a form of resolution to be passed by the directors of the Hibbard Company authorizing one Gall, who was treasurer of said company, to negotiate such settlement.\nThe directors, instead of adopting that form of resolution, passed one which in substance covered all that was therein essential, but varied in the essential as to signing any regular and lawful agreement respecting such claims by adding to the words\ngiving full and final discharge for all payments made\nthe following:\nprovided the same be paid into the Bank of British America according to its rights of transfer and subrogation.\nThis clearly to my mind was notice to the solicitor of the fact that respondent had a claim upon the results. The excuse of the solicitor is that he had no concern with that but to produce a resolution such as would be agreeable to his client's instructions.\nI cannot attribute any meaning to this provision except that the respondent contends for in the first place, that it disclosed the rights of the respondent, or, secondly, which is much more destructive of the appellant's contentions, that it knew of the said claims having been definitely assigned to the respondent. The information to the mind of a solicitor directing his attention to it inevitably must have been that the respondent bank was entitled to receive the proceeds by virtue of a transfer. And that would in law be attributable to the appellant. If it chose, as he says, to take the matter into its own hand, sand he was impliedly directed to exclude that provision, so much the worse for the appellant. It either was submitted to his clients or it was not. If not, then the client is bound by his knowledge which to my mind is conclusive. If it was, as I suspect, anticipated by the client, so much the worse for its contentions.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that the judgment appealed from is right.\nHaving considered the authorities cited on the question of notice to the solicitor, and searched further, I find Gale v. Lewis[4], and Tibbets v. George[5], worthy of consideration as of a time antecedent to our present state of the law when the equity rule has precedence, as it were.\nIt was urged that the men at the back of this appeal and litigation are those responsible as sureties to the bank. I am unable to find how such an issue is presented to us on the pleadings, or necessarily arises from anything therein.\nWe might as well speculate on what might have arisen if the Government of New Brunswick, or His Majesty, on behalf of New Brunswick, or the Attorney General therof, could have been in any form brought into the case.\nWe are only dealing with what is in due form brought before us.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014I am not satisfied that express notice in writing within the statute was proved. By applying the test which is now the settled test in all cases of constructive notice I think the proper conclusion is that the officers of the railway company had before them knowledge of facts which ought to have put them on inquiry and that if they had acted with reasonable business prudence they would have learned that the bank had an interest in the Hibbard Company's claim which made the assent of the bank an essential condition of any valid settlement of that claim. I may add, I think it is only fair to add, that I accept Hanson's testimony and have no doubt that he Mr. did not in fact realize what the nature of the bank's claim was.\nAnglin J.\u2014Mr. Jones' able argument failed to convince me that there was error in the conclusions of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick against which his client appeals either as to the sufficiency of the assignment to the respondent bank or as to the existence of constructive notice thereof to the appellant and its effect. Subsequent consideration of the evidence has not disturbed the tentative views which I had formed upon these points at the conclusion of the argument. Substantially for the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick I would affirm the judgment a quo.\nMignault J.\u2014This case comes to us without a dissenting opinion in the courts below, and the finding that sufficient notice was given to the appellant of the transfer to the respondent of the claims of the Hibbard Company, Limited, against the appellant, is a unanimous one and is supported by the very carefully prepared judgments of Mr. Justice Chandler, in the trial court, and of Chief Justice Hazen, in the Appellate Court.\nThe whole circumstances of the case support this holding. Mr. Hanson, the solicitor of the appellant, had prepared a form of resolution to be adopted by the Hibbard Company for the settlement of the claim it had against the appellant. This resolution was returned to him with the added words,\nprovided the same be paid into the Bank of British North America according to its rights of transfer and subrogation.\nIn other words, Mr. Hanson was informed that the amount due by the appellant to the Hibbard Company was to be paid into the bank because the latter had rights of transfer and subrogation. This could only mean that the claim of the company had been assigned to the bank and that the latter was subrogated to the company for its collection.\nMr. Hanson objected to this and another resolution (the one originally prepared by Mr. Hanson) was adopted omitting these words, the result being that Mr. Gall, under this resolution, was able to get payment, out of moneys due to the company and assigned to the bank, of his personal claim against the appellant.\nI have no doubt that Mr. Hanson acted in absolute good faith, for solicitors as a rule object to any change in resolutions drafted by them for the payment of moneys by their clients, the more so if the disposal of the moneys is, by such changes, made subject to conditions or restrictions. But the fact still remains that the addition made to the first draft of the resolution should have put Mr. Hanson on inquiry as to what were the rights of transfer and subrogation of the bank. In plain English it stated that the bank was a transferee of the claim and was subrogated in any right of recovery of the Hibbard Company. Mr. Hanson could not close his eyes to this plain intimation and make an unconditional settlement with Mr. Gall without running the risk of the trouble that has arisen from the action of Mr. Gall in illegally paying himself out of moneys of which, even under Mr. Hanson's draft resolution, he was a trustee. The bank, at the time of the trial, was still a creditor of the Hibbard Company for more than $5,000.00, and, although it had possibly ample security, it had the right to receive any moneys due to the Hibbard Company under the transfer the latter had made to it.\nI feel that I can really add nothing to the judgments in the courts below and my opinion is to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. P. Jones.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F. R. Taylor.\n[1] [1914] 17 D.L.R. 279 and cases cited.\n[2] 3 AC. 646.\n[3] [1878] 9 Ch. D. 189.\n[4] 9 Q.B. 730.\n[5] 5 A. & E. 107.\n"

R. Holden K.C. for the motion.\nE. R. Angers contra. Mignault J.\u2014The petitioner-appellant, the Merchants Bank of Canada, has applied to me under section 74, subsection 3, of \"The Bankruptcy Act\" for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side (Quebec), of the 25th day of October, 1921, whereby its appeal was rejected, on the respondent's motion for the following reasons:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la permission pr\u00e9liminaire de poursuivre donn\u00e9e par la Cour de Faillite ne pr\u00e9juge rien du futur litige et n'emp\u00eache aucunement l'appelante de faire valoir tous les moyens de droit et de fait qu'elle peut opposer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'un jugement accordant telle permission n'est pas sujet au contr\u00f4le de la cour d'appel;\nTo explain the circumstances under which this judgment was rendered, I may say that the respondent, in July last, presented to a judge sitting in bankruptcy a petition under section 35 of \"The Bankruptcy Act,\" praying that he be authorized to take proceedings in the name of the trustee, but at his own expense and risk, to revendicate certain securities which he had furnished to the bankrupt as a margin on certain stock transactions made by him, but which he alleged the bankrupt had fraudulently transferred to the appellant.\nIt appears that in April last an arrangement of the nature of a transaction (art. 1918 C.C.) had been entered into between the trustee, duly authorized by the inspectors and the appellant, whereby the latter was allowed to keep the securities it held for a large claim against the bankrupt, on condition that it would not assert its claim against the estate, this arrangement, between the parties thereto, to have the authority of a final judgment. The respondent's petition coming before Mr. Justice Panneton, judge in bankruptcy, was referred to Mr, Justice Loranger. The present appellant, although it does not appear to have been served with a copy of the petition, appeared by counsel before the learned judge, and producing the above-mentioned arrangement opposed the granting of the petition.\nThe learned judge, however, on the ground that section 35 of \"The Bankruptcy Act\" does not distinguish between a justifiable or an arbitrary refusal of the trustee to institute proceedings, and that however serious the reasons for refusing the authorization might be, these reasons would have their full effect in a plea to the merits, granted the authorization subject to the present respondent furnishing security to the amount of $300.00\nThe petitioner-appellant appealed from this judgment to the Court of King's Bench, but its appeal was dismissed for the reasons above stated, and it now applies for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe parties came before me by their counsel on November 9th and the matter was fully argued.\nThe petitioner-appellant alleged that this appeal involves matters of public interest and important questions of law with reference to the proper construction of the Bankruptcy Act, and that the said questions of law are applicable to the whole Dominion.\nMr. Geoffrion, K.C., for the appellant, argued that it was very important that section 35 of \"The Bankruptcy Act\" be construed by this court. This section reads as follows: If at any time a creditor desires to cause any proceeding to be taken which, in his opinion, would be for the benefit of the bankrupt's or authorized assignor's estate, and the trustee, under the direction of the creditors or inspectors, refuses or neglects to take such proceedings after being duly required to do so, the creditor may, as of right, obtain from the court an order authorizing him to take proceedings in the name of the trustee, but at his own expense and risk upon such terms and conditions as to indemnity to the trustee as the court may prescribe, and thereupon any benefit derived from the proceedings shall, to the extent of his claim and full costs, belong exclusively to the creditor instituting the same; but if, before such order is granted, the trustee shall, with the approval of the inspectors, signify to the court his readiness to institute the proceedings for the benefit of the creditors, the order shall prescribe the time within which he shall do so, and in that case the advantage derived from the proceedings, if instituted within such time, shall belong to the estate.\nMr. Geoffrion however admitted that the only right of which he was deprived by the judgment rendered under section 35\u2014the effect of which was to subrogate the respondent in the rights of the bankrupt's estate with respect to the proceedings which he was authorized to institute in the name of the trustee-was what he termed the right not to be sued in view of the arrangement or transaction above mentioned. I am not convinced that this is any substantial right, for it is obvious that if the transaction has the effect of a final judgment against the bankrupt's estate, the present appellant can set it up by plea and get its full benefit.\nMoreover this court would not be called upon to construe section 35 if special leave to appeal were granted. The judgment of the Court of King's Bench did not construe it, but dismissed the appeal on the ground that Mr. Justice's Loranger's judgment was a mere preparatory judgment and one not subject to the control of the court of King's Bench, and that the preliminary leave to institute proceedings in the name of the trustee did not decide in any way as to the merits of these proceedings, and did not prevent the appellant from availing itself of any defence in law and fact which it might have against the demand of the respondent.\nBut Mr. Geoffrion argued that it would be very important to determine whether the Court of King's Bench should not have entered into the merits of the appeal, and whether it had not jurisdiction to review the judgment granting authorization to institute proceedings in the name of the trustee.\nThe point however really involves the question whether such a preparatory judgment is appealable and, if appealable, whether under the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure the appeal should have been brought as appeals must be from interlocutory judgments, that is to say upon leave obtained. Under \"The Bankruptcy Act\" courts exercise their jurisdiction according to their ordinary procedure (section 63), and the whole question, were special leave granted, would probably be whether the appeal to the Court of King's Bench was properly brought. There would therefore be to my mind no question of public interest justifying the grant of special leave to appeal to this court merely in order to determine whether the Court of King's Bench had jurisdiction to hear the appellant's appeal, or whether the appeal was properly before that court, in view of the provisions of the Quebec law as to interlocutory appeals (arts. 46, 1211 et seq. C.C.P.).\nWhat is certain is that the construction of section 35 of \"The Bankruptcy Act\" could not be passed on by this court if special leave to appeal were granted, nor can I see that any question as to the proper construction of section 74 would be involved in an appeal to this court. The issue would be, as I have said, whether such a judgment is appealable and whether or not the appellant should have followed the rules governing appeals from interlocutory judgments, and this being a question of practice and procedure, I cannot think that this court would interfere with the decision of the court below.\nOn the whole my opinion is that I would not be justified in granting special leave to appeal (for a reference to decisions governing the grant of special leave see my judgment in Riley v. Curtis's & Harvey, Limited[1]), and the appellant's petition is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1919] 59 Can. S.C.R. 206.\n"

[1914] c. 192, s. 478\u2014Surveys Act, R.S.O. [1914] c. 166, s. 13.\nOwing to a dispute between a municipality and M. as to whether or not some of the land claimed by the latter was part of the highway the Municipality applied to the Department of Lands, Forests and Mines for a survey which was made and confirmed by an order of the Minister. M. then moved his fence to the boundary thereby established.\nSec. 13 (4) of the Surveys Act provides that \u201cthe order of the Minister confirming the survey shall be final and conclusive upon all persons and shall not be questioned in any court.\u201d In an action by M. to restrain the municipality from tearing down his fence the latter invoked the provisions of sec. 478 of the Municipal Act that where a municipality desiring to open an original road allowance by mistake opens a road not wholly upon such allowance the private land included shall be deemed to be expropriated.\nHeld, per Davies C.J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ., that the road allowance this case was opened long before any such provision was placed in the Municipal Act and sec. 478 could not be invoked. The order of the Minister confirming the survey was conclusive and the boundaries established thereunder must be accepted.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ., that the order of the Minister is final and the municipality cannot claim any boundary other than that established by the survey.\nPer Duff J. The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mulock C.J. in the appellate division.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 459) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the respondent.\nThe respondent was, and is, the owner of lots numbers 4, 5 and 6 in the Gore Concession of the township of Zone, in the county of Kent, and brought his action against the appellants for an injunction and damages for the tearing down of the fences erected by the respondent upon his said lots, for a mandatory order compelling the appellants to re-erect the fences torn down by them, and for such other relief as the respondent might be declared to be entitled to.\nThe council of the appellants, in May, 1915, under the provisions of \u201cThe Surveys Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, chapter 166, applied to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to cause the base line from the road allowance between concessions three and four, in the said township of Zone, to be surveyed and to be marked by monuments of stone or other durable material, under the direction and order of the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines, in the manner described by the said Act.\nThe survey was duly made by G.A. McCubbin, O.L.S., an engineer appointed by the said Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines, and the survey so made was confirmed by the said Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines, in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, and an order confirming the same was duly made by the said Minister.\nNotwithstanding the said order confirming the survey, the appellants, in September, 1919, by their servants, agents and workmen, entered upon the said lands of the respondent and tore down and damaged or destroyed his fences thereon, and after the respondent had re-erected his said fences the appellants, in November, 1919, by their servants, agents and workmen, entered upon the said lands of the respondent and again tore down and destroyed them, and threatened to enter and tear down any fences which he might erect upon his said lands.\nThe action was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Orde, who reserved his decision, and subsequently, by his judgment, declared that the survey made by the said George A. McCubbin, O.L.S., is final and conclusive as establishing the boundary line of that part of the road allowance, commonly called the Base Line, which it covers, ordered and restrained the appellants, their servants, workmen and agents from trespassing upon the respondent\u2019s lands, and from tearing down and removing his fences, directed a reference to the local master to assess the respondent\u2019s damages, ordered the appellants to pay the damages so found by the master, and ordered the appellants to pay the costs of the action.\nThe appellants appealed and the Appellate Division affirmed this judgment.\nSec. 13, sub-sec. 4 of the Surveys Act provides that \u201c(4) On the return of such survey to the Minister he shall cause a notice thereof to be published once in each week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the county or district town of the county or district in which the lands lie, and shall specify in the notice a day, not less than ten days after the last publication, on which the report of the survey will be considered, and the parties affected thereby heard, and on the hearing the Minister may either confirm the survey or direct such amendments or corrections to be made as he shall deem just, and shall confirm the survey so amended or corrected, and the lines or parts of the lines so surveyed and marked shall thereafter be the permanent boundary lines of such concession or side roads or parts of concessions or side roads to all intents and purposes, and the order of the Minister confirming the survey shall be final and conclusive upon all persons and shall not be questioned in any court.\u201d\nSec. 478 of the Municipal Act relied on by the appellant reads as follows:\u2014\n(1) Where the Council of a municipality desiring to open an original allowance for road has by mistake opened a road which was intended to be, but is not wholly or partly upon such allowance, the land occupied by the road as so opened shall be deemed to have been expropriated under a by-law of the corporation and no person on whose land such road or any part of it was opened shall be entitled to bring or maintain an action for or in respect of what was done or to recover possession of this land, but he shall be entitled to compensation under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act as for land expropriated under the powers conferred by this Act.\n(2) The right to compensation shall be forever barred if the compensation is not claimed within one year after the land was first taken possession of by the corporation. 3-4 Geo. 5, c. 43, s. 478.\nPike K.C. for the appellant. The highway is the whole land between the fences and it is not necessary that all the space should be fit for travel. See Walton v. Corporation of York[3], at page 188; Sibbald v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[4], at page 190. The evidence shows that this road was used as a public highway for over fifty years which shifts the burden of proof to the plaintiff. Chicago v. Chicago &c., Ry. Co.[5]\nHellmuth K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs and concur in the reasons for judgment as stated by my brother Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This case might have been so presented as to raise some important questions of law governing the rights of litigants similarly situated, but I doubt if on the evidence any satisfactory decision of such a character can be reached.\nThe base line road, so called, within appellant\u2019s jurisdiction, for some reason or other, or none at all so far as appears in evidence, was constructed in such irregular fashion that a contest arose between the landowners on either side claiming that those opposite them had got an advantage by reason of the actual road not being placed where it should have been. This resulted in an application being made under section 13 of the Surveyors\u2019 Act by the appellant\u2019s council to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to cause the concession lines to be surveyed on either side of that part of said base line now in question and to be marked by monuments as provided by said statutory provision.\nThe authority so applied to duly directed such survey and it was proceeded with at some considerable expense and trouble. The necessary steps to enforce the results reported by Mr. McCubbin, the surveyor chosen, were duly taken and the line so surveyed was duly established.\nWhen it became evident what such results would be the appellant\u2019s council sought to revoke its application, but the Minister in charge of such subject matters after due consideration declined to accede to such request.\nWhen the process directed for establishing such concession lines had been duly completed the respondent, as owner of several lots fronting upon said base line, moved out his fence to the McCubbin line so established.\nThe appellant directed his fences to be torn down more than once.\nThe respondent then brought this action to restrain such conduct on appellant\u2019s part, and the trial resulted in a judgment of Mr. Justice Orde holding that appellant, having appealed to the tribunal duly constituted to hear and determine such like issues, must abide by the result and that in accord with such result the respondent was right and appellant wrong, and granted the injunction asked by respondent against appellant\u2019s council repeating its lawless proceeding of tearing down respondent\u2019s fences placed on the McCubbin line, and to pay such damages as already done and, if the parties could not agree on that, same to be settled by a reference, and to pay respondent\u2019s costs.\nThe appellant sought relief in the second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. That court held that, on the facts adduced in evidence, it was unnecessary to determine the question which may be properly raised some day, of how far the line laid down by a survey pursuant to section 13 of the Survey Act can invade the actual travelled highway upon which public money has been expended in construction thereof, and dismissed the appeal. In answering that, which I think a quite correct view if the evidence supports it, I am surprised to find that appellant does not seem to have come prepared with a case presenting evidence to meet such an obvious view of the law.\nIts conception of a highway, under such circumstances, is not that travelled on and upon which public money has been actually expended to make it travellable, but that all that happened to exist, rightfully or wrongfully, between the fences on either side must be held to be the highway within the meaning of what we have to deal with.\nAccordingly, turning to the evidence upon which it relies herein, one of the first assertions in the factum for appellant in this connection is that where plaintiff moved his fences \u201cwas on the graded portion of the road.\u201d\nTurning to the evidence I am surprised to find the following:\u2014\nQ.\u2014And your fence was moved out where it would obstruct travel to some extent on the road? A.\u2014I don\u2019t think so.\nQ.\u2014It was on the travelled portion of the road, on the graded portion? A.\u2014Well, you could use it for a car if you wished.\nQ.\u2014Yes, that was over in a ditch there was on the south side? A.\u2014There was no watercourse on the south side\nQ.\u2014So that it was really all the way that could be travelled? A.\u2014It could be travelled, but it was on grass I put the posts, not on the travelled part.\nThis illustrates appellant\u2019s point of view in regard to the whole case and its contention to be that despite the old definition in the Municipal Act of 1866, and long before and after, being as follows\n315. All allowances made for roads by the Crown surveyors in any town, township or place already laid out, or hereafter laid out, and also all roads laid out by virtue of any Act of the Parliament of Upper Canada, or any roads whereon the public money has been expended for opening the same, or whereon the statute labour hath been usually performed, or any roads passing through the Indian Lands, shall be deemed common and public highways, unless where such roads have been already altered, or may hereafter be altered according to law,\nthe highway is what lands happen to be found between the two fences on either side.\nI submit you cannot extend the statutory definition beyond the actual roadway unless coupled with other circumstances such as the original survey, or the dedication by someone, or some such right to claim expansion beyond that part travelled upon or improved so as to be travelled upon.\nCounsel for appellant in argument expressly renounced any claim resting upon dedication.\nAs demonstrating appellant\u2019s contention to be such as I ascribe to it, I find a mass of evidence that does not pretend to adhere to the travelled way as the highway, but takes as the sole guide, to ascertain and determine that, the farm fences on either side, sometimes very feeble and irregular at that if one applies common knowledge as to conditions in this country.\nThe very interesting question of law of whether or not the actual travelled and graded highway in use having had public money expended upon it and been found beyond the bounds presented by a report such as that of Mr. McCubbin in question herein, can yet be declared, by virtue thereof, to be receded as it were to the rightful owner, does not seem to me to arise on the evidence presented in this case.\nApart from such a question of fact giving rise to a necessary solution of that problem, there is nothing in this appeal.\nI am not prepared to declare that the view of the evidence taken by the court below is erroneous and upon the facts as in the judgment declared I am not prepared to say that court is wrong, and in regard to the relevant law applied thereto I think that court clearly right.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. I concur in the reasons given by Mulock C.J. in the Appellate Division.\nANGLIN J.\u2014That under the original survey the strip of land in dispute formed part of lot 4 now owned by the respondent is, I think, conclusively established by the confirmation of the McCubbin survey by the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines under s. 13 of the Surveys Act, R.S.O. [1914], c. 166. The appellant, defendant, nevertheless asserts that it is part of the highway known as the Base Line. It rests this claim neither on prescription nor dedication, but solely on the effect of s. 478 of the Municipal Act (R.S.O., [1914], c. 192), which reads as follows:\u2014\n478. (1) Where the council of a municipality desiring to open an original allowance for road has by mistake opened a road which was intended to be, but is not wholly or partly, upon such allowance, the land occupied by the road as so opened shall be deemed to have been expropriated under a by-law of the corporation, and no person on whose land such road or any part of it was opened shall be entitled to bring or maintain an action for or in respect of what was done or to recover possession of his land, but he shall be entitled to compensation under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act as for land expropriated under the powers conferred by this Act.\n(2) The right to compensation shall be forever barred if the compensation is not claimed within one year after the land was first taken possession of by the corporation.\nThe learned trial judge held that the operation of that section was superseded by the confirmation of the McCubbin survey by the Minister under s. 13 of the Surveys Act. The Appellate Divisional Court, expressing no opinion on that point, based its judgment dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal, on the ground that because there is no evidence shewing the performance of any statute labour or expenditure of any public money on any portion of the strip in question, nor so far as appears has it ever been used as a highway,\nthat strip of land had not been shewn to be part of \u201cthe land occupied by a road\u201d opened by the municipal council by mistake within s. 478 of the Municiapl Act.\nWhile there is, no doubt, cogent evidence given by the engineer Flater, called by the plaintiff, that the strip of land in question at no point encroached on the travelled way, with great respect there is some testimony adduced by the defendants that some of the permanent boundary posts planted by McCubbin were on the graded roadway and there is also evidence that the ditch on the south side of the via trita and some small part of the latter itself were within the disputed strip.\nBut in the view I take of the purview of s. 478 of the Municipal Act, it is unnecessary to rest a judgment on the determination of that issue of fact which, if found in the appellant\u2019s favour, would probably cover only a comparatively small part of the land in dispute and would render another survey necessary, unless, as held by the learned trial judge, the McCubbin survey should be deemed to have fixed finally the boundaries of the highway by virtue of the provisions of the Surveys Act.\nWhat is now s. 478 of the Municipal Act was first enacted in 1881 by 44 V., c. 34, secs. 15 and 16:\u2014\n15. In case it appears that any municipality in whose jurisdiction an original road, or allowance for road is situate, shall open that which they take and believe to be the true site of the same, and in case the municipality their officers and servants shall act in good faith, and shall take all reasonable means to inform themselves of the correctness of their line and work, and in case it appears that the road being opened, although not or not altogether upon the true line of the original road, or allowance for road, is nevertheless, from any difficulty in discovering correctly the true line, as near to or as nearly upon the true line as under the circumstances could then be ascertained, no action shall be brought by any person against the municipality, their officers or servants, for or in respect of the opening of such road or allowance for road, or for any other act or matter whatsoever connected with or arising from the same.\n16. The municipality shall, however, in any case respecting the opening of an original road, or road allowance, make to any person having title to or interest in the same, reasonable compensation in full of all claims, and as a final settlement of the same: Provided the claims for such compensation shall be made within one year from the time of the laying out or taking possession of such road by the municipality or its officers, or the part thereof in respect of which compensation is claimed, and in the event of the parties not agreeing as to the amount or terms of such compensation, the same shall be ascertained and the payment thereof enforced, under the provisions of the Municipal Act relating to arbitrations.\nThe character of these provisions makes it reasonably certain that they were meant to apply only to roads thereafter opened or laid out. The verbs \u201cshall open,\u201d \u201cshall act,\u201d and \u201cshall take\u201d in the future tense, so indicate, and the restriction of the provision for compensation to claims \u201cwhich shall be made within one year, etc.,\u201d seems to put that beyond doubt. There is nothing to shew that the municipality \u201copened\u201d or \u201claid out\u201d the road known as the Base Line. On the contrary it would rather seem that the owners of the adjoining lands on either side had erected fences on what they conceived to be the boundaries of their lots as best they could leaving what they regarded as the road allowance between them. There is no evidence in the record that the officers and servants of the municipality \u201cacted in good faith\u201d or that they took \u201call reasonable means to inform themselves of the correctness of their line and work,\u201d or that the road opened was\nfrom any difficulty in discovering correctly the true line as near to or as nearly upon the true line as under the circumstances could then be ascertained. The evidence puts it beyond doubt that the Base Line road had been in use as a travelled highway for about 60 years, that is for some twenty years before the statute of 1881 was enacted.\nSections 15 and 16 of the statute of 1881 were carried into the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1892 (55 Vict., ch. 42) as section 549 in substantially the same form as in the original enactment of 1881. In the Revision of 1897[6] the future subjunctive \u201cshall open\u201d was replaced by the present \u201copens.\u201d The section was carried in the same form into the consolidation of 1903, 3 Edw. VII., ch. 19, sec. 635. \u201cOpen\u201d was in the revision of 1913 substituted for \u201copens,\u201d and the conditions as to good faith, care and unavoidable error are now covered by the comprehensive phrase\nwhere the municipality desiring to open an original allowance for road has by mistake opened a road which was intended to be, but is not, wholly or partly upon such allowance.\nAt the same time an idea which had theretofore been left to implication was expressed in the words \u201cthe land occupied by the road * * shall be deemed to have been expropriated,\u201d and the provision restricting the right to recover compensation to claims made within one year \u201cafter the land was first taken possession of by the corporation\u201d was retained.\nI have no doubt whatever that section 478 does not apply to the road here in question. Apart from the other reasons for that conclusion above indicated, the fact that it was opened long before there was any such statutory provision seems to me to be conclusive against the claim of the appellant. Any difficulty presented by section 478 being thus removed, there appears to be no valid reason for not giving effect to the provision of subsection 4 of section 13 of the Surveys Act, that the lines surveyed and marked on a survey approved by the Minister under that section\nshall thereafter be the permanent boundary lines of such concession or side roads * * * to all intents and purposes and the order of the Minister confirming the survey shall be final and conclusive upon all persons, and shall not be questioned in any court.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014There had been for years a dispute as to the true location of the original road allowance of the Base Line in the township of Zone. This township had been surveyed about a century ago and the adjoining proprietors of the Base Line had erected fences to divide their farms from the highway.\nIn 1915, the council of the appellant township resolved, at McDowell\u2019s request, to bring a government engineer to establish the true line of the road allowance. The Government under the provisions of the Survey Act (ch. 166 R.S.C. ss. 13 and 14) sent an engineer, Mr. McCubbin, to make the survey. The survey as reported was evidently adverse to the township\u2019s claims and the township then rescinded its resolution asking for this official survey; but the Minister of Lands and Forests would not accept such a rescission and confirmed the survey which, according to the provisions of the law, became \u201cfinal and conclusive upon all parties\u201d and could not be questioned thereafter in any court whatsoever. The municipality now urges that section 478 of the Municipal Act should apply. This section provides that where a municipality desiring to open an original allowance for road has by mistake opened a road which was intended to be but which is not wholly or partly upon such allowance, then the land occupied by the road as so opened shall be considered as having been duly expropriated.\nIt seems to me that the municipality, having requested the provincial authorities to determine the boundary line between its highway and the adjoining land owners, is debarred from asking for any other boundary than the one declared by such provincial authorities. There never was on the additional piece of land which the township now claims any statute labour nor the expenditure of any public money. It is not in evidence either that this piece of land was used as a public highway.\nFor those reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilson, Pike & Stewart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith & Fisher.\n[1] 48 Ont.

Harrison (Defendant) Respondent.\n1921: June 14; 1921: October 11.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nCovenant\u2014Conveyance of right of way\u2014Defined road\u2014Maintenance\u2014Subsequent destruction of road\u2014Impossibility of performance.\nWhere, in a deed of land bordering on Lake Erie, the vendor grants to the vendee a right of way over a defined road with a covenant to maintain said road and keep it in repair the destruction of the road by encroachment of the waters of the lake excuses him from restoring it or providing a substituted right of way when there is nothing to show that the parties intended to agree therefor.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiff (appellant).\nA deed from the respondent to one Graham, of land bordering on Lake Erie contained the following clause:\u2014\n\u201cPROVIDED and it is further agreed by and between the party of the first part, her heirs and assigns, and the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns that the party of the second part shall have a right of way to his said lands over a certain road shown upon the said plan as Harrison Place, running north-easterly and south-westerly as shown upon the said plan and the party of the first part agrees to maintain the said road and bridges thereon in as good condition as the same are now, and the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, agree with the party of the first part, her heirs and assigns, to close the gates across the said roadway whenever he or they may have occasion to use said gates.\u201d\nSaid Graham conveyed to appellant the property, consisting of two lots, described in said deed except half of one lot.\nThe lake took by erosion all the road called Harrison Place and respondent laid out a new road in its place. Appellant, however, claimed that she was obliged to maintain the former road as it existed when the deed was given to Graham and brought an action to compel her to do so. The trial judge gave judgment in her favour directing the respondent to restore the road to its original condition or to furnish a road and bridges in all respects as suitable. The Appellate Division reversed his judgment holding that by the erosion the title to the road had reverted to the Crown and performance of the covenant would be illegal.\nLafleur K.C. and Braden for the appellant. If the vendor wished to guard himself against the contingency which happened he should have made provision therefor in the deed. See Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal Navigation v. Pritchard[3]; Jacobs v. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais[4].\nImpossibility of performance is no excuse in this case. The loss of the road was not caused by the act of God but by failure of respondent to protect it. See Pandorf v. Hamilton[5], at page 675; Nugent v. Smith[6]. H.J. Scott K.C. and McEvoy for the respondent, cited Haywood v. Brunswick Permanent Building Soc.[7]; Andrew v. Aitken[8]; Austerberry v. Oldham[9].\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The covenant upon which the appellant sued herein, given by respondent in a deed by which she granted to one Graham two town lots of land of which he afterwards assigned the smaller one to appellant, does not seem to me to be clearly one that runs with the land.\nIt was a covenant to maintain a road and bridges thereon (by which access could be had to the land so granted) in as good condition as same were at the time of the grant.\nThe proviso containing said covenant began by stating that it was agreed by and between the grantor, her heirs and assigns, and the grantee, his heirs and assigns, that the grantee should have a right of way over a certain road shewn on a plan, and ended by a covenant of the grantee binding him, his heirs and assigns to close the gates across said roadway.\nFrom this it clearly was a private right of way and was of some considerable length and seems to have served a number of places before reaching the point of approach to the land conveyed.\nEven if the covenant would run with the land so conveyed. I doubt if, having regard to the surrounding circumstances as well as the language used, it could be held to do so in a sense that any assignee, as appellant is, of a small part only of the land granted should enjoy the benefit of same. The law is to be found in Spencer\u2019s Case[10] and the notes thereto in Vol. I of Smith\u2019s Leading Cases (12 ed.) page 62.\nThe grantor can hardly have contemplated keeping up such a road for a colony and forever.\nThen the road at the point in question seems rather remote from the land in question and it may only be one of the many collateral things that have been held not to be of the nature of that which must be the foundation for a covenant running with the land.\nThe points of objection resting upon the right of appellant to sue were taken here for the first time. And in deference to the argument so presented as well as curiosity I have considered the cases cited and much in Spencer\u2019s Case10 and notes thereto cited above, withcout coming to any other definite conclusion than that, if there had been any doubt in my mind as to part of the ground upon which the judgment appealed from is rested in the court below, I should have desired a reargument on this phase of the case. The suggestion I make, as to the appellant not being the assignee of the whole, is my own and if resorted to needs an argument devoted thereto.\nI have considered very fully the grounds taken in the argument in the court below, and have come to the conclusion that the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division presiding in the second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario are, in the main, correct but that it is not necessary to go quite so far as to hold that the mere periodical covering of an eroded part by a few inches of lake water, inevitably leads to a reversion of that part of the land in question to the Crown. But assuredly herein, it the pretensions set up by the appellant are correct, much more than operating on a small part to counteract that which seems inevitable would have to be done by the respondent, or should have been done by her, to protect, by works such as witnesses speak of, the base of the road in question. That would involve what is contemplated by the reasons of the Chief Justice which would be applicable in the sense of interfering with navigation or the right of the Dominion to assert dominion over the space involved.\nI do not think we need go further than the observance of the rule as to what could be held to have been possibly within the contemplation of the parties as I suggested during the argument herein.\nI find justification therefor in the judgment of Lord Kenyon C.J., in the case, cited by counsel for respondent, of The Company of Proprietors of The Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal Navigation v. Pritchard & Others[11], wherein a somewhat similar covenant to that in question herein was involved.\nIn disposing of it he said:\u2014\nThis sort of loss must have been in the contemplation of all the parties in this case; the bridge was to be built in such a manner as to resist any body of water.\nSuch was the nature of the contract there in question. Such is not the nature of the contract here in question.\nThe pretension that such a contract as involved herein (merely in respect of and for the sale of two village lots worth together twelve hundred dollars), necessarily involves the possibilities of expending a fortune for discharging the obligation, is, to my mind, quite unthinkable. If any one has pretended to say that such was involved in fact I beg leave to doubt his recollection and would feel inclined to doubt that the statement had ever reached the mind of respondent.\nLet us apply our common sense to such pretensions and there is an end of such stories.\nIn my view it never was within the contemplation of either of the parties that in the event of that happening, which has happened, the respondent was bound by such a covenant as this to restore the road in question. If such a case had been presented to either as within the possibilities contemplated we never would have been troubled with this covenant or this case.\nI rely, of course, on the cases cited and other reasons based thereon in said judgment of the Chief Justice, to which I have not specifically referred.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The proviso in the grant from the defendant to Graham upon which the decision of this appeal turns is in these words:\u2014\nProvided and it is further agreed by and between the party of the first part, her heirs and assigns, and the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, that the party of the second part shall have a right of way to his said lands over a certain road shewn upon the said plan as Harrison Place, running north-easterly and south-westerly as shewn upon the said plan, and the party of the first part agrees to maintain the said road and bridges thereon in as good condition as the same are now, and the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, agrees with the party of the first part, her heirs and assigns, to close the gates across the said roadway whenever he or they may have occasion to use said gates.\nThe right of way reserved is therefore a right of way on a defined road and it is that defined road which the defendant covenanted to maintain. The Appellate Division was, I think, entirely right in holding that the covenant did not contemplate the case of the destruction of the substratum of the road by the inroads of the lake. The case is within the broad principle upon which the rule in Taylor v. Caldwell[12] rests, if not embraced within the terms of the rule itself. The parties clearly contracted on the footing that the site of the road should continue to exist. I say they clearly did so because, having regard to all the circumstances, one cannot suppose that reasonable persons, having clearly in view the contingency which happened, would on the one hand have exacted or on the other hand agreed to enter into an unqualified covenant to protect the site of the road from the invasion of the lake.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Two questions arise in this case\u2014one as to the construction of the grant by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor of a right of way\nover a certain road shewn * * * as Harrison Place\nand her covenant\nto maintain the said road and bridges thereon in as good a condition as the same are now,\nand the other as to the plaintiff\u2019s right to claim the benefit of this covenant. In the view I take of the first question it will be unnecessary to deal with the second.\nThe learned trial judge (Falconbridge C.J.) held the plaintiff entitled to recover and ordered the defendant to furnish, construct and maintain over her lands a road and bridges as suitable, sufficient and convenient for the plaintiff as the road known as Harrison Place was at the date of the defendant\u2019s conveyance to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. Damages were also awarded for breach of the covenant.[13] The Appellate Divisional Court reversed this judgment, holding that the erosion of the site of Harrison Place by encroachment of the waters of Lake Erie had relieved the defendant from all liability under her covenant.[14] The fact of the erosion is common ground.\nWith very great respect, I fail to find anything in the agreement for the right of way or in the covenant to maintain it which would entitle the plaintiff or her assignor, were he suing, to such a substituted right of way as the judgment of the lamented Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench awarded. The grant is of a right of way over Harrison Place; the covenant is to maintain said road and bridges thereon.\nHarrison Place having ceased to exist without any default of the defendant, I agree in the view of the learned judges of the Appellate Divisional Court that her obligation under the covenant sued upon thereupon lapsed. I cannot usefully add anything to the reasons for this conclusion stated by the learned Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division.\nThe question is purely one of construction of the terms of the covenant, which must, of course, be read in the light of the circumstances under which it was made. But I do not find either in the language of the agreement and covenant per se or in the circumstances under which they were entered into, as disclosed by the evidence, anything that would warrant imposing upon the defendant an obligation\u2014almost certainly impossible of performance\u2014to protect the road in question against invasion by the waters of Lake Erie. That cannot reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties. The case in my opinion falls within the principle of the line of authorities of which Taylor v. Caldwell[15], is the best known and Tamplin Steamship Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co.[16], is a modern instance, rather than within that of Paradine v. Jane[17], and Atkinson v. Ritchie[18], relied on by the late learned Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench. The law seems to be well stated in paragraphs 717 and 718 of Vol. 13 of Corpus Juris, which the learned Chief Justice cited but thought not applicable. The case at bar I think falls within the exception noted in par. 713 rather than under the general rule stated in the passage from par. 711 quoted by the learned Chief Justice. The language of Hannen J. in Baily v. De Crespigny[19], at page 185, appears to be in point.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The obligation incurred by the respondent under her contract with the appellant\u2019s auteurs was to maintain a certain road therein described. This road having been destroyed by the act of God, her obligation is at an end.\nThe parties contracted on the basis of the continued existence of the road its subsequent perishing excuses the performance (Corpus Juris, vol. 13, p. 642, sect. 717). There is an implied condition that the impossibility of performing the obligation puts an end to the obligation of keeping the road in repair. The word \u201cmaintain\u201d could not cover the obligation of re-establishing the road if it were washed away by the action of the waves. It means to keep in repair the road in question. It could not be construed in the circumstances as an obligation of reconstructing works which by their high cost could never have been contemplated by the parties.\nThis contract should be read as containing an implied condition that the respondent should be excused if the breach became impossible from the perishing of the thing without default of the contractor. Taylor v. Caldwell[20]; Appleby v. Myers[21].\nNo reasonable suggestion can be offered that the destruction of the road was due to the negligence or the fault of Harrison.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gibbons, Harper & Brodeur.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.M.

L.R. 386) Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the documents could be read together and constituted a sufficient memorandum in writing of a contract of purchase to satisfy the Statute of Frauds; that the date, May 1st, 1920, on which the cash payment was to be made and security given for the balance of the purchase money indicated the time for taking possession; and that a stipulation that the mortgage would bear interest could be implied, the rate to be five per centum as provided by statute.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. G.F. Henderson K.C. and Hattin for the appellant. The finding of the trial judge that the parties had reached an agreement should not have been disturbed by the Appellate Division. Morrow v. Ogilvie Flour Mills Co.[2]; Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern Ry. Co.[3] And see McKenzie v. Walsh[4].\nThe receipt and the cheque can be read together. Doran v. McKinnon[5]; Stokes v. Whicher[6].\nThe mortgage would bear interest if the contrary is not expressed. Martin v. Jarvis[7], at page 374; Fry on Specific Performance (5 ed.) paras. 368 and 372.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondent. The complete agreement must appear in writing. Douglas v. Baynes[8].\nThe cheque is not referred to in the memorandum and they cannot be read together. Stokes v. Whicher[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by Sir William Meredith, Chief Justice of Ontario, in his dissenting opinion in the Appeal Court of Ontario (First Division), in which I fully concur, and to which I have nothing useful to add, I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant sues for specific performance of an agreement contained in the following:\u2014 Kitchener, Ont., Dec. 29, 1919.\nReceived from Clayton Peterson the sum of one hundred dollars, on deposit for house at 62 St. George St., $1,400 payable May 1st, 1920, and balance of $2,300 on 5 year mortgage.\nAdeline Bitzer.\nThe respondent, besides denying such an agreement as appellant sets up, pleads the Statute of Frauds.\nThe learned trial judge finds as a matter of fact that the rate of interest was not mentioned or discussed. And I may add from a perusal of the evidence that the question of interest was never spoken of by any one until some time after above foundation for this suit.\nThat fact seems conclusively established by the evidence of appellant wherein he spoke as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Was there any discussion then as to interest on the mortgage? A.\u2014No, there was not.\nQ.\u2014The memorandum which is Exhibit No. 1 here, does that contain all that was discussed at that day? A.\u2014Everything.\nAnd more than that it was some days later when having realized that they had not discussed about the driveway to the lot, the size of the lot and the rate of interest, he sought out respondent\u2019s son, who had been present at the signing of said receipt (and in fact wrote it as appellant dictated it), and pretends that the son assented to the change he desired made in the receipt.\nThe said son admits appellant\u2019s visit to him where he was working but denies that he assented to any of such changes and further says that appellant wished him to insert words in the receipt to cover said points. This he properly refused to do and said he would tell his mother what appellant said.\nIt seems to me highly probable that this is the correct version of what transpired on that occasion especially as no more passed between them till a month later when the said son, on behalf of respondent, tendered back to the appellant the cheque which had never been used or indorsed by respondent.\nThat cheque reads as follows:\u2014\nKitchener, Ont., Dec. 29, 1919.\nTo Canadian Bank of Commerce, (Name of Bank)\nWaterloo, Ont. (Branch) )\nPay to the order of Mrs. Adeline Bitzer, $100.00 (one hundred dollars), deposit on 62 St. George St., at purchase price of $3,800.00, $1,400.00 payable on May 1st, 1920, and assume a 5-year mortgage of $2,300.00.\nC. Peterson.\nIt is attempted to strengthen appellant\u2019s case under the above receipt as a compliance with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds by insisting that both must be read together.\nIf she had used or indorsed this cheque of course that would be a fair argument. Inasmuch as she did neither the cheque, in my opinion, cannot be read as part of what she is presumed to have bound herself by in writing.\nIn all the cases relied upon herein by appellant in that regard, none as I read them has gone so far.\nAnd in any event it does not help the case made by the receipt in any regard except to indicate that it was a purchase of the property that was involved.\nBoth read together in any way one may desire do not cover the terms of interest.\nI most respectfully submit that without a word said in the bargaining as to interest, a vital part of every bargain of the kind, the court cannot read into this receipt or into both documents taken together, a provision as to interest\u2014either to provide for interest or the rate of interest. No case is cited that ever went so far and I venture to think that until this none is to be found so naked as this now presented.\nInterest at the statutory rate is implied in many cases determining the sum payable as damages.\nBut this is of an entirely different character and under a statute that requires the essential features of the bargain to be set forth in a writing binding the party sought to be held liable.\nTo say that a mortgage necessarily implies the legal rate of interest would surprise many people in some parts of our Dominion where the vendor generally looks for a good deal more than five per cent per annum upon balances of unpaid purchase money.\nNay more, I venture to think if we so decided we would enable dishonest men desiring to take advantage of vendors to act upon this receipt as a model, and try to cheat the unwary vendor out of the difference between five and six, seven or eight per cent per annum.\nIt is to be observed as said elsewhere that the receipt (by omitting the word \u201cpurchase\u201d) does not shew that it is for any purchase and hence cases cited such as Hughes v. Parker[10], shewing the purchase is prima facie that of the fee simple, relied upon by the learned trial judge, are not applicable.\nAnd again, the help got from the cheque if it had been so incorporated therewith as it might have been either by indorsement thereof, or an express reference thereto in the receipt, must have regard to the assuming of a mortgage. The only existent mortgage possibly referred to, was that to Magdalena Clemens which bore interest at five and a half per cent, payable semiannually. And that mortgage happens to be for only two thousand dollars. One argument might have been raised that as no interest was named the mortgage was to be one without interest, which is by no means an unheard of thing.\nUnfortunately for appellant he recognized the omission and says he agreed with young Bitzer for a six per cent rate. And in light of that and other features of the case the courts should not enforce such a claim by directing specific performance.\nYet it is worth while turning the light that way as a means of shewing what change is involved in reading into a contract which is required by law to be in writing something not there but clearly omitted by mistake which would be another ground for refusing specific performance.\nThere are other features of the case which present difficulties of a kind like unto the interest question, but one such (fatal as I hold) seems to me enough to deal with at such length.\nI may in parting from this case point out how the common sense of the appellant led him to realize the mistakes he had made, and need for amending the contract, so called.\nAnd when the alleged contract was repudiated how far beyond what is usual took place in making a tender of deeds and mortgages.\nIf indeed the case is so clear on the alleged legal authorities and principles of law involved, why did it require so many alternative tenders and such length of exposition in making clear what the tender as made really meant?\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. I agree for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Ferguson that the cheque cannot be looked at and that being so there are essential terms of the contract which are not mentioned in the document relied upon as a memorandum.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The receipt of one hundred dollars signed by Mrs. Bitzer on the 29th of December, 1919, and handed over to the plaintiff Peterson, is a document which contains all the essential terms of a contract for the sale of the property therein mentioned. The parties, property and price are all included. If it was simply an option, as contended by the respondent, it would have been written in a different way. This court which had to construe lately an almost similar document in the case of McKenzie v. Walsh[11], came to the conclusion that such a receipt complied with the requirements of the statute of frauds.\nThe receipt in the present case did not specifically mention that the money was paid for the purchase of a property as in McKenzie v. Walsh11But the price stipulated could not apply to a lease of the property. Besides, the cheque which was given by the appellant to the respondent for one hundred dollars ($100), which was accepted and kept for some time by Mrs. Bitzer, was more explicit in that respect than the receipt itself since it specified that it was given for a purchase price.\nThe two documents, namely, the cheque and the receipt, could be read together. Doran v. McKinnon [12]; Stokes v. Whicher[13]. In the last case of Stokes v. Whicher13, the document signed by the vendor did not contain the purchaser\u2019s name. But as a cheque had been given by the purchaser for the deposit stipulated in the document, it was held that the documents and the cheque could be read together to ascertain the purchaser\u2019s name and form a sufficient memorandum to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nIt is contended by Mrs. Bitzer that the document did not contain any date at which possession was to take place.\nThe 1st of May, 1920, was stipulated as the date at which the cash payment was to be made and at the same time a mortgage was to be given for the balance of the purchase price. In the absence of a contrary intention appearing possession should take place at that date. The date of payment of the purchase money may be regarded as the date of completion (Halsbury, Vol. 25, No. 625).\nIt is contended also by the respondent, Mrs. Bitzer, that there is no stipulation as to the interest on the mortgage.\nA mortgage agreement generally provides for interest.

J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nNegligence\u2014Contract of sale\u2014Fire-arm\u2014Latent defect\u2014Injuries\u2014 Liability\u2014Delictual fault\u2014Articles 1053, 1070, 1491, 1522, 1527 C.C.\nThe appellant was a manufacturer of sportsmen's rifles which, when placed by him on the market, were properly assembled and of good material and workmanship. His is the only make of bolt-action rifle which can be fired with the bolt unlocked though appearing to be locked. To prevent rust, the guns were heavily oiled by the manufacturer and purchasers were warned to wipe them out before using. In order to do this the bolt had to be taken apart but no instructions were given by the manufacturer as to the manner of reassembling the parts. Each of the respondents was injured by the bolt of one of these rifles being driven back through the breach when it was used by him for the first time after its purchase.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that, even assuming that each of the respondents had improperly assembled the parts of the bolt after cleaning it as instructed, the fact that the rifle would fire when the bolt was unlocked while apparently locked, constituted a latent defect and source of danger in the rifle and the failure of the appellant to take any reasonable steps to warn purchasers against that latent danger was equivalent to \"fault\", \"neglect\" and \"imprudence\" within the purview of Art. 1053 C.C. Per Brodeur J. (dissenting):\u2014Fault is either contractual or delictual, and delictual fault cannot be found in an action based on a contract. The appellant was not guilty of any contractual fault, the alleged defect of the rifle not being a latent defect within the purview of article 1522 C.C. The appellant was not liable for an apparent defect (art. 1523 C.C.) and he was not legally bound to warn purchasers as to the way of assembling the parts of the rifle (Art. 1491 C.C.)\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 29 K.B. 476) affirmed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgments of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgments of the trial court[2] which maintained the respondents' actions but reducing the amount of damages granted to them. The material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. Roy K.C. for the appellant. The rifle, if properly assembled, is absolutely safe and offers no danger whatsoever; and the appellant cannot be held responsible for the act of a purchaser who, by his neglect and imprudence, deranges the mechanism and assembles it in a defective manner and other than when it left the factory.\nA. C. Dobell K.C. and J. P. A. Gravel K.C. for the respondents. The appellant is liable either of a contractual fault within arts. 1522 et seq. C.C., or of a delictual fault within art. 1053 C.C.\nF. Roy K.C. for the appellant\nA. C. Dobell K.C. and J. P. A. Gravel K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Mignault J., in which I fully concur, I am of opinion that both the appeals and the cross-appeals in these two cases should be dismissed with costs. Idington J.\u2014Ross v. Dunstall. I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. And the cross-appeal, which raises no question but the measure of damages which for many long years has in numerous cases uniformly been held to be a matter we should not meddle with, must be dismissed with costs.\nRoss v. Emery. For the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge and the judges constituting the majority in the Court of Appeal I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHaving regard to the jurisprudence of this court, for many years past, in refusing to interfere with the assessment of damages when no principle of law is violated in the actual determination of the amount, I would dismiss the cross-appeal herein.\nDuff J.\u2014Negligence is clearly, I think, established in fact. The rifle, when the parts were assembled in a certain way\u2014which to any eye but the expert eye might readily appear to be the right way\u2014was a highly dangerous instrument. So much so indeed that when discharged in such circumstances injury to the holder of the rifle was almost certain to follow.\nThese rifles were sold without warning\u2014that is to say were put into commercial circulation with the reasonable probability that some of them would come into non expert hands, where they would be received without suspicion and under the risks arising from the circumstances mentioned. There is sufficient evidence to support a finding that competent and careful inspection and testing must have revealed the existence of these risks to the appellant and I agree with the courts below that such is the proper conclusion. Is the appellant responsible? I can see no reason for holding that such responsibility does not arise from the very terms of Art. 1053 C. C. unless it can be successfully contended that responsibility in such circumstances is limited to that arising from the contract of sale. I see no reason for such a limitation of the effect of the article mentioned. I cannot understand why a delictual responsibility towards those with whom the negligent manufacturer has no contractual relation may not co-exist with contractual responsibility towards those with whom he has.\nThis is said to be inconsistent with the decisions of the English courts. But it is not, I think, inconsistent with George v. Skivington[3], which appears to be sufficient to support the proposition that a manufacturer is responsible if he negligently manufactures and puts into circulation a mischievous thing which is or may be a trap to people using it. George v. Skivington3 has no doubt been adversely commented upon but it has not been considered by any court competent to overrule it and it has been applied widely in the American courts. See MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.[4].\nWhatever be the state of the English law the principle of George v. Skivington3 is, in my opinion, a principle of responsibility which by force of Art. 1053 C.C. is part of the law of Quebec.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of these two cases sufficiently appear in the reports of the Dunstall Case in the Superior Court[5], and of both cases in the Court of King's Bench[6], and in the judgments of my learned brothers. They raise the very important question of the liability under the law of Quebec of the manufacturer of a firearm, placed by him on the market for general sale, which, though faultless in material and workmanship, causes injury to a purchaser (either from the manufacturer himself or his agent or from a merchant dealing in such goods) owing to a latent and unusual source of danger inherent in its design, to give warning of which no steps have been taken by the manufacturer. The existence of the source of danger in the Ross rifle\u2014that it will fire when its bolt is unlocked\u2014is indisputable. Its latent character is fully established\u2014so much so that the manufacturer claims to have been himself unaware of it. While probably discernible by an expert and unlikely to be the cause of injury to a person who knows of it, it is apt to escape the notice of an ordinary user of a sportsman's rifle\u2014even if somewhat experienced\u2014as happened in each of these cases, without his being chargeable with any fault in the nature of temerity, carelessness or inattention.\nNo such hidden source of danger is to be found in such well known makes of bolt-action rifles as the Mauser, Lee-Enfield, Lebel, Mannlicher, Nagant and U.S. Springfield, none of which can be fired unless the bolt is securely locked. It was not shown to be present in any other make of rifle than the Ross.\nThere is evidence given by Mr. Power, formerly a foreman in the appellant's factory, that this source of danger was in fact brought to the appellant's attention in 1914. But as the manufacturer he should, in my opinion, not be heard to say that he was not or should not have been aware of it. 3 Pothier, Vente, No. 213; S. 1873.2.179; 2 Troplong, Vente, No. 574. There is also uncontradicted evidence given by Mr. Blair, a Government expert, that the danger might have been eliminated by a very simple change in design. That being the case, if such change would neither materially affect the user of the rifle nor interfere with the \"straight pull,\" its characteristic feature\u2014and, while there is no direct evidence to that effect, in the absence of any suggestion in the record that it would deem it a fair inference\u2014I have little difficulty in accepting the conclusion that the fact that the Ross Sports Rifle could be fired while the bolt was in a wrong position and unlocked and nothing to indicate that fact was apparent to the ordinary user constituted a latent defect in its design.\nI assume that the rifles were properly assembled when they left the appellant's factory and that the bolts became subsequently disarranged\u2014not improbably while in the hands of the respective plaintiffs.\nThe learned trial judge found that the existence of this source of danger constituted a defect in the rifle which entailed responsibility on the manufacturer for resultant injuries. Three \"Consid\u00e9rants\" of his judgment read as follows :\nConsid\u00e9rant que le dit accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 non par quelque d\u00e9faut dans les mat\u00e9riaux employ\u00e9s ou dans la main-d'\u0153uvre, mais par un d\u00e9faut dans le mod\u00e8le du fusil lui-m\u00eame et du m\u00e9canisme de la culasse;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce d\u00e9faut consiste en ce que les pi\u00e8ces qui composent la culasse mobile dudit fusil sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9es par la manipulation sans que le changement soit suffisamment apparent pour autre qu'un expert, et en ce que la culasse ainsi d\u00e9rang\u00e9e est susceptible d'\u00eatre mise en place et ferm\u00e9e, et le fusil arm\u00e9, sans que la dite culasse soit fix\u00e9e au canon du fusil\u2014\u00e9tat de choses qui n'est pas visible \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur,\u2014et surtout en ce que le fusil, ainsi apparemment bien arm\u00e9, peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9 avec le r\u00e9sultat que la culasse en est repouss\u00e9e par la d\u00e9tonation, s'en d\u00e9tache et frappe le tireur \u00e0 la figure avec une grande force; Consid\u00e9rant que, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle, la vente publique et la mise en circulation d'une arme affect\u00e9e de ce vice constitue un quasi-d\u00e9lit dont l'auteur est responsable du dommage qui peut en r\u00e9sulter.\nIn the Court of King's Bench, while the judgments holding the defendant liable were sustained, the damages awarded to the plaintiff Dunstall were reduced from $11,060 to $8,560 and those awarded to the plaintiff Emery from $10,000 to $5,482. The respondents have both cross-appealed against these reductions in the amounts of their respective recoveries. These cross-appeals may be disposed of on the short ground that neither case is of the very exceptional class in which this court feels justified in interfering on the ground of gross and palpable excess or inadequacy with the quantum of damages fixed by the provincial appellate court.\nThe failure of the appellant to take any reasonable steps to insure that warning of the latent danger of the misplaced bolt\u2014whether it did or did not amount to a defect in design\u2014should be given to purchasers in the ordinary course of the sporting rifles which he put on the market in my opinion renders him liable to the plaintiffs in these actions. His omission to do so was a failure to take a precaution which human prudence should have dictated and which it was his duty to have taken and as such constituted a fault which, when injury resulted from it to a person of a class who the manufacturer must have contemplated should become users of the rifle, gave rise to a cause of action against him.\nThe cases fall within the purview of Art. 1053 C.C. Taking no steps to warn purchasers of the rifle of its peculiar hidden danger was \"neglect\" and \"imprudence\" on the part of the defendant (whether his knowledge of it was actual or should be presumed) which caused injury to the plaintiff in each instance. If his failure to make an effort to give such warning was due to ignorance of the danger, such ignorance may well be deemed \"want of skill\" (imperitia) under the circumstances.\nThe principle of the case in D. 1869.2.195, cited for the respondents, where a doctor attending a child who failed to notify its nurse of the contagious character of the disease with which it was afflicted and which she contracted was held liable to her, may be invoked. Purchasers of the Ross rifle were entitled to rely on the skill and prudence of its manufacturer as the nurse was on that of the doctor. Another case, reported in the Court of Cassation in S. 1899.1.371 and in the Court of Appeal in D. 1894.2.573, may also be referred to where failure to warn the purchaser of a bicycle of the danger, owing to weakness in the tubing forming the post, of raising the handle bar of the bicycle too high was indicated as a ground of liability on the part of the manufacturer-vendor, the purchaser having been injured because the tubing in the post broke.\nThe responsibility of the manufacturer where he has himself sold to the plaintiff, either directly or through an agent, for injuries occasioned to the purchaser by hidden defects in the thing sold is clearly covered by Arts. 1522 and 1527 C.C. All the authorities have followed Pothier in regarding him as a person who is legally presumed to know of such defects (Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, Rep. vbo. Vices Redhib. Nos. 337-40: Guillouard, Vente, No. 462) and this presumption applies in favour of sub-purchasers as well as the original vendees. It puts the manufacturer who is ignorant of latent defects in the same plight as if he knew of them. There is good authority for the proposition that this contractual or quasi-contractual responsibility extends to sub-purchasers of his products from merchants to whom the manufacturer has supplied them whether directly or through the intervention of wholesale dealers. Baudry-Lacantinerie (Saignat) Vente, No. 432: Guillouard, Vente, No. 452: S. 1891.2.5. But it is perhaps not so clear that it also covers unusual latent sources of danger not amounting to defects.\nI therefore prefer to rest my opinion in favour of the plaintiffs on Art. 1053 C.C. (S. 1879.1.374). The defendant's failure to take steps to warn purchasers of his rifles of the hidden danger peculiar to them, that they would fire when the bolt appeared to be locked but was in fact unlocked, I regard as an imprudence or neglect within the purview of that article and therefore actionable. Sourdat, Resp. Vol. 1, Nos. 668, 670, 675, 680.\nWhile English law is not applicable to these cases I incline to think that under it the defendant would likewise be liable\u2014at all events if he knew of the latent danger of his rifle\u2014and probably if he did not. Reference may be made to the very recent edition (1921) of Clark and Lindsell on Torts, pp. 455, 469, 471-5: 25 Hals. L. of E., No. 293: 21 Hals. L. of E., No. 638 and 686: White v. Steadman[7]; Bates v. Batey[8]; Cavalier v. Pope[9]; and Parry v. Smith[10]. In Blacker v. Lake & Elliot[11], Hamilton and Lush JJ., held knowledge by the manufacturer of the defect or condition creating the danger essential to render him liable to a sub-purchaser from his vendee of an article not ordinarily of a dangerous character even though it must have been in contemplation that such a resale should take place. George v. Skivington[12], the well-known case of the deleterious hair wash, where the contrary was held, is treated as virtually overruled. Lush J. in White v. Steadman[13], however, indicates that in his view the decision in George v. Skivington12 might have been supported if it had been put upon the ground that the defendant had failed to take ordinary care to avail himself of his opportunity of knowledge of the danger of the ingredients composing his hair wash. With respect, it seems to me that ground of liability, though not expressed, is fairly implied in the judgments delivered in the Court of Exchequer. Thomas v. Winchester[14], cited with approval in Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins[15], and the opinion of Matthew L.J., in Clarke v. Army & Navy Society[16], may also be looked at in this connection. George v. Skivington12 is still cited as an authority in Clark and Lindsell's recent book at p. 472. I find it difficult to reconcile the decision in Blacker v. Lake & Elliott[17], with the classical passage in the judgment of Brett M. R., in Heaven v. Pender[18].\nWhenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that everyone of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognize that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger. The duty of a manufacturer of articles (such as rifles), which are highly dangerous unless designed and made with great skill and care, to possess and exercise skill and to take care exists towards all persons to whom an original vendee from him, reasonably relying on such skill having been exercised and due care having been taken, may innocently deliver the thing as fit and proper to be dealt with in the way in which the manufacturer intended it should be dealt with. The manufacturer of such articles is a person rightly assumed to possess and to have exercised superior knowledge and skill in regard to them on which purchasers from retail dealers in the ordinary course of trade may be expected to rely. From his position he ought to know of any hidden sources of danger connected with their use. The law cannot be so impotent as to allow such a manufacturer to escape liability for injuries\u2014possibly fatal\u2014to a person of a class who he contemplated would use his product in the way in which it was used caused by a latent source of danger which reasonable care on his part should have discovered and to give warning of which no steps have been taken.\nI agree with the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench and the Superior Court that the respondents' actions are not prescribed.\nI would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014Ces deux causes, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies pour les fins de la preuve, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment devant nous; mais comme les faits y sont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identiques et que les m\u00eames questions de droit s'y pr\u00e9sentent, nous pouvons les d\u00e9cider en m\u00eame temps. Les faits sont les suivants:\nL'appelant, Sir Charles Ross, est fabricant d'une carabine commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9e \"Ross Rifle.\" Les intim\u00e9s, qui sont amateurs de chasse, ont achet\u00e9 chacun une de ces carabines. Avant de s'en servir cependant ces derniers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de les nettoyer, et \u00e0 cette fin il leur a fallu d\u00e9faire quelques pi\u00e8ces de la culasse. Quand ils sont venus pour assembler ces pi\u00e8ces, ils n'ont pas suffisamment pouss\u00e9 et fix\u00e9 la culasse, de sorte que plus tard, quand ils se sont servis de la carabine pour tirer sur le gibier, la culasse, par l'action de la cartouche, a laiss\u00e9 sa gaine, est venue les frapper \u00e0 la figure et les a bless\u00e9s gri\u00e8vement. De l\u00e0 action en dommages contre le fabricant en all\u00e9guant que les accidents \u00e9taient dus \u00e0 sa n\u00e9gligence et que ces carabines \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es d'un vice cach\u00e9.\nLe fabricant a plaid\u00e9 que ces accidents \u00e9taient dus \u00e0 l'imp\u00e9ritie des deux demandeurs Dunstall et Emery et que ces carabines n'avaient pas de d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l'honorable Juge Dorion, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'accident\na \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 non pas par quelque d\u00e9faut dans les mat\u00e9riaux employ\u00e9s ou dans la main-d'oeuvre, mais par un d\u00e9faut dans le mod\u00e8le du fusil lui-m\u00eame et du m\u00e9canisme de la culasse * * et que ind\u00e9pendamment de toute responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle, la vente publique . . d'une arme affect\u00e9e de ce vice constitue un quasi-d\u00e9lit dont l'auteur est responsable du dommage qui peut en r\u00e9sulter.\nElle a condamn\u00e9 Ross, dans le cas de Dunstall, \u00e0 lui payer $11,060.00, et, dans le cas d'Emery, \u00e0 lui payer $10,000.00.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait responsabilit\u00e9 de la part de Ross, mais elle a r\u00e9duit les dommages en d\u00e9clarant que le montant accord\u00e9 \u00e9tait excessif. Le d\u00e9fendeur Ross appelle de ces jugements et demande que les actions soient renvoy\u00e9es.\nLes demandeurs Dunstall et Emery font contre-appels et demandent le r\u00e9tablissement des jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nSur ces contre-appels nous n'avons pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'entendre le d\u00e9fendeur. Il est de jurisprudence que nous n'intervenons presque jamais dans les d\u00e9cisions qui fixent ces dommages, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y ait application d'un principe erron\u00e9. Dans le cas actuel, la Cour du Banc du Roi a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de r\u00e9duire les dommages; et, de fait, je crois que les montants accord\u00e9s par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9taient trop \u00e9l\u00e9v\u00e9s. La Cour du Banc du Roi a exerc\u00e9 sagement la discr\u00e9tion qui lui incombait.\nAu m\u00e9rite, sur la question de responsabilit\u00e9, se pr\u00e9sentent des points de droit des plus int\u00e9ressants.\nLes actions sont apparemment bas\u00e9es sur une faute contractuelle, c'est-\u00e0-dire sur le fait que la chose vendue serait entach\u00e9e d'un d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9.\nLes cours inf\u00e9rieures ont trouv\u00e9 dans les faits de la cause non-seulement une faute contractuelle, mais un quasi-d\u00e9lit ou une faute d\u00e9lictuelle.\nIl est assez important de pr\u00e9ciser le d\u00e9bat sur ce point, car les deux fautes n'entra\u00eenent pas les m\u00eames cons\u00e9quences et ne sont pas soumises au m\u00eame mode d'enqu\u00eate.\nLa premi\u00e8re question est donc de savoir si les faits de la cause constituent une faute d\u00e9lictuelle.\nEn d'autres termes, l'inex\u00e9cution d'une obligation contractuelle engage-t-elle la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur au point de vue d\u00e9lictuel? Tous les commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on qui avaient \u00e9crit sur la mati\u00e8re jusqu'\u00e0 la codification, \u00e0 quatre exceptions pr\u00e8s, sont d'opinion que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a faute contractuelle il n'y a pas lieu d'appliquer la responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant des d\u00e9lits et des quasi-d\u00e9lits.\nAubry & Rau, vol. 4, par. 446, p. 755, 4e \u00e9d.;\nLarombi\u00e8re, art. 1382, nos. 8 & 9;\nLaurent, vol. 16, nos. 213-230, vol. 20, no. 463;\nDemolombe, vol. 8, nos. 472, 477;\nSourdat, Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9, vol. 1er, no. 6;\nSaleilles, Trait\u00e9 de l'obligation d'apr\u00e8s le code allemand, nos. 330 et suivants;\nHuc, vol. 7, no. 95, et vol. 8, nos. 424 et suivants;\nSaincteclette, Responsabilit\u00e9 et garantie;\nFromageot, De la faute comme source de la responsabilit\u00e9, Paris, 1891;\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 4, no. 2865;\nSauzet, Revue Critique, 1883, p. 616;\nLabb\u00e9, Notes dans Sirey, 1885-2-33; 1886-4-25; 1886-2-42; 1889-44;\nGlasson, Code Civil et la question ouvri\u00e8re, pp. 30 & 32 ;\nDalloz, Suppl\u00e9ment, verbo Responsabilit\u00e9, no. 57;\nRouard de Card, France Judiciaire, vol. 15-1-97;\nColin & Capitant, vol. 2, p. 368 (1915).\nIl y a donc, suivant ces auteurs, deux esp\u00e8ces de faute, c'est-\u00e0-dire la faute contractuelle, si le d\u00e9biteur n'ex\u00e9cute pas son obligation r\u00e9sultant d'une convention ou l'ex\u00e9cute imparfaitement, et la faute d\u00e9lictuelle, c'est-\u00e0-dire celle qui consiste \u00e0 causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 autrui, pr\u00e9judice autre que celui r\u00e9sultant d'une obligation contractuelle.\nNotre code civil a, dans les articles 1070 et suivants, d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de la faute contractuelle; et il a, dans les articles 1053 et suivants, fix\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits. Il a donc indiqu\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re certaine les r\u00e8gles qui doivent nous guider dans le cas de faute contractuelle et dans le cas de faute d\u00e9lictuelle. S'il y a une convention entre les parties, alors nous devons fixer la responsabilit\u00e9 des parties suivant les dispositions du chapitre qui traite de l'effet des obligations: et s'il n'y a pas eu de convention, alors nous devons fixer cette responsabilit\u00e9 suivant les dispositions du chapitre qui traite des d\u00e9lits et des quasi-d\u00e9lits.\nDans les trente derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es en France une opinion diff\u00e9rente a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e par M. Lefebvre, auteur peu connu, qui a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il n'y avait qu'une seule responsabilit\u00e9, celle r\u00e9sultant de la faute d\u00e9lictuelle (Revue Critique de 1886, p. 485).\nEtait-ce l'influence de la doctrine allemande qui se faisait sentir dans cette opinion de M. Lefebvre? En effet, la doctrine allemande veut qu'il n'y ait pas de fautes contractuelles en droit civil, mais que la faute d\u00e9lictuelle soit la seule qui existe et qui donne ouverture \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 (Voir Saleilles, Trait\u00e9 de l'obligation par le Code allemand, nos. 330 et suivants.)\nCette opinion de Lefebvre a \u00e9t\u00e9 reprise dans une forme mitig\u00e9e par Desjardins, Revue des Deux Mondes, 1888, p. 362, et par Grandmoulin, deux auteurs peu connus, et par Planiol, dont on ne saurait contester la grande autorit\u00e9. Nous trouvons l'opinion de Planiol dans son ouvrage sur le Droit Civil, vol. 2, no. 911, 1\u00e8re \u00e9dition, et dans sa note dans Dalloz, 1896-2-457. Ces derniers auteurs ne disent pas, comme Lefebvre, qu'il n'y a que des fautes d\u00e9lictuelles, mais que l'existence d'un contrat n'exclut pas n\u00e9cessairement la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle, et que la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle peut trouver son application lorsque dans l'inex\u00e9cution ou dans l'ex\u00e9cution d\u00e9fectueuse du contrat il appara\u00eet un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9lictueux. C'est la th\u00e9orie que nous retrouvons dans les jugements des cours inf\u00e9rieures, qui d\u00e9clarent qu'une faute peut \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois d\u00e9lictuelle et contractuelle.\nJe ne puis, pour ma part, accepter cette th\u00e9orie de Lefebvre et de Planiol. Si notre code avait voulu \u00e9tablir l'unit\u00e9 de faute, il se serait content\u00e9 de l'article 1053; mais il a, au contraire, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 la dualit\u00e9 des fautes, tant par les articles 1053 et suivants que par les articles 1070 et suivants, et alors nous devons avoir recours aux articles 1070 et suivants chaque fois qu'il s'agit de dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution d'un contrat.\nLes derniers auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit sur la mati\u00e8re sont Colin et Capitant, qui font grande autorit\u00e9 en France. Ils ont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Planiol dans la chaire de droit \u00e0 Paris, et leur opinion est fort pris\u00e9e non-seulement dans les cercles universitaires mais aussi au barreau et sur le banc. Voici ce qu'ils enseignent dans leur volume 2, page 368, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 en 1915:\nCette distinction, qui constitue l'une des notions fondamentales et \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de notre droit priv\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s contest\u00e9e dans ces vingt derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Naturellement, en effet, les jurisconsultes qui voient dans la faute constitutive du d\u00e9lit civil le manquement \u00e0 une obligation pr\u00e9existante, en donnent une d\u00e9finition qui s'applique tout aussi bien \u00e0 la faute du d\u00e9biteur contractuel. Mais cette th\u00e9orie nouvelle n'a pas d\u00e9truit la th\u00e8se classique de la dualite des fautes. Elle est demeur\u00e9e sans influence aucune sur la pratique. Voici en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 quelles sont les diff\u00e9rences qu'il convient de relever entre les deux fautes.\nLa faute contractuelle consiste, nous l'avons vu, dans le fait de la part d'un d\u00e9biteur de n'avoir pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 l'obligation \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait astreint par le contrat le liant \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier. La faute d\u00e9lictuelle consiste \u00e0 causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 autrui, pr\u00e9judice autre que celui r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution d'une obligation, et cela, soit par m\u00e9chancet\u00e9 et intention de nuire, soit par simple manquement aux pr\u00e9cautions que la prudence doit inspirer \u00e0 un homme diligent.\nA cette premi\u00e8re opposition, les jurisconsultes classiques ont souvent rattach\u00e9 ce corollaire qu'il y aurait un degr\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent dans la faute r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de la part d'un d\u00e9biteur et de la part d'un d\u00e9linquant. Le d\u00e9biteur r\u00e9pondrait seulement de sa faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re (culpa levis in abstracto). Le d\u00e9linquant r\u00e9pondrait de sa faute m\u00eame tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re (In lege Aquilia culpa levissima venit). Nous avons vu ce qu'il faut penser de cette pr\u00e9tendue gradation. En mati\u00e8re contractuelle, il y a faute, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, d\u00e8s lors que le d\u00e9biteur a contrevenu \u00e0 son engagement, n'a pas accompli toute la prestation qu'il devait fournir. Le droit en cette mati\u00e8re consacre la responsabilit\u00e9 du simple fait. C'est seulement en mati\u00e8re d\u00e9lictuelle qu'il y a lieu de comparer, comme le faisaient les Romains, les agissements concrets du d\u00e9fendeur avec ceux qu'on e\u00fbt pu attendre du type abstrait de l'homme prudent et diligent.\nIls font ressortir ensuite que la diff\u00e9rence la plus importante entre la faute contractuelle et la faute d\u00e9lictuelle est dans l'onus probandi.\nNotre code de Qu\u00e9bec s'\u00e9tant inspir\u00e9 de la plupart des auteurs favorables \u00e0 la dualit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9paration de la faute, il me para\u00eet raisonnable de les suivre et de s'\u00e9carter de ce principe du germanisme qui, sur ce point comme sur bien d'autres, ne para\u00eet pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accept\u00e9s dans la civilisation moderne. Je trouve donc que les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont fait erreur en d\u00e9cidant qu'une faute pouvait \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois contractuelle et d\u00e9lictuelle.\nMaintenant il nous reste \u00e0 examiner les obligations contractuelles de l'appelant.\nNous sommes en face d'un contrat de vente et nous devons rechercher dans le contrat, ainsi que dans les obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent, les principes qui doivent nous guider. Nous avons \u00e0 rechercher si le vendeur a viol\u00e9 cette disposition implicite de son obligation qui l'obligeait \u00e0 garantir son acheteur contre les d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s de la chose.\nQu'est-ce qu'un d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9? C'est, nous dit l'article 1522 du code civil, un d\u00e9faut qui rend la chose vendue impropre \u00e0 l'usage auquel on la destine.\nL'article 1523 nous enseigne que le vendeur n'est pas tenu des vices apparents et dont il a pu lui-m\u00eame conna\u00eetre l'existence. Le fusil vendu dans le cas actuel n'\u00e9tait pas impropre \u00e0 l'usage auquel il \u00e9tait destin\u00e9; au contraire, c'\u00e9tait un fusil perfectionn\u00e9 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment brevet\u00e9 et qui avait l'avantage de tirer plus rapidement que ceux qui sont sur le march\u00e9. Le chasseur, dans le maniement de la culasse, n'a qu'\u00e0 faire un mouvement, c'est-\u00e0-dire la pousser en avant, et alors la culasse se ferme d'elle-m\u00eame sans exiger le mouvement de fermeture qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour les autres carabines. On con\u00e7oit de suite le grand avantage qu'une invention comme celle-l\u00e0 peut produire. L'\u00e9conomie du temps et des mouvements compte pour beaucoup dans le succ\u00e8s du chasseur ou du soldat.\nMais il est n\u00e9cessaire que l'assemblage des deux parties de la culasse soit bien fait. Si ces deux parties sont improprement r\u00e9unies, alors la fermeture ne s'op\u00e8re pas et il arrive un accident comme dans les causes qui nous occupent.\nLes intim\u00e9s n'avaient \u00e9videmment pas les connaissances voulues pour faire l'assemblage requis. Ils se sont fi\u00e9s \u00e0 leur connaissance des anciens mod\u00e8les et ils se sont mis en frais de nettoyer la culasse et le canon du fusil. Ils ont \u00e9videmment d\u00e9rang\u00e9 le boulon qui va \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du cylindre, ne lui ont pas donn\u00e9, en rassemblant les pi\u00e8ces, la longueur voulue pour qu'il p\u00e9n\u00e8tre suffisamment et se ferme ensuite automatiquement. Et alors en tirant la carabine, la culasse, qui n'\u00e9tait pas ferm\u00e9e, a fait un mouvement de recul et a caus\u00e9 l'accident dont les intim\u00e9s se plaignent.\nLa question de responsabilit\u00e9 qui se pose est de savoir si le vendeur d'une machine dangereuse, qui est parfaite en elle-m\u00eame mais dont les parties mal assembl\u00e9es par l'acheteur causent un accident, est responsable de cet accident. En d'autres termes, a-t-il vendu un article atteint d'un vice cach\u00e9? La question a un int\u00e9r\u00eat considerable, car avec notre d\u00e9veloppement industriel la d\u00e9cision que nous allons rendre peut \u00eatre grosse de cons\u00e9quences. Tous les jours il se met sur le march\u00e9 des automobiles, des engins \u00e0 gazoline, des moteurs \u00e9lectriques, qui, s'ils sont mis entre les mains de personnes comp\u00e9tentes, n'offrent pas de grands dangers; mais s'ils sont men\u00e9s, r\u00e9par\u00e9s ou assembl\u00e9s par les premiers venus, ils peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 de s\u00e9rieux accidents. Des m\u00e9canismes perfectionn\u00e9s sont tous les jours mis en vente; mais avant d'y toucher l'acheteur doit se renseigner sur la mani\u00e8re de les manier. Le vendeur a rempli son obligation du moment que la chose vendue n'est pas impropre \u00e0 l'usage auquel elle est destin\u00e9e.\nLe major Blair, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin expert des demandeurs, nous dit lui-m\u00eame comment les accidents sont survenus:\nIt is owing to the bolt having been assembled with the sleeve in the wrong position, in such a position that the sleeve of the bolt was unable to travel forward on the bolt itself and lock the lugs.\nCe n'est donc pas un d\u00e9faut de l'article vendu qui a caus\u00e9 les accidents, mais ces accidents sont dus au fait qu'on a mal assembl\u00e9 les pi\u00e8ces de la carabine. Et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par les demandeurs eux-m\u00eames. La preuve d\u00e9montre que les fusils, quand ils ont laiss\u00e9 la fabrique, \u00e9taient parfaitement assembl\u00e9s.\nLe m\u00eame t\u00e9moin nous dit:\nQ.\u2014What have you to say regarding a rifle that could have its bolt assembled in the wrong way and yet fire? A.\u2014Well, in the hands of one unacquainted with its mechanism, in the hands of the every day individual, I would have to say that there was danger.\nOn lui demande:\nQ.\u2014Would you call that a faulty design? A.\u2014In my opinion, it would be a fault in design. Q.\u2014Would you consider it a dangerous defect? A.\u2014I would in the hands of a person who did not know whether it was rightly or wrongly assembled; there would be danger of his getting it into action in a wrong manner which would, if he did so, of course, be dangerous to the firer.\nQ.\u2014I am asking you whether there is anything from the external point of view in the rifle to show that that rifle is assembled in the wrong way? A.\u2014To one who knows it, yes; to one who does not know it, there is not; in my opinion there is not.\nL'opinion de cet expert n'est pas corrobor\u00e9e, au contraire les autres experts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus ne paraissent pas abonder dans son sens. Mais prenant m\u00eame son opinion, je dis que le d\u00e9fendeur ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenu responsable, parce que, suivant les dispositions de l'article 1523 C.C. le vendeur n'est pas tenu des d\u00e9fauts dont l'acheteur a pu lui-m\u00eame conna\u00eetre l'existence.\nPothier, Vente, no. 207, parlant des vices qui peuvent s'apercevoir, dit:\nEt quand bien m\u00eame il (l'acheteur) ne l'aurait pas connu (le d\u00e9faut) il ne serait pas encore recevable \u00e0 se plaindre du tort qu'il souffre de ce contrat, car c'est par sa faute qu'il le souffre: il ne tenait qu'\u00e0 lui d'examiner la chose avant de l'acheter ou de la faire examiner par quelqu'un s'il ne s'y connaissait pas lui-m\u00eame. Or un tort qu'une personne souffre par sa faute n'est pas un tort auquel les lois doivent subvenir.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, au no. 418, Vente, apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 ce passage de Pothier, dit:\nL'ignorance de l'acheteur ne suffirait donc pas pour que le vice f\u00fbt consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme cach\u00e9 quant \u00e0 lui s'il \u00e9tait apparent pour une personne connaissant les choses dont il s'agit.\nUn homme ne doit pas s'aventurer de toucher \u00e0 des machines dangereuses ou susceptibles de le devenir, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit parfaitement renseign\u00e9 sur leur m\u00e9canisme.\nMais on dit: On aurait pu rendre ce m\u00e9canisme tellement parfait qu'un ignorant m\u00eame n'aurait pas pu en faire improprement l'assemblage. Il me semble qu'une telle exigence d\u00e9passe les dispositions de la loi. Le vendeur n'est pas tenu de prot\u00e9ger son acheteur contre les imprudences de ce dernier. Il n'est tenu que de livrer un article qui ne sera pas impropre \u00e0 l'usage auquel il est destin\u00e9.\nL'absence seule de certaines qualit\u00e9s,\ndisent Aubry et Rau, 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol. 4, p. 387,\ndont se trouverait d\u00e9pourvue le chose vendue ne constitue pas un vice de nature \u00e0 donner lieu \u00e0 l'action redhibitoire.\nIl en est de m\u00eame des dommages, car on ne peut r\u00e9clamer des dommages que si on peut exercer l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire (arts. 1526, 1527 C.C.).\nSi l'acheteur juge \u00e0 propos de manier une arme, d'en d\u00e9faire les parties du m\u00e9canisme et de les assembler irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, il n'a qu'\u00e0 s'en prendre \u00e0 lui s'il lui arrive ensuite un accident.\nLe vendeur est-il oblig\u00e9 de faire l'\u00e9ducation de son acheteur? Je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que non.\nC'est pourtant cette obligation que les cours inf\u00e9rieures lui ont impos\u00e9e. On s'est bas\u00e9 sur un jugement rapport\u00e9 dans Dalloz, 1894-2-573, concernant un bicycle. Mais dans cette cause l'accident \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la faiblesse du tube de direction qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dissimul\u00e9e aux yeux de l'acheteur par diff\u00e9rentes pi\u00e8ces. Il y avait d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le contrat \u00e9tait susceptible d'\u00eatre annul\u00e9 \u00e0 moins que le vendeur ne m\u00eet son acheteur au courant de ce d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9.\nMais ici il n'y a pas de d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9 dans le mod\u00e8le du fusil et dans le m\u00e9canisme de la culasse.\nDans un jugement rapport\u00e9 dans Dalloz, 1857-1-65, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour de Cassation que le vendeur n'est pas responsable du vice relatif dont deux choses vendues s\u00e9par\u00e9ment par lui au m\u00eame acheteur peuvent \u00eatre affect\u00e9es par leur mode de r\u00e9union ou d'assortiment, si cet assortiment constitue un fait personnel \u00e0 l'acheteur, qu'on reprocherait vainement au vendeur de n'avoir pas fait conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l'acheteur par des prospectus ou autrement dans quelles conditions la r\u00e9uniom devait \u00eatre op\u00e9r\u00e9e, une telle obligation ne r\u00e9sultant d'aucune loi.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je suis d'opinion:\n1\u00b0 que dans les circonstances actuelles la seule faute qui puisse \u00eatre imput\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur est une faute contractuelle et non pas quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle;\n2\u00b0 qu'il n'y avait pas de d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9 dans la carabine qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue aux demandeurs;\n3\u00b0 que le vendeur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu de faire l'\u00e9ducation de son acheteur sur la mani\u00e8re de manier ou d'assembler les articles qui lui \u00e9taient vendus.\nPour toutes ces raisons, les appels doivent \u00eatre maintenus avec d\u00e9pens et les contre-appels doivent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9s aussi avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014In these two cases which present virtually the same question of civil responsibility, we have had the advantage of two arguments, the case of Ross v. Dunstall having been argued in February and that of Ross v. Emery in May. The accident of which the two respondents complain occurred in a similar manner, through the back-firing of a sporting rifle manufactured by the appellant, and each of the respondents lost the use of his right eye besides suffering other injuries to the head and face. In the case of Dunstall however the rifle was purchased in Minneapolis from dealers in firearms who had themselves procured it from the selling agents of the appellant. In the other case, the respondent Emery bought the rifle directly from the appellant. This difference in circumstances has given rise to the suggestion that the liability in the Dunstall case is delictual and in the Emery case contractual. In my opinion, whether the civil responsibility incurred proceeds from a contract or rests on a quasi-d\u00e9lit, matters very little in this case. Indeed there is perhaps some ground for the pungent criticism which Mr. Planiol, vol. 2, nos. 873 and following, makes of the generally admitted distinction between la faute d\u00e9lictuelle and la faute contractuelle, which, in the opinion of the learned author, \"n'a ni sens ni raison d'\u00eatre.\" It is obvious that no civil responsibility can exist without a faute, and faute is defined as \"un manquement \u00e0 une obligation pr\u00e9existante.\" (Planiol, no. 863). Whether this obligation be one imposed by a law or by a contract, and cases can easily be conceived where there is an obligation imposed by law together with one created by a contract, the result, generally speaking, is the same, in the sense that the person in fault is obliged to indemnify the person aggrieved to the extent of the injury suffered. Therefore, if the appellant was guilty either of a delictual or of a contractual fault, and if this fault caused the injuries complained of, there can be no question as to the civil liability which he has incurred for the damages suffered by the respondents. And while no doubt the code deals separately with the two kinds of responsibility (see articles 1053 and following in the case of d\u00e9lits and quasi-d\u00e9lits, articles 1070 and following with regard to obligations generally, and articles 1522 and following as to the sale of things having latent defects), and while these articles may be referred to accordingly as they apply to one or the other of the judgments in question on these appeals, I do not apprehend that the practical result of one rule or of the other, as applicable to the cases under consideration, will be in any way different. The rifle, the back-firing of which injured the two respondents, is called the \"Ross Straight Pull Rifle.\" Without attempting any too technical description of this rifle, I may say that to be safely fired the bolt of the rifle must be locked. This bolt is contained in a bolt carrier or sleeve and is turned by spiral projections around it which act in spirally cut grooves inside the bolt carrier. To lock it, the handle on the bolt carrier is forced straight forward. This turns the bolt and lugs about one-quarter of a revolution and the lugs are locked into grooves in the extension of the barrel. When the assembled bolt is removed for cleaning the rifle or other purposes, the bolt may easily be slipped back into the wrong spiral groove, bringing the lugs against the end of the bolt carrier about in line with the handle. In this condition the bolt may be returned to its place in the rifle, and have the appearance of being locked, but as the lugs have not turned to the locking position, the rifle is not locked. If then it be fired, and it can be thus fired, the bolt is thrown back in the face of the user. In other rifles with a bolt action, such as the Mauser, Lee-Enfield, Lebel, Mannlicker, Nagant, United States Springfield, the rifle cannot be fired until the bolt is locked.\nIn so far as any defect has been charged against the Ross rifle, it lies in the fact that the bolt may be improperly assembled and appear to the user to be locked, and that although it be really not locked, the rifle can nevertheless be fired in this unlocked position, with the result of throwing back the bolt in the face of the user. There is no doubt whatever in my mind that it is because the respondents, in using the rifle, improperly assembled the bolt that they suffered the injuries which gave rise to their actions. When the rifle is properly used and the bolt is locked in position, no such accident is possible. I do not think therefore, although the learned trial judge so found, that there is a defect in the design qua design of the rifle, for it contains a properly constructed locking device, and it was never intended that it should be fired in an unlocked position, but there is a possibility that the user, unless he be properly instructed as to the locking of the bolt, may assemble it in the wrong way and be deceived by the appearance of the rifle into thinking it properly locked. And the danger is that, unlike other types of bolt action rifles, the Ross rifle can be fired although the bolt is unlocked, with the consequence that the user, if he aims the rifle in the ordinary way from the shoulder, will be injured as were these respondents.\nThe evidence is that these rifles, and there was a military as well as a sporting rifle, were inspected at the factory by Government inspectors, that they were fired several times with a charge heavier than the usual one in order to test their strength of resistance, and that no rifle was put on the market except with the bolt properly assembled. To prevent rust, the gun was heavily oiled and the purchaser was warned to wipe it out thoroughly before using it. No warning was given of the possibility of wrongly assembling the bolt, and the danger that the rifle might be fired with the bolt in an unlocked position was not pointed out to users of the rifle. Certain instructions with respect to cleaning the gun accompanied each rifle, but no instructions as to the manner of assembling the bolt were given to purchasers. Indeed the appellant does not appear to have imagined that an accident like the one in question was possible. The troops of the Canadian expeditionary force stationed at Valcartier to the number of some 30,000 were all armed with the Ross rifle. I think it sufficiently appears that no accident such as the one in question occurred there, although the rifle was fired thousands of times, but no doubt the troops were carefully instructed as to the use of the rifle. In fact, besides the case of these two respondents, the only other instance testified to is that of one Leonard in 1896, where the bolt is shown to have been thrown back in the face of the user through being improperly assembled in the rifle.\nThe question now is whether the appellant is liable in damages for the reason that, although he manufactured and sold a rifle with a properly constructed locking device, these respondents were injured because they improperly assembled the bolt in the rifle and were deceived by the general appearance of the rifle into thinking that the bolt action was properly locked. Or perhaps the question should be stated thus, and this appears to be the ground chiefly insisted on by the respondents, is the appellant liable because the rifle constructed by him could be fired in an unlocked position? It is important to mention that both these respondents were experienced in the use of firearms, but, when injured, were using the Ross rifle for the first time. As I have said, the circumstance that one of the respondents purchased the rifle directly from the appellant and the other through a dealer who had obtained it from the selling agents of the appellant, does not alter the responsibility of the latter if through the violation of a contract or by reason of the mere negligence of the appellant either of the respondents suffered injury. The principles governing civil responsibility are very familiar. In the absence of any contractual relations between two persons, the one is liable towards the other if, being doli capax, he has caused him damage by his fault, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill (art. 1053 C.C.). This fault may be an act of commission or of omission, and however slight the negligence may be it engenders civil responsibility where it is productive of injury to another. In the case of the sale of a thing with a latent defect, the usual remedy is the rescission of the sale or a diminution of the price. A distinction is made between the case where the defect was unknown to the seller and where it was known to him; in the former case the price and the expenses of the sale only can be demanded, in the latter, the seller is obliged to pay all damages suffered by the buyer (arts. 1527, 1528 C.C.). Knowledge of the defect is either actual or presumed, for, according to article 1527 C.C., the seller is obliged to pay damages in all cases in which he is legally presumed to know the defects.\nThe authors, and chiefly Pothier (Vente, nos. 212 and following, Obligations, no. 163), explain that the seller is legally presumed to know the defects when the thing sold is one in which the seller usually deals, or one manufactured by him. The mere dealer is generally allowed to rebut the legal presumption of knowledge by shewing that in fact it was impossible for him to discover the defect, but the manufacturer is not listened to when he pleads ignorance of the defect, for he is held to have guaranteed the product created by him as free from latent defect, spondet peritiam artis, and, as Pothier observes, his ignorance of the defect in the thing manufactured by him is in itself a fault. Imperitia culpae annumeratur. The appellant here manufactured the rifle and knowledge of any latent defect in it must therefore be imputed to him.\nConsequently it is not material in these cases to discuss the nature of the presumption, either \"juris tantum or juris et de jure, mentioned by article 1527. If ignorance of a latent defect is in itself a fault, in the case of the manufacturer who sells a thing manufactured by him, it becomes unnecessary to determine whether the presumption of knowledge of this defect can be rebutted by him, for, even if he could rebut it and establish his ignorance, he would nevertheless be in fault, so that whether the appellant knew or did not know that his rifle could be fired in an unlocked position is immaterial if this be a latent defect of the rifle manufactured by him.\nAfter due consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the possibility of the rifle being fired in an unlocked position, when to the ordinary and even cautious user the bolt action would appear to be locked, is a latent defect of the Ross rifle entailing the civil liability of the appellant as its manufacturer for the damages incurred by the respondents. I have been careful to say that I do not consider the design of the rifle defective, as a design, for a properly constructed locking device was provided, but there was a hidden and undisclosed danger and this certainly was a defect in the rifle and a latent one, as an inspection of the rifle locked or unlocked shows. That such a defect might have been detected by an expert is no reason to hold the defect to be other than latent, or to free the appellant from liability, for it suffices that a reasonably prudent user could be deceived by the appearance of the rifle into thinking that it was properly locked and ready to fire. And to put on the market without proper instructions or warning such a rifle\u2014whether the liability be contractual or delictual\u2014is a fault for the consequences of which the appellant must be held liable.\nThere is an instructive case in Dalloz, 1894. 2. 573, where the cour d'appel of Bruges held in 1893, as follows:\nLa faiblesse du tube de direction d'une bicyclette, dissimul\u00e9e aux yeux de l'acheteur par diff\u00e9rentes pi\u00e8ces et ne pouvant d'ailleurs \u00eatre appreci\u00e9e en l'absence de connaissances techniques, constitue un vice cach\u00e9 de nature \u00e0 entra\u00eener la r\u00e9solution de la vente et le principe de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au profit de l'acheteur.\nLe vendeur exciperait en vain de ce que la rupture du tube de direction aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation trop grande que l'acheteur aurait, par ignorance, donn\u00e9e au guidon, s'il a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de mettre de dernier au courant du m\u00e9canisme et des organes de la machine.\nThe note to this decision contains the following observation:\nAu reste, l'allocation de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l'acheteur se justifiait, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 un autre point de vue par la faute que les vendeurs avaient commise en ne lui faisant pas conna\u00eetre le m\u00e9canisme de la machine et les dangers que pouvaient pr\u00e9senter certains organes.\nI have no intention to hold that every manufacturer or vendor of machinery must instruct the purchaser as to its use, or that the purchaser, who without sufficient knowledge attempts to operate machinery, is to be indemnified for the damage resulting from his ignorance, but where as here there is a hidden danger not existing in similar articles and no warning is given as to the manner to safely use a machine, it would appear contrary to the established principles of civil responsibility to refuse any recourse to the purchaser. Subject to what I have said, I do not intend to go beyond the circumstances of the present case in laying down a rule of liability, for each case must be disposed of according to the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. The respondent Emery pretends that when the rifle was sent to him the bolt had been improperly assembled, that he fired it in the condition in which he had received it\u2014it was only fired some three years after its receipt\u2014and that consequently the appellant is liable for the accident. The finding of the learned trial judge is adverse to this contention and I do not base my conclusions on it.\nThe appellant's plea of prescription is not made out, for prescription certainly cannot run before the injury was incurred and these actions were served within the year of the accident. Were this a redhibitory action claiming annulment of the sale, it would possibly be a fatal objection that the respondent Emery allowed the rifle to remain in his possession for three years without firing it. But, as I take it, his action can stand, notwithstanding the contractual relations between the parties, upon article 1053 as well as upon articles 1527, 1528 C.C. The former article is applied every day in the case of passengers injured while travelling on railway carriages, although a contract is made between them and the railway company for their transportation. And I cannot assent to the broad proposition that where the relations between the parties are contractual there cannot also be an action ex delicto in favour of one of them. Very much depends on the circumstances of each particular case.\nI would therefore dismiss the two appeals with costs.\nThe cross-appeals of both respondents against the reduction, by the Court of King's Bench, of the damages allowed by the Superior Court, in my opinion, cannot be entertained. The practice of this court, except in very exceptional cases, is not to allow appeals which put in question the quantum of damages assessed by the courts below. For that reason I would not interfere with the judgment of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe cross-appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, Parent & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent Dunstall: A.

C.\nThe driver of an automobile, who fails to take reasonable precautions against, and to use reasonable care to avoid, danger to human life is, under section 247 of the Criminal Code, criminally responsible for the consequences.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 1 W.W.R. 443) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], on a reserved case for the opinion of that court. The appellant was convicted of manslaughter for unlawfully killing a workman who was working in a manhole in the street by striking him with his motor car, and the conviction was sustained by the Court of Appeal.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. F. Henderson for the appellant.\nHarold Fisher for the respondent. Idington J.\u2014The appellant whilst in charge of and driving an automobile in one of the streets of Regina, ran it over an obstacle described as follows by the learned trial judge:\u2014\nThe tarpaulin was thrown over a form extending about five or six feet from north to south, and looking at it from the north or from the south it was in the shape of an inverted V. The top of this V would be somewhere between four and five feet high. Possibly nearer four than five feet. The width of the bottom of the V would be between three and four feet. The measurements were not given at the trial, but a witness erected a tarpaulin at the trial, in the presence of the court and jury to represent its position at the time of the accident.\nThe structure so described covered a manhole in the street where three men were working for the provincial telephone department, and one of them was killed as the result of this adventure on the part of the appellant.\nFor so killing that man appellant was indicted for manslaughter and found guilty thereof.\nThe street in question was a wide one on which there was ample room for appellant to have driven the car in question over the unobstructed part of the street and passed the said structure in safety.\nThe learned trial judge submitted, after said conviction, a reserved case containing the following question:!\u2014\n1. Did I properly instruct the jury as to the negligence which under the circumstances of the case, would render the accused guilty of manslaughter?\n2.\u2014In view of the fact that there was no evidence that the accused saw the deceased nor knew that the deceased was under the tarpaulin referred to in the evidence, could the accused be found guilty of manslaughter?\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal with the exception of Mr. Justice Newlands, answered these questions in the affirmative and sustained the conviction. The opinion of the majority was written by Mr. Justice Lamont who reviewed at length many decisions which support the judgment now appealed from, if any needed beyond the relevant section of the Criminal Code which I am about to quote.\nMr. Justice Newlands held that in light of some expressions in decisions of long ago that\nthere must be gross negligence before there is criminal liability (and that) the want of ordinary reasonable care which an ordinary prudent man would have observed, although sufficient to render the accused liable in a civil action, is not sufficient in a criminal case.\nSeveral of the cases he cites were mere nisi prius expressions which are not at the present day of much value, even if, as I submit, possibly relevant to the then state of the law.\nThe law applicable to this case is to be found in section 247 of the Criminal Code, cited by Mr. Justice Lamont, which reads as follows:\u2014\n247.\u2014Everyone who has in his charge or under his control anything whatever animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or care may endanger human life, is under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against and use reasonable care to avoid, such danger and is criminally responsible for the consequences of omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform such duty.\nThis was first enacted in the Criminal Code of 1892, section 13.\nIt leaves no room for the refined distinctions between ' negligence and gross negligence.\nIt imposes an absolute duty on the part of him having charge of that which in its use may endanger human life, to take precaution and care.\nIt should not, I respectfully submit, be frittered away by any refinement on the part of judges. The learned trial judge's charge throughout was absolutely correct until he momentarily, on objection, interjected the remark that there was a possible distinction between that which would render a man liable for civil damages for negligence, and that which would render him liable criminally.\nEven if the distinction had been maintainable as I hold it is not in the application of this section, he seems to have covered the ground.\nI should have preferred the charge before so amended.\nSection 1019 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\u2014\n1019.\u2014No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted,\nmight, if need be for which in my view there is none, be relied upon. If Mr. Justice Newland's view is correct it should be applied.\nThe negligence here in question which led to appellant's motor car running over such an obstacle on the street as the above description presents when ample space to pass it without doing so, was so palpably gross that there was not much to be found in the way of palliation even if the old saws about gross negligence could be invoked and relied upon.\nThere was, in my opinion, no miscarriage of justice.\nThe appeal should, I think, be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014Section 258 of the Criminal Code does not I think, substantially change the common law. In this I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Sedge- wick delivered on behalf of the court, in the Union Colliery Company's Case[2]. There may, I think, be cases in which the judges ought to tell the jury that the conduct of the accused in order to incriminate him under this section must be such as to imply a certain indifference to consequences, but such cases, I think, must be rare and this assuredly is not one of them. Where the accused, having brought into operation a dangerous agency which he has under his control, (that is to say dangerous in the sense that it is calculated to endanger human life), fails to take those precautions which a man of ordinary humanity and reasonably competent understanding would take in the given circumstances for the purpose of avoiding or neutralizing the risk, his conduct in itself implies a degree of recklessness justifying the description \"gross negligence.\" The facts of course may disclose an explanation or excuse bringing the accused's conduct within the category of \"reasonable\" conduct. But as Vaughan J. said long ago in Bushell's case[3], the judge does not charge the jury with matters of law in the abstract but only upon that law as growing out of some supposition of fact; and it is much better in such a case as the present, (where, in the absence of explanation, the conduct of the accused\u2014driving a motor through a frequented street at the rate of 12 miles an hour without seeing the road clearly before him\u2014plainly inculpates him) that the trial judge should seek, as Mr. Justice Lamont did, to bring the jury to concentrate their attention upon the various matters alleged in explanation and excuse. Anglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. There was dissent in the court of appeal only upon the first question of the reserved case. To that question s. 247 of the Criminal Code precludes any but an affirmative answer. Failure to take reasonable precautions against, and to use reasonable care to avoid, danger to human life is thereby declared to entail criminal responsibility for the consequences. There is nothing in s. 16, referred to by Mr. Henderson, to qualify this explicit declaration; and s. 258 has no bearing, in my opinion, on a case of manslaughter. It would be most unfortunate if anything should be said or done in this court to countenance the idea that a motor car may be driven with immunity from criminal responsibility if reasonable precautions be not taken against, and reasonable care be not used to avoid, danger to human life. As Mr. Justice Bigham said on the trial of a chauffeur for manslaughter by running over a woman in a London street:\u2014\nThere is a greater responsibility on a person engineering a dangerous machine like a large motor car about the streets than on a man driving a one horse brougham. Rex v. Davis.[4]\nWhat are reasonable precautions and what is reasonable care depends in every case upon the circumstances. Carelessness which ought to have been recognized as not unlikely to imperil human life cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as aught else than culpable negligence.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal arises out of a conviction for manslaughter in the case of a man driving negligently an automobile. It is contended by the accused that there must be gross negligence to incur criminal liability and that the degree of negligence must be higher in criminal cases than in civil cases.\nA large number of cases have been quoted to us on this point and they might appear somewhat conflicting though I think that they could be reconciled by a careful examination of the facts in each case. But the language itself of the Criminal Code disposes of this issue. It says in article 247:\u2014\nEveryone who has in his charge or under his control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate * * * which, in the absence of precaution or care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable care to avoid such danger and is criminally responsible for the consequences of omitting without lawful excuse to perform such duty.\nNobody will dispute the fact that an automobile negligently driven is a dangerous thing. Then the driver of his automobile on the street is bound to take reasonable precaution and use reasonable care to avoid any danger.\nIf our legislators intended to state that there would be criminal liability only in the case of reckless or gross negligence, they would certainly have so declared their intent. But they simply incorporated in our criminal statutes these expressions so well known and so fully construed in the cases of civil negligence.\nThe absence of reasonable care in driving an automobile may then create a criminal liability. The following cases may be quoted in support of this contention: Reg. v. Murray[5]; Rex v. Grout[6]; The Queen v. Dalloway[7].\nEven if we construe the judge's charge as the appellant contends, I consider it legal and sufficient.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. Mignault J.\u2014The appellant was tried on an indictment for manslaughter for having, when driving a motor car in a public street of Regina, caused the death of one Percy Young. The learned trial judge, in charging the jury, directed them as to the law governing the case as follows:\u2014\nIt has been decided and I am going to tell you that the law is, that every person who drives a motor car has a duty to drive it with such care and caution as to prevent, so far as is in his power, any accident or injury to any other person; that is, he has got to use all reasonable precaution to see that no person is injured through his want of caution or precaution.\nAfter the charge, counsel for the accused complained that the learned judge should have told the jury that a greater degree of negligence was required in a criminal case than in a civil one, and the learned judge recalled the jury and gave them this further direction:\u2014\nI am also asked to direct your attention to the fact that in a criminal case the degree of negligence which renders a man culpably negligent is greater than in a civil case. I think that is quite so, and I am going to charge you to that effect\u2014that while in a civil case a man may be liable to an action for damages, in a criminal case it would take a greater degree of negligence to render him liable. That is so. But in this case it is for you to say whether or not the accused, driving a vehicle of that sort along the streets of the city took that care which it was the duty of an ordinary prudent man to take in order to avoid doing damage to some person else on the street. If you come to the conclusion that he did not take that care, and that it was in consequence of that want of care that the death of Young took place, then he is guilty; if he did take that care he is not guilty.\nNotwithstanding Mr. Henderson's able argument, I cannot come to the conclusion that the jury was misdirected. Section 247 of the Criminal Code states the law as follows:\u2014\nEveryone who has in his charge or under his control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable care to avoid, such danger, and is criminally responsible for the consequences of omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform such duty.\nI think the charge is fully supported by this section. It was the duty of the accused to take reasonable precautions to avoid endangering human life, and the jury was told so. It was then for the jury to determine whether the accused had taken these precautions.\nNaturally, in the offence of manslaughter, there may be a greater or less degree of guilt according to the circumstances of each case. I see no reason to doubt that the degree of guilt in this case will be duly considered when sentence is pronounced on the jury's verdict.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1921] 1 W.W.R. 443.\n[2] [1900] 31 Can.

Act, s. 91, s.s. 27.\nHeld, also, that the Alberta \"Liquor Act,\" though some of its provisions may be ultra vires, is still a valid prohibitory Act within the meaning of Part IV of the \"Canada Temperance Act.\"\nHeld, also, that prohibition of import in aid of temperance legislation is not within the purview of section 121 of the B.N.A. Act, as the object of that section is to ensure that \"articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces\" shall not be subjected to any customs duty when carried into any other province. Idington J. contra.\nHeld, also, that the Dominion Parliament can enact laws which may become operative only in certain provinces or which may aid provincial legislation.\nHeld, also, Duff J. dissenting, that non-compliance with the imperative requirement of sub-section (g) of section 152 of the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" that the proclamation of the Governor in Council for taking the poll should state \"the day on which in the event of the vote being in favour of the prohibition, such prohibition will go into force,\" was fatal to the validity of all subsequent proceedings, including the orders in council bringing prohibition into force.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The proclamation was also void on the ground that it extended the hours for taking the poll beyond those expressly provided by the statute, section 101 of the \"Dominion Elections Act\" not being applicable. Anglin J. semble.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Under section 109 of the \"Canada Temperance Act\" and section 153 of the \"Canada Temperance Amending Act,\" the Governor in Council had absolute discretion as to the date on which prohibition shall come into force and he was not authorized to limit the exercise of that discretion by an irrevocable decision at the time of the issue of the proclamation.\nPer Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014The provision in Part IV that the prohibition shall be in force \"if more than one-half of the total number of votes cast in all the electoral districts are in favour of such prohibition\" is satisfied where more than one-half of the total votes cast in the province are in favour of prohibition, although in certain electoral districts there is a majority against prohibition; \"in all the electoral districts\" does not in the context mean \"in each electoral district.\"\nBefore judgment was rendered in this case, the Parliament of Canada passed an Act, in 1921, 11 & 12 Geo. V., c. 20, declaring that \"no order of the Governor in Council declaring prohibition in force in any province * * * shall be * * * ineffective, inoperative or insufficient to bring prohibition into force at the time thereby declared by reason of any error, defect or omission in the proclamation * * *. Held, Idington J. dissenting, that this Act was intra vires of the Parliament of Canada and had a retrospective effect. The legislative jurisdiction which authorized the \"Canada Temperance Amending Act\" of 1919 supports also the interpreting statute of 1921. Its validity cannot be impugned on the ground of interference with civil rights; per Duff J.\u2014as this legislation, though affecting such rights, was not passed \"in relation to\" these rights.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The curative statute of 1921 cannot retrospectively affect the civil rights of the appellant which rested on provincial law, and these rights must be determined according to the law applicable to the province as it existed before such enactment.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1921] 16 Alta. L.R. 113,) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] dismissing the appellant's action, on a case stated for the opinion of the court raising the question of the validity of Part IV of the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" ch. 8 of 10 Geo. V., 1919, and of the orders in council declaring it in force in Alberta and certain other provinces.\nThe essential parts of the stated case are the following:\n1. The defendant is a body corporate with head office at the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, having an agent and carrying on business at Calgary, in Alberta, and elsewhere throughout the Dominion of Canada.\n2. The plaintiff, Gold Seal Limited, is a body corporate and politic duly incorporated by letters patent of the Government of Canada, under the Companies' Act, being Chapter 79, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, and amendments thereto.\n3. The said letters patent of the plaintiff, Gold Seal Limited, were granted the 8th day of November, 1916, and contain inter alia the following provisions: (a) To engage in and carry on in Canada or elsewhere the business of wholesale and retail grocers, wholesale and retail druggists, bonded or other warehousemen, general traders, wholesale and retail merchants, brewers, maltsters, distillers, manufacturers, importers, exporters, packers or bottlers, distributors of all kinds of wines, spirits, malt liquors and of aerated, mineral and artificial waters and other drinks, of teas, coffees, baking powders, fruits, spices, drugs, all kinds of tobaccos and accessories of the tobacco business and any and all other articles and things which may be conveniently dealt in by the Company in connection with above businesses.\n(b) To do all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects. The operation of the Company to be carried on throughout the Dominion of Canada and elsewhere.\n* * *\n5. The plaintiff has at all times since its incorporation carried on an interprovincial business throughout Canada as importer and exporter and distributor of all kinds of wines, spirits and malt liquors and has carried on the business of warehousemen in connection with its said goods.\n* * *\n8. On the 1st day of February, 1921, the plaintiff in the ordinary course of its business pursuant to bona fide transactions in liquor with persons in the Province of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, respectively, duly tendered to the defendant as such common carrier the following goods:\n* * * 10. Each of the said packages was plainly labelled so as to show the actual contents thereof and the name and address of the plaintiff, the consignor thereof, and each of the said packages was addressed to a bona fide person, the actual consignee thereof, at his private dwelling house, to be dealt with in a lawful manner, viz.: as a beverage, all of which was within the knowledge of the defendant at the time of the tender to it of the said package.\n12. Each of the packages mentioned in paragraph 8 hereof contained intoxicating liquor as defined by the Canada Temperance Act.\n13. The defendant has not only refused to carry the goods of the plaintiff as aforementioned but has notified the plaintiff that hereafter it will not carry any such wines, spirits, malt liquors or other intoxicating liquors from the plaintiff at Vancouver in the province of British Columbia to any person or persons or corporation in the Provinces of Alberta or Saskatchewan or Manitoba and that it will not carry any such wines, spirits, malt liquors or other intoxicating liquors from the plaintiff at Calgary in the Province of Alberta to any person or persons or corporation in the Province of Saskatchewan or Manitoba.\n14. In addition to the tenders for carriage of the goods before mentioned on the 1st day of February, 1921, the plaintiff in the ordinary course of its business tendered to the defendant at Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia for delivery to the plaintiff's warehouse at Calgary, Alberta, the following goods:\n* * *\n16. Each of the packages mentioned in paragraph 14 hereof contained intoxicating liquor as defined by the Canada Temperance Act. 17. The defendant has notified the plaintiff that hereafter it will not cany any intoxicating liquors of any kind whatsoever to the plaintiff's warehouse at Calgary, Alberta, whether tendered for carriage by the plaintiff or any other corporation or person and whether to be used for export from Calgary, Alberta, to places where such liquors may be lawfully received or not.\n18. The plaintiff is unable to procure any other means of conveyance for any of the goods herein mentioned.\n19. The plaintiff is unable to carry on its business as an importer and exporter of intoxicating liquors by reason of the defendant's refusal to carry its goods.\n20. The plaintiff has suffered damage in loss of profits on the said goods tendered to the defendant as aforementioned in the sum of $7,260.00, and will continue to suffer damage so long as the defendant refuses to carry intoxicating liquor for the plaintiff.\n21. The defendant has refused and continues to refuse to carry the said or any intoxicating liquors to the plaintiff at Calgary, Alberta, and has refused and continues to refuse to carry said or any intoxicating liquors from the plaintiff at Calgary, Alberta, to any person in the provinces of Manitoba or Saskatchewan and has refused and continues to refuse to carry the said or any intoxicating liquors from the plaintiff at Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia to any person in the Province of Alberta on the sole ground that having regard to the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act being chapter 152 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1906 as amended, and the Dominion Elections Act, chap. 46 of 10-11 George V., and orders-in-council, proclamations and pro- ceedings in the next paragraph hereof mentioned, the defendant could not lawfully carry the said or any intoxicating liquors into the Provinces of Alberta or Saskatchewan or Manitoba.\nThe questions of law stated for the opinion of the court are:\n1. Having regard to all matters and things mentioned in this case and having regard to the Canada Temperance Act as amended, the Dominion Elections Act, the proclamations and orders-in-council and notices and proceedings referred to in this case, is the defendant prohibited in law from receiving and carrying intoxicating liquors from a point outside the Province of Alberta to the plaintiff's warehouse at Calgary, Alberta, for reshipment in the ordinary course of business to places in Canada outside the Province of Alberta or in foreign countries where the same may be lawfully received?\n* * * *\nA. A. McGillivray K.C., for the appellant.\u2014Sections 152 et seq., added to the \"Canada Temperance Act\" in 1919 by 10 Geo. V., c. 8 are ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. Russell v. The Queen[2]; Hodge v. The Queen[3]; Attorney General for Ontario V. Attorney General for Dominion[4]; City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[5]; Attorney General for Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders' Association[6]; because\n(a) they are designed to aid provincial prohibition legislation; (b) The initial step for bringing the prohibitive section (No. 154) into force is a resolution of the provincial legislature;\n(c) Such a resolution is ultra vires of a provincial legislature;\n(d) The amendments apply only to certain provinces\u2014those in which a local prohibition law is in force. As legislation dependent on the \"Peace, order and good government\" provision of sec 91 of the British North America Act (Russell v. The Queen[7], Dominion prohibition legislation to be valid must extend to the whole of Canada;\n(e) The \"liquor evil\" is dealt with, not as a matter of Dominion wide importance, but as a matter of local importance in each province affected. Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[8].\n(f) The amendments interfere with free export and import as between provinces of articles which are the produce or manufacture of one of them, contrary to section 121 of the British North America Act;\n(g) The amendments interfere with the civil rights of the individual citizen safeguarded by the provincial law to have intoxicating liquor in his private dwelling-house.\n(II) that, if valid, upon a proper construction the prohibitive section, No. 154\u2014one of the added sections\u2014does not forbid the importation of intoxicating liquor intended for export;\n(III) that sec. 154 has not been brought into force in Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba,\n(a) because there was not in force in such province a valid law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors for use as a beverage; or, (b) because the requisite majority for prohibition has not been obtained; or,\n(c) because essential steps prescribed for bringing s. 154 into force were not taken.\n(d) because the proclamation of the governor in council for taking the poll did not state the day on which prohibition would go into force.\n(e) because the proclamation contained different hours of polling than those specified in the statute.\nIV. Retrospective operation ought not to be given to the curative statute of 1921 unless Parliament has by clear and unambiguous words made the Act retrospective. Young v. Adams[9]; Midland Railway Co. v. Pye[10]; Taylor v. The Queen[11]; Boulevard Heights Ltd. v. Veilleux[12]; Smithies v. National Association of Operative Plasterers[13]; Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[14]; Ex parte Wilson[15]; The Queen v. The County Council of Norfolk[16].\nThe curative statute of 1921 can have no effect upon this case, as this court can only give the judgment which the court appealed from should have given, on the law as it stood at the date of delivering judgment. Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux[17]; Lemm v. Mitchell [18]\nH. H. Parlee K.C., for the respondent intervenant. The \"Canada Temperance Amending Act\" of 1919, is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament. Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada (10); Russell v. The Queen[19]. This statute does not interfere with any matters of a local or private nature.\nThe proclamation is not invalid, as it is in conformity with section 109 of the \"Canada Temperance Act\" and section 153 of the \"Canada Temperance Amending Act.\"\nThe \"Liquor Act\" of Alberta being, as a fact, an Act in force in that province, the governor in council could issue the necessary proclamation. The Queen v. Burah[20]; Gold Seal Limited v. Dominion Express Company[21].\nThe objections and grounds of error taken are not open to the appellant as, the vote being favorable to prohibition, the governor in council declared the Amending Act in force and the prior proceedings are not open to attack. Ex parte Tippett[22]; The Queen v. Hicks[23]; Reg. v. Shavelear[24].\nThe curative Act of 1921 has been made applicable to pending litigation; Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux[25]; Quilter v. Mapleson[26]; and the Supreme Court of Canada is bound to consider the effect of this amending statute.\nIt was the intention of the Parliament of Canada, when it passed the Act of 1921, to make the same retrospective.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After the argument in this appeal, and after giving much consideration to the several points raised by the counsel for the appellant, I reached the conclusion that his contention must prevail, viz.: that the requirement of subsection (g) of sec. 152 of the \"Canada Temperance Amending Act,\" 1919, (10 Geo. V., c. 8) was imperative and that non-compliance with it rendered all subsequent proceedings invalid. That section provided that\nin any proclamation to be issued by the Governor in Council for taking the votes of all the electors in all the electoral districts of the province for or against the prohibition of the importation or the bringing of intoxicating liquors into the province, such proclamation shall set forth * * (g) the day on which, in the event of the vote being in favour of the prohibition, such prohibition will go into force.\nNo such day was stated in the proclamation in question in this case and, in my opinion, its absence was fatal to the validity of all subsequent proceedings.\nThis conclusion of mine was concurred in by the majority of the court, but, before judgment was delivered Parliament intervened and passed the Act of 1921, 11 & 12 Geo. V., c. 20, which declared:\u2014\nI. No proclamation heretofore or hereafter issued under Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act, as enacted by chapter eight of the Statutes of 1919, second session, shall be deemed to be void, irregular, defective or insufficient for the purpose intended merely because it does not set out the day on which, in the event of the vote being in favour of the prohibition, such prohibition shall go into force, provided it does state that such prohibition shall go into force on such day and date as shall by order in council under section 109 of the Canada Temperance Act be declared.\n2. No order of the Governor in Council declaring prohibitions in force in any province, whether heretofore passed or hereafter to be passed, shall be or shall be deemed to have been ineffective, inoperative, or insufficient to bring prohibition into force at the time thereby declared by reason of any error, defect, or omission in the proclamation or other proceedings preliminary to the vote of the electors, or in the taking, polling, counting or in the return of the vote or in any step or proceeding precedent to the said order, unless it appear to the court or judge before whom the prohibition is in question that the result of the vote was thereby materially affected.\nThis statute made no exception from its application of proceedings in any suit pending at the time of its passage and however unjust this may seem to be, it cannot affect the validity of the Act itself. This Act, in my opinion, is perfectly constitutional, and being so cannot be called into question by us. It cured what I held to be the fatal defect in the proclamation. That being cured, I feel bound to uphold the validity of the proceedings bringing into operation the provisions of the Act of 1919, 10 Geo. V, c. 8, prohibiting the importation into the province of Alberta of intoxicating liquors. It was admittedly not competent for the local legislature to pass such an Act and, in my judgment, the Parliament of Canada, under its general power \"to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada,\" and under its enumerated powers in sect. 91 (2) (B.N.A. Act) \"for the regulation of trade and commerce\" had such power.\nOn all the other points raised by the appellant in the argument of this case, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nUnder all the circumstances of this case, however, I think that the appellant company is entitled to be paid its costs throughout.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a company incorporated under the \"Companies' Act,\" being chapter 79 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, for the following purposes amongst others:\u2014 (See page 426).\nThe respondent is a common carrier for hire also incorporated, for the purpose of so carrying from and to all points in Canada through which the Canadian Pacific Railway runs. Each of the said parties hereto had been carrying on its said respective business when the Alberta \"Liquor Act\" was passed and the amendments thereto were also passed and also when the \"Liquor Export Act\" of said province and amendments in question herein were passed.\nThe appellant's head office is in the City of Vancouver in British Columbia and there it has a private warehouse and it also, at the time in question herein, had a branch office and private warehouse in the City of Calgary in the Province of Alberta.\nThe admitted facts of the stated case so far as necessary to present what has to be acted upon in deciding this appeal, are stated therein as follows:\u2014 (See page 426).\nThe trouble between these parties arises solely out of the question of the validity of certain enactments by the respective legislatures of Alberta and Saskatchewan and Manitoba and supplementing same, the observance or rather non-observance of the provisions of the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" c. 152 of the R.S.C. 1906, as amended, and the failure to observe same in the orders in council, proclamations and proceedings to carry same out; and possibly also the \"Dominion Election Act,\" chapter 46 of 10 & 11 Geo. V.\nShortly and in plain English, if the carrying of said liquor in question so tendered for carriage would have been against the law as claimed by the Government of Alberta it would have been, the respondent must be excused for its refusal, but if the legislative provisions in question, or any of them, were so ultra vires the legislatures of Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba as to be ineffective as excuses, then in whole or in part as the case may turn out the respondent is not excused. The questions raised are somewhat involved and may be made very confusing. It will be observed that the appellant, desirous of testing the various questions of right it sets up, made a series of tenders of shipment of liquor to the respondent and thus got a series of refusals.\nThe parties agree to submit their disputes to the Alberta court in the shape of a stated case, from which I have adopted above several paragraphs as setting forth essentially what is in dispute; to be illuminated so far as I can see by supplementing thereto the story of relevant law as I understand the decisions of the court above bearing thereon.\nBeginning with the latest decision of said court directly bearing upon a very important part of the questions involved, we find that the Province of Manitoba passed in the year 1900 an Act for the suppression of the liquor traffic in that province.\nIn due course a test case was submitted to the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba by the Attorney General of that province and the Manitoba Licence Holders Association in which the question of its constitutional validity was threshed out. That court held that the legislature had exceeded its powers in enacting \"The Liquor Act\" as a whole.\nOn appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that court reversed said decision and held that the Legislature had jurisdiction to enact said \"Liquor Act.\" It is reported in Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders' Association[27]. In that Act there was the following clause:\u2014 119. While this Act is intended to prohibit and shall prohibit transactions in liquor which take place wholly within the Province of Manitoba, except under a licence or as otherwise specially provided by this Act, and restrict the consumption of liquor within the limits of the Province of Manitoba, it shall not effect and is not intended to affect bona fide transactions in liquor between a person in the province of Manitoba and a person in another province or in a foreign country, and the provisions of this Act shall be construed accordingly.\nThis was probably the result of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion[28], where in answer to the following question\n(4) has a provincial legislature jurisdiction to prohibit the importation of such liquors into the province? that court answered as follows:\u2014\nTheir Lordships answer this question in the negative. It appears to them that the exercise by the provincial legislature of such jurisdiction in the wide and general terms in which it is expressed would probably trench upon the exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nThese judgments seem to settle much if duly observed in prohibition legislation.\nBut unfortunately the Legislature of Alberta after passing, in 1916, an Act taken evidently from said Manitoba Act containing same clauses as above quoted relative to importation, saw fit in 1918 to pass another Act in substitution of the former and not only omitted said section but attempted thereby and by numerous amendments to render importation impossible despite the above cited judgment of the Court above. At the same session the legislature enacted by ch. 8 an Act called \"The Liquor Export Act,\" attempting thereby to prohibit the export thereof. I cannot refrain from suggesting that the exportation of all the liquor in or coming into Alberta from that province ought to be held as an aid in promoting the prohibition of the use of said liquor in Alberta which is all that the legislature of that province can be legitimately concerned about.\nPassing that practical view of the matter I submit that the constitutional aspect of the subject matter thus brought forward seems but the counterpart of the importation question expressly passed upon by the judgment above quoted from the Ontario Case[29].\nIn short I agree with the result reached by the Alberta Court in the case of Gold Seal Limited v. The Dominion Express Co.[30], holding that Act ultra vires.\nThat brings me to the consideration of the possible bearing of what is involved herein of section 121 of the B.N.A. Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n121. All articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.\nThis section has not, so far as I know, received anything but a casual consideration by any of the courts having to deal with such questions as are involved herein.\nIndeed until the Alberta Acts, to which I have above referred, there was no legislation in which the rights established by said section would seem to have been plainly disregarded.\nIn the argument before us herein a reference to said section caused the inquiry to be made as to the facts of whether or not any of the said goods tendered for carriage had been of the \"growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces.\" That fact was admitted and subsequently made to appear in a consent filed by leave of this court so far as appears therein.\nHence the question arises whether or not this section does not render ultra vires any effort by either local legislatures or parliament to override the said provision.\nI incline to hold that it does unless in the possible case of an enactment by Parliament in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law.\nCertainly no single province, nor all combined, can override the plain meaning of the language used.\nAnd when we turn to the \"Regulation of Trade and Commerce,\" I think there are many decisions shewing that the powers to be exercised thereby are not applicable to anything that is likely to be involved in the meddling with this provision.\nThere may be, however, times when the products of a province may be infected with, for example, some contagious disease rendering it absolutely necessary, as matter of public safety, to forbid transportation across the lines bounding a province or a district therein.\nIt seems to me that the true and only remedy for such a condition of things would be the exercise by Parliament of its powers resting in its jurisdiction over criminal law and procedure in criminal matters.\nThe section, in my opinion, adds to the difficulties in the way of any provincial legislature seeking to bar the importation of liquor not alone from another country, which the court above expressly decided in the Attorney General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion[31], such legislation could not do, but also from one province where manufactured into another. Again there is, by virtue of the recent decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Great West Saddlery Company v. The King[32], and other cases heard together therewith, established the doctrine that a legal entity created by virtue of the provisions in the \"Dominion Companies Act\" above cited, has rights, despite local legislation, such as no individual citizen would think of asserting.\nIt adds to the strength of appellant's case so far as Alberta and much of Saskatchewan legislation is concerned.\nUntil recently it had been generally supposed to be quite clear that corporations created by Parliament in virtue of its exclusive jurisdiction, for the due execution of any of the specific purposes, falling within the enumerated classes of subjects defined in section 91, of the B.N.A. Act, as, for example, banks and others, could be assigned such rights over property and civil rights as Parliament chose to confer.\nOn the other hand it had been as generally assumed that other corporate creations of Parliament rested upon its residuary powers alone and could not, as regards property and civil rights, exceed in capacity the powers of the private citizen when operating in any province, unless so far as the legislature of the province so concerned, in virtue of its exclusive authority over property and civil rights, had otherwise enacted.\nHence at a very early date the decision in the Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[33], maintained the right of a provincial legislature to declare, by virtue of its said exclusive power over property and civil rights, the contractual capacity of any insurance company opera- ting in the province and the effective limitations of its contract and conditions therein, whether the company had been incorporated by the Dominion Parliament or elsewhere.\nThat I respectfully submit was an exercise by a provincial legislature of a power as great as or greater than to refuse a company, unless licensed, the right to assert its pretensions in the courts of its province.\nThe item of \"Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" in the enumeration of the class of exclusive powers assigned Parliament was pressed then and therein as it has been in numerous cases since, without availing the companies anything.\nIt was again brought forward in the John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[34].\nThe reasoning upon which the court proceeded is now declared, in the recent judgment above referred to, to have rested upon said item No. 2 of the British North America Act, though upon considering it in same cases when before us I doubted that intention, for reasons I set forth in that case[35].\nThe pith of all that was necessarily involved in the John Deere Plow Case34, was the refusal of the authorities in British Columbia to register the company unless and until it changed its name. I humbly conceived that it was not necessary in order to rectify such a wrong to hold that the item 2 of sec. 91 was the basis of the existence of all Dominion corporations save in specified cases otherwise covered by the enumeration of classes in said section.\nUnfortunately the judgment of the court above in said Great West Saddlery Case [36] and other cases makes it clear that there can no longer be any hope of resting the creation of such corporations upon anything save in said item No. 2, relative to \"trade and commerce,\" and that we cannot properly shrink from the very grave consequences of such a departure from the old view that the basis of such incorporation as there in question was the residual power of Parliament and not the item No. 2 relative to the regulation of trade and commerce as now asserted.\nIt is not our province to reconcile the view taken in the Parson's Case [37] and other cases with the latest exposition and decision pursuant thereto, but to apply the latest decision when no way of escape therefrom seems possible as bearing upon the issues raised herein.\nIt would therefore seem clear that a Dominion incorporation such as appellant, engaged merely in the import and export business, cannot by virtue of local legislation be debarred from carrying on its business.\nHonestly doing such as it professes to have been doing could not necessarily infringe upon the prohibition of the local law against the consumption or selling of intoxicating beverages in the Province of Alberta.\nNeither would the carrying by respondent for appellant to another province be necessarily against, or a violation of, the prohibitory legislation thereof, so long or far as such legislation could be held intra vires.\nFor the several foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the refusal of the respondent to carry appellant's goods in question cannot be upheld unless by virtue of some enactment of Parliament.\nIt is contended by respondent that such legislation had been effectively enacted at the time in question. Have each and all of the foregoing difficulties in the way of a provincial legislature, rendering illegal such service as the respondent herein was asked by appellant to perform, been so overcome by Dominion legislation which has become effective and is not ultra vires.\nThat seems to me the crucial question herein.\n10 Geo. V, ch. 8 amending the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" if its several provisions for bringing it into force had been duly observed, in my opinion would have had such effect so far as Alberta was concerned.\nThe tender made for carriage of such goods from British Columbia into any of the other provinces in question herein, wherein said amendment has not been made effective, or elsewhere permitting of lawful carriage there of course stands good.\nThe appellant raises many objections to the validity of the proceedings to bring the amendment into effect.\nIn the first place its counsel points out that the same is only applicable to a\nprovince in which there is at the time in force a law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes.\nAlthough, for the reasons I have pointed out, the legislation in Alberta on the subject has exceeded I had almost said, all bounds, by enacting provisions that seemed in conflict with the law so declared by the court above in the Ontario Case[38], and in other respects which I need not repeat, yet when all these unwarranted attempts are blotted out there still remains a substantial enactment of what was taken from the Manitoba Act held valid, to constitute what might answer to the descriptive terms I have quoted as the basis for a further Dominion Act such as 10 Geo. V, ch. 8. Another objection taken is that Parliament cannot supplement and aid provincial legislation, I am of the opinion that it can and in doubtful cases of the respective jurisdiction of the provincial legislature and Dominion Parliament it is often advisable that there should be concurrent legislation to overcome such doubt or difficulty.\nAgain it is contended that Parliament cannot enact a law which may only become operative in a part of Canada.\nI am quite unable to understand such a contention in face of the fact that the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" which distinctly provided for counties and other municipalities by the votes of the electors, bringing same into force it should then and there become effective, and such conditional legislation was upheld in the Russell Case[39].\nThe condition of its becoming operative is by this amendment made dependent upon the vote of the electorate of the province to be affected, instead of being confined to that of the county or other municipality in question, rendering it so.\nThe conditional character of the legislation is in principle the same. And there is a very good reason for Parliament providing such a course. It requires the support of public opinion in any district affected by such legislation in order to render its enforcement effective, instead of becoming a mockery leading to evil results of a most undesirable kind.\nIndeed it may be doubted whether or not the support of a bare majority of those voting can be relied upon as a safe guide in that respect. That, however, is a question with which we are not concerned. All we have to deal with is the existence of the power to enact such a conditional form of legislation. A number of other objections of less import made by counsel for appellant seem to me answered by the same mode of reasoning I have adopted as to one or more of the foregoing objections which I have specifically dealt with out of respect to the arguments presented.\nAssuming for argument's sake, as has been suggested, that parts of the Alberta Acts trespass on the field of criminal law, when the Dominion Parliament which is possessed of absolute power over \"criminal law and procedure in criminal matters,\" sees fit to pass an enactment which, with the rest of the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" may well fall within and be attributed to an exercise of that source of its jurisdiction for so enacting though their Lordships in the court above in the Russell Case[40], assigned another as preferable, the room for dispute seems to me ended.\nEven if to enforce that enacted within the reserved power of \"peace, order and good government\" I submit the powers given relative to \"criminal law and procedure in criminal matters\" may be relied upon as well as the other, if inherently applicable.\nThere remains a further ground of objection taken by the appellant that the right of export is not touched by the amendment in question and hence the importation for the mere purpose of export is for a commercial purpose within the meaning of the amendment, sec. 154, s.s. 3.\nThis certainly is a fairly arguable point but I incline to think, having regard to what subsection (c) of section 154 regarding the transportation of liquor through the province and a doubtful import of the word \"commercial\" when read in connection with the rest of the proviso in which it appears, it was the evident purpose of the amendment, read as a whole, to exclude any other form of export but that provided by through transportation.\nThe final point made that the statutory provisions made for the amendment coming into force have not been duly followed seems to me fatal to the said proceedings.\nThe amended Act in question expressly provides that the Governor in Council\nmay issue a proclamation in which shall be set forth\n(a) The day on which the poll for taking the votes of the electors for and against the prohibition will be held;\n(b) that such votes will be taken by ballot between the hours of nine o'clock in the forenoon and five o'clock in the afternoon of that day;\n(c) the day on which, in the event of the vote being in favour of the prohibition, such prohibition will go into force.\nIt seems to me idle to try to minimize the effect of these provisions and to try to justify such plain departures therefrom as were taken by extending, in the case of Manitoba and part of Alberta, the hours for taking the poll and also failing in each of the three provinces to declare when the Act was to come into force.\nIn the case of Manitoba the extension of the hours for taking the poll was directed by the proclamation in absolute disregard of the express provisions in subsection (b) above quoted.\nIn the case of Alberta the disregard thereof was the work of a returning officer who presumed to assert, contrary to the fact, in his notice to the electors, that the extended hourshad been named by the proclamation.\nCan such elections be held to be in due conformity with the imperative basic conditions precedent, laid down in the statute as the only method of procedure which should be taken to enable the constituted authorities to take steps for bringing that statute into force and rendering it effective? The word \"shall\" used in declaring what such a proclamation should, if ventured on, contain, shews the peremptory nature of the enactment.\nThat governed items therein from (a) to (g) and the only permissive thing, in way of adding thereto, was as follows\n(h) any further particulars with respect to the taking and summing up of the votes of the electors as to the Governor in Council sees fit to insert therein,\nwhich was not acted upon.\nI cannot find existent in the legislation providing for this peculiar election, or elsewhere, any curative or validating enactment anticipating and providing for such gross or any departures from the express provisions of Parliament requiring the hours stated of voting (nine to five) to be observed and the date of the coming into force to be named.\nThe only such enactment cited and relied upon is section 101 of the \"Dominion Elections Act\" assented to 1st July, 1920, which by its first subsection enacted as follows:\u2014\n101.(1). Whenever under the Canada Temperance Act a vote is to be taken, the procedure to be followed shall, in lieu of the procedure therein directed, be the procedure laid down in this Act with such modifications as the Chief Electoral Officer may direct as being necessary by reason of the difference in the nature of the question to be submitted, and with such omissions as he may specify on the ground that compliance with the procedure laid down is not required.\nThis was enacted two months after the respective proclamations for Alberta and Saskatchewan, calling the election for taking the required poll, to bring into force the amendment in question to the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" had been issued.\nIn each of these proclamations the hours named within which the votes were to be taken were nine o'clock in the forenoon and five o'clock in the after noon. In the case of Manitoba the proclamation was issued on the 14th of Aug., 1920, and the hours named within which the votes were to be taken were, as to urban polling subdivisions, between six o'clock in the forenoon and six o'clock in the afternoon, and as to rural polling subdivisions, eight o'clock in the forenoon and six o'clock in the afternoon. The said section 101 could not by its terms be made applicable to such a change of the said imperative conditions I quote, and the Chief Electoral Officer never attempted to so apply it\u2014though acting thereon in other regards not in question.\nIt is to be observed that the hours within which voting must take place had been peremptorily fixed by the enactment and that no one can now tell what the exact result would have been had that been adhered to; and also that the delegated duty of fixing the time when its result was, if favourable, to become law was imperatively required to be declared by order-in-council previous to such voting and stated in the proclamation calling the election.\nThese departures from the express conditions of bringing the statutes into effect were, to my mind, fatal errors and rendered ineffective the attempt to bring the Act into force in said three provinces, and thus left the appellant's tenders of goods for carriage by respondent so effective, at the time when made, as to entitle the appellant to succeed therein.\nIt is true that Parliament has, after the argument herein and pending the delivery of judgment thereon, enacted a statute for the purpose of curing the effect of such errors. Clearly that statute cannot retrospectively affect the civil rights of appellant though Parliament proceeds in a general way therein to deal with pending cases as if possessed with plenary powers over property and civil rights. With great respect I cannot so hold or maintain the attempt to take away the rights of a litigant which must be determined by the relevant law of the province bearing thereon where its cause of action arose, and, I submit, cannot be properly affected by any enactment of Parliament.\nThere might arise cases of corporate bodies created within and by virtue of the powers assigned specifically by the enumerated items of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act to the Dominion alone, and solely dependent for their civil rights thereon, when a judgment founded thereon might be affected by retrospective legislation, but this is not such a case. The appellant's rights herein rested entirely, save as to the important fact of its incorporation, on provincial law, as to property and civil rights which were, save as to its incorporation, not conferred by Parliament and over which it is powerless either to impair or take away. I do not think the destruction of limitation of any of the powers of the legal entity of appellant can be held as within the purview of the said Act. I cannot conceive that Parliament intended to discriminate against a creation of its own when clearly it intended all to be treated alike. Private citizens and provincial or other than Parliament's non-corporate creations, clearly could not be affected by such legislation.\nIt would, in my view, be improper to express any opinion as to the effect of this curative legislation beyond dealing with the civil rights of the parties hereto. In my opinion the appellant is entitled to have the judgment from us which the court below should have pronounced, or, in other words, determine the civil rights of the parties by the law applicable to the province as it stood before this enactment.\nWe have no jurisdiction to determine otherwise.\nIt is suggested by the intervenant's counsel in a supplementary factum, that though we have by the \"Supreme Court Act\" to declare the law as the court below should have done, yet this amendment by Parliament which created the court and so defined its limitations of jurisdiction, must have intended by this enactment to have changed, for the purposes of this case, that limitation.\nI do not find in the Act in question any such intention either express or implied.\nThe Act, so far as I can understand it, was to my mind so framed in this regard by reason of haste and accidental oversight of the limited powers of Parliament over property and civil rights.\nLet us assume for a moment that Parliament had at any time enacted, quite independently of this conditional form of legislation, by way of referendum, as I conceive would be quite competent for it, if rested on its exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law, a statute prohibiting the import or export of liquor, and pretended therein to deal with the rights theretofore acquired by any one over property or civil rights resting solely upon the provincial legislation in virtue of the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures over property and civil rights; and to take such rights away by merely making such enactment retrospective, as is attempted by the Act in question herein, how long would argument in support of such legislation be listened to by any court acquainted with the B.N.A. Act? Of course if Parliament acting upon item No. 2 and asserting an obvious intention to destroy or limit the powers of its creature resting thereon, I conceive it might do so even if retroactive legislation of another character than presented for consideration herein.\nOr suppose the appellant had chosen to pass this court and go to the court above, is it conceivable that it would, if taking the view I do as to the effect of non-observance of the conditions of bringing into operation this referendum style of legislation, feel bound to hold such an infringement upon property and civil rights as they existed before the enactment of such an Act as binding it?\nI am of the opinion that on the stated case the appellant is entitled to succeed and that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the view of the majority of the Appellate Division that the proclamation was not invalid. The evidence furnished by the parent enactment (\"The Canada Temperance Act\") as well as by the amending statute of 1919 appears to point rather definitely to the conclusion that the order in council to be passed after the vote has been taken is intended to be the operative instrument by which the prohibitions are to be brought into force and the instrument governing the date upon which they are to become law.\nConsider first the provisions of the parent Act, the relevant section being section 109. The language is unqualified. Where a petition has been adopted, the section provides\nthe Governor in Council may at any time after the expiration of 60 days from the day on which the same was adopted declare that Part II of this Act shall be in force and take effect on the day on which the licenses then in force shall expire if such day be not less than 90 days from the \"date of such order in council\" and if less \"then on the like day in the following year,\" and \"upon, from and after that day\" Part II of the Act shall become and be in force. It is to be observed that the section commits it to the uncontrolled discretion of the Governor in Council to determine the time when the order in council shall pass and it is by reference to this date that the time is fixed when the prohibitions are to come into force.\nThe second subsection (which applies where there are no unexpired licences) in terms entrusts the Governor in Council with absolute authority to decide when Part II shall come into operation.\nThis authority of the Governor in Council which arises only after the vote has been taken seems to extend to all cases; and it would extend, I think, to any case in which by the proclamation, a specified day has been named.\nThe fact, no doubt, that by section 2 the Governor in Council is authorized to state in the proclamation the date upon which, in the case of a favourable vote, Part II is to come into operation gives colour to the suggestion that it is intended to authorize the Governor in Council to decide upon that date in advance. But the tenor of section 109 seems opposed to such an inference. It is the order in council in every case which brings the prohibitions into force and it is the date of the order in council which in every case automatically determines the time when they are to take effect. The section in pointed terms authorizes the Governor in Council to act \"at any time\" after the expiration of 60 days from the adoption of the petition and it would seem singular indeed, if his discretion was to be controlled by the naming of a date in the proclamation, that some reference to that contingency does not appear in section 109. It may be suggested, of course, that votes might conceivably be influenced by the circumstance that the prohibitions are to come into force upon this or that date and that to change the date would involve something like a breach of faith. But giving the fullest weight to that suggestion it seems to be quite overborne by the obvious inconveniences entailed by adopting the alternative construction under which all the labour and expense of taking the vote might be wasted by the accident of the proceedings being prolonged (in consequence, for example, of legal controversies) beyond the date named in the proclamation. It is difficult to suppose such a result to have been contemplated.\nThe language of section 153 of the \"Canada Temperance Amending Act\" is just as pointed and imposes an imperative duty upon the Governor in council to \"declare the prohibition in force\" if the vote proves to be favourable to the petition.\nThe inconvenience, indeed, of the alternative construction is perhaps even more obvious in the case of proceedings under the amending Act. Harvey C.J. has alluded to circumstances indicating the impracticability of fixing in advance the day upon which the Governor in Council is to act after the result of the poll is finally known. Needless to say, there is nothing fanciful in these suggestions; and where the area (as under the amending Act) in which the vote is to be taken is a whole province they are of the gravest practical importance.\nFor these reasons I think the weight of argument favours the conclusion that the discretion of the Governor in Council under section 109 and under section 153 is not fettered by anything stated in the proclamation as to the date when the prohibitions are to come into force, in other words, that he was not authorized under the original Act or under the amending Act to limit the exercise of that discretion by an irrevocable decision at the time of the issue of the proclamation.\nIt seems accordingly that if a date be named it must be as a provisional date subject to the possibility, at all events, of any change which the Governor in Council may consider necessary in the exercise of his judgment after the result of the vote has been ascertained; and if that be the manner in which this machinery was intended to operate it would seem to be in furtherance of the intention of Parliament to say simply, as does the proclamation in question, that the prohibitions shall come into force in accordance with the order of the Governor in Council under section 109 of the Act.\nThe fact that a direction is mandatory in form is not conclusive, of course, as to the result of noncompliance; and the statute in this case does not assist us by any express provision. The duty of the court therefore is to collect the intention of Parliament by examining the whole scope of the enactment. Liierpool Bank v. Turner[41]. As Lord Penzance said in Howard v. Bodington[42]:\u2014\nYou must in each case look to the subject matter; consider the importance of the provision (in question) and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act; and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether the matter is what is called imperative or only directory. Considering the matter in this aspect and guided by the considerations indicated above, my conclusion must be that even if the appellants are right in their view that section 152 directs the insertion in the proclamation of the date of coming into force of the prohibitions (specified by the day of the month), then the direction is what is called \"directory\" only, that is to say, there is no solid ground for implying that nullity shall be the consequence of disobedience.\nThe prohibitions of the amending Act of 1919 were therefore duly brought into force if the Parliament of Canada had authority to enact them and if the other conditions mentioned in the Act have been fulfilled, namely, that there shall be a \"law prohibiting\" the sale of intoxicating liquor \"in force\" in the Province of Alberta and that the result of the vote shall be favourable.\nI agree with the reasons given by the Chief Justice in the court below that both these conditions were satisfied.\nThe capacity of the Parliament of Canada to enact the amendment of 1919 is denied. With this I do not agree. And, first, I am unable to accept the contention founded upon section 121 of the B.N.A. Act; the phraseology adopted, when the context is considered in which this section is found, shews, I think, that the real object of the clause is to prohibit the establishment of customs duties affecting inter-provincial trade in the products of any province of the Union.\nIt is not strictly necessary to express any opinion upon the point whether this statute can be supported as passed in exercise of the power given by the second enumerated head of section 91. It has been held that the literal meaning of the words \"trade and commerce\" must be restricted in order to give scope for the exercise of the powers committed to the provinces by section 92. The legislation of 1919, however, deals only with imports into the provinces to which it applies and it is legislation clearly, I think, beyond the authority of a province to enact. The reason mentioned therefore seems to fail of application. It has been held also that the regulation of a particular business in each of the provinces throughout the Dominion by a general system of Dominion licensing is not a \"regulation of trade and commerce\" within the meaning of the phrase as here employed. That rests, in part at least, upon the ground that such a construction would give to No. 2 a scope including subjects specially dealt with by other heads of section 91, banking, e.g. and shipping. This is an objection which would appear to have little force as applied to legislation dealing only with foreign or inter-provincial trade and it seems at least much open to question whether the general elucidation of the language of No. 2 in Parson's Case[43], when properly construed, contemplates the exclusion of legislation dealing with exports or imports even of a specified commodity from the ambit of the authority arising under that head; and in the Insurance Act Reference[44], it was expressly held that an enactment requiring a foreign company to take out a licence before carrying on the business of insurance in Canada was an enactment within the category of \"regulation of trade and commerce.\"\nA much more serious objection, however, arises from the decision of the Lords of the Judicial Committee in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Dominion[45]. It was there held that the authority touching the regulation of \"trade and commerce\" given by section 91 contemplates the passing of laws with the view to the preservation of the thing to be regulated and not with a view to its destruction and consequently that a law abolishing all retail transactions in liquor within a specified area could not be supported as a law passed in the exercise of this power.\nIt is undoubted that the Act of 1919 was passed in aid of provincial liquor enactments and in substance aims at the abolition of transactions in liquor within the provinces to which it applies, and that being the case there is of course much force in the suggestion that the Act of 1919 could not be sustained as a valid enactment in \"regulation of trade and commerce\" consistently with their Lordships' decision.\nIn a wider view it might be well suggested that a law prohibiting the export or the importation of a specified commodity or class of commodities from or into a particular province is, when considered in its bearing upon the trade and commerce of the Dominion as a whole, a law passed in \"regulation of trade and commerce;\" and it may be open to doubt whether their Lordships' decision on the reference of 1896 ought to be regarded as applying to an enactment solely directed to the prohibition of such exports or imports.\nOn the other hand the enactments of the amending Act are not enactments dealing with a matter falling within any of the classes of matters exclusively assigned to the provinces by section 92 and they are within Dominion competence if they are enactments touching \"the peace, order and good government of Canada\" which seems too clear for argument. It is argued that such an enactment must be one whose operation extends to the whole of Canada\u2014which this enactment does, conditionally at all events. But I am not prepared without further examination of the point to agree that an enactment in the terms of the Act of 1919 confined in its operation to one province could not be sustained as relating to \"the peace, order and good government of Canada.\" I pass no opinion upon that point.\nIn this view it is not necessary to pass upon the question of the validity of the statute of 1921 but as it has been the subject of discussion by other members of the court I will give my opinion upon it.\nClearly, I think, if the Dominion had power to pass the Act of 1919 it had power by a subsequent enactment to construe it with the consequence that all courts would be bound to observe the construction so placed upon it. That is so because the power of legislation is plenary and it could not be seriously disputed that given legislation being valid as dealing with a subject within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament a subsequent interpreting statute would equally be valid provided of course that the interpreting statute did not so entirely change the character of the legislation as to cause it to operate within a field withdrawn from Dominion authority. If the enactment as construed could validly have been passed then the construing statute is intra vires. Could the provisions of 1921 have been enacted as part of the statute of 1919 without impairing the validity of this last mentioned statute? The answer to this question must be in the affirmative except at all events as to the third section. And it is no objection that pending litigation is affected since that is only one of the consequences necessarily involved in the full exercise of the authority to pass legislation of the type in question. The fallacy lies in failing to distinguish between legislation affecting civil rights and legislation \"in relation to\" civil rights. Most legislation of a repressive character does incidentally or consequentially affect civil rights. But if in its true character it is not legislation \"in relation to\" the subject matter of \"property and civil rights\" within the provinces, within the meaning of section 92 of the British North America Act, then that is no objection although it be passed in exercise of the residuary authority conferred by the introductory clause. Ancillary legislation permissible as in exercise of the powers given by the enumerated heads of 91 may be legislation of a different order, that is to say, it may be legislation which, if enacted by a province, would be legislation \"in relation to\" some at least of the matters (civil rights, for example) falling within the classes of subjects specified in section 92. Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[46]. The parent Act as well as the amending Act affect property and civil rights although they are not enactments in relation to that subject. The amending Act makes the importation of liquors into Alberta unlawful and accordingly a common carrier could not either under the provisions of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" or by the common law be required to accept liquor for shipment into Alberta. The right which otherwise the owner of the liquor would have possessed has therefore ceased to exist because the Dominion Parliament has validly declared the act he could before have required to be done an unlawful act. The legislation does not deal with the duties of common carriers as such but the law as declared by it necessarily has a very important effect upon the duties of common carriers. So the Act of 1921 declares that certain acts shall be deemed to have been unlawful and it follows that a court holding that the importation would have been unlawful must, as a consequence, hold that the right set up by the shipper did not exist.\nIt is not quite clear indeed whether or not the right set up in this case is not really a right derived from Dominion legislation, but that is of little importance. Neither by the law of British Columbia nor by that of Alberta could a common carrier be required to do an act which by competent legislative authority had been declared to be illegal.\nSection 3 presents a different question. It may well be argued that it is legislation relating to civil rights or to the administration of justice and not within the competence of Parliament to enact in exercise of the residuary power. I express no opinion upon this as there has been no argument upon it.\nFor these reasons the appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff company is incorporated under the Dominion \"Companies' Act\" and empowered to engage throughout Canada, in buying, selling, importing and exporting intoxicating liquors. The defendant company is a common carrier and operates between the points to and from which the liquors, of which the carriage is in question in this action, were consigned. The plaintiff sues to recover damages for alleged wrongful refusal by the defendant to accept for transport four consignments of intoxicating liquors, within the meaning of that term in the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" which were duly tendered to it. One of these shipments, tendered at Vancouver, British Columbia, was, to the knowledge of the defendant, intended for export by the plaintiff from its warehouse at the City of Calgary in the Province of Alberta to which it was consigned. Each of the other three shipments was, to the defendant's knowledge, bona fide consigned to an individual at his private dwelling house where the provincial law in each instance permitted such liquors to be received and used.\nThe material facts are stated in a special case submitted, pursuant to an order of a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, for the opinion of the Appellate Division as to the legality of the defendant's refusal to carry. If the plaintiff should be entitled to recover in respect of the rejection of the four shipments the parties have agreed that the damages sustained by it amounted to $7,260 and that judgment should be entered for that sum.\nIt is stated in the special case that the defendant justified its refusal to accept the tendered shipments solely on the ground that, having regard to the \"Canada Temperance Act\" (R.S.C. [1906], c. 152), as amended in 1919, and the Dominion \"Elections Act\" (10 & 11 Geo. V, c. 46) and certain orders in council, proclamations and proceedings purporting to have been made, issued and taken by virtue of those statutes, it could not lawfully carry intoxicating liquors into the several provinces for which the shipments were respectively destined, viz.: Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta by a majority judgment determined the issue so presented in favour of the defendant and dismissed the action. From that judgment the present appeal is brought. In the provincial court counsel were heard representing the parties to the litigation and the Attorney-General of Alberta, who, upon being notified of the hearing by direction of the court, intervened to oppose the plaintiff's contention. The Minister of Justice, although likewise notified, was not represented. In this court counsel appeared for the plaintiff as appellant and for the Attorney General of Alberta as intervened. Neither the defendant nor the Minister of Justice was represented.\nThe appellant urged the following grounds of appeal:\n(The learned judge here sets out the grounds of appeal as the same are stated at pages 430 et seq. supra).\nBut for legislation (11 & 12 Geo. V, c. 20), passed since the argument I should have been prepared to give effect to the appellants' contention that non-compliance with the imperative requirement of clause (g) of s. 152 of the \"Canada Temperance Act\"\u2014that the proclamation of the Governor in Council for taking the poll should state\nthe day on which, in the event of the vote being in favour of the prohibition such prohibition will go into force\u2014\nwas fatal to the validity of all the subsequent proceedings, including the orders in council bringing prohibition into force. This would have meant that they would recover judgment for $7,260 and costs. Parliament has, however, by an Act, so framed as to admit no doubt as to its construction in this particular ordained (s. 2) that, notwithstanding any such defects, those orders in council shall be and shall be deemed to have been valid, effective and sufficient from their respective dates.\nAlthough at first disposed to doubt the power of Parliament thus to take away the civil rights of litigants, further consideration has satisfied me that, since such interference with civil rights, though no doubt intended (vide s. 3), is merely an incidental consequence of the legislation, its validity cannot be successfully impugned on that ground. The legislative jurisdiction which authorized the Act of 1919 will likewise support the auxiliary statute of 1921\u2014at all events sections 1 and 2 thereof.\nThis recent Act also overcomes any objection to the orders in council bringing prohibition into force based on prolongation of the hours of polling beyond those prescribed by clause (b) of sec. 152. There is nothing in the record to shew that the result of the vote was materially affected either by that irregularity or by the omission from the proclamation of the date on which prohibition should go into force.\nInterference by ex post facto legislation with rights involved in pending legislation, even when deemed necessary in the public interest, is to be deprecated. Where such interference is not necessary to the attainment of the object of the legislation it is difficult to conceive of any defence for it. Here, if my view of the fatal effect of the omission from the proclamation of the Governor in Council of the date on which prohibition should come into force be correct, the plaintiffs' right to recover $7,260 has been taken away. The purpose of the act of June last\u2014to prevent the loss of the thousands of dollars expended in taking polls in several provinces\u2014would have been fully attained had a proviso saving the rights of the plaintiffs and others in like plight been inserted in it.\nThe legislation of 1919 when brought into force prohibits the importation of intoxicating liquor into those provinces where its sale for beverage purposes is forbidden by provincial law. It was enacted as Part IV (secs. 152 to 156) of the Canada \"Temperance Act\" (R.S.C. [1906], c. 152) and was passed in order to supplement and make more effective such provincial prohibitory laws. Its true character therefore is temperance legislation rather than legislation regulating the importation of liquor as a matter of trade and commerce. It prohibits; it does not regulate. Moreover, it deals with trade in only one class of commodities. In view of these facts Part IV itself should be regarded, as the Canada \"Temperance Act\" has been (Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Dominion[47]; Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[48], rather as an exercise of the general power of Parliament to pass laws for the \"peace, order and good government of Canada,\" than ascribable to its powers to legislate for \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" (the only enumerated head invoked to support it) or authorized by any other of the enumerated powers conferred by s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nIt is common ground that the prohibition of importation is beyond the legislative jurisdiction of the province. It is not covered by any of the enumerated heads of s. 92. It lies outside of the subject matters enumeratively entrusted to the provinces under that section and upon it, therefore, the Dominion Parliament can legislate effectively as regards a Province under its general power \"to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada\". Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta48. The \"Canada Temperance Act\" itself, the validity of which was upheld in Russell v. The Queen[49], Lord Haldane assures us is an instance of such a case. The facts that the legislation of 1919 was designed to aid provincial prohibition legislation, that it applies only to certain provinces,\u2014those in which a local prohibition law is from time to time in force,\u2014that it deals with the liquor evil as a matter of local importance in each province affected, and that it interferes with civil rights of the individual citizen safeguarded by the provincial law therefore do not afford arguments against its validity. The propriety of concurrent or supplementary legislation to cover a field which lies partly within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures and partly within that of the Dominion Parliament was indicated by Lord Atkinson in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[50].\nNor do I see any force in the objection that the initial step towards bringing the prohibitive section 154 into force is a resolution of the provincial legislature. I see no reason why a provincial legislature may not thus intimate its opinion that concurrent action by the Dominion authorities is desirable. Under the \"Canada Temperance Act\" the initial step is a petition of one-fourth of the electors of the county or city in which it is sought to bring that Act into force.\nNeither is the legislation under consideration in my opinion obnoxious to s. 121 of the B.N.A. Act. The purpose of that section is to ensure that articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any province shall not be subjected to any customs duty when carried into any other province. Prohibition of import in aid of temperance legislation is not within the purview of the section. The prohibition of import and of inward transportation by sec. 154 is absolute. No exception is made in favour of liquor intended for export from the province into which it is sought to take it. I find nothing to justify the reading of such an exception into the statute.\nThe two remaining grounds taken by the appellants were that sec. 154 was not in force in the province of Alberta (a) because the law of that province prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor as a beverage is ultra vires in that it prohibits the holding within the province of liquor for export therefrom, and (b) because a majority in favour of prohibition was not obtained in each of the electoral districts of the province.\n(a) The stated case submits no question as to the Alberta \"Liquor Act.\" That statute is not set up as a justification of the defendants' refusal to accept the tendered shipments. In fact it is not mentioned in the stated case at all. Its invalidity was raised in argument by counsel for the plaintiff solely to support his contention that because there was not a valid prohibition law in force in Alberta a condition precedent to the Dominion prohibition of import being brought into effect in the province did not exist. If the Alberta \"Liquor Act\" should be construed as prohibiting the holding within that province of intoxicating liquor for export (having regard to the provisions of the \"Liquor Export Act\" I do not think that is its effect) it might be pro tanto, but pro tanto only, ultra vires. The question is discussed at length in the judgments rendered by the Supreme Court of Alberta in Gold Seal Ltd. v. Dominion Express Co.[51]. Speaking generally, I am disposed to accept the dissenting opinions of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stuart in that case. (b) Section 153 of the amended \"Canada Temperance Act\" provides that\nthe Governor in Council shall by order in council declare the prohibition in force (in the province) if more than one-half of the total number of votes cast in all the electoral districts are in favour of such prohibition.\nCounsel for the appellant contends that the word \"all\" is here used in the sense of \"each and every of.\" No doubt \"all\" is often susceptible of that meaning. But the context, particularly the words immediately preceding, viz., \"one-half of the total number of votes cast,\"\u2014and the general tenor of the statute makes it plain that the phrase \"in all the electoral districts\" is here used as the equivalent of \"in the whole province.\" Any other interpretation of it would shock common sense. Although the majority in some of the electoral districts in each of the three provinces was against prohibition, a majority of the total number of votes cast in each province, taken as a whole, was distinctly in favour of it. This contention of the appellant fails.\nOn the whole case therefore, although with some reluctance because I think the plaintiffs were quite unnecessarily and, if I may say so with respect, arbitrarily deprived of what I regard as a good cause of action by the ex post facto legislation of last June, I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nWith some hesitation, because of the presence in section 3 in the recent Act of the concluding words \"having regard to the provisions of this Act,\" I concur in the exercise of discretion by this court in awarding to the plaintiffs their costs of this litigation throughout.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014As this case stood after the argument, and before Parliament enacted the recent statute, 11-12 Geo. V, ch. 20, which received Royal sanction on the 4th June 1921, my opinion was that the proclamation ordering the vote should have mentioned the day on which prohibition would go into force in the event of the vote being in its favour (section 152 \"Canada Temperance Act\"), and that the omission of this statement rendered the subsequent proceedings void. This would have entitled the appellant to judgment for $7,260, the agreed amount of its damages by reason of the respondent's refusal to carry its goods.\nThe new statute materially modified this situation, and notwithstanding Mr. McGillivray's ingenious argument I must hold that it is clearly retrospective. The omission made in the proclamation therefore can no longer justify a judgment in favour of the appellant.\nOn all other features of the case my opinion was against the contentions of Mr. McGillivray. I take it that the validity of the \"Canada Temperance Act\" having been affirmed by the Judicial Committee in Russell v. The Queen[52], the amendment of 1919, 10 Geo. V., ch. 8, being legislation of the same character, cannot be assailed as transcending the powers of Parliament.\nNor do I think that any argument can be based on sec 121 of the British North America Act which states that\nall articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free in each of the other provinces.\nThis section, which so far as I know has never been judicially construed, is in Part VIII of the Act, bearing the heading \"Revenues, Debts, Assets, Taxation,\" and is followed by two sections which deal with customs and excise laws and custom duties In the United States constitution, to which reference may be made for purposes of comparison, there is a somewhat similar provision (art. 1, sec. 9 par. 5 and 6). the language of which, however, is much clearer than that of sec. 121. It says:\u2014\nNo tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.\nNo preference shall be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one state over those of another; nor shall vessels bound to or from one state be obliged to enter, clear or pay duties to another.\nI think that, like the enactment I have just quoted, the object of section 121 was not to decree that all articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the provinces should be admitted into the others, but merely to secure that they should be admitted \"free,\" that is to say without any tax or duty imposed as a condition of their admission. The essential word here is \"free\" and what is prohibited is the levying of custom duties or other charges of a like nature in matters of interprovincial trade.\nMy conclusion therefore is that in view of the provisions of the statute of 1921 judgment can no longer be rendered in favour of the appellant on the only point where, in my opinion, under the then state of the law, it was justified in attacking the proclamation and the order in council. The appeal must consequently be dismissed.\nOn the question of costs, however, other considerations arise. Here the statute of 1921 gives the court full discretion to make such order as it may see fit, and it is natural that it should have done so. Retrospective legislation of this nature, affecting pending litigation, can only be justified under very extraordinary circumstances. It takes away from the appellant its right to obtain damages for the refusal of the respondent to carry its goods, refusal which was not, when made, justified by the proceedings had under the \"Canada Temperance Act.\" But as it leaves to the court full discretion to adjudicate upon the costs, I think that the appellant should have its costs throughout. As I have said, before the statute of 1921, the appellant was right in attacking the proclamation as being insufficient in an essential particular, and I would not further penalize it by making it bear the costs it has incurred. And although, as a rule, costs should follow the event, here, carrying out what I take to be the intention of section 3 of the new statute, I would grant them to the appellant.\nMy opinion is to dismiss the appeal but to give to the appellant its costs here and below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs against respondent.\n[1] 16 Alta.

The ore was not delivered on that date though S. had been urging expedition and had offered to extend the time and in October the company wrote S. that material shipments could not be made for some months and suggesting that the contract be cancelled, which S. refused to do. There was no formal extension. In November conversations took place between S. or his representative and the manager of the mines which ended in the latter undertaking to deliver the ore as fast as it could be got out. The delays continued with S. still urging expedition until June, 1918, when the company wrote that no further deliveries would be made. In an action by S. for damages the breach of contract was admitted the only question being its date and the consequent measure of damages.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 561) that there was no breach of the contract before June, 1918; that there was no new contract entered into as a result of the conversations that took place in November, 1917, but the parties acted throughout on the basis of the original agreement made in April; and that the measure of damages was the difference between the contract price and the value of the ore in June, 1918. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial as to the measure of damages.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nAnglin K.C. and R.C.H. Cassels for the appellants. The respondents were in fault and the appellants exercised forbearance up to June 21st, 1918. The breach occurred on that date and the measure of damages should be the difference between the contract price and the value of the ore then as there was no market. See Ogle v. Earl Vane[2]; Hickman v. Haynes[3].\nH.J. Scott K.C. and R.S. Cassels K.C. for the respondents referred to British Westinghouse Electric Co. v. Underground Electric Railways Co.[4]\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent, in the end of April and beginning of May, 1917, entered into two written contracts with the appellants to sell and deliver to them Canadian Lump Chrome ore.\nThe following is a copy of the first of these contracts:\nPhiladelphia, April 25th, 1917.\nMessrs. Black Lake Asbestos & Chrome Co., Ltd.,\nBlack Lake, P.Q., Canada.\nDear Sirs:\u2014We have to-day bought for our account from you a lot of Canadian Lump Chrome Ore on the following conditions, viz.:\nQuantity 1,500 gross tons of 2,240 lbs. each.\nBrand or make.\nQuality good, well prepared chrome ore.\nPrice: Ore analyzing 32 to 35% chromic oxide, $23.50; for ore analyzing over 35% to 38%, $25.75; for ore analyzing over 38% up to 39%, $27.50, with a scale of $1.00 for each full unit over 39% and up to 42%. All per gross ton. Terms of payment to be made in U.S. gold coin or equivalent. Cash in full to be paid in Black Lake, less 25c. per ton as heretofore.\nPlace of delivery f.o.b. cars, Quebec Central Railroad Company\u2019s tracks, between Robertsonville and D\u2019Isr\u0153li, P.Q.\nTime of shipment: As fast as possible. The entire quantity to be shipped not later than first of November. This purchase is subject to the Canadian Government granting permission to ship to the United States.\nShipping directions: Will be given as fast as the ore is loaded.\nRemarks: Sampling and analyzing to be done by us, at our expense. Where our determinations are not satisfactory to seller, he is to have the privilege of disposing of such carloads which are to be replaced.\nNote: Each delivery to constitute a separate and independent contract unless otherwise stated.\nAll agreements contingent upon strikes, accidents, delays of carriers, or other unforeseen circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the sellers, wars of this or other nations, as well as interruptions of navigation through strikes or other causes, in which case deliveries against this contract may be suspended.\nSellers are not compelled to replace shipments lost at sea.\nAccept. May 29, 1917.\nBlack Lake Asbestos & Chrome Co., Limited.\n(Sgd.) J.E. Murphy, Jr.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) Frank Samuel.\nThe second is identical in its terms save being for 2,000 gross tons instead of as in the first for 1,500 tons and the dates of the making being 2nd May, and acceptance the 29th of May and in the use of the word \u201canalyzing\u201d for \u201ccontaining.\u201d A printed form was used in each case and I surmise one used by appellants.\nThe respondent not only failed to complete delivery by the 1st November, 1917, named in each of the respective contracts for limit of time therefor, but continually held out to appellants hopes of doing so and accepted their forbearance from time to time until June, 1918, when the respondents\u2019 many broken promises had apparently become unbearable to appellants and led them to write respondents the following letter:\u2014 Philadelphia, Pa., June 11th, 1918.\nMessrs. Black Lake Asbestos & Chrome Co.:\nDear Sirs:\u2014Referring to our two contracts with you for chrome ore on April 25th and May 3rd, 1917, we are advised by our representative at Black Lake that your Black Lake office is shipping chrome ore to other parties without giving us the opportunity to sample and analyze this ore and apply against our contracts with you. We consider this a repudiation on your part of our contracts, and therefore, will have to take legal action and hold you for non-delivery of this ore.\nWe telegraphed you to this effect to-day and must have an immediate answer in reference to same. We are sending a copy of this letter to your Black Lake office.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) Frank Samuel.\nThe substance of this letter was also sent by telegraph on the 11th of June, but no reply came to either until the following:\u2014\nNo 20 Victoria Street,\nToronto, Ontario, June 21st, 1918.\nFrank Samuel, Esq.,\nHarrison Building,\nPhiladelphia, Pa., U.S.A.\nDear Sir:\u2014Delay in answering your telegram and communication of the 11th inst. has been due to the writer\u2019s absence from the city.\nThe contracts to which you refer bear on their face a ground for termination, viz., the pinching out of ore, which unfortunately took place on our properties.\nWe regret to say, also that the sampling and analysis which has been done by your representative in the past has been most unsatisfactory.\nIn addition, practically our entire output at the present time is being used for home consumption, and we regret that we cannot make any further shipments to you.\nYours very truly,\nBlack Lake Asbestos & Chrome Company, Limited,\n(Sgd.) Robert F. Massie,\nManaging Director. Hence this action for damages in which respondents set up many defences all of which were decided by the learned trial judge to be unfounded.\nHe assessed (expressly relying upon Ogle v. Vane[5], hereinafter referred to) the damages on the basis of the difference in market price for such goods on the date of respondents\u2019 last letter, quoted above, and the price named in each of said contracts.\nOn appeal therefrom to the first Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for Ontario, that court maintained said judgment in all respects save in the taking of said date as basis for the assessment of damages.\nIt instead thereof directed a reference to the Master in Ordinary to inquire and state the damages.\nInstead of taking any fixed date as the basis for applying the relevant law to the existent facts it directs said master\nto ascertain and state what quantity of Canadian lump chrome ore within the grades contracted for was diverted from delivery to the plaintiffs by the defendants other than for unsatisfactory analysis of the ore, and sold to other persons between May 1st, 1917, and June 22nd, 1918, and whether any and if so what quantity of similar ore was purchased by the plaintiffs between the said dates to replace the ore so diverted and sold to other persons, and is to allow to the plaintiffs, as damages, in respect to the ore, so diverted and replaced, the excess, if any, between the price paid by the plaintiffs in each case and the contract price for the same grade of ore. And as to the residue of the 2,660 tons undelivered by the defendant the said Master shall allow as damages the sum of $30.26 per ton, being the difference per ton between $23.50 the contract price and $53.76, the market price on June 21st, 1918, of ore of the lowest grade contracted for, but the defendant shall be entitled to shew before the said Master in mitigation of the said last mentioned damages: (1) that the plaintiffs bought at a lower price than $53.76 per ton by reason of the situation caused by the defendants default in delivery, and (2) that the plaintiffs bought in in the market at a lower price than $53.76 per ton in excess of the amount required to fill their forward contracts, and in either of the said events the damages on the ore so bought shall be calculated on the basis of the said lower price instead of at the sum of $30.26 per ton. I, with great respect, cannot find in my view of the contract above set forth and the relevant facts anything to warrant the court below in finding as the reasons for its judgment shew, that\nas each car was diverted from the respondent (now appellant) and shipped elsewhere that was a repudiation pro tanto and was known to be so by the respondent (now appellant) through his agent Wooler.\nThe contract was not for the entire output of the mines of respondent regardless of its obligations to others either express or implied. The only words in the contract giving any colour for such an interpretation are, I submit, the words \u201cfast as possible\u201d which, seeing it had till the 1st November\u2014a period of seven months\u2014to get out and load about three thousand tons of the desired ore, must be interpreted reasonably.\nLet us imagine a buyer under such like contract, on discovery that other customers of the vendors were getting shipments from him of the like goods, immediately going into the open market and buying at a lower price than named in his contract and trying then to evade the acceptance of delivery tendered him within the ultimate time named for delivery and setting up such a defence.\nI submit such a proceeding could not be countenanced and that such a defence would not be listened to for a moment. Nor can the counterpart thereof as presented herein be maintainable. Contracts for delivery by instalments at stated times have been presented in some cases to courts and damages assessed on that basis as evidently what was within the contemplation of the parties concerned therein. But that is not the nature of this contract. Nor do the words therein \u201cnote: each delivery to constitute a separate and independent contract unless otherwise stated,\u201d which seem to be relied on by the reasons assigned below, make it so. They are words which form part of a printed form used in making the contract and the only operative effect they can have herein would be in the event of a contest as to the quality of goods that had been so delivered, or something akin thereto, arising out of such delivery or in relation to such goods as had been delivered.\nThere is no dispute herein arising out of past deliveries.\nThe only thing here in question is what arises out of non-delivery to which the said note is entirety inapplicable.\nI submit, therefore, the first part of the above quoted direction to the master is not maintainable.\nThus, I conceive, is also eliminated from our consideration, all that transpired up to the time limit of 1st November for the complete fulfilment of the contract, save in so far as the correspondence between the parties hereto prior to that date may, and I think, must, be looked at to help in the due appreciation of what followed up to the 21st of June, 1918.\nIt is upon the correct appreciation of the said correspondence so had, that maintenance of the remaining parts of the order of reference should depend.\nThe difference between the market price of such goods as in question, on the 1st November, 1917, and the price agreed for under the contract, would be the true measure of damages for the breach then, of the contract, unless otherwise provided, or determined by the conduct of the parties.\nOn the 17th October, 1917, in reply to a complaint as to the tardy nature of deliveries under the contract, on the part of appellants, the respondent wrote Samuel (the writer of said complaint) as follows:\u2014 Dear Sir:\u2014We have your favour of the 11th inst. and in reply beg to advise, that we do not expect to be in a position to make larger shipments of chrome ore on your contract before next summer, so if you wish to cancel your contract on the first of next month we will do so. We regret very much that we are unable to make larger shipments on your contract at present, but it is a cause beyond our control. Kindly let us have your reply to this offer at an early date.\nYours truly,\nBlack Lake Asbestos & Chrome Co., Ltd.,\nPer J.E. Murphy, Jr.\nReply thereto (dated 23rd October) was as follows:\u2014\nDear Sirs:\u2014We are in receipt of your favour of October 17th, and in reply would state that we cannot cancel our contract with you for chrome ore, as our people are willing and anxious to receive this ore at the present time, and we must ask you to get shipments off as rapidly as possible.\nVery truly yours,\n(Sgd.) Frank Samuel.\nIt seems quite clear that respondent by offering cancellation meant literally what it said and did not intend to be held for damages in case of assent on the part of appellants to the proposition presented\nOn the 20th November the correspondence is resumed and it continued until June following of such a character as clearly to demonstrate that the respondent was claiming it was doing the best it could to live up to the contract and was asking and accepting appellants\u2019 forbearance and promising future deliveries and that the appellants were exercising due forbearance and perhaps more than the respondent deserved.\nIndeed it would have been improper under such relations as said correspondence discloses to have brought chrome ore of kind and quality named in the contract for the sole purpose of asserting an action for damages and thereby establishing the measure of such damages as appellant had suffered. The respondent\u2019s factum points to a letter of appellant of 18th March, 1918, pointing out to the former the measure in which it had failed to live up to its promises and to threats it had made of a discontinuance of the forbearance that had hitherto been shewn respondent unless it shewed a better appreciation thereof.\nIt is to be observed that said letter went no further than pointing out the course which the appellant might be driven to adopt and hence they remained liable to fulfil their part of the contract until they had gone further or the respondent had as it did later repudiate in clear and explicit terms.\nThe answer to the respondent\u2019s attempt to use this letter as evidence that the contract had ended is not confined to that alone for the effect of it was to produce a delivery of it and acceptance by appellants of two more car loads of chrome ore in the month of April.\nThus by the concurrence of both parties the contract had not ended and the final breach thereof taken place.\nThe decision in the case of Ogle v. Earl Vane[6], seems to me to exactly fit the facts in the case as I find them by a perusal of the entire correspondence. In that case Blackburn J. wrote the leading judgment. In the Exchequer Chamber, in appeal therefrom, the court was unanimous and it may not be amiss to remark that Willes J. was one of those writing to express the opinion of the court. Shortly thereafter in 1875, in the case of Hickman v. Haynes[7], a strong court in appeal, Lindley J. writing the judgment, accepted that decision as a guide and applied the principle involved. In 1899 the late Chief Justice Lord Russell of Killowen in the Commercial Court applied the identical principle thus involved to the decision of the case of Ashmore & Son v. C.S. Cox & Co.[8], and at the close of his judgment page 443 furnished an apt illustration of what should be borne in mind in dealing with the facts presented herein.\nUnfortunately respondent seemed to have been inclined herein throughout to get away from the actual facts as I view them both in its dealing with the appellants and the case presented to the court, or to read them backwards.\nIn my view of the facts the case is simple and the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored with costs here and in the first Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario,\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellants, I think, are entitled to succeed on the principal ground on which they based their appeal, namely that there was no substituted contract but that the time for delivery was extended from time to time in forbearance and by way of indulgence at the request of the defendants. That is, I think, a substantially just interpretation of what occurred between the parties, and it is also, I think, what the trial judge intended to find although his findings, perhaps, are not very precisely expressed.\nNo question arises here such as that which, but for the arrangement between the parties, might have arisen in Tyres v. Rosedale Iron Co.[9], where the plaintiffs insisted upon putting an end at once to the indulgence and required immediate delivery of all the overdue instalments. No such question arises here, because the immediate cause of the indulgence being terminated was the repudiation by the defendants of their obligations under their contract.\nANGLIN J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument I had a strong impression that the disposition made of this case by the learned trial judge had been entirely satisfactory and should not have been interfered with. Further consideration has confirmed that view. The issues as to the breach of the contract by the defendants, the date when such breach occurred, alleged purchases by the plaintiffs to replace ore which the defendants had failed to supply and the quantum of the plaintiff\u2019s damages were presented for trial and were tried out. The evidence supports the finding of a wilful breach of contract by the defendants deliberately made in order to take advantage of an increased market price. Forbearance by the plaintiffs at the instance of the defendants prevented an actionable breach before the 21st of June, 1918, when such a breach undoubtedly occurred. The assessment of damages as of that date was therefore warranted. The measure of damages adopted by the trial judge\u2014the difference between the sale price and the value at the date of breach\u2014was that prescribed by the law under such circumstances as the evidence disclosed no market in which the goods were procurable at the date of the breach. The quantum allowed has not been successfully challenged. Prior to the 21st of June, 1918, the plaintiffs were under no obligation to look elsewhere for ore in order to mitigate their damages. Indeed they could not safely purchase ore to replace what the defendants were bound to furnish as the contract being still open they might be compelled to take the latter. After the 21st of June, so far as the evidence shews, no ore was available\u2014certainly none at any price less than that which the learned trial judge fixed as the value at that date of the ore in the delivery of which the defendants made default.\nThere is in my opinion nothing to justify further investigation. The appellants had their day in court. They took their chances on the evidence submitted at the trial. If they failed to take every advantage of the opportunity they then had they must suffer the consequences. With respect, the judgment of the trial judge was in my opinion entirely right; it should not have been disturbed and should now be restored.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The only question here is as to the quantum of the damages to which the appellants are entitled for the admitted default of the respondent to make deliveries in accordance with the requirements of the two contracts which it had made with the appellants to sell them the total quantity of 3,500 gross tons of Canadian lump chrome ore. The quantity undelivered was 2,660 tons, and by the terms of the contracts the whole of the ore should have been delivered not later than the first of November, 1917.\nThe finding of fact of the learned trial judge with regard to the question whether the time for delivery had been extended beyond November 1st, 1917, is as follows:\u2014 From the beginning defendants were dilatory in making delivery, so that long before November 1st\u2014the date fixed for the completion of the deliveries\u2014it became apparent that full delivery would not be made within that time. Plaintiffs did not then stand on their strict right to enforce performance at that time, but while continually pressing for more prompt and larger deliveries than they were getting, the facts warrant the inference that the effect of what happened between them was an extension from time to time of the time for making deliveries until hope for further deliveries was ended by a notice of June 21st, 1918, by the defendants declining to make further shipments to plaintiffs. Not only is this so but Mr. Tomlinson makes the statement that plaintiffs had extended the time for delivery down to the time defendants repudiated the contracts, which statement has not been contradicted.\nIt is true that the learned judge arrives at this finding by means of an inference from the facts proved, but there was certainly no refusal of the respondent to make any deliveries after November 1st, and subsequently to that date the appellants pressed for the carrying out of the contracts, and the respondent made certain deliveries thereunder, so that until the final refusal to make further deliveries in June, 1918, both parties were acting under the original contracts of sale. The inference of the learned trial judge is therefore fully justified by the evidence.\nI cannot accept the contention of the respondent that after the 1st of November, 1917, a substituted contract was entered into to sell ore to the appellants as fast as it could be mined, which contract not being in writing could not be enforced, but, according to my reading of the correspondence, until the final repudiation in June, 1918, the original contracts were considered in force and acted upon by both of these parties.\nIf therefore there was not a substituted contract, but a mere forbearance as to deliveries under the original contracts, the time of repudiation or of refusal to make further deliveries is the time at which the damages for breach of contract should be assessed. Unfortunately for the respondent the price of chrome ore had very notably increased from November 1st, 1917, to June 21st, 1918, when the letter of repudiation was written, so that its position is worse than if it had declined to make further deliveries after November 1st. But it is impossible to accept the latter date as the one at which the damages should be assessed, for both parties acted under the contract for several months afterwards, and really the respondent, by its letter of repudiation, has determined the time for ascertaining the damages to which its repudiation entitles the appellants.\nThe only point remaining is whether the variation made by the Appellate Division in the judgment of the learned trial judge should be sustained. This involves the question whether an opportunity should be given to the respondent to shew, if it can, whether or not the appellants, under their obligation to minimize the damages, bought chrome ore to replace that undelivered by the respondent, the damages then being the difference between the contract price and the price at which such ore was purchased. After due consideration, I have come to the conclusion that up to the time of repudiation the appellants were not entitled to purchase chrome ore to replace that yet undelivered by the respondent, and that if they had made such a purchase they could nevertheless have been forced by the respondent to take the full quantity mentioned in the contracts. The reference ordered by the Appellate Division would therefore be without any possible use, for, if the appellants could not buy as against their contract, it is immaterial to inquire at what price they did in fact purchase ore. The appellants were dealers in ore and as there was a great demand for the commodity they naturally bought all they could. It is true that the contract states that each delivery should constitute a separate and independent contract, but that certainly does not mean that as to the quantity undelivered there should be as many contracts of sale as there were tons or carloads to be delivered. And even were there such a multitude of contracts to be fulfilled not later than November 1st, unquestionably the time for delivery could be extended by forbearance beyond that date, and then the damages for the final breach of contract would have to be determined as of the time of the breach.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the judgment of the learned trial judge should not have been disturbed, and the appeal should be allowed and this judgment restored. The cross-appeal of the respondent should be dismissed with costs.\nI may add that inasmuch as the contracts in question were made in the Province of Quebec where also the breach occurred, the liability of the respondent should have been determined according to the Quebec law. The parties however assumed otherwise and they appealed to the law of the forum which was applied by the courts below. I am not to be taken as dealing with the matter under any other basis.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cassels, Brock & Kelley.\n[1] 48 Ont.

Moore (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: October 19; 1921: November 21.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ. and Cassels J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nCompany\u2014Sale of land\u2014Implied powers\u2014Exercise of option\u2014Specific performance.\nThe charter of a pulp and paper company empowered it to purchase and hold lands, mill privileges, growing timber and other property.\nHeld, that from this power to purchase the power to sell is implied having regard to the nature of the business to be carried on.\nHeld also, Duff J. dissenting and Cassels J. expressing no opinion, that the company could sell all the property so acquired as long as it did not dispose of its whole undertaking.\nM. obtained from the company a lease of all its real and personal property with an option to purchase the same at any time during the term. He assigned the lease to B. who agreed in writing that, if he exercised said option he would convey to M. a quarter interest in the property he acquired. B. did not formally exercise the option but with intent to defraud M. he acquired enough stock in the company to give him control. In an action by M. for specific performance of the agreement to give him a quarter interest.\nHeld, Duff and Cassels JJ. dissenting, that B. having complete control by his acquisition of the stock in fact exercised the option to purchase and may be compelled to procure the conveyance necessary to vest in M. the quarter interest to which he is entitled.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The option to purchase was ultra vires of the company; it dealt with all the land, etc., which the company was authorized to acquire and the powers given the company by its charter made it an undertaking in which the public must be presumed to have an interest; in such case the sale of all the land, the whole substratum of the undertaking, which the charter does not authorize would be an interference with the carrying out of the undertaking as authorized by the legislature and must be decmed to be prohibited. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nPaton K.C. for the appellant. The appellant never exercised the option and cannot be compelled to convey a fourth interest in what he has not acquired.\nThe company cannot convey all its property. See Lindley on Companies (6 ed.) page 245; Simpson v. Westminster Palace Hotel Co.[1].\nPaton K.C. for the appellant\nL. A. Lovett K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree for the reasons assigned in the courts below that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI do not think, however, that the resort to a voluntary winding up of the company is at all necessary or the only means of enforcing the contract.\nThe appellant is just as much bound to procure the conveyance to the respondent of what he is entitled to as if he had procured, pursuant to his agreement with the company's covenant with the respondent, the conveyance of the property to his own attorney or any one else he chose to select.\nThe court below can, no doubt, if necessary, find other means of enforcing the execution by the appellant of his obligation to the respondent.\nDuff J. (dissenting)\u2014The Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company, Limited, was incorporated by a Nova Scotia Statute, 44 Vict., ch. 27, \"for the purpose of manufacturing wood pulp and paper\" in Nova Scotia and of purchasing and holding lands, leases, privileges, growing timber and other property at and near Mill village and elsewhere in the County of Queens, and for transacting all business in connection therewith.\nThe Company was (sec. 7) invested with power to expropriate\nlands and wood contiguous to or connected with lands and works of the company.\nThe municipality of Queen's County (sec. 10) was empowered to exempt the company from taxation.\nBy a lease dated the 2nd October, 1916, the company leased to the respondent all its\nmills, buildings, machinery and all its lands, tenements, privileges easements and appurtenances situate in the County of Queens;\nand by the same instrument it was provided that the appellant should have\nthe sole and exclusive option at any time during the existence of this lease, of purchasing the fee simple of the lands, tenements, easements and appurtenances hereby demised together with all buildings, plant and machinery thereon\non certain specified terms. On the same date the respondent assigned this lease to the appellant and again on the same date the appellant and the respondent executed an agreement by which the appellant agreed to engage the respondent as his manager upon certain terms as to remuneration and by which it was further provided:\u2014\n4.\u2014If at any time Frank K. Brown purchases the said premises described in the said lease out of the aggregate net earnings as set forth above in this agreement then and immediately thereafter the said Phil. H. Moore is to become the owner of 25 per cent thereof and the said Frank K. Brown is to assign and transfer to the said Phil. H. Moore 25 per cent or one quarter interest therein by good and sufficient deeds thereof always conveying only such title as he may have acquired from the said Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company, Limited. 5.\u2014In the event of the said Frank K. Brown being desirous to purchase the said property before the said aggregate net earnings as hereinbefore referred to, are sufficient to complete the amount of the said purchase price, the said Phil. H. Moore shall have the option of drawing from the said capital account of the said company his proportion of the profits to that date or of purchasing with his said proportion of profits and any other money which he may desire to invest in the said property an interest in the same not to exceed 25 per cent of the said property at the same valuation as the said Frank K. Brown will pay to the Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company, Limited, for the purchase of the said property, namely, $30,000.00.\nThe respondent during the currency of the lease purchased from the shareholders of the company the whole of the shares of the company and the appellant thereupon demanded a transfer of a one-fourth interest in the property comprised in the lease and tendered one quarter of the purchase price paid. This the respondent refused offering at the same time to transfer one quarter of the shares purchased. The respondent thereupon brought this action and the courts of Nova Scotia upheld his claim that he is entitled to a conveyance from the appellant of an undivided one-fourth interest in the property comprised in the lease.\nThe purchase by the respondent was not technically a purchase in pursuance of the option. It was nevertheless, I think, a transaction within the scope and intendment of articles 4 and 5 of the agreement between the appellant and the respondent.\nArticle 4 provides that the respondent is to participate in the fruits of the exercise of the option upon the same footing as the appellant. If the conditions are fulfilled under which that article is to come into play, then whatever title or interest the appellant acquires by the exercise of the option is immediately to be effected by a trust in favour of the respondent. The article treats the appellant as a trustee, it treats the rights under the option as trust property held for the benefit of the appellant and the respondent, and it is from this point of view also that we must construe article 5. Article 5 was intended to apply to every interest acquired by the appellant which (if the conditions of article 4 had happened), would have been of such a character that the trust thereby declared would have captured it.\nThe respondent's rights under these articles could not be affected by the form of the transaction between the appellant and the company. If what was done was done for the purpose of effectually securing, so far as possible, the benefits of the option, then the interest, whatever form it might take, of which the appellant was the recipient was to be subject to the respondent's rights as declared by these articles.\nThe respondent was to be entitled under the terms of article 5 to have transferred to him a one-fourth interest in what the appellant acquired and it is important to note that it was his right to demand an interest which, while differing in quantity from that of the appellant, should in point of quality be identical with the appellant's. He was entitled to be put in point of quality upon the same footing as the appellant.\nNow it is quite obvious that what the appellant offered the respondent, namely, one quarter of the shares acquired by him, was not an interest which the appellant was bound to accept as in satisfaction of his rights. The acceptance of the appellant's offer would place him in the position of a minority shareholder, a position in which he might well find that share for share what he had accepted was not equal in value to that one-fourth the appellant had retained. He was clearly entitled to have a transfer of an undivided one-fourth interest in every share acquired by the appellant or at all events a declaration of trust by the appellant in respect of such a one-fourth interest.\nOn the other hand the claim made by the respondent which has been admitted in the court below is, I think, an inadmissible one. There can be no doubt that the method adopted by the appellant for securing the fruits of the option was adopted in good faith. There were at least two most cogent reasons for pursuing the course that was taken. 1st, it was gravely questionable (so much is admitted and I shall point out in a moment that the option was ultra vires and unenforceable) whether a conveyance literally in execution of the terms of the option would not be wholly inoperative at law, and 2nd, assuming such a conveyance could have any operation, it would have the effect of divesting the title to the company's properties from the company and depriving the purchasers consequently of the benefits of the compulsory powers given by the Act of incorporation as well as of the privilege in respect of taxation. That the parties were alive to these considerations is proved by the evidence of the respondent himself who says he pointed out the \"value\" of the \"charter\" and the importance of securing it. His precise words are:\u2014\nI pointed out the value of the charter and that we should get that with other assets when he exercised his option.\nIn these circumstances the respondent is in this dilemma. The shares acquired by the appellant are within the contemplation of articles 4 and 5 or they are not. If they are not he has no claim upon them or upon the appellant under article 5. If they are, and I have stated the reasons for concluding that they are, then these shares are the subject in respect of which the respondent's rights under articles 4 and 5 are exercisable. Indeed, the conduct of the respondent as disclosed by the evidence just quoted, especially in a proceeding in which he invokes the equitable powers of the court, would preclude him from denying it.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the questions raised by the appeal but it is not right, I think, that I should take leave of the appeal without expressing the opinion I have definitely formed after a most careful consideration of the subject that the option was ultra vires (I express no opinion about the validity of the lease itself) and that by the express terms of the articles the respondent is precluded from demanding from the appellant a title which the appellant did not and could not acquire from the company. As to the last mentioned point the words of article 4 are express, and, as I have already said, it is quite clear that the subject dealt with in article 5, that is to say, the subject of the rights vested in the respondent under article 5 is the same as that in respect of which rights are given him by article 4.\nThe general rule as to the powers of the modern statutory companies is stated by Lord Blackburn in Attorney General v. Great Eastern Ry. Co.[2], in these words;\nwhere there is an Act of Parliament creating a corporation for a particular purpose, and giving it powers for that particular purpose, what it does not expressly or impliedly authorize is to be taken to be prohibited;\nand where extraordinary powers are conferred such as compulsory powers to take land or such as a right to treat with a municipality for exemption from taxes, a stricter rule is applied. Such powers are presumed to be conferred in the public interest, and it is conclusively presumed that the undertaking is one in which the public has an interest and any dealing with the property of the company which interferes with the carrying out of the undertaking as authorized by the legislature is deemed (in the absence of some provisions to the contrary effect) to be prohibited and rendered inoperative if attempted.\nIn Esquimalt Water Works Co. v. Victoria[3], I stated the principle thus:\u2014\nThe power to dispose of its property is, in the case of a quasi public corporation, created by special Act of Parliament, such as the plaintiff company (see Proprietors of Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Navigation v. Proprietors of Birmingham Canal Navigation[4] and Reg. v. South Wales Rly. Co.,[5] a limited power. It is limited by this rule, namely, that apart from authority expressly given or appearing by necessary implication from its incorporating Act such a corporation may not dispose of its property if by such disposition it should disable itself from carrying out the objects (in which the public have an interest) for which its special powers were conferred upon it.\nTo the cases cited in this passage may be added Mulliner v. Midland Ry. Co.[6].\nThe option now before us was in form a contract by which the company professed to agree upon certain conditions to dispose of property constituting the whole substratum of its undertaking. I do not think it is affirmatively established in the evidence that the company was not in possession of other property; it may have had, for example, a bank account; but the power to acquire property given by the statute, that is to say the power to acquire lands, etc., was limited in its territorial operation to the county of Queens and the lease professes to deal with the whole of the company's landed property in that county. Such a virtual alienation of all its property would be beyond the power of a trading company possessing powers of selling its property in the course of its business in the absence of authority given by its charter or by statute; Simpson v. Westminster Palace Hotel Co.[7]; a disability which can, in some cases where the undertaking is not affected by a public interest, be overcome by the consent of all the shareholders. Where the transaction, however, concerns an undertaking of the class to which that now in question belongs, namely, an undertaking in which the public is conclusively presumed to have an interest by reason of the extraordinary powers given to the corporation authorized to carry it out, the consent of the shareholders is of no effect.\nIt does not appear that the property of the company was in fact procured by means of the exercise of its compulsory powers; but this is immaterial. A company endowed with such powers enters upon a negotiation for purchase armed with a powerful weapon which gives it a real advantage. But generally speaking such weapons are not put into its hands to enable it to make a profit by trading with the property so acquired and selling it at an advanced price to a purchaser less advantageously situated.\nThere are one or two subsidiary points to which perhaps one ought to refer. It was suggested by Mr. Lovitt in the course of his ingenious argument that there were cases in which the proprietor of a \"one man company\" had been directed to bring about the winding up of the company in order to carry out an agreement to convey property. Such cases may be quite intelligible where a public interest is not involved but obviously they have no sort of application to an undertaking of the class with which we are now dealing. Further I cannot help observing that it seems a strange misapplication of equitable powers to exert them in lending assistance to the design of the respondent to dismember this undertaking, to deprive it of very important elements of value (on that his own evidence is conclusive) by separating the ownership of the property from the valuable privileges vested in the company itself by statute. Under articles 4 and 5 the respondent, as I have said, is entitled to be put as regards the quality of his interest in the same case with the appellant; he is entitled to have his share of every kind of economic benefit which the ownership of shares gives; but, by the articles themselves as well as by his own conduct, and as well indeed by the plain dictates of justice, he seems to be precluded from demanding that which he had demanded in this litigation.\nAnglin J.\u2014It has been found by the learned trial judge and the court en banc that in acquiring the stock of the Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp, and Paper Company and thus obtaining control of its property and assets the defendant in fact exercised an option which he held to purchase that company's mills, buildings, machinery and lands for $30,000. It has further been held by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that in putting the transaction for the acquisition of the property from the company into this form, the defendant acted in bad faith, i.e., as I understand it, with the intent of defrauding the plaintiff of the interests he had contracted to give him in the property to be acquired from the company in the event of the option to purchase it being exercised. It is not possible to set aside these findings. There is evidence to warrant them. The principal question in issue is whether the plaintiff by the device to which he resorted has created a situation that renders the court impotent to give to the plaintiff the relief of specific performance which he claims.\nTwo obstacles were urged by counsel for the appellant; (a) that while the Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company has statutory power to acquire lands, it has not the power to sell them; (b) that the property in question is vested, not in the defendant, but in the company.\nAs to the first objection, I think the power to sell its lands and other property (short of disposing of its whole undertaking\u2014and it is not established that the option covered the entire undertaking of the company) is implied in the nature of the business which the company was incorporated to carry on. In re Kingsbury Collieries, and Moore's Contract[8].\nAs to the second objection, I do not see sufficient reason for presently reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that its jurisdiction in personam should be exercised to thwart the dishonest purpose of the defendant and compel him to fulfil his obligation to the plaintiff on the ground that the decree pronounced may prove to be brutum fulmen. Having secured complete control of the company the defendant can, and may probably be forced to, procure the execution by it of any conveyances necessary to vest in the plaintiff the one-quarter interest to which he has been found entitled. Should any insuperable difficulty to carrying out the decree supervene, it will be within the power of the court, under the reservation of further consideration, to order an assessment of damages in lieu of specific performance or to award the plaintiff such other alternate relief as the circumstances may call for. Vide N. S. Rules Nos. 517 and 538.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nMignault J.\u2014The only question in this case which requires consideration is the objection of the appellant that he is asked to do something which cannot legally be done, to wit, to assign or cause to be assigned to the respondent one quarter interest in the properties mentioned in the lease and option. His objection that he has acquired only the shares of the Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company and that that company alone can dispose of these properties, does not impress me, for the appellant, as owner of all the shares, can certainly cause such an assignment to be made by the company. But would the assignment, if made by the company, be of legal effect?\nThe objection of the appellant is that while this company can acquire lands it has not the power to sell them. I have examined the company's charter, 44 Vict. (Nova Scotia), ch. 71. It gives the company the power to manufacture wood, pulp and paper in the province, to purchase and hold lands, mill privileges, growing timber and other property at and near Mill Village and elsewhere in the county of Queens, and to transact all business in connection therewith. In my opinion, such a company has the power to sell any land which it has acquired, this power being implied in the authority given it to purchase and hold lands, mill privileges, growing timber and other property and to transact all business in connection therewith. In re Kingsbury's Collieries[9]. Any other decision would force the company to hold in perpetuity or until its dissolution the property acquired by it.\nBut here the evidence shews that the properties mentioned in the lease and option to purchase were all the properties belonging to the company. All the shares in the Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company several years before had been acquired by one Davison, and after his death belonged to his son and two daughters. For some time the company's operations had not been carried on and the mill property was in a somewhat dilapitated condition, and no doubt the lease in question was made for the purpose of securing some one who would carry on the business, improve the property and who might eventually purchase the mill property.\nIf this lease had conferred an option to purchase the whole undertaking of the company with its charter as well as its properties, it might well be beyond its powers. But the option is an offer to sell for $30,000.00 the fee simple of the lands, tenements, easements and appurtenances demised by the lease, together with all buildings, plant and machinery thereon. The lease covered all the mills, buildings, machinery and all the lands, tenements, privileges, easements and appurtenances of the company situate in the county of Queens and more particularly described in some twenty-four deeds. I think such an offer of sale comes well within the decision in Wilson v. Miers[10], where a navigation company had agreed to sell its entire fleet of twelve ships, and it was held that such a sale was within the powers of the directors. Under the clauses of settlement of the company the directors were authorized to sell, let to hire and charter the company's vessels. In the present case the power to sell the properties of the company, I have said, must be implied, while in the case of Wilson v. Miers[11], it was expressed, but the point here is that there is a distinction between selling the business of a company as a whole and selling all its existing goods and chattels. (See Lindley, Law of Companies, 6th ed., 1902, vol. 1, p: 256.) I therefore think that a sale can legally be made to the respondent of one quarter interest in the fee simple of the properties covered by the lease and option to purchase.\nOn the other points I accept the findings of the two courts that the appellant acquired all the stock of the company under the terms of the original agreement, and that, as between him and the respondent, he must be held to have purchased the property within the meaning of the agreement between them. In the opinion of Ritchie E. J., in the appellate court, the appellant acted in bad faith and is subject to the control of a court of equity. The trial court, after declaring that the respondent is entitled to have the appellant assign and transfer or cause to be assigned and transferred to the respondent one quarter interest in the premises by good and sufficient deeds thereof, retained further consideration of the action, so that it will no doubt be able to make any additional order which may be necessary to give effect to its decree, the action being one in personam.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCassels J. (dissenting). With all respect I am unable to arrive at the conclusions come to by the learned trial judge (Mr. Justice Mellish) and the learned judges in the Court of Appeal. The Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company, Limited, were incorporated by special charter, ch. 71, 44 Vict. (1881). They were incorporated for the purpose of manufacturing wood pulp and paper in the province of Nova Scotia, and purchasing and holding lands, mill privileges, growing timber and other property at and near Mill Village and elsewhere in the county of Queens, and for transacting all business in connection therewith.\nOn the 2nd day of October, 1916, the Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company, Limited, leased to the present respondent, Phil. H. Moore, the properties set out and described in the statement of claim. By the terms of the lease, the lessee was to hold the said lands, premises, easements and appurtenances for the term of three years from the 1st of October, 1916, paying the rent provided for in the said lease. The lease further provided as follows:\nThe lessee shall have the sole and exclusive option at any time during the existence of this lease of purchasing the fee simple of the lands, tenements, easements and appurtenances hereby demised together with all buildings, plant and machinery thereon at and for the sum of $30,000.00 with the proviso that all monies paid on account of said yearly rentals of $2,000 shall be credited on the said purchase price.\nIt is also provided as follows:\nAnd it is hereby declared and agreed that this indenture and everything herein contained shall enure to the benefit of and be binding on the parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns respectively.\nOn the 2nd day of October, 1916, the same date as the lease, an agreement in writing was made between the plaintiff, Moore, and the defendant, Brown, which is set out in the statement of claim.\nBy this agreement Moore assigned and delivered the said lease and option to said Frank K. Brown. The fourth clause of this agreement provides as follows:\u2014 4. If at any time the said Frank K. Brown purchases the said premises described in the said lease out of the aggregate net earnings as set forth above in this agreement then and immediately thereafter the said Phil. H. Moore is to become the owner of 25 per cent thereof and the said Frank K. Brown is to assign and transfer to the said Phil. H. Moore 25 per cent or one quarter interest therein by good and sufficient deeds thereof always conveying only such title as he may have acquired from the said Nova Scotia Wood, Pulp and Paper Company, Limited.\nThere is no covenant or agreement binding Brown to exercise the option of purchase.\nI quote a few sentences from the evidence of Moore:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Now about this option, did you have any conversation with Brown about exercising the option at any time? A.\u2014Yes, we discussed it a number of times.\nQ.\u2014As to the method of transfer of the properties, did you have any discussion with Brown about that prior to the end of the option? A.\u2014Yes, I pointed out the value of the charter and that we should get that with other assets when he exercised his option.\nQ.\u2014Did you discuss the way the property should be taken over under the option? A.\u2014I don't think we went into details about that; it was to be transferred by some method satisfactory to the two parties.\nQ.\u2014Was any different method of transfer discussed with Brown? A.\u2014No, not with me.\nAt the hearing of this appeal a very elaborate argument was presented by Mr. Paton as to the power of the company to sell these assets. In the view I take of the case it is unnecessary to consider these nice questions of law.\nIn point of fact Brown never did exercise the option. What happened was that, very likely acting on the suggestion of Moore, he acquired practically the whole of the stock of the company, and it would appear from the argument and the statement that Brown is quite willing to assign to Moore one quarter in value of the stock subject to payment by Moore of the amount due to him. The ownership of the stock would carry with it the ownership of the assets. It is said on behalf of Moore that the ownership of one quarter of the stock is not the same thing as the ownership of one quarter of the assets. This may be so but Brown, not having exercised the option, is not in a position to convey 25 per cent of the assets. The right of Moore to the 25 per cent of the assets is necessarily based upon the option being exercised by Brown.\nI am of the opinion that the offer made by Brown to transfer 25 per cent of the stock is a reasonable one and will practically give Moore one fourth interest. It will also prevent the breaking up of the company and will enable the company to carry on the business for which they were incorporated.\nI would allow the appeal with costs of the trial and of the appeal to the court of appeal in Nova Scotia, and also of the appeal to this court.\nI think the judgment should contain an undertaking on the part of the appellant Brown to transfer to Moore 25 per cent of the stock upon Moore paying what is properly due by him, if not already paid. In other respects the judgment should stand.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: V. J. Paton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. A. Lovett.\n[1] [1860] 8 H. L.

By a codicil, he further declared that \"in order that there may not be any possible misapprehension in respect\" to the above bequests, \"in the event of its being found that I have not effectually by the said will ordered that the moneys due under (one policy) and under (the other policy) should be and become part of my estate, * * * the said bequests * * * be and are hereby revoked.\" The order of the testator as to the moneys payable under one policy was effectual, but as to the other was ineffectual.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that, there being nothing in the context to warrant reading \"and\" as \"or\", the courts must adhere strictly to the intention expressed; and as the condition precedent upon which revocation of the legacies was to take place did not come into existence, the legacies have not been revoked. Per Mignault J. dissenting.\u2014As the testator did not succeed in making the moneys due under one of the policies a part of his estate the legacies have been revoked.\nBy another clause of his will, the testator bequeathed \"all the residue of my personal estate and effects\" to certain persons therein designated \"to be paid to them without interest when they reach the full age of twenty-one years.\" The question submitted to the court was whether the residuary legatees were entitled to the interest or income accruing from investments of the residuary personalty notwithstanding the words \"without interest.\"\nHeld, that the legatees were entitled to such interest, as it remained part of his estate and passed under the residuary bequest of personalty.\nAfter having bequeathed all the residue of his personal estate and effects as above stated, the testator bequeathed \"all my real estate of every kind and all my personal estate and effects unto my executors * * * according to the nature thereof upon trust, that my trustees shall and will call in and convert (the same) into money * * * : to pay my funeral and testamentary expenses and debts (and) the legacies bequeathed by this my will.\"\nHeld, that the testator's intention, by the direction for conversion, was not to make the proceeds of his real estate personalty so that it should, as such, fall within his residuary bequest; and the surplus of the proceeds, after the payment of the debts and legacies must pass as on an intestacy.\nThe executors of the will commenced this action by way of originating summons in order to submit the above questions arising upon the construction of the will for the opinion of the court. They were represented by counsel in the trial court and, being served with notice of appeal, before the Court of Appeal but the latter court refused them any costs.\nHeld, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that this court should not interfere with the discretion exercised by the Court of Appeal on a question of costs.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, reversing the judgment of the trial court, Bigelow J. and maintaining the cross-appeal of the official guardian, now respondent.\nOne William Walsh died on the 23rd day of May, 1914, having previously executed his will, dated the 26th day of April, 1912, and a codicil, dated the 6th day of May, 1912. Letters probate in respect of the will and codicil were granted to the respondents, William Grayson and P. A. Reilly, the executors therein named. They then took out an originating summons for the determination of certain questions arising upon the construction of the following clauses of the will.\nThe first question was whether the appellants or any of them are entitled to any portion, and if so, what portion of the sum of $800.00 directed to be paid to each of them under the following clauses in the said Will and Codicil thereto, namely:\nClause A. (will): \"I bequeath to my nephews William Milburn, Robert Milburn, Walter Milburn, and to my nieces, Mary Milburn, Ida Milburn, the sum of Eight Hundred ($800.00) Dollars each, to be paid to them without interest four years after my death.\"\nClause B. (will): \"I hereby direct that the proceeds of my policy of insurance in the Independent Order of Foresters to the best of my recollection, number 57437, for Two Thousand ($2,000.00) Dollars, dated January 18th, 1893, and that the proceeds of my policy of insurance in the Ancient Order of United Workmen for Two Thousand ($2,000.00) Dollars, dated July 21st, 1892, notwithstanding any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries herein shall be and become part of my estate directed to be distributed in this my will.\"\nClause C. (codicil): \"In order that there may not be any possible misapprehension in respect to my bequests in my said will to my nephews and nieces, the children of my sister, Margaret A. Milburn, I hereby declare that in the event of it being found that I have not effectually by the said will ordered that the moneys due under the policy of insurance in the Independent Order of Foresters No. 57437 and under the policy of insurance in the Ancient Order of United Workmen, dated August 1st, A.D. 1892, should be and become part of my estate directed to be distributed under the terms of my said will, the said bequests to the said nephews and nieces, the children of my said sister, be and are hereby revoked.\"\nAfter the testator's death his executors claimed and received from the Independent Order of Foresters the amount due under his insurance policy in the Order. The Ancient Order of United Workmen refused to pay the executors the amount of the policy in that Order, on the ground that there was no effectual designation of beneficiaries by the will, and that, the beneficiary designated in the policy having died before the testator, the amount of the policy was payable to the next-of-kin. The executors thereupon sued the Order for the amount of the policy; and Brown J., before whom the action was tried, decided that the amount of this policy formed no part of the testator's estate. There was no appeal from this decision, and the Order paid the amount of the policy to the next-of-kin.\nThe trial judge in the present action held that the appellants were entitled to the sum of $400 each; but the Court of Appeal held that the appellants were not entitled to any part of the legacies to them.\nThe second question was whether the entire residue of both real and personal estate including accrued interest or other income, if any, is payable to the children of the testator's nephew, represented in this case by the Trust Company and the official guardian, now respondents, and if not so payable, who is entitled thereto and in what proportions, the whole under the following clauses of the will: Clause D. (will): \"I bequeath all the residue of my personal estate and effects share and share alike to the following children of my nephew Frederick J. Walsh, Jean Mary Walsh, Kathleen Lillian Walsh, Marie Margaret Walsh, Thomas Robert Walsh, Frederick Michael Walsh, to be paid to them without interest when they reach the full age of twenty-one years.\"\nClause E. (will): \"I devise and bequeath all my real estate of every kind and all my personal estate and effects, unto my executors and the survivor of them, and his successor, their and his heirs, executors and administrators respectively, according to the nature thereof upon trust, that my trustees shall and will call in and convert into money, and such thereof as shall not consist of money within four years from the date of my death, and shall call in and add to the monies produced on such sale, call in and convert and call in and add to my said moneys:\n\"1. Pay my funeral and testamentary expenses and debts.\n\"2. The legacies bequeathed by this my will.\"\nThe trial judge held that the above named children were entitled to the entire residue with the interest and income and that the proceeds of the real estate must all be considered as personalty and passed under the residuary bequest of personal estate; and the Court of Appeal maintained this holding.\nThe Court of Appeal gave costs to all parties, except the executors, out of the estate and gave no costs to the executors. The latter cross-appeal to this court against the award of costs to the appellants out of the estate and against the refusal of costs to them. Christopher C. Robinson for the appellants.\nM. G. Powell for the respondents Grayson et al.\nJ. A. Ritchie for the respondents, the executors and Administrators Trust Co. and the official guardian.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of the submission made to a court below for a construction of the last will and testament of William Walsh, dated 26th April, 1912, and a codicil thereto dated 6th May, 1912.\nThe second question thus submitted was stated as follows:\u2014\n(b) Whether William Milburn, Robert Milburn, Walter Milburn, Mary Milburn and Ida Lewis, formerly Ida Milburn, or any of them are entitled to any portion, and if so, what portion of the sum of $800.00 directed to be paid to each of them under the following clauses in the said will and codicil thereto, namely,\u2014(see clauses A, B, C, page 51), in view of the fact that no moneys under the policy of insurance in the Ancient Order of United Workmen were paid or became payable to the estate of the said deceased.\nMr. Justice Bigelow before whom the application was first heard construed the said will and codicil as giving to the Milburn legatees each a share of the moneys due under the policy of the Independent Order of Foresters, which undoubtedly became part of the estate of the testator.\nHe seems to have observed the fact that the total amount of the two policies on their nominal face value of $2,000 each, would, when added together, amount to the sum of $4,000, which would produce to each of the Milburn legatees, the sum of $800, and that the intention of the testator, when illuminated by what appears in the codicil, was probably, when read in light thereof, to have the said legacies paid out of that fund. The testator had not, whatever may have been in his mind, clearly expressed by his will any such intention. It may be highly probable that in light of what is now presented to us that it was from the fund these policies would produce that he desired to pay the said legacies.\nThe bequests are made in the most absolute form and hence payable out of his estate unless he has in some way pro tanto revoked his will.\nUpon appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan that court reversed the said judgment.\nCuriously enough that judgment of reversal proceeded upon the assumption that the language of the codicil is plain and unambiguous and therefore held the said legacies to each of the Milburns had been revoked thereby.\nThey now appeal from that judgment to this court and their counsel points out (what is fairly arguable in my opinion) that so far from the said language of the codicil being \"clear and unambiguous\" it is capable of other meanings than that given it by the court of appeal below.\nIf the disjunctive \"or\" had been used instead of the conjunction \"and,\" of course there would have been a clear revocation on account of one of the policies having, by its terms, been given to others designated in same, and hence did not fall into the testator's estate.\nBut the implied, if not the express, condition precedent upon which the alleged or intended anticipative revocation of the codicil was to take place, never came into existence, and the legacies stand unrevoked. In any event, unless and until a clear intention to revoke appears we should not hold the bequests revoked. The bequests to appellants and the direction that the proceeds of the policies should become part of testator's estate, were in the will separated by five paragraphs, each distinctly dealing with other matters.\nYet they were, I submit, improperly presented, in the question submitted relative to them, as if the bequests and directions had been so placed or connected in the will, suggesting a possibly close relation of these subject matters, and tending thereby to confuse.\nNo one could suspect any such relationship of subject matters from a mere reading of the will.\nAnd the codicil is in the same question placed next after two independent clauses.\nWhether all this has in fact confused I know not. But such a condition of things leads me to repeat that there never was in fact room for so blending, as it were, subject matters absolutely independent of each other, and each to be given only its own express force and effect by strict observance of the language used in each expression of thought so presented.\nIt is fairly arguable that the testator having disclosed by the codicil what he had in mind relative to the source from which these legacies were to be paid, we may, without resorting to mere speculative opinion of possible intention having any sphere in which to operate, clearly find that unless and until there was a failure to bring both policies into his estate, no revocation was intended.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout to appellants out of testator's estate.\nI agree that if such view as that of Mr. Justice Bigelow had been suggested to the testator framing this codicil, he possibly would have assented thereto but more probably would have considered who had in fact been designated, and seen that they, or some of them, did not get the duplicate shares they were seeking, and getting, if the judgment appealed from stands.\nTwo other questions are raised by the same appellants in regard to which it occurs to me as quite possible that the nature of the estate and the relative parts thereof to bear its burden, may be such as to leave the appellants without any direct, or even indirect, interest in having same determined.\nIf they get paid the legacies bequeathed to them and cannot claim as heirs at law, they need not concern themselves with the determination of these questions. No objection of that kind having been taken by counsel for respondents, I presume it is deemed necessary to have same determined even if my view, or the alternative one of Mr. Justice Bigelow, is adopted in regard to the above question, No. 2, of the submission, with which I have dealt.\nThe first of these questions is thus stated in said appellant's factum:\u2014\nIn holding that the legatees of the residuary personalty are entitled to the interest or income accruing thereon between the date of the testator's death and their attaining the age of twenty-one years;\nAnd in another form the question is, in same factum, presented thus:\u2014\nThe next question is whether the residuary legatees are entitled to the interest or income accruing from investments of the residuary personalty between the date of the testator's death and their attaining the age of twenty-one years, notwithstanding the express direction of the will that the residuary personalty is to be then divided among them \"without interest.\"\nThe disposition thereof turns upon the interpretation and construction of the residuary bequest, which reads as follows:\u2014(See Clause D, page 53). The question raised thereon is whether or not the words \"without interest\" therein can be given any effect and if so what.\nI have tried to give these words some effect but failed to find anything rational to which direct effect can be given unless we extend the primary meaning of the bequest which is expressly confined to \"the residue of\" the \"personal estate and effects\" which certainly does not comprehend real estate. Surely that residue must comprehend all interest earned from investments of purely personal estate.\nIt might be surmised that if we attribute all intention on the part of the testator to exclude interest from the investments of proceeds of sales of real estate after the conversion of the latter, we might catch a glimpse of something possibly existent in his mind which the words would express. The decisions cited in the factums of counsel do not carry us very far.\nThe unfortunate expression may help by virtue of said decisions to maintain the position taken by appellants in their third contention, which is that the residuary request expressly limited to personal estate cannot be extended to include the proceeds of the conversion of the real estate and hence if anything thereof remains after applying same as specifically directed there would be an intestacy pro tanto.\nThere is much to be said for that contention.\nThe will provides, next after the above quoted residuary bequest as follows:\u2014(See Clause E, page 53).\nIt was stoutly contended by counsel for the official guardian that the case of Singleton v. Tomlinson[1], is decisive of the question raised, and it certainly would be if the provisions in the will there in question were either identical or quite analogous. The will in that case started out with a direction to convert the estate, real and personal, and then proceeded to dispose of \"the proceeds\" of such conversion in manifold ways with one exception specifically dealt with and subject thereto ended by constituting a party named the testator's legatee.\nHow could he be supposed to be residuary legatee of anything save the balance of the fund thus produced?\nHere the provision for conversion comes last and after the residuary bequest above quoted which restricts its operation to the personal estate.\nWith great respect, I fail to see much resemblance between the Singleton Case[2] relied upon and this, especially in light of the stress laid by Lord Cairns and others on the words \"the proceeds.\"\nThen to cover the ground of the effect of a direction to convert real and personal estate, there are numerous decisions shewing that such a direction, even when acted upon and the conversion completed, is in itself by no means decisive of the ultimate character and destiny of the fund so created, if there is open the question of intestacy as there is here, if the restricted nature of the residuary bequest is had in view.\nOf the numerous authorities cited on either side and duly considered by me perhaps the case of Amphlett v. Parke[3], is the strongest in appellants' favour.\nThere the will only directed a conversion of the real estate which was to be considered as personal estate with a gift as here of the residue of the general estate.\nThe review of the decisions in the opinion judgment of that case is in itself valuable, as well as the judgment and though those affected thereby were proceeding to the House of Lords, they prudently settled the matter by dividing evenly. The net result of the authorities seems to me to be that the provisions of the will itself and the language used in making same must be kept in view in deciding whether or not there has been clearly intended a conversion of realty into personalty with interest, to determine the scope of the residuary bequest.\nThe best opinion I can form, keeping that in view, is that the restricted nature of the residuary bequest given by above quoted provision is such as to render it impossible to say that the testator really intended by his later creation of a trust to finally determine all the proceeds to become thereby personal property within the meaning of the residuary bequest.\nThe direction to pay thereout debts and legacies does not seem to be a satisfactory basis upon which to so decide. To pay legacies I should read as to pay specific legacies, and all the more so as payment in all cases involved, except when otherwise specified, was to be \"without interest,\" which might reasonably be referable to interest on the real estate proceeds, and thus be made intelligible and effective.\nI am of opinion that as to any proceeds of real estate so converted, if not eaten up by debts and specific legacies, the testator died intestate.\nThere is a cross-appeal by the executors against the ruling of the court below refusing them costs.\nThat was a matter entirely in the discretion of the court below and, by the settled jurisprudence of this court, we, even when we have jurisdiction, refuse to entertain any appeal merely as to costs.\nMoreover I agree in the opinion of the court below that an executor's duty ends when he gets what he has asked and he is not supposed to take a partizan part.\nHence I think the cross-appeal must be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The only question requiring examination is the question whether the residue affected by the testator's bequest of\nall the residue of my personal estate and effects\nincludes the real estate directed to be converted. In my opinion the meaning of the will is plain. The bequest of the residue is a bequest dealing with the subject matter which is described as\nthe residue of my personal estate and effects.\nThe devise of the real estate is clearly, I think, a devise and the direction to convert is clearly, I think, a direction for the purposes of administration only and in consequence the bequest of the residue affects only property which was personal estate independently of the legal operation of the devise.\nThere is a cross-appeal as to costs. I can entertain no doubt that the executors and trustees were acting properly in the exercise of the statutory authority io submit questions arising upon the construction of the will for the opinion of the court; and having commenced an action by way of originating summons with that object, it was not only their right but their duty as well to be represented in the court of first instance and on any appeal that might be taken from the judgment of the court of first instance for the purpose of seeing that the court was correctly informed with regard to the considerations bearing upon the subjects brought before the court for examination. That being so, they are by law entitled to their costs by statutory right and the order of the Court of Appeal refusing them their costs was an order prejudicing them in a substantive right and one consequently of which they are entitled to complain by way of appeal. Anglin J.\u2014To five children of his sister William Walsh by his will bequeathed the sum of $800 each. In a codicil he directed that:\u2014(See clause C, page 51).\nThe testator had by his will directed that the proceeds of both these policies\nshould be and become part of (his) estate.\nIt is common ground that his order as to the moneys payable under the Foresters' policy was effectual, but that the like order as to the Workmen's policy was ineffectual. It was held by Mr. Justice Bigelow that, under these circumstances, the five legacies must abate to the extent to which the estate was augmented by the receipt of the insurance moneys; and by the Court of Appeal that the five legacies were wholly revoked. With great respect, I am unable to accept either view.\nThe testator provided for revocation of the legacies upon the happening of a single condition\u2014that the proceeds of both policies should become part of his estate. It is quite probable that the judgment of Mr. Justice Bigelow would carry out what the testator actually had in mind. But, if that were his intention, he did not express it.\nIn the judgment of the Court of Appeal, on the other hand, the word \"and\" of the codicil seems to have been unconsciously converted into \"or.\" For that construction I cannot find justification and I have little doubt that it would defeat the testator's purpose. The only safe course\u2014the only course open to us\u2014is to adhere strictly to the intention expressed and that is that revocation should ensue if, but only if, the condition prescribed has been entirely fulfilled.\nThe second question arises out of provisions making certain legacies payable more than one year after the testator's death without interest. I entirely agree with the judges of the provincial courts that the interest of which the legatees were thus deprived remained part of the estate and passed under the residuary bequest of personalty. The words \"without interest\" in the residuary bequest are senseless and were no doubt introduced per incuriam. They should be ignored.\nThe remaining question is whether the testator's real estate was converted into personalty so that so much of it, or of its proceeds, as was not required to meet his pecuniary legacies passed under the residuary bequest couched in these terms:\u2014(See clause D, page 53).\nThe only disposition of the real estate, made after all the legacies, including the residuary bequest, had been stated, is in these terms:\u2014(See clause E, page 53).\nGrammatically the word \"personal\" in the residuary bequest qualifies the word \"effects\" as well as the word \"estate.\" Under this bequest, apart from the effect of the direction for conversion of the real estate, it would be abundantly clear that nothing except what was personalty at the testator's death would pass. \"Effects\" is no doubt a comprehensive term. The meaning to be attached to it depends on the context. It may carry real estate. Kirby-Smith v. Parnell[4]; Smyth v. Smyth[5]; Attorney-General of Honduras v. Bristowe[6]; Hammill v. Hammill[7]. Alone it will not. Doe v. Bring[8]; and I know of no case where, used in such a context as \"my personal estate and effects,\" it has been held to embrace realty. Such a context in my opinion excludes realty from its purview. Did the testator intend by the direction for conversion to make the proceeds of his real estate personalty for all purposes so that it should, as such, fall within his residuary bequest? Such would be the effect of an absolute direction to sell not limited to any particular purpose. Singleton v. Tomlinson[9], was such a case. There the person constituted \"my residuary legatee\" was held entitled to the surplus proceeds of realty not required to satisfy the dispositions made by the will. The same result follows where the residue, though designated personal estate, is clearly intended to comprise what remains of a blended fund arising in part from proceeds of converted realty.\nBut here the testator has declared the purpose of a conversion to be the payment of his funeral and testamentary expenses, debts and legacies. In such a case surplus proceeds of converted realty will not pass under a bequest of residuary personalty. Maugham v. Mason[10], and Collis v. Robins[11], are authorities in point. Amphlett v. Parke[12]; Fitch v. Weber[13]; Taylor v. Taylor[14], and Collins v. Wakeman[15] (although the last mentioned case is questioned in Theobald on Wills, 7 ed., 256), may also be referred to.\nI do not find in the will before us any expression or implication of intention that, notwithstanding the indication of certain purposes of the conversion, it is to be \"out and out\" and for all purposes. The leaning against intestacy will not supply the omission of words expressive of the intention that the residuary legacy of personalty should include undisposed of realty or its proceeds. The avoiding of intestacy is to be regarded in construing doubtful expressions but is not enough to induce the Court to give an unnatural meaning to a word.\nIn re Benn[16].\nIn cases of ambiguity you may, at any rate in certain wills, gather an intention that the testator did not intend to die intestate, but it cannot be that, merely with a view to avoiding intestacy, you are to do otherwise than to construe plain words according to their plain meaning. A testator may well intend to die intestate. When he makes a will he intends to die testate only so far as he has expressed himself in his will.\nIn re Edwards[17].\nI would, therefore, with respect, answer question (c) of the summons in the negative as to realty or proceeds thereof not required to pay funeral expenses and legacies. Such residuary realty or proceeds thereof passed as on an intestacy.\nThere remains to be dealt with the executors' cross-appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal depriving them of their costs in that court. No doubt it is most unusual that an appeal should be entertained in this court on a mere question of costs. Here, however, the executors have been deprived of their costs not as a matter of discretion but on an erroneous view of the law, namely that, having received the advice of the court of first instance, although served with notice of the appeal they had no interest in it and should merely have awaited its result. They maintain, on the contrary, that it was their duty and their right to attend the hearing, to watch the proceedings and, if necessary, to assist the court in the disposition of a matter which they had originally brought before it. That right seems well established in practice. Carroll v. Graham[18]; Catterson v. Clark[19]; Fulton v. Mercantile Trusts Co.[20]. The executors in my opinion should have been allowed their costs in the Court of Appeal and should also have them here\u2014on such moderate scale however, as is indicated in the cases cited. I do not regard this question as really the subject of a substantive appeal involving costs only but rather as an incident of the main appeal in which the merits of the litigation are before the court and the disposition of them by the provincial courts will be substantially varied. Delta v. Vancouver Rly. Co.[21].\nAll parties should have their costs of these proceedings throughout out of the estate. The questions involved are important. They concern the administration of the estate and arise out of dispositions made by the testator which are by no means free from difficulty.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an originating summons to construe the will and codicil of William Walsh. Three questions had been submitted to the court below, but we have only to deal with two.\nThe first is whether the appellants are entitled to any portion of the legacy of $800 under the following clauses in the will and in the codicil: (See clauses A, B, C, page 51).\nIt is in evidence that no money under the insurance policy of the Ancient Order of United Workmen was paid or became payable to the Walsh estate. It is in evidence also that the insurance policy in the Independent Order of Foresters was paid to the estate. The judge of original jurisdiction decided that the legacies to the appellants would be discharged by paying them the proceeds of the Independent Order of Foresters policy. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision and came to the conclusion that the legacies of $800 made to each of the appellants had been revoked by the codicil.\nThe codicil, it seems to me, is very explicit. It provides that if the two policies of insurance were not part of the estate, then the legacies in favour of the appellants would be revoked. It is true that only one of the policies was paid to the estate, but the condition of the codicil was that if it was found that the declaration of the testator was ineffectual as to both the policies then that would deprive the appellants of the bequest stipulated in the will in their favour. It may be that the testator did not express correctly what he intended. It may be that he did not intend to give his nephews a portion of their legacies if only one of the policies would form part of his estate, but the words are so plain and so explicit that we have not to look for an intention which otherwise is so clearly expressed.\nThe appeal is well founded as to the first question and I would answer it in the affirmative.\nThe other question which has also been submitted to the consideration of the court is whether the entire residue of both real and personal estate, including accrued interest or other income, is payable to the children of the testator's nephew, Frederick J. Walsh.\nIn the will the following clause is to be found:\u2014 (See clause D, page 53). There is no provision for the residue of the real estate, except that the executors are empowered to convert the whole estate into money for the purpose of paying funeral and testamentary expenses and of paying the legacies. The words \"personal estate and effects\" could perhaps be construed as meaning in some cases personal and real property. The intentions of the testator could in some cases be determined so as to cover both personal and real property. Kirby Smith v. Parnell[22]. But in this will no such intention can be found for, in another part of his will, the testator puts personal estate and effects in juxtaposition with real estate.\nThe only possible conclusion then is that the testator has failed to dispose of his real estate; and if there is to be found some real estate after the conversion ordered by the will, then this real estate should go to the heirs of the de cujus.\nCollins v. Robins[23]; Ackroyd v. Smithson[24]; Curteis v. Wormald[25].\nThe point as to interest raised on this second question could not be of any benefit to the appellants, since this interest forms part of the residuary personalty and would not belong to them, even if their construction of the words \"without interest\" were correct.\nI would then answer the second question in the negative as to the real estate and would state that the children of Frederick J. Walsh are not entitled to the real estate but they could receive the interest on their legacy.\nThe costs of the appeal should be paid out of the estate. There is a cross-appeal on the part of the executors of the will who were condemned personally in the court below to pay their costs.\nIt is a question of discretion about which we should not interfere. The costs should not be large, if the executors simply appeared and held a watching brief. Of course they should be larger if they took an active part in the proceedings below. We have no way to ascertain the circumstances which brought this condemnation and we should not then interfere with the exercise of a discretion which might have been equitably exercised. If the executors had found it advisable to take a part in a contestation which was argued by the two interested parties, viz., the Milburns and the Walshs, it was certainly on their part a useless intervention which the court below could very well dispose of in the way it has done.\nThe cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I propose to reply in the following order to the questions submitted with a brief statement of my reasons for each answer.\nFirst Question:\u2014Is the bequest of $800 by the late William Walsh to each of his nephews and nieces, to wit to William Milburn, Robert Milburn, Walter Milburn, Mary Milburn and Ida Milburn, all of them being children of his sister Margaret A. Milburn, revoked by reason of the codicil added to his will by the said William Walsh?\nThe will contained the following directions as to two policies of life insurance held by the testator: (See clause B, page 51).\nIn the codicil made a few days after the will the testator said: (See clause C, page 51). Of course, the testator's declaration in his codicil must be read with the directions given by him in his will as to the two insurance policies, and I construe the codicil as meaning that if the testator has not succeeded, by his will, in making the moneys due under these two policies a part of his estate to be distributed under the terms of his will, then the legacies to the nephews and nieces, the children of his sister Margaret A. Milburn, are revoked.\nThe testator did not succeed in making the moneys due under one of the policies a part of his estate and therefore in my opinion the legacies to his nephews and nieces are revoked.\nIt is contended that the revocation takes place only if the testator's directions fail as to both policies, and that if they succeed as to one of them and fail as to the other, the condition is not entirely fulfilled, and therefore there is no revocation.\nI am unable so to read the condition. It deals with \"the moneys due\" under the policy of insurance in the Independent Order of Foresters and under the policy of insurance of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, as one fund, and if this fund does not become a part of the testator's estate by virtue of the directions of the will, the bequests to Margaret A Milburn's children are revoked.\nA failure with respect to one of the policies prevents the moneys due under both policies from becoming a part of the testator's estate, and therefore the revocation takes place.\nIf I could resort to conjecture to determine the probable intention of the testator, I would unhesitatingly concur in the opinion of the learned trial judge that the revocation took place only pro tanto or in proportion to the amount of the policy which did not form part of the estate. But conjecture as to the probable but unexpressed intention of the testator is entirely out of the question. If the testator desired the revocation to operate partially in the event which has happened, he has not stated his desire in the will. Therefore the answer must be either revocation or no revocation. My answer is that the legacies in question are revoked, and in that I agree with the Court of Appeal.\nSecond question:\u2014Does the interest on the bequests payable more than a year after the testator's death, and which is not to be paid to the legatees, form a part of the residuary bequest?\nThere is no difficulty here. The interest which was not to be paid to the legatees on the bequests made payable more than a year after the testator's death, in my opinion, forms part of the residuary bequest, notwithstanding the words \"without interest\" in the latter bequest, which words should be disregarded. Any other construction would leave this interest entirely outside of the operation of the will. I may add that the residuary legatees do not take these moneys as interest on the residuary bequest, but as moneys forming part of the residue and which have never left the estate. Here again I agree with the Court of Appeal.\nThird question:\u2014Does the surplus of the conversion of the real estate, if there be any such surplus after payment of the funeral and testamentary expenses and debts and the bequests made by the will, form part of the residuary bequest of the personal estate and effects?\nI will cite both the residuary bequest and the clause ordering the conversion of the real estate, the latter being very badly drafted:\u2014(See clauses D and E, page 53). This is by far the most difficult question, and it appears to me that my answer will be more intelligible if it is briefly expressed.\nIn my opinion the residuary bequest is of the residue of the testator's personal estate and effects (and the word \"personal\" qualifies both the words \"estate\" and \"effects\") as it stood at the death of the testator.\nI am also of opinion that when the conversion of real into personal estate is ordered by a will for certain specific purposes, any residue remaining after these purposes are satisfied, is not to be regarded as personal but as real estate in so far as the interests of those who upon an intestacy would take the real estate are concerned.\nNow what are the purposes for which this conversion is ordered? They are:\u2014\n1.\u2014The payment of funeral and testamentary expenses and debts,\n2.\u2014The legacies bequeathed by the will.\nIt would be idle to say that the residuary bequest is one of the legacies bequeathed by the will, because we would still have to determine what was the object of the bequest, and this object was the residue of the personal estate and effects of the testator, that is to say of what was personal estate and effects at the death of the latter. The surplus of the converted real estate would not be comprised therein. I find therefore that if there be a surplus from the conversion of real estate, after providing for the payment of funeral and testamentary expenses and debts as well as of the legacies bequeathed by the will, it does not form a part of the residuary bequest and does not pass under the will. Naturally one shrinks from coming to the conclusion that there is a partial intestacy but I can see no help for it. I have not cited any authorities on this branch of the case and am content to rely on those contained in the judgment of my brother Anglin whose opinion I share.\nMy answer to this question is therefore no, and consequently, with respect, I differ from the Court of Appeal on this point.\nThe main appeal should therefore be allowed to the extent of answering this question in the negative. I would direct that the costs of the appellants and of the respondents be paid out of the estate. I would not give costs to the executors on the main appeal.\nAs to the cross-appeal, nothing more is involved than the question of costs in the Court of Appeal which the executors claim should have been granted them. The costs were refused because the executors applied to the Court for advice and received it, and had no further interest in the matter, except to await the result of the appeal. I am not ready to say that this was error on the part of the Court of Appeal. The practice may be different in England and perhaps in Ontario, but it is a matter of practice and I am not disposed to interfere with what has been done here. I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Allan, Allan & Taylor.\nSolicitors for the respondents Grayson et al.: Grayson, Emerson & McTaggart.\nSolicitors for the respondents The Executors and Administrators Trust Co. and the official guardian:\nMackenzie, Thorn, Bastedo & Jackson.\n[1] [1878] 3 App. Cas. 404.\n[2] 3 App. Cas. 404.\n[3] [1831] 2 Russ. & M. 220.\n[4] [1903] 1 Ch. 483.\n[5] [1878] 8 Ch.

Sec. 13 Cr. C.\nIn an action framed for damages for indecent assault, although the plaintiff's evidence of force and want of consent on her part is discredited, the court can, nevertheless, accept her evidence that the defendant is the father of the child and find that there was seduction. Cassels J. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (14 Sask. L.R. 117) reversed, Cassels J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Taylor J. at the trial1, and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThis action is one for damages by the appellant against the respondent alleging that the latter did carnally know her against her will, whereby she became pregnant. The appellant testified that she did not consent to the intercourse with the respondent. The trial judge disbelieved this evidence, but found that she had been seduced by the respondent and that the defendant was the father of her child, and he allowed her $2,500 damages. The Court of Appeal held that, as the appellant's evidence of force and want of consent on her part was discredited, and as there was no other evidence than appellant's that she had been seduced, the respondent denying any connection at all, the court could not find that there was seduction.\nW. S. Gray for the appellant. It was open to the trial judge to accept the appellant's evidence in part and reject it in part. E. v. F.[2]; Brown v. Dalby[3].\nH. Fisher for respondent. The appellant failed to prove her action as brought for criminal assault. The appellant on the evidence is not entitled to a judgment for damages for seduction. Gibson v. Rabey[4].\nW. S. Gray for the appellant\nH. Fisher for respondent\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nI agree so fully with the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Lamont in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal that I need not repeat same here.\nDuff J.\u2014The judgment of Mr. Justice Taylor was reversed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the evidence of the plaintiff established that there was no seduction within the meaning of the statute. Mr. Justice Taylor's view evidently was that the plaintiff's account of the occurrence to the effect that she was overwhelmed by force could not be accepted in view of certain facts which he considered established. These facts he thought incompatible with the hypothesis of serious resistance by the plaintiff. Is the plaintiff precluded by her own evidence given on cross-examination from maintaining the allegations of her statement of claim which are the essential allegations of a cause of action under the statute? The question is not without difficulty; but on the whole I think it may properly be answered as Mr. Justice Taylor impliedly answered it. If the rejection of the plaintiff's account necessarily involved the assumption that she had committed perjury then I think the law would not permit her to recover a judgment based on that assumption. But here no such assumption was involved; the learned trial judge might very properly, as he did, conclude that in the plaintiff's state of health, the plaintiff's impression of what occurred had become blurred and could not be wholly relied upon as an accurate register of what actually happened and that the only safe course was to draw the inference properly arising from certain physical facts which pointed as he thought very clearly to the conclusion at which he arrived. As a general rule, no doubt, where a party calls a witness with his eyes open with full knowledge of what the witness is likely to say (and more especially where the witness is the party), it is not competent to that party to contradict him on a vital point. That was held in Sumner v. Brown[5], by Mr. Justice Hamilton. I think that rule is inapplicable to this case. It is, I think, a question for the tribunal of fact to determine in such a case whether statements made on cross-examination by such a witness as the plaintiff with respect to such an occurrence was one which, having regard to all the circumstances, ought to be treated as conclusive against her. Assuming in any case that there was an absence of consent there was still a right of action for assault.\nIt has been laid down (see Smith v. Selwyn[6]), that where the facts constituting the foundation of a cause of action in themselves constitute a felony the right of action for tort is suspended until the plaintiff has prosecuted the defendant if the plaintiff is the person on whom the duty of prosecution falls; but this is an objection which cannot be raised as a defense to an action on the pleadings and it is not a proper ground for non-suit. The defendant's proper course is to raise it by an application to stay. Section 13 of the Criminal Code of Canada professes to abolish this rule. It may be questioned whether this is a subject within the competence of the Parliament of Canada as appertaining to the domain of the criminal law or as a proper subject for the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction in the enactment of a Criminal Code. But at least there is a declaration in the most deliberate and solemn form by the legislative authority having jurisdiction over the criminal law, that the rule is no longer necessary in the interests of public justice. As the rule has its foundation in the supposed interests of public justice, it is at least, I think, exceedingly doubtful whether in this country any action ought to be stayed on such a ground.\nThat is a question which does not strictly arise here because no application was made for a stay of the action and the rule, if not entirely obsolete, ought at least to operate only within the straitest limits allowed by precedent. Anglin J.\u2014I had occasion very fully to consider the chief question which arises on this appeal in the case of E. v. F.[7]. I have had no reason to change the views there expressed. The only difference between that case and the case at bar is that there the plaintiff was the father whereas in the present case the girl herself brings the action by virtue of a statutory provision enabling her to do so. That difference in my opinion does not suffice to render inapplicable here the ground of decision in E. v. F.7. I agree with the view of Mr. Justice Lamont that where, in an action constituted as is that at bar, the plaintiff either in examination-in-chief or in cross-examination gives evidence of circumstances which negative the existence of violence sufficient to establish a case of ravishment, her right to recover is not necessarily destroyed because she has alleged and sworn to such violence. The reasons assigned by that learned judge in his dissenting opinion are so satisfactory that I feel I cannot usefully add to them.\nI would therefore with respect allow this appeal with costs here and in the court of appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant testified that the respondent had connection with her, but that it was without her consent and by force. The learned trial judge discredited this latter statement, and indeed under the circumstances described by the appellant it seems impossible that the respondent could have succeeded in having connection with her unless she had allowed him to do so. But the learned trial judge none the less believed that connection had taken place and that the respondent was the father of the child to whom the appellant had given birth. The respondent argues that the appellant's action was an action for an assault amounting to rape; that in such an action the learned trial judge could not give her judgment for seduction; and that the appellant could not obtain a judgment for assault, because her statement that connection with her was had by force and without her consent was rejected by the trial judge.\nIn my opinion the learned trial judge could credit one part of the appellant's testimony and disbelieve the other part as being grossly improbable, not to say impossible. If, notwithstanding her statement that she was not a consenting party but was overcome by force the learned trial judge really believed, under all the circumstances, that a case of seduction had been made out, he was certainly entitled to give the appellant judgment for seduction. Of course, the position of the appellant on this appeal is somewhat extraordinary for she, or her counsel for her, is forced to contend that a part of her testimony was rightly discredited by the trial judge. But there is no doubt in my mind that the judge at the trial could partly accept and partly reject the appellant's story, as unquestionably a jury could do. That is all I need to say, for I feel that I can add nothing to the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Lamont in which I fully concur.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nCassels J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice. The plaintiff, Amelia MacKenzie, was at the date of the alleged assault or rape (1st July, 1917) of the age of twenty years. On the 30th of June, 1920, she was twenty-three years of age. Her story as well as her conduct is full of inconsistencies and in my opinion it would be a dangerous precedent to allow a judgment to stand based on evidence such as that given on behalf of the appellant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laidlaw, Blanchard & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bothwell, Campbell & Roth.\n[1] [1921] 14 Sask.

Co. to New York under a joint tariff was that the company would be liable for loss of, or injury to, the goods caused by the negligence of another carrier from which the latter was not relieved by the terms of the bill of lading. The goods were lost while in the custody of the other carrier after they arrived in New York.\nHeld, that the onus was on the C.P.R. Co. of showing that the loss was not caused by negligence or, if it was, that the other carrier was relieved from liability.\nAnother condition was that if the goods were not removed within forty-eight hours after written notice had been given of their arrival the carrier could keep them on its premises and be responsible as warehouseman only or, at its option, after giving notice of its intention to do so, place them in a public warehouse at the risk of the owner and be free from liability. The goods were kept on the premises for a few days after notice of their arrival was given to the consignee and then, without further notice, were placed in a public warehouse where they became unfit for sale and were abandoned by the owner.\nHeld, that the carrier was not relieved by the terms of this condition; the goods were not kept on the premises and so the liability was not that of a mere warehouseman; and it was not relieved from liability by placing them in a public warehouse as no notice was given of its intention to do so. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nPotatoes were shipped from Hartland, N.B., for carriage by the appellant to New York. The bill of lading contained the following clauses:\u2014\nSec. 1. The carrier of any of the goods herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto except as hereinafter provided.\nSec. 2. In the case of shipments from one point in Canada to another point in Canada, or where goods are shipped under a joint tariff, the carrier issuing this bill of lading, in addition to its other liability hereunder, shall be liable for any loss, damage or injury to such goods from which the other carrier is not by the terms of this bill of lading relieved, caused by or resulting from the act, neglect, or default of any other carrier to which such goods may be delivered in Canada, or under such joint tariff, or over whose line or lines such goods may pass in Canada or under such joint tariff, the onus of proving that such loss was not so caused or did not so result being upon the carrier issuing this bill of lading. The carrier issuing this bill of lading shall be entitled to recover from the other carrier on whose line or lines the loss, damage, or injury to the said goods shall have been sustained the amount of such loss, damage, or injury as it may be required to pay hereunder, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript thereof. Nothing in this section shall deprive the holder of this bill of lading or party entitled to the goods of any remedy or right of action which he may have against the carrier issuing this bill of lading or any other carrier.\nSec. 6 (part) Goods not removed by the party entitled to receive them within forty-eight hours (exclusive of legal holidays), or in the case of bonded goods within seventy-two hours (exclusive of legal holidays), after written notice has been sent or given, may be kept in car, station, or place of delivery or warehouse of the carrier, subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to the carrier's responsibility as warehousemen only, or may, at the option of the carrier (after written notice of the carrier's intention to do so has been sent or given), be removed to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the cost of the owner and there held at the risk of the owner and without liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage. The goods were carried to New York over the line of the New York Central Ry. Co. On arrival notice was given to the consignee who did not take delivery. They were kept on the premises for a few days and then placed in a public warehouse, but the carrier did not give written notice of its intention to do so. While in the warehouse they became unfit for sale and were abandoned by the owners.\nF. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. The evidence does not establish negligence on the part of the carrier. But in any event it is only liable as a warehouseman.\nAt common law after notice is given of the arrival of the goods at their destination, and after a reasonable time therefrom has elapsed, the liability as carrier ceases, and it is then only that of bailee. Mitchell v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry. Co.[2]; Chapman v. Great Western Ry. Co.[3].\nThe same is the case under condition 6 of the bill of lading. By keeping the potatoes on the carriers' premises for more than forty-eight hours after notice of arrival was given the liability of warehouseman was established and that of carrier was not restored by placing them in the warehouse.\nW. P. Jones K.C. for the respondent, referred to Getty & Scott v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[4]; Rogers Lumber Co. v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[5].\nF. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant\nW. P. Jones K.C. for the respondent\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant and those for whom it is, by the terms of its contract, responsible, disregarded the conditions imposed upon it thereby and placed the goods in question where such goods never should have been placed and caused thereby the destruction of said goods. The learned judge in a fair and lucid charge to which no objection of any kind was taken by counsel submitted to the jury questions to which no exception was taken.\nUpon the answers thereto and the admitted facts the learned trial judge for the reasons that appear in his opinion directed judgment to be entered for respondent.\nThe Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, upon an appeal taken thereto by appellant herein, for reasons assigned by it, covering, correctly, so far as I understand, some points of fact not expressly mentioned by the learned trial judge, upholds his reasons and thus leaves me, agreeing as I do in all said reasons, unable to add anything useful thereto.\nI therefore am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The contract provides that where goods are shipped under a joint tariff, (which is the present case) \"the carrier issuing this bill of lading * * * shall be liable for any loss, damages or injury from which the other carrier is not, by the terms of the bill of lading, relieved, caused by, or resulting from the act, neglect or default of any other carrier to which such goods may be delivered * * * under such joint tariff * * * the onus of proving that such loss was not so caused or did not so result, being on the carrier issuing this bill of lading.\" This language is clear and the effect of it is that on proof that goods were received by a carrier under \"a joint tariff\" the appellant company is \"liable\" for the loss, damage or injury to such goods unless it establishes one of two things: 1st, that such loss, damage or injury is something in respect of which, by the terms of the bill of lading, \"the other carrier\" is not to be responsible, or 2nd, that such loss, etc., was not caused or did not result from the act, neglect or default of \"the other carrier.\"\nThe onus resting upon the company is the onus probandi in the strict sense, that is to say, the company is the actor in the litigation in respect of these two issues, and in so far as they involve questions of fact the company must fail unless it establish affirmatively by reasonable evidence that upon them it is entitled to succeed. The company relies upon article 6 of the conditions, which is in these words:\u2014\nSection 6 (part). Goods not removed by the party entitled to receive them within forty-eighth hours (exclusive of legal holidays), or in the case of bonded goods within seventy-two hours (exclusive of legal holidays), after written notice has been sent or given, may be kept in car, station or place of delivery or warehouse of the carrier, subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to the carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only, or may at the option of the carrier (after written notice of the carrier's intention to do so has been given), be removed to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the cost of the owner, and there held at the risk of the owner and without liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.\nNow it is undisputed that the goods were not \"kept in car, station or place of delivery or warehouse of the carrier\" and therefore that branch of this article limiting the carrier's responsibility in such a case to that of warehouseman has no application and the company's sole recourse must be to the provision which entitles the carrier, upon giving written notice, to remove the goods to a public or licensed warehouse. I have no doubt that written notice here means written notice to the owner and it is admitted that such notice was not given; such notice is an essential condition and accordingly it follows that this branch of the article is also without application. As to damages, I concur in the view taken in the court below that section 4 of the contract fixes the damages. The trial judge was therefore right in instructing the jury as he did. The sole issues were issues in respect of which as already mentioned the company was actor. There is no evidence upon which the jury could properly have found for the company upon those issues. The case appears to be a peculiarly simple one although it has perhaps been obscured by the accumulation of irrelevancies which it has attracted during its progress through the courts. It is proper, however, to observe that the argument advanced to the effect that the New York Central Company's responsibility ceased after the expiration of forty-eight hours after the arrival of the goods in New York, is really beside the point. The conditions prescribed by the second section impose responsibility for loss unless that loss is something in respect of which the bill of lading itself relieves the carrier; and these conditions are not satisfied unless such release is to be found in express language or by necessary implication from the language of the document. Section 6 provides for exemption from liability in certain specified cases and the facts of the present case do not bring it within any of these exemptions.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts of this case are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the learned trial judge and in that of the Chief Justice of New Brunswick delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[6]. If findings of the jury were necessary to maintain the judgment which the plaintiff holds, I incline to think it could not be sustained. But I agree with the trial judge and the court of appeal of New Brunswick that upon the conditions of the bill of lading under which the plaintiff's goods were shipped, their loss raises a presumption of liability on the part of the defendant as the primary or issuing carrier, and that there is no evidence in the record on which a finding could be based that would rebut that presumption.\nBy clause 1 of the conditions the issuing carrier (the defendant) assumes liability for any loss of, or damage to, the goods, except as otherwise therein provided.\nBy clause 2 where goods are shipped under a joint tariff (admittedly this case), the issuing carrier assumes liability for loss, damage or injury to such goods caused by, or arising from, any act, neglect or default of any other carrier to whom the goods may be delivered under such joint tariff, (in this case the New York Central Ely. Co.) from which such other carrier is not relieved by the terms of the bill of lading. The issuing carrier also assumes the onus of proving that such loss was not so caused or did not so arise.\nBy clause 3 a number of possible causes of loss or injury are categorically excepted from those entailing liability on the carrier. None of them was the cause of the loss of the plaintiff's potatoes. The only one of these excepted causes relied on by counsel for the appellant was \"inherent vice in the goods.\" There is nothing in evidence to suggest the existence of such a vice\u2014nothing to shew that the potatoes would have become unfit for sale if given reasonable care and attention. Clause 3 further provides for the carrier's liability being that of a warehouseman in the event of the goods being destroyed by fire more than 48 hours (72 hours in the case of bonded goods) after written notice of arrival of the goods at destination\u2014making it clear that responsibility as carrier does not terminate when actual transit is completed and also that it continues as to other causes of loss even after expiry of the 48 hours \"free time.\"\nClause 6 provides two methods by which the carrier may be relieved of this responsibility. By adopting one its responsibility may be reduced to that of a warehouseman; by pursuing the other it may entirely escape further responsibility. In this case neither of the prescribed courses was taken. The New York Central Railway Company placed the goods in a public or licensed warehouse, but without giving notice of intention to do so. The goods became unfit for sale while in this warehouse and still under the control of the carrier to whom they had been transferred by the original carrier who issued the bill of lading, and whose responsibility had not been either reduced to that of a warehouseman or extinguished because of non-compliance with the conditions prescribed by clause 6 for effecting one or other of these results.\nThere is no evidence to negative the presumption arising under the bill of lading that the loss of the potatoes is ascribable to some neglect or default of such transferee-carrier. Indeed there is not a little pointing to the conclusion that its selection of a public or licensed warehouse unsuited for the storage of the potatoes was the direct cause of their loss. Had the jury found negligence of the New York Central Railway in this respect, in the absence of the notice of intention requisite to bring the defendant within the protection of clause 6, a judgment against it based on that finding would have been unassailable. But without such a finding the failure of the defendant to discharge the onus which it assumed by the bill of lading of disproving that the loss of the plaintiff's goods was due to some act, neglect or default of its transferee-carrier justifies a judgment upholding its responsibility. I agree with the reasoning on which Mr. Justice Crocket founded his conclusion that the defendants remained liable in respect of the shipment in question as common carriers under the terms of the bill of lading.\nThe full value of the consignment at the point of shipment, plus freight charges, etc., paid by the plaintiff, has been allowed as damages. There is evidence that the price of potatoes had declined before the plaintiff's potatoes had suffered deterioration attributable to any act or omission of the New York Central Railway Company. But clause 4 of the bill of lading provides that the amount of the loss for which the carrier shall be liable shall be computed on the basis of the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment (including freight and other charges, if paid, and duty, if paid or payable and not refunded), unless a lower value has been represented in writing by the shipper or agreed upon, or is determined by the classification or tariff on which the rate charged for carriage is based. None of these exceptions is invoked but it is said that from the value of the goods at the time and place of shipment should be deducted any decline in price before the happening of the event which entails liability on the carrier. The amount of the damages awarded is admitted to have been the value at the time and place of shipment. The total loss of the shipment is conceded. I agree with the learned trial judge and the court of appeal that clause 4 deprives the defendant of any advantage which it might otherwise have had from falling prices in the potato market just as it would preclude the plaintiff from claiming the benefit of an advance in the price of potatoes. The clause was no doubt inserted to avoid difficulty and uncertainty in the assessment of damages. The value of the goods at the place and time of shipment would probably be known to the carrier when assuming responsibility and it would be in its interest to have this value fixed as the basis of that responsibility rather than the uncertain and unknown future value at the place and time of delivery. This stipulation probably operates in the interest of the carrier more often than in that of the shipper.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

The trial judge held the view stated in the head-note. The full court decided that it should be 80 per cent of the actual value of the work done. W. C. Macdonald for the appellant. In Hawkins v. Burrill[1], where a contractor was to be paid 80 per cent of the \"value of the work done,\" it was held that this value was not the cost to the contractor but that of the partial work measured by the total price. See also 3 Hals. Laws of England, page 213; Fidelity Co. v. Agnew[2].\nBurchell K. C. for the respondent referred to Emden on Building Contracts (4 ed.) page 112; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9nerale v. Milders[3].\nW. C. Macdonald for the appellant\nBurchell K. C. for the respondent\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing a judgment' of the learned trial judge in an action brought by respondent upon a building contract against the appellants seeking to recover for work and material, and damages for dismissal terminating the contract.\nThe contract provided for payment by the appellant of $13,875.00 for the entire work and material\nin instalments * * * of eighty per cent of labour and materials delivered on the certificate of the architects.\nWhen the respondent contractor had realized that he had undertaken the work at too low a price and could not induce the architects to give him progress certificates for the eighty per cent on his own basis of what was due him, he wrote letters to the appellant and the architects clearly declaring that unless the architects yielded to his wishes the work would cease.\nThere were negotiations and a fruitless proposal for arbitration designed to override the architects' certificate and decision as to what was due, all of which fails to touch the vital points in question herein. Then the architects gave appellants under article 5 of the contract which reads as follows;\nArt. 5. Should the contractor at any time refuse or neglect to supply a sufficiency of properly skilled workmen, or of materials of the proper quality, or fail in any respect to prosecute the work with promptness and diligence, or fail in the performance of any of the agreements herein contained, such refusal, neglect or failure being certified by the architects, the owner shall be at liberty after three days' written notice to the contractor, to provide any such labour or materials, and to deduct the cost thereof from any money then due or thereafter to become due to the contractor under this contract; and if the architects shall certify that such refusal, neglect or failure is sufficient ground for such action, the owner shall also be at liberty to terminate the employment of the contractor for the said work and to enter upon the premises and take possession, for the purpose of completing the work comprehended under this contract, of all materials, tools and appliances thereof, and to employ any other person or persons to finish the work, and to provide the materials therefor; and in case of such discontinuance of the employment of the contractor he shall not be entitled to receive any further payment under this contract until the said work shall be wholly finished, at which time, if the unpaid balance of the amount to be paid under this contract shall exceed the expense incurred by the owner in finishing the work, such excess shall be paid by the owner to the contractor, but if such expense shall exceed such unpaid balance, the contractor shall pay the difference to the owner. The expense incurred by the owner as herein provided, either for furnishing materials or for finishing the work, and any damage incurred through such default, shall be audited and certified by the architect, whose certificate thereof shall be conclusive upon the parties;\na certificate which reads as follows:\u2014\nHalifax, N.S., August 21st, 1919.\nW. J. Hopgood & Sons,\nHalifax.\nDear Sirs:\u2014In accordance with article 5, of signed contract, dated 20th May, 1919, between Austin J. Feener, contractor and yourselves, we hereby certify that the aforesaid contractor has stopped the work and nothing has been done on the building since Saturday last noon.\nWe further certify that such neglect and failure of the contractor is sufficient ground for you to terminate the employment of the contractor and to proceed as provided in article 5, of the contract.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) Harris & Horton. Thereupon the appellant pursuant thereto and in literal compliance therewith wrote the respondent as follows:\u2014\nHalifax, N.S., August 22nd, 1919.\nTo Austin J. Feener, Esq.,\nHalifax, N.S.\nSir:\u2014We beg to enclose herewith copy of certificate of. Messrs. Harris & Horton, under article five, of the contract between us, dated May 20th, 1919.\nPlease take notice that you having stopped the work under said contract and nothing having been done on the building since Saturday noon last, we hereby terminate your employment for the said work and will, on Wednesday morning next, August 27th, 1919, enter upon the said premises and take possession for the purpose of completing the work comprehended under said contract, of all materials, tools and appliances therefor and will employ other person or persons to finish the work and to provide the materials therefor, and we hold you responsible for the excess of the expense incurred by us therefor over the unpaid balance of the contract price, and will also hold you responsible for any damage incurred through your default.\nYours truly,\nW. J. Hopgood & Son.\nPursuant thereto appellants after the expiration of the time specified therein and in due accordance with the terms of the contract as expressed in said article five thereof, proceeded to finish the work in question on a basis of paying therefor the cost of labour and materials plus ten per cent.\nThe work cost them in all over twenty thousand dollars instead of the contract price.\nThe respondent on the day following the date and delivery of appellants' letter issued the writ commencing this action and pursued it despite all the foregoing circumstances.\nI am unable to understand the process of reasoning by which it is sought to overrule the absolute discretion of the architects as to the progress certificate upon which alone appellants were bound to pay and the respondent was to become entitled to recover payments unless and until the work had been duly completed.\nThe contention that the alleged cost of labour and materials incurred by the respondent instead of the value thereof having regard to the total price is to be paid therefor by appellants, certainly is in conflict with the express language above quoted from the written contract and with the following provision which therein followed that,\nAll payments shall be made upon written certificates of the architects to the effect that such payments have become due.\nAnd in article 10 of the contract there is an express provision that no such certificate\nshall be conclusive evidence of the performance of the contract either wholly or in part.\nThis provision is evidently designed to protect the appellants against possible errors af the architects in making progress certificates and enable the architects to correct any such when coming to give the final certificates.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court of appeal below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the view of the contract taken by the learned trial judge. \"Labour and materials\" means in this context, in my judgment, the value of the labour and materials as represented by the work done, which value, of course, must be ascertained by reference to the standard furnished by the contract price. That is a perfectly reasonable construction of the language and it gives also reasonable effect to the intention of the parties as disclosed by the contract as a whole. The evidence seems to establish quite conclusively that the respondent found himself in a position in which he considered he was unable to proceed with the work in the absence of some readjustment of the terms. This he made known to the appellants. It is quite true that the respondent desired to go on with the contract but conditionally upon some readjustment of its terms resulting in an arrangement more favourable to himself. There was, I think, a perfectly clear declaration by him that otherwise he could not and would not carry out his agreement.\nIn these circumstances the respondent cannot successfully allege either that he completed his contract or that he was ready and willing to complete it but that he was prevented from doing so by the appellant. As the learned trial judge says, the essential averment that he was ready and willing to perform his contract is an allegation which is negatived by the evidence. See Forrestt v. Aramayo[4], at page 338.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am with great respect of the opinion that the construction put upon the contract between the parties to this action by the learned trial judge was correct and that his judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action was therefore right and should be restored.\nRead literally and taken by itself, the clause,\neighty per cent of labour and materials delivered on the certificates of the architects. might support the plaintiff's contention\u2014that is if the architects' certificate should not be regarded as indispensable. But the contract also contains a stipulation for a twenty per cent draw-back payable only 33 days after completion of the work. Now the obvious purpose of inserting this latter provision was to afford reasonable security to the owner for the completion of the work by the contractor as well as to protect him against liens for wages and materials. Having regard to that purpose, the proper construction of such a provision in my opinion is that twenty per cent of the proportion of the contract price earned shall be withheld from time to time as progress payments are made. Otherwise the owner would have no security whatever should the contractor become insolvent or make default during the progress of the work. The two clauses, one for the protection of the contractor, the other for that of the owner, must be read together. The object of the court in construing a contract must be to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties gathered from the contract as a whole\u2014not from the consideration of a single provision divorced from its context.\nIt is conceded that the clause providing for payment of eighty per cent of labour and materials is subject to the later clause providing for the twenty per cent drawback, to the extent that if at any time the payments made for the value of labour and materials should amount to eighty per cent of the whole contract price the contractor would not be entitled to receive any further payment until 33 days had expired after the completion of the work. It might be that with only fifty per cent or even less of the total work completed the actual value of labour and materials furnished would amount to eighty per cent of the contract price. According to the plaintiff's contention he would then be entitled to be paid such eighty per cent, leaving only twenty per cent of the total price in the owner's hands to secure the completion of the remaining fifty per cent or more of the work. I cannot think that a construction which would lead to such a result can be correct. It does not give to the draw-back clause the effect it was intended to have.\nIn my opinion the interpretation put upon the contract by the architects was sound and the contractor's right to be paid from time to time eighty per cent of labour and materials furnished was subject to the restriction that a sum equal to twenty per cent of the value of the work done and materials on the ground estimated in proportion to the contract price for the completed work should from time to time be retained by the owner as drawback. In other words, the contractor's right was not to receive on progress certificates eighty per cent of the absolute value of the labour and materials furnished but of the relative or proportionate value thereof estimated on the basis of the contract price representing the total value of the completed work. Fair effect\u2014and I am convinced the effect intended\u2014is thus given to both the eighty per cent and the twenty per cent provisions.\nThe plaintiff stopped work and practically refused to proceed further unless his interpretation of the contract should be accepted. The architects certified to the owner that there had been such neglect and failure of the contractor as warranted the termination of the contract under article 5. The defendant was thereupon entitled forthwith to terminate the plaintiff's employment. As I read the contract the three days' notice clause applicable to an earlier provision for delay in the work does not apply to this case. On this ground and also on the ground that the plaintiff had abandoned the work and sufficiently intimated his purpose to repudiate the contract to warrant the defendant in treating it as at an end I think the action was rightly dismissed at the trial.\nIn the absence of any evidence of fraud or collusion with the defendant on the part of the architects the failure of the plaintiff to produce their certificate for the sum which he claims was due him by the owner presents a formidable obstacle to his success.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court en banc and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nMignault J. (dissenting).\u2014The principal question here turns on the construction of clause 9 of the contract whereby the respondent undertook certain construction and repair work for the appellants for the sum of $13,875.00. A difference arose between the parties owing to the refusal of the architect to grant progress estimates for an amount equivalent to eighty per cent of the labour and materials furnished by the respondent, so that the latter was deprived, during the progress of the work, of the payments to which he claimed he was entitled. The respondent having notified the appellants that he would not continue his work unless he received the amount due according to the agreement, the appellants put an end to his contract. This action was brought by the respondent for the value of his work and for damages.\nThe material portion of clause 9 reads as follows:\u2014\nArt. IX. It is hereby mutually agreed between the parties hereto that the sum to be paid by the owner to the contractor for said work and materials shall be $13,875.00 (thirteen thousand eight hundred and seventy-five dollars), subject to additions and deductions as hereinbefore provided, and that such sum shall be paid in current funds by the owner to the contractor in instalments, as follows:\u2014 Eighty per cent of labour and materials delivered on the certificate of the architects.\nFirst payment on the value of labour amounting to five hundred dollars.\nOther payments fortnightly as the work progresses.\nTwenty per cent of full amount of contract to be paid as herein provided.\nThe final payment shall be made within thirty-three days after this contract is fulfilled.\nAll payments shall be made upon written certificates of the architects to the effect that such payments have become due.\nThe construction which the architect placed on the clause was that the payments during the work were not to be of eighty per cent of the actual value of labour and materials, but, inasmuch as the contractor had undertaken the work for too low a price, the eighty per cent was to be determined with reference to the portion of work executed as compared to what remained to be done. Thus if a quarter of the work contracted for was performed up to a certain date, the payment was to be of eighty per cent of one-quarter of the contract price, and not eighty per cent of the actual value of the labour and materials.\nI cannot agree with this construction which the learned trial judge adopted.\nIn plain English the contractor is entitled, as the work progresses, to instalments of eighty per cent of the labour and materials furnished. There is no reference here to the proportion between what is performed and what remains to be done. The contract provides that the first payment is to be made on the value of labour amounting to $500.00. This clearly refers to the actual value, and in my opinion the actual value of the work done, measured generally but not necessarily by the actual expenditure, is the basis on which the architect should have granted certificates for the fortnightly payments. It is true that the final instalment is to be twenty per cent of the full amount of the contract, and is payable within 33 days after completion of the work. And it is urged that, assuming the contract to be for too low a price, the contractor would receive eighty per cent of the contract price before eighty per cent of the work had been completed, and that therefore the owner's security for due performance would be gone, or would be limited to the twenty per cent retained for the final payment.\nThe only security which the contract provides is this twenty per cent and the owner remains fully entitled to it. The objection is one which the owner should have considered before making the contract, but certainly is no reason to refuse to give effect to the plain, meaning of its language. If the appellants are right, where the contract price is too low, in claiming that the eighty per cent should be calculated on the proportion of the work done and not on the actual value of the labour and materials furnished then, when the contract price is too high, the eighty per cent would be estimated on a similar proportion, and might conceivably exceed the actual expenditure. I cannot place so forced a construction on the plain language of this contract, so I may simply say that finding; myself in entire agreement with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Russell in the appellate court, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCassels J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge, Mr. Justice Mellish, restored.\nI agree entirely with the reasons of the learned trial judge. He has dealt fully with the facts of the case and it is unnecessary to repeat them. If the contention of the respondent be correct, the protection of the owners in having 20 per cent held back as security would be wiped out before half of the work was performed. The contractor might have received the whole contract price and if dishonest (not that there is any suggestion of dishonesty on the part of the present contractor) or from pecuniary troubles be unable to finish the work the owner would lose his 20 per cent drawback. I also am of opinion that a certificate of the architect was a condition precedent to the contractor being entitled to payment. There is no allegation of fraud nor proof thereof entitling the contractor to have the architect disqualified.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. A.

Fisher, [1921] S.C.R. 546\nDate: 1921-11-21\nW. A. Kinney (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nEsther Florence Fisher (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: October 19; 1921: November 21.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ. and Cassels J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLibel\u2014Demand for payment of account\u2014Reply\u2014Privilege\u2014Criminal charge\u2014Res judicata.\nTo a demand by F. for payment of an account K. replied by pointing out errors and demanding payment of the amount of a cheque drawn by a third party in the felonious conversion of which, he alleged, F's wife took part and that the rights in said cheque had been transferred to him.\nHeld, Duff and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that any privilege which attaches to K.'s letter as a reply to a demand for payment of an account does not extend to the portion containing the criminal charge, there being no proof that K. possessed any rights in respect to said cheque or had any interest in making such charge.\nOn appeal from the result of a former trial of this case the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held (53 N.S. Rep. 406) that the whole letter was privileged but ordered a new trial of the whole case on the ground that the question of malice should have been left to the jury.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that as the order was for a new trial without restriction, and the evidence given on the former trial is not before the court, the question of privilege is not res judicata by the decision of the provincial court.\nPer Duff J. When a court, in granting a new trial, decides a substantive question in the litigation, that question, for the purposes of that litigation, is to be taken to have been conclusively determined as between the parties.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia setting aside the judgment for the defendant and ordering a new trial. The plaintiff's husband wrote to the defendant asking for payment of an account enclosed and received the following reply.\nSeptember 10th, 1918.\nMr. Vince Fisher,\nDear Sir:\u2014Replying to your request to pay your balance of wages I would say outside of errors in your account in which you have failed to credit me with meals furnished you and have charged for more time than you worked particularly on the last day, I have a counter-claim against you for $25 due me from you on your wife's account being the amount of Mrs. McDonald's lost check, in the felonious conversion of which and the cashing of same by falsely impersonating Mrs. McDonald at the Bank I have reason to believe and do believe your wife took part.\nThis of course would leave you in debt to me which balance I hereby demand you pay forthwith to me.\nYours truly,\nW. A. Kinney.\nP.S.\u2014Mrs. McDonald has transferred all her rights to me in the check in question.\nMrs. Fisher brought action claiming damages for libel. On the trial defendant failed to prove the criminal charge and also his rights in said cheque but he relied on his plea that the letter was privileged. There had been a former trial of the action, in which a judgment for the plaintiff had been set aside by the full court[1], which held that the whole letter of defendant was privileged and ordered a new trial to have the question of malice submitted to the jury. On the second trial plaintiff's action was dismissed, the case being withdrawn from the jury, and the full court again ordered a new trial. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The questions to be determined were: First, was the decision of the court below after the first trial conclusive as against the parties as to the question of privilege? Secondly, if that question is not res judicata was the whole letter really privileged? Thirdly, if it was privileged was there evidence of malice to be submitted to the jury?\nPaton K.C. for the appellant. The court below has twice held that the letter was privileged and on neither occasion did the plaintiff appeal from the decision. That question is now res judicata.\nThe plaintiff has had two opportunities to prove actual malice. Two members of the court below hold that he has entirely failed and two that some evidence has been given.\nA mere scintilla of evidence will not support even a finding by the jury. See Laughton v. Bishop of Sodor and Man[2], at page 505.\nIf the evidence is equally consistent with the presence or absence of malice there is nothing to be submitted to the jury. Spill v. Maule[3].\nL. A. Lovett K.C. for the respondent. For the privilege to attach to the criminal charge in his letter defendant must prove that he has an interest in the subject matter of the charge. Harrison v. Bush[4], at page 348.\nAs to malice see Adam v. Ward[5], at page 318; Royal Aquarium v. Parkinson[6], at page 444.\nPaton K.C. for the appellant\nL. A. Lovett K.C. for the respondent Idington J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia directing a new trial in an action for libel founded on the following letter written by appellant to the respondent's husband:\u2014\nMr. Vince Fisher:\nDear Sir:\u2014Replying to your request to pay your balance of wages I would say outside of errors in your acct. which you have failed to credit to me with meals furnished you and have charged for more time than you worked particularly on the last day, I have a counter claim against you for $25 due me from you on your wife's account being the amount of Mrs. McDonald's lost cheque, in the felonious conversion of which and the cashing of same by falsely impersonating Mrs. McDonald at the bank I have reason to believe and do believe your wife took part.\nThis of course would leave you in debt to me which balance I hereby demand you pay forthwith to me.\nYours truly,\nW. A. Kinney.\nP.S.\u2014Mrs. McDonald has transferred all her rights to me in the cheque in question.\nThis was in reply to the following letter of respondent's husband:\u2014\nMr. Kinney:\nDear Sir:\u2014Please find enclosed my bill and also time of labour. Please settle at $2.00 a day for 10 days.\nVincent Fisher.\nThe ground upon which the court below proceeded was that there was evidence before the learned trial judge of malice on the part of appellant sufficient to entitle the respondent to have her case submitted to the jury instead of being dismissed as it was at the close of the respondent's case.\nI agree with the appellate court below in the result reached, but cannot agree with all the reasons assigned. There is another ground on which I hold the learned trial judge erred, and which the reasons of the appellate court seem to countenance, and that was in holding the publication of such a libel was privileged by reason of the occasion therefor being so.\nThis probably arose from the fact that there had been a prior trial of same cause of action in which a verdict had been rendered in favour of the plaintiff (now respondent) and judgment therein had been set aside on the ground that the publication was privileged by reason of the occasion giving rise thereto.\nThe new trial granted therein was unrestricted and in no res judicata sense was plaintiff, or the learned trial judge, bound by such ruling of the court.\nIn the sense that such a ruling as matter of precedent in the court above bound the judge if the facts presented were exactly the same as on the first trial he may have been bound by such ruling and to leave the plaintiff if she so desired to appeal therefrom.\nIn like manner the appellate court may have felt bound.\nIf that court of appeal from the first trial holding as it did in fact, had desired to render its judgment conclusive, it might have so directed, and restricted the second trial to a single issue and thus forced appellant to come here for relief.\nIn the absence of such direction the whole case is open to us now and, assuming the evidence on the first trial exactly the same as on the trial now in question there was such obvious error that it is I conceive our duty in the interest of the administration of justice to make clear that such a holding not only is no bar to the respondent now, but also that she is entitled to our ruling upon the point in dismissing this appeal. And all the more so by reason of the appellate court holding that the statements of alleged fact which appear in the alleged libel must be taken as evidence of the occasion being privileged.\nI, with respect, cannot assent to such a proposition of law.\nTo maintain that because a plaintiff in a libel suit driven by necessity of law to put in evidence the whole document is bound by all the alleged facts therein is, I submit, quite untenable.\nIf that were the case there would be no necessity for a libeller to prove the truth of his accusation.\nAs a means of interpreting the alleged libel they may be valuable, but not as proof of existence of a privileged occasion.\nTo bring any defendant within a privilege claimed by him under the law he must prove the facts upon and by virtue of which he is entitled to make such claim unless they have already been proven in the case.\nIt is not what such a defendant says or believes that constitutes the privilege, but the proven facts and circumstances which, if sufficient, constitute in law the privilege.\nIt sometimes happens as, for example, in the common case of a man asking another as to the integrity or fidelity of a former servant and his answer is given fairly that no further evidence is needed inasmuch as the circumstances involved in the proven facts constitute the privilege.\nIn this case there was nothing resembling that condition of things.\nAnd the excuse that the appellant might believe what he related does not alone constitute the privilege. See the judgments of the several able judges in the case of Hebditch v. MacIlwaine[7], dealing with the case of belief as an element which proved nothing as part of what could constitute the occasion a privileged one.\nAnd in another aspect of this phase of the question as to proof needed, see the case of London Association for Protection of Trade v. Greenlands[8], and especially the following sentence on page 26:\nI do not think that Macintoshv. Dun[9], affects the consideration of this case, beyond shewing that in determining what is a privileged occasion all the circumstances under which the publication is made need to be considered for the purpose of determining whether privilege attaches or no.\nThat sentence expresses what I think must be observed in this case, and the said case of Macintosh v. Dun9, is worth considering in the same connection.\nWhen we try to find out those circumstances we cannot accept as proven all the appellant imagines and utters unless and until he has proven same or what he alleges as admitted as fact which is not the case by filing as of necessity the libel as a whole.\nThat is, however, evidence against him and somewhat cogent that there never was a basis for supposing that the man addressed was at all concerned in the story put forward as a means of answering an honest debt by way of counterclaim, which is the only matter in which they had a common interest.\nAccording to what he relates the cheque belonged first to Mrs. Macdonald and then possibly to the bank.\nIt was no concern of his unless and until he had proven the postscript allegation of his that he had acquired her rights. No evidence being given on that point and his allegation being unproven, there remains no possibility of his claiming the occasion as privileged until he does, and proof thereof would possibly destroy his pretensions.\nAnd when he has proven, if ever, that fact I fail to see how he could, without a good deal more, come near establishing a counterclaim resting thereon as against the husband of respondent.\nAssuming the law of Nova Scotia as stated by counsel for respondent and not denied by appellant's counsel as to the liability of the husband for a wife's torts, the foundation for the privilege claimed is far from being established.\nAnd the fact of his pleading justification is one open to very serious and grave remarks even if withdrawn, which is stated by court and counsel for appellant.\nSo far as appears in the case before us it stands there yet.\nIn this connection a perusal of the opinion of Odgers on Libel and Slander, 5 ed. (Can.) at page 249, is worth while for those concerned.\nThere is abundant evidence, in the case as it stands, of malice which entitled the respondent to the opinion of the jury even if there had been proven a case of privilege which I hold there was not.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014Two questions arise. And first was the occasion privileged? This question was passed upon by the full court when ordering a new trial. It was then held, and this was the basis of the court's judgment, that the occasion was privileged. It is not suggested that the pertinent evidence presented at the second trial differs in any relevant way from the evidence presented at the first trial. The full court proceeded upon the assumption that it did not, and that tribunal may fairly be presumed to know the grounds of its own previous decision. The former decision was therefore binding upon the full court and in my judgment it is conclusive as between the parties in this court also. I had occasion to discuss the effect of the decisions of a court of appeal in making an order directing a new trial based upon definite conclusions of law and fact in Western Canada Power Co. v. Berglint[10], at p. 299. I cite the passage:\u2014\nThere is some authority indicating that where a court of appeal in granting a new trial decides a substantive question in the litigation, that question, for the purposes of that litigation, is to be taken to have been conclusively determined as between the parties. I refer without-further discussion to the observations of Lord Macnaghten in Bader Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin[11] at page 623, and to their Lordships' decision in Ram Kirpal Shukul v. Mussumat Rup Kuari[12]. (See especially page 41 as to the effect of determinations in interlocutory judgments upon the rights of parties in the suits in which the judgments are given.) It seems quite clear that for this purpose we are not confined to the formal judgment; Kali Krishna Tagore v. Secretary of State for India[13] at page 192, and Petherpermal Chetty v. Muniandi Servai[14] at page 108.\nI think the view here tentatively put forward is the sound view of the effect of a decision of the character under discussion.\nThere remains the question whether there was sufficient evidence of express malice to support the verdict of the jury. The case, on this branch of it, is. very close to the line. On the whole I prefer the view of Harris C. J. and Mellish J. and in consequence my conclusion is that the action should be dismissed. Anglin J.\u2014The law governing occasions of qualified privilege in actions for libel, as to the respective functions of the judge and the jury in dealing with the issue raised by such a defence and as to the nature and degree of evidence of express malice relied on to destroy the privilege which may properly be submitted to the jury, has been so fully reviewed by the House of Lords and the authorities so exhaustively discussed in the recent case of Adam v. Ward[15], that it is no longer necessary to look to earlier reported decisions and a re-statement of the principles established by them is uncalled for.\nIn my opinion whatever privilege may have attached to the defendant's letter in so far as it was a reply to the plaintiff's reiterated demand for payment of his wages did not extend to the charge of felonious misappropriation of a cheque by the plaintiff which it contained. There is an utter absence of evidence in the record before us to establish any interest of the defendant in making such a charge. If an assignment of Mrs. MacDonald's rights in regard to the cheque would have given him such an interest, the fact of such assignment is not proved. With respect, I cannot accept the view of Mr. Justice Ritchie that the libellous letter, because put in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff to prove the libel and its publication, affords evidence against him of all the facts which it states. The plaintiff was obliged to put in the whole document. That was the defendant's right.\nWe do not know on what evidence the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc when dealing with the record of a former trial held that the privilege of the occasion on which the letter complained of was written extended to the libellous portion of it. It may be that if the same evidence was again before him the learned Chief Justice, who presided at the second trial, would properly have held himself bound by the ruling of the full court. Indeed the full court itself might have been so bound. But the evidence given at the former trial is not before us. We have no means of knowing whether it was the same as that given at the second trial. The order of the full court on the appeal from the judgment at the first trial directed a new trial of the whole case. It was not limited to the question of malice but left open the entire issue raised by the defence of privilege. We therefore must deal with the evidence now before us and determine whether it discloses such an interest in the defendant as would entitle him to claim qualified privilege for the libellous statement complained of made when he was replying to the demand of the plaintiff's husband for payment of his wages. That it does not do so I am quite satisfied.\nBut if the privilege of the occasion on which the defendant's letter was written extended to the libellous matter complained of I should be disposed to agree with the view which prevailed in the court en banc that the language in which it was couched and the subsequent incident indicative of persistence by the defendant in the accusation against the plaintiff afforded some evidence of actual malice which should have been left to the jury.\nMignault J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Ritchie in the Appellate Court.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: V.

The only question for decision on the appeal is the construction to be placed on the portion of a contract between the parties which is set out in the head-note.\nChristopher C. Robinson for the appellant.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. and M.G. Powell for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument in this case I entertained no reasonable doubt that the appeal failed and should be dismissed.\nA careful perusal of the agreement in question and further consideration of the facts as proved satisfied me that the reasons for judgment of the trial judge, Middleton J., and of Chief Justice Mulock and Mr. Justice Riddell of the Appellate Division were sound and that their construction of the contract in question was the correct one.\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by my brother Anglin and as these reasons embody my own views fully I do not deem it necessary to add anything to them, and I would, therefore, for the reasons stated by him, dismiss the main appeal as well as the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal, both with costs, reducing the amount awarded plaintiff, on Mr. Robinson\u2019s admission, by the sum of $249.42.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a newspaper publisher and the respondent a manufacturer of paper. They entered into a contract of which the most important clause is as follows:\u2014 The company agree to sell and the purchasers to purchase during the period commencing on the 1st day of January, 1916, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1918, for use in the publication of the British Whig newspaper published in the city of Kingston, one hundred and fifty tons approximately of paper per year (being the whole of the purchased requirements) on the following terms and conditions.\nThe questions raised relate to the interpretation and construction of this clause.\nThe learned trial judge held that the words\none hundred and fifty tons approximately of paper per year\nwere the essential dominating part of the clause and contract, and consequently, that the damages for breach thereof by failure on the part of respondent in the third year of the term to deliver the quantity thus called for, must be assessed on the basis of one hundred and sixty\u2011five tons, less the quantity delivered in that year.\nWhy one hundred and sixty-five tons instead of one hundred and thirty-five tons should be taken as such basis would be puzzling but for the fact that the parties concerned had some discussion in a friendly way in anticipation of the breach, and respondent then proposed to add 10% to the approximate amount named in the contract.\nEven so, I submit with great respect, such an estimate of the approximate amount might as well have been put at 10% below as 10% above that.\nHowever, in my view of what the parties were contending for, which I am about to state, this new suggestion of mine is only to illustrate how far apart it was possible for the parties to have been in making such an elastic contract.\nIt seems to me quite clear that the approximate amount of one hundred and fifty tons a year was, in the minds of those concerned, nothing but an estimate of the possibilities and that the actual goods the appellant was contracting to buy and the respondent contracting to supply, was the paper required for use, in the publication of the newspaper published by appellant in Kingston, during each year of the currency of the contract, and that was intended by both parties to be the whole of the appellant purchaser\u2019s requirements for said purposes.\nThe actual requirements for the purpose so specified doubtless would be found in the result reduced to an absolute certainty, yet must in the course of business events necessarily be given some flexible meaning to which business common sense would have to be applied to avoid quarrelling over details in the last year of the currency of the contract.\nNo one on either side of such a contract would expect a definite stock-taking at the beginning or ending of such a term as contracted for. Hence they had to make reasonable allowances in estimates of requirements in giving and supplying the last order under the contract.\nAnd in approaching the making of such a contract to the due execution of which reasonable conduct and fair dealing must be applied, it was quite natural they should begin by a guess of what was the possible or probable quantity to be needed.\nI can easily see how such a form of a long contract such as before us grew, and bit by bit was amended in accordance with past experience not only in relation to appellant\u2019s business but that of very many others carrying on the business of newspaper publishing.\nIn doing so the important clause now in question seems to have become rather ambiguous. Yet I have no manner of doubt that if the appellant had improperly undertaken a re-selling of the goods so supplied, to the detriment of the respondent, the latter could have had the doing so restrained; or that if the appellant had improperly bought any part of its requirements elsewhere than from respondent, the latter could, and no doubt would have claimed damages for such a breach, and that the basis for the measure thereof must necessarily in such case have been the quantity of the requirements of appellant having due regard to what I have adverted to above as to reasonable allowance in the possibly final orders for the year.\nIn such an action for damages the court or jury trying it would be bound to consider, if having any regard to the intention of the parties, what was the probable amount of the paper necessary to supply the requirements of the appellant in its specified business.\nThe jury in such a case would be asked to consider what was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.\nAnd the true basis therefor would not, I submit, be the estimate or guess of what was presented as the approximate quantity when coupled up with something much more specific as herein, but that which would, in a business way, as result of experience, be quite capable of being demonstrated to be a substantially larger quantity than the original guess.\nI submit this test of the realities in order to get away from what seems to me rather an illusory way of selecting arbitrarily some words of a contract and discarding others, and forgetting to realize what the parties actually were trying to do by means of the contract they were framing. In other words, the subject matter of the contract was not the estimated, but the actual requirements of a specified business. The contract certainly is ambiguous and in all such cases the acts, conduct and course of dealing of the parties before and at the time they entered into it, may be looked at in order to ascertain what they had in contemplation and what they did immediately after in pursuance thereof.\nIt is clear that the experience of the three years\u2019 contract which preceded this one demonstrated that a hundred and fifty tons was far below the probable requirements yet the parties acted in dealing with each other on the basis I suggest and for the first two years of this contract, acted on same basis.\nThe appellant\u2019s business seemed to be growing and that was mutually advantageous until an unfortunate condition of affairs arose in the third year of the contract which rendered it otherwise for respondent.\nNeither was to blame for the unexpected condition in question, nor could it excuse the breach of contract.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed; the judgments of the courts below reversed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the damages be assessed on the basis of the quantity required for the appellant\u2019s business specified in the contract, and that alone.\nIf the parties cannot agree of course a reference must determine the amount.\nI suspect it can be determined between themselves as matter of business better than any referee can do it.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur in the view expressed by Mr. Justice Ferguson with which Mr. Justice Masten agreed. My reasons for this conclusion are quite sufficiently stated in the judgment of Ferguson J. and consequently it is unnecessary to do more than summarize them in a sentence or two.\nThe phrase \u201cbeing the whole of the purchaser\u2019s requirements\u201d and the word \u201capproximately\u201d must be construed by reference to one another and by reference to the fact explicitly stated in the contract that the purchase is a purchase of paper for a particular use. I think the more reasonable construction is that which treats the first mentioned phrase as the governing one and the quantity named as an estimate only.\nI think also that the contract being one which is susceptible of more than one necessarily exclusive meaning, the course of dealing between the parties prior to the contract as well as the course of dealing under the contract itself are relevant facts for the purpose of deciding what is the right construction. I concur with Mr. Justice Ferguson in the opinion that the fact proved by the invoices that shipments were made and expressed to be made under this very contract in the years 1916 and 1917 in excess of 150 tons, is an important and weighty fact pointing to the conclusion to which the learned judge arrived.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Middleton[3], and by the Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division and Mr. Justice Riddell[4].\nThe contract to be construed expressly provides that it \u201cis to be read and interpreted as made at * * * the City of Hull, Quebec.\u201d But, as was determined in McConnel v. Murphy[5], cited by Mr. Robinson, the governing principle in Quebec as in the provinces where the English common law prevails\nmust be to ascertain the intention of the parties through the words they have used. This principle is one of universal application.\nTheir Lordships proceed to point out that there is no technical or artificial rule in the law of Quebec which bears upon the construction of a mercantile contract such as that before us.\nThe question is really as to the meaning of language and that must be the same everywhere.\nSee, however, Art. 1019 C.C.\nThe contract was in my opinion absolute for the sale of\none hundred and fifty tons (150 tons) approximately of paper per year.\nI read \u201capproximately\u201d as the equivalent of \u201cabout\u201d and regard it as having been inserted\nonly for providing against accidental variations arising from slight and unimportant excesses or deficiencies.\nBrawley v. United States[6].\nThis qualifying word is not\nsupplemented by other stipulations or conditions which (might) give it a broader scope or more exclusive significancy\nas the words \u201cmore or less\u201d were in Brawley\u2019s contract.\nThe words immediately succeeding\u2014\nor at that proportionate rate for any shorter broken period covered by this contract further indicate that a quantitative definition of the subject matter was uppermost in the minds of the parties. What that subject matter was to be having been thus defined, it seems to me that proper and adequate effect is given to the words \u201c(being the whole of the purchasers\u2019 requirements)\u201d by treating them as a statement of expectation. The converse case was thus dealt with by Mr. Justice Atkin in In re Harrison and Micks, Lambert & Co.[7], approved by the Court of Appeal in Tibbits Brothers v. Smith[8]. No case has been cited\u2014no doubt because none can be founds\u2014where a contractual provision for the sale of a defined quantity of goods has been held to be overridden by a subsequent ex facie parenthetical clause such as that now under consideration. The words \u201c(being the whole of the purchaser\u2019s requirements)\u201d, as Sir Wm. Mulock says\ndo not form any controlling part of the contract but are merely an intimation as to the purchaser\u2019s expected requirements.\nThe English authorities relied on by the appellant, which with others are collected in 25 Hals. Laws of England, page 214, note (f) to paragraph No. 366 and the 1920 supplement at page 1365, are all cases in which the statement as to quantity was obviously introduced merely as an estimate, the contracts having provided for the sale of a particular lot of goods specified by description or otherwise designated. Bourne v. Seymour[9], cited by Mr. Justice Riddell, is certainly more closely in point than any of them and is about as helpful as a decision on the construction of one contract can well be on that of another not drawn in identical terms. The problem is purely one of construction\u2014to ascertain what are the governing words in the document before us which determine the subject matter of the contract. Those words, in my opinion, are\none hundred and fifty tons (150 tons) approximately, of paper per year.\nThe construction for which the appellant contends, on the other hand, gives no effect to this specification of the quantity of the subject matter.\nThe ambiguity or uncertainty necessary to justify resort to evidence of conduct to assist in ascertaining the intention of the parties, in my opinion is not found in this contract.\nI agree with the learned trial judge and the Appellate Divisional Court that \u201ceach year stands by itself\u201d\u2013that the contract is not for 450 tons to be delivered during a three year period but for one hundred and fifty tons a year.\nMr. Robinson\u2019s assent to the contention that the basis for computing the damages should be an obligation to supply 150 tons instead of 165 tons for the year 1918 involves a reduction of the amount awarded by the sum of $249.42 as I make the computation. I would dismiss the defendants\u2019 cross-appeal as well as the main appeal\u2014both with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this case is whether the defendant company agreed to supply all the paper required for the publication of the two newspapers of the appellant company or simply the approximate quantity of 150 tons a year.\nIt seems to me that if the parties intended that all the requirements of the newspapers should be provided for by the respondent company the contract would have been drafted in a different way. Instead of stipulating that the Eddy Company would sell approximately 150 tons of paper and then adding within parentheses (being the whole of the purchaser\u2019s requirements) if the parties had put the latter words at first and stated that the Eddy Company would supply the whole quantity of paper required for the publication of the newspapers in question with the addition after that of the words \u201cabout 150 tons\u201d it would not have altered the exact meaning of the agreement and of the extent of the obligation. It would have meant that the supply of all the paper required for the publication of these two papers should be made by the vendor.\nIt should not be forgotten also that this contract is on a printed form. The words in parentheses which the appellant seeks to be the ruling words of the agreement are printed and the words \u201c150 tons\u201d are typewritten.\nWhere there are formal and general words which are the usual terms used in a contract and there are other special and peculiar words, and the question is which are to have most weight, the terms that a man has thought of for himself and written into the contract, if they conflict and cannot be reconciled with the printed words, ought to have most weight. Desrosiers v. Lamb[10].\nBesides, I cannot read this contract as meaning by its own expressions a right on the part of the purchaser to get from his vendor all the paper he required for his newspapers because he simply stipulated that 150 tons was all the purchaser\u2019s requirements, remaining free to purchase elsewhere if he wanted a larger quantity at a better price. As to the cross-appeal, I would dismiss it. The defendant company has no right under the contract to apply to the last year the surplus quantity which it delivered in the previous year. Each year stood by itself.\nThe appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This case should be dealt with on no higher basis than as involving the construction of quite a usual form of contract. It is noticeable that the contract says:\nThis contract is to be read and interpreted as made at the Head Office of the company at the City of Hull.\nTherefore the question of its construction falls to be determined in this case according to Quebec law, of which, although it was not proved as a fact before the courts below, this court is bound to take judicial notice: Logan v. Lee[11]; John Morrow Screw & Nut Co. v. Hankin[12].\nThe portion of the contract in respect of which the dispute has arisen is the following:\u2014\n1. The Company agree to sell, and the purchasers to purchase during the period commencing on the first day of January, A.D 1916, and ending on the thirty-first day of December, A.D. 1918, for use in the publication of \u201cThe British Whig\u201d newspaper or newspapers published in the City of Kingston, Ont., one hundred and fifty (150) tons approximately of paper per year, or at that proportionate rate for any shorter broken period covered by this contract, (being the whole of the purchasers\u2019 requirements), on the following terms and conditions:\u2014\nDoes this mean that the purchaser is entitled to a quantity of paper sufficient in each year to satisfy its requirements irrespective of the quantity mentioned, or does it signify that this quantity alone, whether or not it satisfies these requirements, is to be delivered under the contract? This is the whole question to be decided, and in order to solve it the parties have made a diligent search in the books for similar cases and perhaps naturally, because the case was brought before the Ontario courts, they refer us to English or Canadian decisions exclusively. I think, however, that in a matter of this kind, where the only inquiry is as to the meaning of a contract, decided cases, unless they interpret an absolutely identical clause, are of very little assistance. In all such cases, the paramount rule is to give effect to the intention of the parties and as to this intention the language of the contract, and if it be ambiguous the course of dealing of the parties, are the best guides.\nThe Quebec Civil Code (Arts. 1013 et seq.) has laid down, for the interpretation of contracts, certain general rules which it will be useful to follow in this case.\nThus when a clause is susceptible of two meanings, it must be understood in that in which it may have some effect rather than in that in which it can produce none (Art. 1014).\nAll the clauses of a contract are interpreted the one by the other, giving to each the meaning derived from the entire Act (Art. 1018).\nIn cases of doubt, the contract is interpreted against him who has stipulated and in favour of him who has contracted the obligation (Art. 1019).\nHowever general the terms may be in which a contract is expressed, they extend only to the things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract (Art. 1020).\nApplying these rules, the obligation to sell paper was contracted by the respondent, so the clause in question, if it be of doubtful meaning, should be construed in favour of the respondent. Care must be taken however to so interpret the contract that effect may be given to all its terms.\nSuch evidence as there is here is not of much assistance. The contract is on a printed form furnished by the respondent. The blanks were filled in by means of a typewriter. Thus the words \u201cone hundred and fifty (150)\u201d are typed. The remainder of clause 1 is printed, including, of course, the parenthetical phrase. Before this contract the parties had entered into other similar contracts specifying also 150 tons, but notwithstanding this specification, the respondent, without objection, furnished quantities in excess of 150 tons per year. Similarly, during 1916 and 1917, the respondent, without objection, supplied paper as ordered and in excess of 150 tons. It is true that, in this action, it seeks to have this excess credited to 1918, but as to that it is clearly wrong. The whole difficulty comes from the fact that the price of paper rose sharply in 1918 and the respondent claimed that if it were bound to furnish up to the requirements of the appellant in that year it could only do so at a loss.\nPrima facie I would say that the sale here is of a specified quantity of paper, to wit 150 tons \u201capproximately,\u201d the latter word having the meaning of \u201cmore or less.\u201d The difficulty, however, is to give some effect to the words \u201cbeing the whole of the purchaser\u2019s requirements.\u201d To say that the respondent contracted to sell paper to the extent of the appellant\u2019s requirements, whatever they might be, would deprive of any useful effect the specification of 150 tons. A more natural meaning can be given to the parenthetical phrase, without rendering this specification meaningless, by saying that it was a representation by the appellant that the whole of its requirements would be 150 tons approximately, and that is the way the contract reads. The respondent may conceivably have had good reasons for insisting that the specification of a quantity should be accompanied by a representation that the quantity specified was the whole of the purchaser\u2019s requirements. At all events, while we cannot disregard these words, if they can be given a natural meaning by taking them as a representation or estimate of the purchaser\u2019s requirements, I would not hesitate to do so, the more so that if I adopt the appellant\u2019s construction, I would deprive of any useful effect the specification of the quantity.\nThe course of dealing of the parties may of course be taken into consideration, if a contract be ambiguous, but it can be here explained by the fact that the price of paper had not appreciably varied at the time when the excess deliveries were made.\nOn the whole I have come to the conclusion not to disturb the judgment below and this involves dismissing both the main and the cross-appeal.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cunningham & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Powell, Snowdon & Bishop.\n[1] 19 Ont.

L.R. 428) Davies C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that the liability of the insurer only attached in the case of loss or injury from one of the specified causes, stranding, sinking, etc., and did not extend to the case where the automobile was damaged by falling into the water between the end of a ferry-boat and the wharf.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment on the trial[2], in favour of the appellant. The main question raised on this appeal is the construction of the condition of the policy set out in the head-note. The appellant claims that its liability was limited to loss from the causes specified in that condition. The respondent that there was a general liability including a liability in special cases. There is a subsidiary question as to the power of the adjuster sent to settle the loss to bind the company by directing that the automobile be repaired and the salvage expenses ascertained.\nHeighington K.C. for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing a judgment of the trial judge (who had dismissed the action) and holding that the plaintiff respondent was entitled to recover from the appellant herein $1,781.47 on his policy of insurance covering his automobile.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division was delivered by Mr. Justice Masten speaking for the whole court.\nThe circumstances under which the loss was sustained are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Orde, the trial judge, and need not here be repeated.\nThe question to be determined in this appeal is whether the loss is or is not covered by the terms of the policy of insurance.\nI may say that I agree generally with the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Masten for holding that this question should be answered in the affirmative.\nThis question must be determined under the opening words of the policy which are as follows:\u2014 Automobile.\nIn consideration of twenty-eight and five cents dollars ($28.05) premium and the declaration of the insured, it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy is intended to cover the insured to an amount not exceeding seventeen hundred dollars ($1,700.00) on the body, machinery and equipment, while within the limits of the Dominion of Canada and the United States (exclusive of Alaska, the Hawaiian Islands and Porto Rico) including while in building, on road, on railroad car, or other conveyance, ferry or inland steamer, or coastwise steamer between ports within the said limits, subject to the conditions before mentioned and as follows:\n(A) Fire, arising from any cause whatsoever and lightning.\n(B) While being transported in any conveyance by land or water\u2014stranding, sinking, collision, burning or derailment of such conveyance including the general average and salvage charges for which the insured is legally liable.\nIt appears to me that the answer to the question of defendant appellant\u2019s liability turns upon the proper construction of condition \u201c(B)\u201d. Does this condition mean that defendant\u2019s liability, by the insertion after the dash (\u2014) of the words \u201cstranding, sinking, collision, burning or derailment of such conveyance,\u201d is strictly limited to damages caused by one or more of these specified facts of \u201cstranding, etc.,\u201d or are they stated merely as examples of that liability? In other language do these words following the dash (\u2014) mean including damages caused by \u201cstranding, etc.,\u201d or must they be read as defining and limiting the company\u2019s liability to accidents arising from any of these facts.\nI think these causes of possible damage explicitly enumerated are only given as examples of the company\u2019s liability, but do not exclude other causes, and that the fair and reasonable way of construing the clause is to read in after the dash (\u2014) the word \u201cincluding\u201d or the words \u201csuch as,\u201d but not the words \u201cbut only in case of\u201d or \u201cor only if caused by\u201d as contended by the company. At the very worst these words seem to be ambiguous and should therefore, in case of doubt as to their meaning, be construed against the company if capable of such construction.\nFor the reasons, therefore, stated by Mr. Justice Masten in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division, and the additional reason above stated by me, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge, and turns only upon the construction of an insurance policy issued by appellant to respondent covering risks of loss by the latter arising from his ownership of an automobile.\nI agree with the reasoning of the said court of appeal unless in the minor suggestion therein that the contract prepared by the appellant is not ambiguous. I find it so ambiguous that we are entitled to construe it most strongly against appellant.\nAnd if we do so there is ample ground for holding that if the company ever intended to limit its liability in the way contended for on its behalf its limitation thereof should have been so expressed as to take it clearly out of the risk its general terms had clearly expressed.\nThis it clearly did not do and therefore is bound by the general terms used.\nIt rather clearly intended to extend its liability to contribute to general average marine terms used.\nThe appellants\u2019 factum appeals to our general knowledge of such a subject. My limited share of such general knowledge clearly shews that such an ambiguously worded contract is not universal and that some other companies do not use such ambiguous language. Indeed it looks rather like a trap for the unwary compared with what I know.\nI conclude that the general comprehensive terms of the contract cover just such a loss as in question and that the pretended limitation does not effectively except the loss in question therefrom.\nThere is another ground of appeal claimed and that is from the exercise of discretion on the part of the courts below which clearly falls within those questions of practice and procedure with which this court has uniformly refused to interfere.\nA point was taken by counsel for the respondent that the acts of the adjuster for appellant were such and so reasonably relied upon by respondent that appellant cannot now be heard to set up its present pretensions.\nI am unable to take that view but the extent to which the adjuster, presumably well acquainted with his business and the facts he had to deal with, went shewed that those directing him certainly never imagined the policy was so limited and restricted as now contended for but acted upon the construction which has been upheld by the Appellate Division.\nIt is illuminating to find that the appellant never considered its contract otherwise than as the Appellate Division finds it.\nIt certainly is the view which any one presented with such a contract would take of his rights if acting thereon.\nBeyond that I do not think the contention of respondent arising out of that incident is of any value.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. DUFF J.\u2014I find myself unable to accept the view of the court below as to the construction of this policy. I concur in the view of the trial judge and mainly for his reasons. There is not, I think, any satisfactory evidence of authority reposed in the adjuster to enter into a contract to pay and it appears to me to be more than doubtful whether the facts relied upon establish a contract even assuming such authority. As to the construction of the policy, with great respect to the court below, I confess I am unable to read sub-paragraph B otherwise than as describing the conditions out of which liability is to arise when the automobile is in course of transport \u201cin any conveyance by land or water.\u201d These conditions include and are limited to \u201cstranding, sinking, collision, burning or derailment\u201d and it is undeniable that on this construction the respondent must fail. The word \u201cextended\u201d which was the subject of some discussion during the course of the argument is no doubt used in a not uncommon sense of the word \u201cextend\u201d \u2014to \u201cwrite out (in legal instruments) in proper form.\u201d Oxford Dict.\nANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Orde in giving judgment dismissing this action after the trial I am of the opinion that the cause of loss sustained by the plaintiff was not within the risk covered by the insurance policy which he held with the defendant company. While the restriction upon the risk assumed during transit certainly might have been better expressed, it is stated in terms which I think admit of no doubt and seem sufficiently clear to preclude misunderstanding of its scope by an ordinary person taking insurance. The form of policy is one intended for general use to cover risks of many different kinds. The nature and the extent of the risk under each individual policy is intended to be defined by an indorsement or indorsements attached to it. The policy on its face says so. The insurance is expressed to be\nas respects loss * * * covered by indorsement or indorsements attached hereto.\nthrough\nfire, theft and transit * * * while in building, on road, or railroad car or other conveyance, ferry or inland steamer, subject * * *as follows:\n* * *\n(B) While being transported in any conveyance by land or water\u2014stranding, sinking, collision, burning or derailment of such conveyance, including general average and salvage charges for which the insured is legally liable.\nIf every case of loss during transit was meant to be covered, the first phrase of (B), just quoted, would have been left unqualified. The only possible office of the words following the dash is to restrict this otherwise general risk by particularizing and defining what the insurer means shall be the limitation of its responsibility. I am, with great respect, unable to accept the construction put upon this clause in the Appellate Division.\nIn the absence of any proof that the insured was misled, or that he did not get precisely the insurance for which he bargained and paid, I can see no ground for extending the company\u2019s responsibility beyond the limits which the policy, in my opinion, evidences its intention to set.\nNor do I find anything in what the adjuster Marsh did that should estop the defendant from raising the defence that the plaintiff\u2019s loss was not covered by his policy. In the absence of express authority enabling an employee such as Marsh was to commit the company to a liability not covered by its policy I cannot conceive that it is within the scope of his powers to do so. Atlas Assurance Co. v. Brownell[3]; Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Margeson[4]. There is nothing to shew that any such authority was in fact given to Marsh. Nor does it appear that any action was taken by the company\u2019s directors or executive officers or by any general agent representing them after the circumstances of the loss were known at all inconsistent with their present defence. The policy expressly provides that no acts or proceedings of the company relating to appraisal or any examination shall operate as a waiver of any provision or condition of the policy. Marsh\u2019s duties as I view them, were confined to investigating and appraising the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s loss. The company when apprised of all the material circumstances appears promptly to have repudiated liability and advised the insured that it would be useless for him to put in proofs of loss.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nMIGNAULT J. concurs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kerr, McNevin & Kerr.\n[1] 48 Ont.

Bickell and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1921: November 4; 1921: December 9.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nBroker\u2014Speculation in foreign stocks\u2014Adverse rate of exchange\u2014Dealing in margins\u2014Profit to customer\u2014Right to exchange profit.\nIn the absence of any agreement to the contrary, or of a custom of the stock market of which he is, or is presumed to be, aware, the customer of a Canadian broker who buys and sells for him, through an agent in New York, United States stocks on margin is entitled to have his profits paid in American currency and so get the benefit of the adverse rate of exchange between the two countries.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment on the trial in favour of the appellant.\nIn Jan. 1918, the appellant employed Bickell & Co., Toronto brokers, to buy and sell stocks for him on margin. He dealt only in United States securities and carried on transactions for two years through the agents of Bickell & Co. in New York. At the end of that time he ceased operating and his account showed a balance in his favour of some $80,000 which he claimed should be paid in United States currency, the rate of exchange being then 17 per cent. against Canada. The claim was refused and the balance was paid, his right to claim the further sum being reserved and he brought action for the amount. Slaght K.C. for the appellant, referred to Robertson v. Mollett[1], at page 829.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The question involved in this action is the right of the defendant firm of brokers carrying on business in Toronto, and in New York through their agents there, to discharge itself from liability to the plaintiff who had engaged the firm\u2019s services in the purchase and sale of stocks in New York by paying him, when their dealings ended, the balance due to him in Canadian funds without any allowance for exchange upon the admitted balance upon New York where the transactions all took place.\nThe dealings between the parties were those of principal and agent requiring full accounting and were not in any sense those of vendor and purchaser which might give rise to the presumption of local currency being contemplated by the parties in the discharge of the agent\u2019s accountability.\nI cannot think, therefore, that it would be possible for the broker\u2019s company, in the absence of any special agreement permitting it to do so, to reserve to itself and to withold from its customer the plaintiff the premiums of exchange upon New York upon the admitted balance due such customer. The benefit of such exchange it seems to me legally belonged to the broker\u2019s principals and should not, on any principle I know of, be retained by the brokers or agents in addition to their ordinary charges.\nThe learned trial judge so found and awarded the plaintiff the sum of $10,103.35. There is no dispute about the correctness of the amount allowed if the right of the plaintiff to be paid in the equivalent of American currency on the balance due him is correct.\nThe Appellate Division by a majority of three to two allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario with whom Maclaren J. concurred, seems to have based his judgment upon what he held to be \u201cnot an unfair inference\u201d under the facts as proved, that the plaintiff, the now appellant, had acquiesced in foregoing his claim to exchange as to the transactions before July 1919, in consideration of his broker\u2019s promise to allow the premiums in regard to future transactions.\nI am quite unable to draw or to accept any such inference or acquiescence, or that any such compromise ever was reached between the parties. The learned justice of appeal, Hodgins, who concurred in allowing the appeal and dismissing the action did so, however, upon an entirely distinct ground of an agreement or arrangement between the defendants and their New York agents, to which he assumed the plaintiff was a party and bound by, under which\nCanadian speculators might deal in New York market in stocks on margin under circumstances which would obviate the necessity of their remitting money between Toronto and New York or vice versa.\n* * *\nThat method consisted in the maintaining by Miller and Co. of a deposit in the Standard Bank in Toronto consisting of a large amount of money. The results of the purchases and sale of stock in New York were communicated by Miller and Co. to the appellants, who were then authorized by Miller and Co. to draw for the benefit of their clients upon the funds in the Standard Bank, paying in this way their Canadian customers any profits that had been made in trade in New York. This also involved the advantage of enabling buying and selling to be done by clients in Toronto upon the credits of the appellants in New York and not upon their own individual credit, and also upon the basis of Canadian dollars, any losses being charged to the appellants. When this arrangement was made, apparently the difference in exchange was nil or trifling. It is said to have been 1 per cent. when the respondent\u2019s transactions began.\nI am quite unable to see how a private arrangement made between the Toronto brokers and the defendants and their New York agents, Miller & Co., can be invoked to prejudice the plaintiff in his dealings with the brokers in Toronto unless indeed there was proof of his knowledge of such an agreement and acquiescence in it. Of such proof, however, I found none and in its absence I cannot see how the private agreement between the Toronto brokers and their New York agents could affect plaintiff\u2019s rights in his dealings with his agents or brokers in Toronto.\nI am in full accord with the dissenting judgments of Magee and Ferguson JJ. and for the reasons given by them which to me are perfectly satisfactory and convincing I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of Middleton J., the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of whether or not a man employing a Toronto broker to operate for him in New York and make such investments there as the investor may from time to time direct to be made, is entitled to demand and receive in New York the net profits made therefrom less usual commission the broker is entitled to.\nThe learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Middleton, held that the appellant having been a very successful investor in that way was entitled to recover from the respondents, who were his brokers, acting through New York agents, his full measure of profits and to a New York cheque therefor, if payment to be made by cheque, and could not be deprived of his exact measure of profits in New York where earned and held when the account was closed.\nThe respondents tried to substitute for the New York cheque or draft, to which the appellant was entitled, a cheque on a Canadian bank nominally for the same sum but leaving over ten thousand dollars of said profits in the hands of respondents\u2019 New York agents.\nRespondents tried an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario and were successful in obtaining by a majority of three to two a reversal of the learned trial judge\u2019s judgment. Hence this appeal here.\nI am so clearly of the opinion that the learned trial judge was, upon his finding of facts, right in his law that I fear to prolong the discussion lest I add to the confusion of thought.\nYet I may say that the appellant, a stranger at the time to the respondents, opened his operations by expressly directing an investment to be got in New York and giving a three thousand dollar cheque by way of security for the venture.\nBecause that cheque was on a Canadian bank, though not a word passed as to the rate of exchange or cost of cashing the cheque or its proceeds in New York, it is contended that the basis was in law thus laid for returning it, and the profits of many dealings with which it had only a remote connection, in depreciated Canadian paper currency and justifying the retention of ten thousand dollars of legitimate profits lying in the hands of respondents\u2019 New York agents. I cannot assent to any such proposition as being based on law.\nI can conceive of such a system as the respondents and their New York agents adopted being the basis of a contract with clients when adopted by them, or any of them choosing to be bound by the operations of such terms of agency.\nBut any such exceptional system would not bind their clients unless clearly brought home to the minds of such as retained them, and their assent, either expressly or impliedly, got thereto.\nSo far from that being the case herein it is exceedingly doubtful from the evidence when this system was first adopted by the respondents, and clearly never had been brought home to the mind of appellant until July, 1919, when first set up to him.\nAs to the question of fact resting thereon I am bound by the judgment of the learned trial judge unless I can find some substantial fact entitling me to rest a dissenting conclusion upon, which I confess I cannot.\nIndeed I am, after a perusal of the evidence of the witnesses for respondents thus brought in question, decidedly of the opinion that the learned trial judge correctly appreciated the value thereof.\nBut for that finding, and my concurrence therein, I might be bound to accept and act upon another appreciation of the facts so far as bearing upon the later transactions.\nThe result is that in my view of the facts throughout there never existed any basis for the pretensions of the respondents to appropriate the profits of the appellant, or any part thereof, to meet the risks incidental to the operation of its peculiar system. It is stated in argument that many Toronto brokers acted upon the same system but proof thereof is very scant and, as a universal well-known custom of the market binding on all dealing therein, is very far from being proven.\nAnd when we turn from the abstract to the concrete there is an illustration given in the offer through other agents to claim specific delivery in New York of the securities in question therein refused by the respondents and its agents which I assume was intended as a means of testing the actual contentions of the respondents.\nThat refusal was unjustifiable. Indeed it is attempted to be met by an explanation which may be correct that the refusal was the result of a mistake.\nBut if respondents\u2019 contentions be correct there was no need for such an explanation for it was part of its rights flowing from the contention set up, if well founded, that any return of New York profits must be answered only by a return of Canadian paper currency, nominally of the same number of dollars as held in New York agents\u2019 hands.\nIn line with such a mode of thought it is rather curious to find in respondents\u2019 factum reliance placed upon sub-section 3 of section 15 of the Currency Act, 9-10 Edw. VII., Canada, dealing with the coinage in circulation in Canada.\nIf this had been taken as the basis of what is in question instead of the depreciated paper currency we might have found something to rest upon for another view than I take.\nIf the depreciated nominal value of a dollar had been in fact the converse of what it is and very acutely so at the time in question in favour of Canada as against that in New York, I suspect the respondent would stoutly have resisted what it now contends for herein, as being most unjust and quite properly so.\nIn other words if the American dollar had been worth only seventeen per cent. less than the Canadian in paper currency and the present appellant had demanded profits based on such a depreciated American dollar and demanded such Canadian dollars worth so much more, I fancy we would have heard a very justifiable outcry against such an unreasonable demand, even if the business had begun as this is said to have begun.\nI think this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs here and below.\nDUFF J.\u2014Prima facie the appellant is entitled to call upon his agents, the respondents, to account for all profits arising through the employment of funds placed by him in their hands for the purpose of trading in shares on his account. This presumptive right of the appellant could only be displaced by proving either an agreement to the contrary or a custom governing the relations of the parties and modifying that presumptive right.\nExpress agreement to the contrary was negatived by the learned trial judge and that hypothesis may be discarded. The facts from which we are asked to infer such an agreement by conduct are, in my opinion, altogether too meagre to support that conclusion. As to custom I agree with Ferguson J. that a custom such as that relied upon as between brokers in Toronto and New York, assuming it proved, could not affect the appellant\u2019s right unless at least he had knowledge of it and this is not asserted. ANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge and by Magee and Ferguson JJ.A. in the Appellate Divisional Court I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton restored.\nThe relationship of the parties\u2014that of broker and client\u2014prima facie entitles the plaintiff to recover the moneys for which he sues. The broker cannot profit from his client\u2019s transactions beyond the usual brokerage commission unless he establishes some special agreement, express or implied, or some custom of the market on which he is employed to deal for the client, so well defined and established that the latter may properly be taken to have contracted subject to it, which entitles him to whatever additional gain he claims. The evidence in this record, in my opinion, does not establish anything of the kind.\nThe admitted balance of over $62,000 standing to the plaintiff\u2019s credit in February, 1920, when his account with the defendant was closed, was the outcome of transactions on the New York market in American stocks. The plaintiff\u2019s profits were all earned in New York and were received there by the defendants\u2019 correspondents in United States currency. No reason has been shown why he should not receive the full benefit of the moneys thus obtained on his behalf.\nThe evidence credited by the learned trial judge\u2014and in my opinion the more credible\u2014is that if Barthelmes wished at any time during the period of his dealings with the defendants to obtain delivery of shares in which he was \u201clong\u201d he would have been required to pay for them in United States funds. Why should he be denied the corresponding right of being paid on the same basis? The matter in issue has been so fully discussed however in the judgments in which I have already expressed my concurrence that I cannot usefully add to them.\nThe only circumstance in evidence that would seem to be at all inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that although he made his original deposit of $3,000 with the defendants in Canadian funds he was given credit for that entire amount in the first account rendered by them to him of the transactions carried on in his behalf on the New York market. The New York discount on Canadian funds at that time is said to have been one per cent. It is quite possible, however, that the defendants were willing to waive their right to debit the plaintiff with the amount of this comparatively small discount, $30.00, in order to secure his custom. Indeed I am not at all certain that at that time the difference in exchange was not generally ignored in business transactions in Canada. I do not find in this single circumstance\u2014and there is nothing else in the evidence pointing in that direction\u2014enough to warrant the defendants asserting a right to retain exchange amounting to 17 per cent. on upwards of $62,000.00 profits made in New York on the plaintiff\u2019s account at a time when such exchange was certainly taken into account in other business transactions.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The appellant claims that he is entitled to be paid in United States money a substantial balance standing to his credit on certain purchases and sales of United States securities made for him on the New York Stock Exchange by the respondents who were his brokers in Toronto, and who, through their agents, Miller & Co., stock brokers and members of the New York Stock Exchange, purchased and sold these securities on behalf of the appellant. When the account, which had lasted some two years, was closed on February 7th, 1920, the balance to the appellant\u2019s credit was $62,445.62. The appellant contended that this sum being really United States money, he was entitled to the value of the exchange which was then 17 per cent. The respondents paid him this $62,445.62 in Canadian money under reserve of his right to claim the value of the exchange. This action was taken to recover this exchange, and the learned trial judge, Middleton J., gave the appellant judgment for $10,105.73, deducting from the appellant\u2019s balance the sum of $3,000.00 which he had paid in Canadian money as a margin when he opened his account in January, 1918. In the Appellate Division this judgment was reversed by Meredith C.J.O., and Maclaren and Hodgins JJ., and the appellant\u2019s action was dismissed, Magee and Ferguson JJ. dissenting. From the latter judgment the appellant appeals.\nThe main facts of the case were thus stated by the learned trial judge:\u2014\nThe defendants are brokers carrying on business at Toronto. In January, 1918, the plaintiff began trading with them as his brokers, in the purchase and sale of stock, the transactions being almost entirely on the New York Stock Exchange. At this time he deposited with the defendants, as security by way of margin, the sum of $3,000 Canadian currency. The trading continued until February, 1920, when the account was closed by the payment of the amount admitted to be due by the brokers and the handing over of a few shares, the only stock purchased then remaining unrealized, reserving to the plaintiff the right to put forward this claim for exchange.\nDuring this period many transactions had taken place, and the course of dealing had generally been profitable to Barthelmes, although on individual transactions he had made a loss. His $3,000 had grown to approximately $60,000.\nThe way in which the business was carried on by Bickell & Co. was that they had an arrangement with Miller and Company, of New York, to purchase and sell for them upon their instructions. An account was kept with the Standard Bank at Toronto, and when Bickell desired to make a purchase, a deposit was made to the credit of this account. On a sale being made, Miller would instruct the transfer to Bickell\u2019s credit of any balance that might be payable. No money was sent to New York for the individual purchases, and no money was sent from New York for individual sales, and it was arranged that exchange should not be payable as between Miller and Bickell with respect to any of their transactions. The amount involved would not be great because, while the volume of trade would no doubt be very large, the balance ultimately payable either by Miller to Bickell or vice versa would be comparatively small. The effect of this arrangement, however, was that the profit which might be made by one customer in respect to his individual trading would be set off against the loss payable by another, and the result would be that an arrangement, perfectly fair as between Miller and Bickell, might be exceedingly unfair as between the Toronto brokers and an individual customer. If the individual customer lost on the transaction so that money would have to be sent to New York, I can see no reason why that customer should not be called upon to pay the exchange incident to the remitting of funds to New York to pay his loss. On the other hand, if a customer made on a transaction, I can see no reason why he should not receive the New York funds, with the incidental advantage by reason of the depreciation of Canadian currency.\nIn my opinion the arrangements between the respondents and Miller & Co., which were entered into for their mutual convenience, are without effect on any rights which the appellant may have against the respondents. The evidence is that the respondents transmitted by wire the appellant\u2019s orders to Miller & Co. in New York, where they were attended to by the latter. But these orders were not ear-marked, so to say, no mention being made of any particular client, but they were sent on with others, and no doubt Miller & Co., in dealing with gains and losses, off-set the one against the other, any settlement with the respondents being of the difference one way or another in the day\u2019s trading. It is evident that with the large volume of transactions between the two firms, and the settlement of differences which of course varied from the credit to the debit side, the question of exchange was not important. No doubt also the respondents required fresh margins from unsuccessful customers, but naturally did not demand any margin outside of the original one from those who, like the appellant, were fortunate in their speculations. If the transactions in question were real ones they were merged into a large number of other transactions, the respondents of course keeping track of those effected by each of their customers. Miller & Co. made the purchases and sales on the stock market in New York and used the stock certificates, all the purchases being on margin, to finance the transactions with their bankers.\nNo special bargain was entered into between these parties when the account was opened, and the appellant, when he made the first purchase of one hundred shares of United States Steel, paid the respondent $3,000.00 in Canadian money as margin. In July, 1919, there was some conversation between the appellant and Mr. Cashman, one of the respondents, the appellant claiming that he was entitled to the value of the exchange, which Mr. Cashman disputed, but apparently he offered to allow exchange on future transactions, if the account was closed and a new one opened, and if the appellant accepted his then balance, some $40,000.00, in Canadian funds, which he refused to do. The learned trial judge found that this conversation was followed by a continuance of trading without any change in the rights of the parties, the delay being a mere truce and not an abandoning of any right.\nThe evidence would have been much more complete and satisfactory if the testimony of the member of the firm of Miller & Co., with whom the respondents dealt had been obtained. As the record stands, the different transactions entered into and which involve a very large amount, are shewn by the monthly statements, seventeen in number, which were produced at the trial. When the account opened, New York exchange was only 1 per cent. On December 1st, 1919, it was 4\u00be per cent and it rapidly increased so that, when the account was closed, it stood at 17 per cent. By reason of this rapid rise, the arrangement between the respondents and Miller & Co. was cancelled early in January, 1920, and subsequently exchange was exacted on money sent to New York. Whether or not the appellant was aware of this new arrangement is one of the facts in dispute.\nGenerally, the course of dealing between the appellant and the respondents, as demonstrated by the monthly statements, shewed an apparent adverse balance against the former. But inasmuch as the appellant was \u201clong\u201d as to a considerable amount of securities which stood to his credit in the respondents\u2019 or their New York agents\u2019 hands, but on which a margin only had been paid, the sale of these securities at the market price then prevailing would change this adverse balance into a substantial profit. Or the appellant could, if he preferred, say at the end of any month, pay the balance due on the purchase price of these securities\u2014that is to say the adverse balance mentioned in the monthly statement\u2014and demand delivery of the stock certificates. Whether he would be required to pay this adverse balance in Canadian or United States funds is a point on which Mr. Cashman made two diametrically opposed statements. The learned trial judge preferred Mr. Cashman\u2019s first answer to the plain question put to him, that the payment of the balance of the purchase price would have to be made in New York funds. It is hard to believe that any sane broker would have accepted Canadian money at par to be sent to New York. If he had done so, he would have been obliged to make up himself the amount of exchange, for obviously New York money would have to be provided. What had already been paid, to wit the margin furnished, came out of moneys which the appellant had to his credit in New York, for otherwise he would have been called upon to supply the necessary margin, which never happened after he had furnished the initial margin of $3,000.00.\nIt is not necessary to examine the monthly statements in detail, and it will suffice to consider the two last ones. Looking at the statement for December, 1919, it begins by an apparent adverse balance carried over from November of $168,330.94, which, with a charge of $932.86 for interest, made the debit amount on December 31st, $169,263.80. On the credit side is the sum of $60,367.50, sale price of five hundred shares of U.S. Rubber at 121, so that the apparent net adverse balance for the month was $108,896.30. However, the appellant was \u201clong\u201d on 1,200 shares of rubber, 100 shares of U.S. Steel, and the amount of $250.00 in liberty bonds. Of course, the apparent adverse balance would be more than wiped out by the sale of these securities as shewn by the statement for January, when they were all sold with the exception of the liberty bonds. Or, if the appellant had desired, on December 31st, to take delivery of these securities, the balance payable in New York, in New York funds, I take it, would be the above adverse balance of $108,896.30.\nExamining now the statement for January, 1920, we find the appellant charged with the purchase of 100 shares of rubber at 125 and 100 shares of the same stock at 124, to wit $12,530.00 and $12,422.50. These sums, with the adverse balance of $108,896.30 from December, make the total sum of $133,848.80 on the debit side. During January the appellant sold 1,400 shares of rubber and 100 shares of steel, the sale price of which, with a dividend of $125.00 on his steel stock, netted him the total sum of $200,997.50, so that, after wiping out the amount standing to his debit, the appellant had a balance in his favour of $67,148.70, and was \u201clong\u201d with $250.00 in liberty bonds.\nThe appellant closed his account on February 7th, 1920. He had purchased, on February 3rd, 400 shares of steel and 100 shares of rubber. These he sold, on February 6th, at a loss, so that, as he was charged a New York premium of $623.08 on $3,748.00, his net loss, there was, on the debit side, $54,893.08, and, on the credit side, with $72.50 for adjustments for September, the sum of $117,338.70, leaving a balance in his favour of $62,445.62, which the respondents paid him in Canadian funds, under reserve of his right to claim the premium on New York funds if he was legally entitled to it.\nNow it appears by all the monthly statements that the appellant never took delivery of any of the stocks said to have been actually purchased for him (he asserts that at the end he was refused delivery), but settled on the basis of the difference between the purchase and sale prices, being fortunate enough to realize a very handsome profit.\nIf we could take the appellant as being a speculator on an expected rise of the market after the purchases said to have been actually made for him, but of which he had no serious intention of taking delivery, his profit or loss being the difference between the purchase and sale prices, inasmuch as his speculation was made in Toronto, although the respondents say it was carried out in New York by actual purchases and sales, it seemed to me on my first consideration of the case that, as it is not shewn that the respondents made any profit on the exchange\u2014which profit they of course could not keep\u2014their only obligation was to pay the appellant the ultimate difference in his favour in Canadian money.\nMy difficulty, however, on further consideration, is that although, like the learned trial judge, I have very serious doubts whether any real purchases and sales were made, still I must decide this case on the basis that it is common ground with both parties, who no doubt wished to bring themselves within the rule laid down in Forget v. Ostigny[2], that all these transactions were actually carried out by the respondents, and their agents, Miller & Co., on the New York market. After the initial advance of $3,000.00 in Canadian money, all the purchases were financed in New York by means of moneys standing to the appellant\u2019s credit in New York, so that the amount charged as paid on account of the purchases was paid in New York funds, notwithstanding the respondents\u2019 assertion that Miller & Co. were credited with it in their bank account in Toronto. The final balance due to the appellant when he closed his account was a balance remaining to his credit in New York where the sale price of his stocks was paid, and not in Toronto. This being the case, the appellant is entitled to this balance in New York funds, just as he would have received New York money, and exactly the same amount of it, had he taken delivery of these stocks in New York, after paying in New York funds what was necessary to complete their purchase, and had then sold them in New York on the dates when they were sold for him on the instructions of the respondents. And if it is true, as asserted by the respondents, that Miller & Co. received in Toronto and in Canadian money the margin paid on account of stocks bought for the respondent\u2019s clients\u2014but the facts here shew that they must have used moneys standing to the appellant\u2019s credit in New York to make purchases for the latter\u2014they would profit to an easily calculable extent by the exchange, if they could pay in Canadian money what they had received in New York funds for the sale of the appellant\u2019s securities.\nAs a consequence I have come to the conclusion that, on the state of facts admitted and indeed asserted by the respondents, the appellant is right in contending that the balance due to him should be paid in New York funds. I would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Barton & Henderson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\n[1] [1874] L.R. 7 H.L. 802.\n[2] [1895] A.C. 318.\n"

Richardson Deceased (Defendant) Respondent.\n1921: November 2, 3; 1921: December 9.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Subscription for stock\u2014\u201cUnderwriting\u201d\u2014Assignment of subscription agreement\u2014Rights of assignee.\nIn a letter sent to R. requesting him to take stock in a newly formed company and enclosing a form of subscription the writer, who not long after became president of the company, stated that M. & Co., financial agents, had undertaken to sell $150,000 worth of the stock. R. signed the form thereby agreeing to purchase from M. & Co. 100 shares and that \u201cthis underwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution as security for advances.\u201d He never paid for the stock which eventually was pledged by M. and Co. with the appellant as security for advances. In an action by appellant to recover the price of the 100 shares:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (48 Ont. L.R. 61) which reversed that rendered at the trial (46 Ont. L.R. 598) that R.\u2019s contract was an underwriting of the undertaking of M. & Co. and a purchase of stock only if the latter failed to dispose of the whole 1,500 shares; as these were all sold the obligation of R. no longer existed.\nHeld, also, that the contract signed by R. was, ex facie, such as to put the appellant on inquiry; the contract was not negotiable and the agreement that it could be pledged or hypothecated could not give the assignee any rights higher than those of its assignor. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment on the trial[2], in favour of the appellant.\nThe point in issue on the appeal is whether or not the respondent Richardson was a subscriber for shares in a newly formed company, The Canadian Jewellers, Ltd., unconditionally and without limitation. The material facts are sufficiently stated in the head-note.\nHellmuth K.C. and Chipman K.C. for the appellant. The provision in the contract that it could be pledged or hypothecated intimated to the appellant that it could safely be accepted as security and estopped respondent from alleging that the writing did not contain the whole agreement. Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.[3]\nIt was assigned without being subject to the equities between Richardson and Mackay & Co. In re Agra and Masterman\u2019s Bank[4].\nTilley K.C. and Cunningham K.C. for the respondent, referred to Re Schwabacher[5] Hutchinson v. London and Provincial Exchange[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am, after much consideration, of the opinion that the document or agreement on which the action is based was not an absolute and unconditional agreement to purchase and pay for the one hundred shares subscribed for by Richardson but was an underwriting or a conditional agreement to do so if the $150,000 worth of the shares of Canadian Jewellers, Limited, which Mackay & Co., Ltd., had subscribed for and were about to put on the market were not taken up by the public, and only to the extent that they were not so taken up.\nThe contentions of the appellant Trust Company with which the agreement or underwriting was pledged or hypothecated by Mackay & Co., Ltd., for advances made, were that it was not limited to the $150,000 worth of the stock of Canadian Jewellers, Ltd., which Mackay & Co. had subscribed for and were putting on the market, and further that even if defendant respondent\u2019s contention as to the limited construction of the agreement was correct, and it was so limited, they as pledgees or hypothecatees nevertheless are entitled to recover because they had no notice or knowledge of the conditional nature of the agreement which contained the express provision that the\nunderwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution as security for advances.\nI am of the opinion that the Trust Company appellants may fairly be said to come within the phrase \u201cBanking Institution\u201d in the underwriting agreement mentioned.\nI am also of the opinion that the document was merely an underwriting. It is on its face expressly called so and the Trust Company must be taken, when making advances upon it when it was pledged with them, to have so understood it. The duty of inquiring and finding out what extent and what amount of shares the \u201cunderwriting\u201d covered devolved upon them. If they had discharged that duty they must have learned that the underwriting agreement was a conditional one binding upon Richardson only to the extent that Mackay & Company\u2019s subscription to the shares of Canadian Jewellers, Ltd., which they were offering to the public for sale, were not taken up by the public. The letter which Timmis, the co-promoter with Mackay & Company, of the Canadian Jewellers, Ltd., sent to Richardson, a letter enclosing the \u201cunderwriting form\u201d to be signed by him in case he decided to take any shares, expressly stated that $150,000 worth of stock was the amount which MacKay & Co. had \u201cundertaken to sell to their clients.\u201d The appellant Trust Company would have learned by further prosecuting their inquiries that the underwriting had reference to and only covered that amount of stock. They would thus have found the limited nature of the underwriting and have only themselves to blame if they, neglecting their duty, failed to make the inquiries which they should have made.\nIt appears by the evidence that Mackay & Co. had sold to the public the full amount of their undertaking of $150,000 and that Richardson\u2019s obligation under his indemnity was at an end.\nOn the whole I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J\u2014The Canadian Jewellers, Limited, was incorporated by letters patent dated the 11th August, 1911, according to a minute of the first meeting of the provisional directors, on 30th of said month of August, under and by virtue of the Companies Act, c. 79 of R.S.C. 1906.\nThere would seem to have been only five subscribers, each subscribing for a single share, and they were declared provisional directors who met as such on said 30th August and elected themselves directors, and passed by-laws of which No. 18 provided as follows:\u2014\n25,000 shares of the unsubscribed and unissued capital stock of the Company, of the par value of $100 each share, are hereby created and shall be issued as preference shares having priority both as to capital and as to dividends over the ordinary shares, which dividends shall be at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, and shall be cumulative. It was moved by Mr. O\u2019Brien, seconded by Mr. Gilmor and resolved: That the Montreal Trust Company be and is hereby appointed transfer agent of the shares of the company for such considerations and upon such terms and conditions as may be arranged by the president of the company; and that the president and secretary of the company be and they are hereby authorized to sign and execute in the name of the company the necessary agreement with the said trust company.\nThis helps to shew the business relation of the appellant to said company and is suggestive that the appellant probably had a better chance than deceased Richardson of knowing a good deal he should have been told and thus it was put on the inquiry.\nOne Timmis and the firm of J.A. Mackay & Co. both being brokers in Montreal which was to be the business home of said new company, had an agreement between them whereby they undertook the promotion of the company and sales of its stock and to divide the profits between them on a stated basis. Each took a large part of the stock\u2014Timmis to the amount of $100,000.00 and J.A. Mackay & Co. to the amount of $150,000.00 intending, of course, to resell same to the public.\nThe scheme promoted was the merger of certain named companies engaged in the jewellery business and the business of others likewise so engaged.\nTimmis wrote the late George T. Richardson as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, 8th Sept. 1911.\nGeorge T. Richardson, Esq.,\nMessrs. James Richardson & Sons, Ltd., Kingston.\nDear Mr. Richardson:\u2014I enclose herewith an outline of the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, an amalgamation which has been originated by myself, and which is being financed by J.A. Mackay & Co., Ltd., financial agents of this city. I also enclose an underwriting form. Mr. J.W. McConnell, Mr. R.J. Dale and Mr. James Playfair have taken $15,000 each. The money which we will receive from the sale of surplus merchandise when the different factories have been concentrated, with the $150,000 of stock which Messrs. Mackay & Co. have undertaken to sell to their clients, will give the new concern ample cash capital, so that it is exceedingly improbable that any payment whatever will ever be called on the underwriting. The underwriters will get 50 per cent of common stock as compensation for their under-writing services. It was my intention to have offered this to Mr. H.W. Richardson, but as he is now in the west, I am submitting it to you. We do not desire to have names for less than $10,000 or more than $15,000. I shall be very glad indeed to have you in on it if you care to come, but feel perfectly free to decline if it is not entirely acceptable to you. I only wish to give you the same opportunity as my other \u201cMissisquoi\u201d friends.\nWith kind regards, yours faithfully.\n(Sgd.) Henry Timmis.\nThe outline enclosed, so referred to, set forth in the first part thereof, as follows:\u2014\nCanadian Jewellers, Limited.\nTo be incorporated under the Companies Act of the Dominion of Canada.\nCapital....................................................................... $5,000,000.00\nConsisting of: 25,000 shares of seven per cent (7 per cent)\nCumulative Stock, and 25,000 shares of Common Stock.\nThe Company is being organized for the purpose of acquiring, coordinating and extending the business at present carried on by a number of the leading and most successful wholesale manufacturing and import jewellery houses of Montreal, Toronto and elsewhere, among others being:\nWilliam Bramley,\nThe Hemming Mfg.

Brown.\nThis is called a renewal of the original and substitutes 25th January, 1913, for the date of payment therein which was 15th September, 1912.\nOn the 30th October, 1914, by an agreement in writing between the appellant and the said J.A. Mackay & Company, Limited, the latter acknowledged an indebtedness to the former of $138,141.15 and interest at 7 per cent from 1st October, 1914, payable monthly and then assigns as follows:\u2014\n2. As collateral security for the payment of the said indebtedness and any interest which may accrue thereon the borrower hereby acknowledges to have assigned, transferred and made over to the lender all its right, title, claim and interest in and to the subscription made by G. Richardson, of Kingston, Ontario, for one hundred (100) shares of the preferred capital stock of Canadian Jewellers, Limited, at a price of ninety-five per cent (95%) of the par value thereof, with fifty per cent (50%) of the par value of such subscription in bonus common stock of the company, the purchase price of which stock was to be paid on the fifteenth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen (1913), as more fully appears from the copy of the said subscription hereto annexed to form part of these presents. Then followed an acknowledgement by appellant of the borrower having theretofore delivered to it stock certificates of the Canadian Jewellers to be delivered to the subscriber at the time of payment of the said subscription.\nThe appellant never tendered such certificates of stock to said Richardson who had enlisted in one of the first Canadian Expeditionary Forces and gone to Valcartier, and thence overseas to France where he was killed in the late war in 1916.\nIndeed any correspondence, on the subject of what is in question herein, had with him before his departure was either with Timmis or Mackay or latter\u2019s firm.\nThe appellant claims to have sent the late Mr. Richardson at Kingston something in the end of December, 1914, but no proof given of his having got it or heard of it and the appellant must have known he was not there.\nPrior to bringing this action there was a demand made on the executor of deceased\u2019s estate in Winnipeg for payment. This action is brought against said executor to recover the sum of $9,500.00 with interest thereon at 7 per cent and is founded upon the foregoing subscription, not, it is to be observed, to take stock in the company, but to buy from J.A. Mackay & Company shares thereof held by them.\nThe court appealed from held, and I think rightly, having regard to all the surrounding facts and circumstances which must be considered to interpret and construe what is a most ambiguously worded contract, that the condition of his so contracting had been fulfilled by the sale of stock to the public by Mackay. Indeed, the whole of the contract as finally developed and executed is not before us but only one part which, if justice is to be done, should have been supplemented by whatever is included in the cryptic term at the end thereof, as follows:\u2014\nThis agreement may be signed in counterpart and all counterparts taken together shall be deemed to be one original instrument.\nWhat does that mean? Where are these counterparts? How much has been realized from them by J.A. Mackay & Co. or the appellant?\nPreceding that we have the following:\u2014\nThis underwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution as security for advances.\nWhat is meant by \u201cthis underwriting?\u201d\nI find assistance in the case of In re Licensed Victuallers\u2019 Mutual Trading Association; Ex parte Audain[7], at page 7. Such an able court as there seized of that case and such an authoritative expert, if I may be permitted the term, as Lindley L.J., relative to the branch of the law in question, found it necessary to bring in evidence to help to the meaning of the term \u201cunderwriter.\u201d\nI think that example might well have been followed by those conducting this case instead of leaving us to guess which of the variety of meanings the term may have is to be applied in the peculiar connection in which it was used herein.\nLet us never forget this is not the common case of an issue of stock by a company in which men calling themselves for the moment underwriters do in fact undertake the management of the floating on the market a particular issue of stock or debentures by a company desiring their services. It seems to have been in regard to what is herein in question a device copied therefrom by two men who owned a certain amount of stock in a company.\nIndeed the term as used herein has given rise to several different interpretations according to the side counsel happened to be on and even these not always consistently adhered to.\nI think I have said enough to shew in what sense I think this contract is most ambiguous and why the surrounding facts and circumstances must be looked at.\nAnd I repeat that when so looked at and considered it was not a flotation of the entire preferred stock issued and offered by the company, but that held by J.A. Mackay & Co., and so issued and offered.\nClearly they disposed of more than they then had or offered and the obligation arising from signing such a counterpart as this now in question ended.\nThere is, however, another and graver point raised and that is the charge that the contract was induced by fraud or by unjustifiable misrepresentation of fact.\nThe learned trial judge found expressly that there was fraud so inducing the contract and going to the very root of the matter as would have rendered it void in the hands of J.A. Mackay & Co.\nHe did not give effect thereto for the reasons he gave, resting upon the decision of the case of In re Agra and Masterman\u2019s Bank[8], to which I will presently refer.\nThe learned trial judge\u2019s statement of fact upon which he rested his finding is challenged in appellant\u2019s factum before us. The statement the learned trial judge made is verified by the evidence given in answer to the questions 75 to 85 referred to by him.\nThe full import thereof did not in his view of the law call for an expanded argument and we are not to take his reference as more than an indication of much else.\nThe actual facts are that of the five companies set forth in the outline above quoted from, one known as the Caron Company, never had agreed as represented to come into the merger, and of the four others one was in the hands of a receiver.\nAnd the company was induced, by means I need not enlarge upon, to accept the representation of Timmis and, in September, almost concurrently with the signing by the late Mr. Richardson of the first subscription by him now in question, to take over some of these others from Timmis at such a gross over estimate of the value of their assets that later on, under threat of a lawsuit, he was induced to reduce their valuation to an aggregate of less than one-third of that he had induced the company to agree to.\nHis representations to the late Mr. Richardson were not, however, revised but, on the contrary, long after he had been so compelled by the company to accept that reduction, he continued in his correspondence with him, in answering his inquiries, to maintain the rosy side of things instead of telling him the truth.\nMackay was appealed to and responded in like fashion.\nIf he had told Richardson the actual facts of the disastrous change I venture to think he never would have got the renewal subscription now sued upon. Either Timmis knew that the representations he was making to Richardson were false, or he made them recklessly not caring whether true or false, and thus the contract was founded on fraud, and null.\nOr there may have been in law an alternative view of possibly mere misrepresentation which entitled Richardson, on its coming to his knowledge, to repudiate the contract.\nI am of the opinion that in law the appellant has no higher right than J.A. Mackay & Co., with whom the contract was made. And I have no doubt that the learned trial judge, while having ample ground in the evidence that was before him in the whole case, and not confined to one or more sentences thereof, to say and hold that the contract had been induced by fraud, erred in holding that the Agra Case[9], above cited, prevented his applying the facts as against appellant.\nThat case seems to me quite distinguishable. It proceeded on a promise, as in principle the court found, to honour drafts provided for in a letter of credit there in question.\nHere there is nothing but a contract, non-assignable in law, to buy from J.A. Mackay & Co. a number of shares. And there is added thereto a consent to its being used in a specified manner without any promise express or implied that there was or could not be anything vitiating it.\nMoreover there was nothing involved in the Agra Case9, but the liability to answer for a recognized breach of contract to the creditors of the bank in liquidation, no charge of fraud or the like being involved. I have looked at all the cases cited in appellant\u2019s factum and fail to find in any of them anything to support appellant\u2019s contention on this point.\nIndeed most of them relate to transfers of negotiable bonds or debentures. One other case cited seems to rest upon estoppel which does not help here.\nThe point taken by the respondent that the appellant is not a banking institution within the meaning of the term as used in this contract is, I think, well founded.\nIn view of section 156 of the Bank Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 29, prohibiting appellant from calling itself a banking institution, I prefer that to the Century Dictionary as my guide to the meaning of such a term when used in such a document as in question herein.\nIndeed the objection seems fatal to the right asserted by appellant that it has any higher title than J.A. Mackay & Co. would have if suing.\nAnd the case of Crouch v. The Cr\u00e9dit Foncier of England[10], is much more in point than any of the bond and debenture cases cited by appellant, for it shews how little may take away from these usually negotiable instruments the quality of negotiability.\nIn quitting this branch of the case I may say I have endeavoured to find something on the curious question of what exact meaning may be attached to the words \u201cthis underwriting\u201d but found nothing more instructive than the Ex parte Audain Case[11] cited above.\nAnd I presume industrious counsel on either side citing so many decisions have failed also or we should have had some results worth while.\nI, for the foregoing reasons, have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014The agreement sued upon is an underwriting agreement. This is sufficiently clear from the form of the document. It is true that there is an undertaking to accept and pay for shares but the undertaking is declared in explicit terms to be of the nature of an underwriting. In essence, therefore, the obligation is an obligation to indemnify J.A. Mackay & Co. against failure to dispose of the underwritten shares. In any action to enforce this undertaking the onus is of course on the plaintiff to shew that the circumstances have arisen making absolute the conditional obligation to accept the shares and pay for them and this proof is lacking.\nMr. Hellmuth\u2019s principal contention was that the clause\nthis undertaking may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution as security for advances\nconstituted an authority to the lender to make advances as upon the security of an absolute obligation to pay. I cannot find any evidence of such authority in this document; on the contrary the obligation upon which the lender is invited to advance is described in express words as \u201cthis underwriting.\u201d\nMr. Hellmuth relies upon the judgment of Lord Cairns in In re Agra and Masterman\u2019s Bank[12], at pp. 396 and 397. The substance of Lord Cairns\u2019 judgment in this case, in so far as now pertinent, is that the letter there in question was an invitation to bankers to advance money upon the faith of a promise contained in that letter to accept bills drawn upon the writers of it and that this virtually constituted an undertaking to pay such bills irrespective of the equities between the writers and the persons to whom the letter was addressed propriis nominibus. The letter contained an unqualified promise to honour the drafts of the addressees and was expressed in terms plainly constituting an invitation to third persons to negotiate such drafts in reliance upon that promise. The letter was either a promise to pay such drafts in disregard of equities or it was a mere trap, which of course the writers of it could not be allowed to aver. I find at most only a superficial resemblance between that letter and the document now under consideration. Here there is no unqualified undertaking and indeed no undertaking of any description by the subscribers to repay advances made upon a pledge or hypothecation of the agreement.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014After giving to all the circumstances of this case most careful consideration I have reached the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal should not succeed.\nI have no doubt that the Trust Company took the obligation of the late G.T. Richardson subject to whatever equities and conditions affected it in the hands of J.A. Mackay & Co., of which its ex facie designation as an \u201cunderwriting\u201d in my opinion gave them constructive notice. I cannot accept the view that the mere statement that the non-negotiable document signed by Richardson might be pledged or hypothecated as security for advances enables the assignee of it to assert rights higher than those held by its assignor.\nI think it is also reasonably clear that the liability assumed by Richardson towards J.A. Mackay & Co. was not absolute but conditional and in the nature of an underwriting. I am not so well satisfied however as to the terms of the condition on the happening of which Richardson\u2019s liability on the document sued upon was intended to cease. In view of the facts that this document is an underwriting of J.A. Mackay & Co. and that Mackay himself tells us that \u201cthe amount to be underwritten (by his firm) was to be $150,000,\u201d I am not convinced that the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that Richardson\nwas to pay only in the event of the $150,000 (to be underwritten by J.A. Mackay & Co.) not being taken up by the public.\nis wrong. The evidence taken as a whole leaves little room for doubt that J.A. Mackay & Co. did in fact dispose to the public of more than the original $150,000 worth of preferred stock for which they undertook to obtain purchasers. Therefore, while not entirely satisfied that the condition of the underwriting sued upon was what the Appellate Divisional Court has found it to be, since the evidence, oral and documentary, does not enable me to say that it was something different and was unfulfilled, a reversal of the judgment a quo would not, in my opinion, be justified.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The document on which the appellant\u2019s action is based is an undertaking signed by the late George T. Richardson, represented by the respondent, his executor, to subscribe for and purchase from J.A. Mackay & Co., one hundred preferred shares of Canadian Jewellers, Limited, at the price of 95 per cent of the par value thereof, with 50 per cent. of the par value thereof in bonus common stock of the company, the purchase price to be paid on the 15th day of January, 1913. This undertaking replaced a former one not produced, but said to have been similar in tenor and states:\u2014 This underwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution as security for advances.\nIt is very important to observe that this document is not a negotiable instrument. And I fear that many of the appellant\u2019s contentions are based upon a negotiability which it certainly does not possess.\nThe appellant however relies upon the clause stating that this underwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution as security for advances, and the learned trial judge, on the authority of the judgment of Lord Cairns (then Sir H.M. Cairns L.J.) in In re Agra and Masterman\u2019s Bank, ex parte Asiatic Banking Corporation[13], at page 397, decided that under this clause the appellant took Richardson\u2019s undertaking free from any equities it might have in the hands of J.A. Mackay & Co., Limited.\nIn my opinion the case cited does not help the appellant. It was the case of a letter of credit issued by a bank in favour of one of its clients, authorizing the client to draw upon the bank to the extent of \u00a315,000, and undertaking to honour on presentation drafts drawn thereunder. Lord Cairns said:\nThe essence of this letter is, as it seems to me, that the person taking bills on the faith of it is to have the absolute benefit of the undertaking in the letter and to have it in order to obtain the acceptance of the bills which are negotiable instruments payable according to their tenor and without reference to any collateral or cross claims.\nThere is nothing similar here. The stipulation that the \u201cunderwriting\u201d might be pledged or hypothecated did not add anything to it as a contract, nor did it, in my opinion, give the assignee any greater right than is conferred by the assignment of a contract or chose in action, the more so as the very clause permitting its pledge or hypothecation gave notice to the pledgee that it was an \u201cunderwriting,\u201d that is to say, as I will show, a conditional contract. And surely a conditional contract can only be assigned subject to the condition expressed in it or consequent on its nature.\nThe other cases referred to by the learned trial judge are bond cases to which very different principles apply.\nI have said that Richardson\u2019s undertaking, being an \u201cunderwriting\u201d, is a conditional contract.\nBouvier, Law Dictionary, Vol. 3, p. 3352, defines \u201cunderwriting\u201d and \u201cunderwriting contract\u201d as follows:\u2014\nUnderwriting. An agreement, made in forming a company and offering its stocks or bonds to the public, that if they are not all taken up the underwriter will take what remains. An underwriter is held liable in England on the stock subscribed by him. See 42 Ch. D. 1.\nUnderwriting contract. An agreement to take shares in a company forming, so far as the same are not subscribed to by the public.\nAn underwriting is therefore essentially a conditional contract, and whatever rights J.A. Mackay & Co., Limited, or the appellant as its assignee, had were subject to this condition.\nIt follows that the appellant took this undertaking subject to any equities and conditions which affected it in the hands of J.A. Mackay & Co., Limited. In other words it acquired no higher rights than J.A. Mackay & Co., Limited, itself had to exact performance of Richardson\u2019s undertaking. There is some difficulty in determining here what was the preferred stock which had to be taken up to free Richardson from liability under his contract.\nThe heading of the document signed by Richardson represents the preferred shares as being $2,500,000, of which shares to the amount of $600,000.00 were to be issued. Is the amount of shares underwritten by Richardson the whole $600,000.00, or, as found by the Appellate Division, only the $150,000.00 which J.A. Mackay & Co., Limited, had undertaken to sell to its clients?\nIt is to be observed that Richardson\u2019s contract to underwrite shares was made with J.A. Mackay & Co., Limited. The form signed by Richardson, or a similar form, was enclosed in the letter which one Henry Timmis, promoter of the company, wrote to Richardson on the 8th of September, 1911, whereby he sought to induce Richardson to enter into an underwriting contract with Mackay & Co. This letter represented that Mackay & Co., who were financing the company, had undertaken to sell $150,000 worth of stock to their clients, and the document signed by Richardson being an underwriting contract made with Mackay & Co., this letter would shew that the stock to be underwritten was the $150,000 worth of stock which Mackay & Co. had undertaken to sell to their clients. There is no suggestion in this letter that Mackay & Co. were seeking subscriptions for a greater amount of the preferred stock.\nTimmis, in his evidence, stated that Mackay & Co. and he himself had sold to the public 4,760 shares. I do not think therefore that there can be any serious doubt that the whole $150,000 of stock had been sold by Mackay & Co. to the public. This being the case Richardson\u2019s obligation to subscribe the stock underwritten by him came to an end, and Mackay & Co. would have no action against Richardson to force him to take the stock. The appellant, not being in a better position than Mackay & Co., cannot therefore assert any rights under Richardson\u2019s contract.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.B.

He was suffering from Bright's disease, and, to alleviate pain, morphine was administered each day at 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. The evidence of the attending doctor was that the effect of the narcotics would last two or three hours after the injection had been given. The circumstances of the execution of the will were related by the appellant. The testator was at first opposed to making a will, because he thought he would get better and also that it was unnecessary as he was of the opinion that his estate would go to his wife without it; but later on, he agreed to do so. Two days before his death, the will was drafted in pencil by an intimate friend of the deceased, copied by the appellant and shown to the testator at about 5 p.m. and again the next morning. The testator assented to it. Between 2 and 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the same day, the appellant handed the will to her husband who signed it without assistance. The appellant and the two witnesses to the will testified that the deceased was then compos mentis.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the evidence sufficiently establishes that the will expressed the true wishes of the testator and that he was compos mentis at the time of its execution, the more so as the will was simple and the disposition by the testator of his property to his wife was reasonable under the circumstances. Before the execution of the will, the appellant requested the attendance of two witnesses; and when they were at the testator's bedside, she asked them aloud if they \"would witness the execution of the will.\" The appellant then handed her husband the will and he signed it. Then the witnesses immediately signed in the presence of the testator.\nHeld, that the signature by the testator implies both knowledge by him of the fact that he was executing his will and a request to the witnesses to act as such; and this implicit recognition is a sufficient compliance with Article 851 C.C. Duff J. expressing no opinion.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014Probate of a will, not being conclusive of its validity is not res judicata even against a party who appeared and objected to the probate.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Surveyer J. and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nL. P. Cr\u00e9peau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Under the circumstances of the case, the disposition of all his property to his wife was not unreasonable, but on the contrary was such a disposition as the testator without any injustice to any one might fairly have made.\nI am inclined to think the learned Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench placed a much broader construction upon Doctor Anderson's evidence than its language warranted. I think the doctor, in giving the evidence he did, intended to limit his opinion as to the mental condition of the testator to the time that he was under the effect of the injection of morphia and not to extend it to the time when this effect had worn off. Accepting the evidence of the wife as I do, though she was the sole beneficiary, and also that of the two witnesses to the testator's signature, I cannot entertain a reasonable doubt of the capacity of the testator, when he signed the will, to do so or that the will embodied his real wishes and intentions.\nI think this evidence shews the requirements of article 851 of the Civil Code to have been complied with. See Faulkner v. Faulkner[1].\nI would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge upholding the will.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench of Quebec reversing the judgment of the Superior Court which affirmed the validity of the will in a suit which was first launched to set aside the probate as irregularly obtained, but by amendment of the pleadings involved the validity of the will itself, on the ground that the testator was non compos mentis at the time when he is alleged by respondent to have executed the said will.\nThe deceased signed a will of which the following is a true copy:\u2014\nMontreal, P.Q., November 2nd, 1918.\nI this day will my entire estate and all other effects to my wife Alice Wynne.\nWitness\nThat was attested to by two witnesses, called in for the purpose, on an occasion when the deceased was suffering from a severe illness. To ameliorate the said suffering the doctor in attendance had been in the habit of administering narcotics twice a day, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon and eight o'clock in the evening. It is urged that the pain and suffering thus alleviated rendered the deceased non compos mentis although the document was signed between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and the doctor admits the acute effects of the narcotics would only induce from two to three hours sleep.\nThe deceased was sitting up and signed the document on a pad handed him by the appellant when in that position, which with his frail state of health amply accounts for the shaky appearance of his signature.\nIf the appellant's story is true, it was drafted by a pencil in the hand of an intimate friend of the deceased, the previous day, copied by her and shewn to her deceased husband the same day about 5 p.m. when he assented to it, at an hour when the influence of the narcotic injected at eleven a.m. must have almost entirely passed.\nThe learned trial judge accepted her entire story as true, and that of the witnesses who had attested the signature as true.\nTo hold such a will invalid for the technical reasons assigned by the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench, disregarding all the attendant circumstances, as evidence of an effectual compliance with the requirements of the law, would, as Mr. Justice Martin suggests, render invalid many apparently good wills.\nIn many of the essential features of the case, necessary to consider herein, it has a remarkable resemblance to the case of Lamoureux v. Craig[2], save that in my own view and that of others considering the facts in that case there was much to give rise to a suspicion that the will was neither what the testatrix had previously intended or might have been expected to intend, and that the signature of the testatrix was thought by some of us to be illegible. In this case there was nothing but what one would expect to find, and what was consistent with the duty of the testator.\nMoreover there was such a simplicity in the words used in question herein that all that which needed to be understood by him signing was so susceptible of comprehension at the slightest glance that, if any consciousness at all were left, they must have been understood by any one capable of executing the document as undoubtedly the deceased was.\nIn the Lamoureux Case[3] the deceased had rejected one will submitted to her for reasons she assigned and, when her vitality had been reduced below what the alleged testator here in question possessed, she had presented to her a will which needed the possession of very acute faculties to comprehend whether or not her wishes had been observed.\nI quite agree with Mr. Justice Surveyer that if the will in that case, as the court above held, overruling us, was maintainable, certainly this is much more so.\nI need not enlarge; for the learned dissenting judges in the court below have so fully and carefully covered the ground with more extended notes in all of which I concur, as to render it needless for me to repeat same herein.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in appeal below and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored. Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed. The onus rests upon those who propound a will of establishing that it was the will of a competent testator.\nAfter fully examining the evidence I cannot resist the conclusion that the medical evidence points clearly to incompetency and I can find nothing in the other evidence relied upon to counterbalance the effect of this.\nThe appeal therefore, in my opinion, fails not merely because I am not satisfied that the conclusion reached by the majority of the court below is wrong but because as a result of an independent examination of the evidence I think the weight of evidence supports that conclusion.\nAnglin J.\u2014Two distinct issues are presented on this appeal\u2014one as to the testamentary capacity of the testator, the other as to compliance with the requirements of Art. 851 C.C. in the execution of his will. The learned trial judge determined both in favour of the appellant, the sole beneficiary. The Court of King's Bench decided both against her by a majority of three judges to two.\nThe evidence of the doctor who attended him is relied on to establish the testator's incapacity. But, with great respect, I think it far from conclusive. It is not clear that he refers to incapacity other than that caused by the administration of narcotics. As to that he says it would not last more than two or three hours after the injection had been given. Three and a half hours appear to have elapsed between the last previous injection and the execution of the will. The appellant who was present at the execution says her husband was then \"perfectly all right; he knew what he was signing.\" Robert Mellor, one of the witnesses to the will, says the testator recognized him and the other witness, James, and that he did not seem to be in a dazed condition but on the contrary \"seemed to know what he was doing.\" In answer to an inquiry as to his health by Mellor he replied \"not well; not well.\" James did not address him but thought the testator knew who he was. The appellant tells us that her husband sat on the side of his bed, that she gave him a writing pad which he put on his lap and then signed the will without other assistance. This statement is not contradicted. In fact it is corroborated by Mellor except that he thinks a table was used and not a writing pad. The signature itself, while somewhat shaky, is remarkably good for a man who died the next day from Bright's disease. The trial judge evidently believed both the appellant and the witness Mellor and, so far as one can judge by reading their testimony in print, it seems to be perfectly candid and entirely credible.\nThe will itself is reasonable, having regard to the testator's circumstances. It consists of only sixteen words\u2014a simple devise to the widow of the entire estate and effects, which are said to amount to about $12,000. The appellant tells us it was drafted in pencil the day before its execution by Mr. Tuck, an intimate friend of the testator, with his approval if not by his express instructions, that she copied this draft and shewed the copy so made to her husband the same afternoon and again the next morning and that he approved of it as expressing what he wished on both occasions.\nTaking all these circumstances into account, while, had the will been lengthy or the dispositions at all complicated, I should have doubted the testator's capacity to appreciate it, I am satisfied that the evidence of the appellant and the witness Mellor sufficiently proves that he had capacity on the afternoon of its execution to make a will such as that prepounded.\nThe only objections to the sufficiency of the execution under article 851 C.C. which call for attention are that the testator did not refer to the document prepounded as his will or acknowledge his signature to it in the presence of the witnesses and did not request them to attest the will. Compliance with all other formalities prescribed by that article is fully established.\nMellor tells us that when he and James came to her husband's bedside Mrs. Wynne \"asked if we would be witnesses and put our signatures on his will; she said it aloud to both of us.\" The will was then placed before the testator and he signed it, as already described, in the presence of Mellor, James and Mrs. Wynne, and Mellor and James \"immediately\" signed as witnesses in his presence and in that of each other. The signature by the testator thus made requires no other acknowledgment as the learned Chief Justice of Quebec points out; and, with great respect, it implies in my opinion both knowledge by him of the fact that he was executing his will and a request to the witnesses to act as such. This implicit recognition of the document as a will and request that the witnesses should attest the signature of the testator are, I think, a sufficient compliance in these particulars with article 851 C.C.\nI would for these reasons allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The respondent should pay the appellant's costs in this court and in the court of King's Bench. Brodeur J.\u2014La pr\u00e9snte action \u00e9tait originairement institu\u00e9e dans le but de faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le Protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui d\u00e9clarait que le testament de John Francis Wynne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment v\u00e9rifi\u00e9. Cette action en annulation du jugement de v\u00e9rification all\u00e9guait que les formalit\u00e9s voulues n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies et que la preuve qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e9tait mensong\u00e8re.\nIl appert, en effet, par la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en la pr\u00e9sente cause, que l'affidavit du nomm\u00e9 Tuck sur lequel le Protonotaire avait bas\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision rapportait des faits absolument inexacts. Ainsi il jurait qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lors de la signature du testament par le testateur, tandis que la preuve incontestable d\u00e9montre que cette assertion est inexacte. La d\u00e9fenderesse, qui soutient la validit\u00e9 du testament, est oblig\u00e9e d'admettre dans sa d\u00e9fense que cette partie de l'affidavit Tuck \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e et elle plaide que cette erreur provenait du fait que l'avocat qui avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 l'affidavit n'avait pas compris parfaitement les informations qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es.\nLe jugement de v\u00e9rification aurait certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 cass\u00e9 sans la preuve additionnelle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en la pr\u00e9sente cause. Cette preuve est que le testament avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 au crayon de mine par Tuck lui-m\u00eame sur les instructions du testateur, qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transcrit \u00e0 l'encre par la femme de ce dernier, que le testateur l'aurait sign\u00e9 ensuite en pr\u00e9sence des deux t\u00e9moins Mellor et James dont les noms apparaissent sur le testament, et que le lendemain le nomm\u00e9 Tuck y aurait lui-m\u00eame appos\u00e9 sa signature comme t\u00e9moin. Il est incontestable que cette signature de Tuck ne donnait aucune valeur au testament, mais pouvait-elle avoir pour effet de le rendre nul si autrement il \u00e9tait valide? Certainement non. La cour pouvait donc, dans ces circonstances, d\u00e9clarer que le testament, vu la preuve additionnelle faite, \u00e9tait d\u00fbment v\u00e9rifi\u00e9.\nLe demandeur a alors compris la faiblesse de sa position et il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 amender sa d\u00e9claration pour all\u00e9guer que le testateur n'\u00e9tait pas compos mentis lorsqu'il a sign\u00e9 son testament.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 Faction du demandeur et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 en Cour du Banc du Roi. La v\u00e9rification du testament n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, vu la preuve faite, le v\u00e9ritable sujet du litige; mais la discussion a port\u00e9 sur la capacit\u00e9 du testateur et sur les formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi pour rendre un testament valide.\nLe testateur \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment dans un grand \u00e9tat de faiblesse. De fait, il est mort le lendemain.\nLe t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin qui le soignait n'est pas tr\u00e8s favorable \u00e0 ceux qui r\u00e9clament que M. Wynne \u00e9tait capable de tester. Il avait perdu espoir de le gu\u00e9rir et alors tout le traitement consistait \u00e0 lui administrer soir et matin des drogues destin\u00e9es \u00e0 apaiser ses douleurs. L'effet de ces drogues \u00e9tait de le plonger dans le sommeil ou de le rendre inconscient pour une couple d'heures. Quand il a exprim\u00e9 ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s \u00e0 son ami Tuck et \u00e0 sa femme, il paraissait comprendre parfaitement ce qu'il faisait. Les t\u00e9moins du testament jurent qu'il paraissait comprendre ce qu'il faisait quand il l'a sign\u00e9 en leur pr\u00e9sence. Il n'a dit alors que deux ou trois mots qui portaient sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9; mais on ne saurait dire qu'il ne comprenait pas la port\u00e9e de la signature qu'il donnait. Il pouvait \u00eatre encore un peu sous l'influence des drogues qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9es environ deux heures auparavant; mais le maintien qu'il avait et sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l'un des t\u00e9moins d\u00e9notent un \u00e9tat d'esprit qui me para\u00eetrait incompatible avec l'incapacit\u00e9.\nSi on n'avait que la preuve des t\u00e9moins du testament, il serait peut-\u00eatre assez difficile de dire que le testateur savait que le document qu'on lui faisait signer \u00e9tait l'expression de ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s, car la demande que la femme du testateur a faite aux deux t\u00e9moins de signer le testament n'a peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par le testateur; mais par le t\u00e9moignage de la femme, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par le juge, quoiqu'elle f\u00fbt contredite sous certains rapports, nous avons la preuve bien compl\u00e8te et bien certaine que le testateur savait qu'il signait un testament.\nLes circonstances d'ailleurs rendent probable le fait que ce testament doit repr\u00e9senter la volont\u00e9 du d\u00e9funt. Le testateur et sa femme, la l\u00e9gataire universelle, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9s depuis plus de vingt-cinq ans et ils n'avaient pas d'enfants. Il \u00e9tait assez naturel que le mari laiss\u00e2t \u00e0 sa veuve, qui avait pr\u00e8s de soixante ans, les quelques biens qu'il avait pour lui permettre de vivre confortablement le reste de ses jours.\nCette cause ressemble sous bien des rapports \u00e0 celle de Craig v. Lamoureux[4] qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9. Les faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause paraissent plus favorables \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du testament que dans cette cause de Craig v. Lamoureux4. Je reconnais bien le danger qu'il y a de maintenir des testaments sur le t\u00e9moignage du l\u00e9gataire lui-m\u00eame. Mais la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Craig v. Lamoureux4 favorise la validit\u00e9 des testaments dans des cas semblables \u00e0 celui-ci. Quant aux formalit\u00e9s, je crois qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es, surtout du moment que l'on accepte le t\u00e9moignage de la l\u00e9gataire universelle. Le testament exprimerait la volont\u00e9 du testateur. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par lui en pr\u00e9sence des deux t\u00e9moins qui auraient \u00e9galement sign\u00e9 en sa pr\u00e9sence. Il est bien vrai qu'il n'y a pas eu de demande expresse et formelle par le testateur \u00e0 ces t\u00e9moins de signer, mais comme ils ont sign\u00e9 en sa pr\u00e9sence et imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s lui il me semble que cette circonstance constitue une r\u00e9quisition suffisante pour assurer la validit\u00e9 du testament.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette Cour et de la Cour du Banc du Roi et le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli.\nMignault J.\u2014The plaintiff, respondent in this court, complains of the will, in the form derived from the laws of England, of his brother the late John Francis Wynne, bequeathing his entire estate to his wife, the present appellant.\nAs originally drafted, the respondent's action aimed at having the probate of this will set aside, and most of the fifteen paragraphs of the declaration were of the nature of an attack on the judgment of probate, while the conclusions asked merely that this judgment be set aside. By an amendment permitted at the trial, the respondent further alleged as paragraph 14a, that at the time he signed the will, John Francis Wynne was not compos mentis, and was unable to make a will and to acknowledge his signature on a will previously made. And by the same amendment he added to his conclusions the prayer that at all events the said will be annulled, resiliated and cancelled. It is not unimportant to point out that up to the time of this amendment the respondent had apparently completely misconceived what was his remedy against the will in question. The judgment of probate has, in Quebec, a purely relative and prima facie effect, not going beyond identifying and proving the document presented as a will, so that authentic copies of the same (the will itself not being in notarial form never becomes authentic) may be delivered to interested parties. But, as stated by article 858 of the civil code,\nthe probate of wills does not prevent their contestation by persons interested.\nAnd as far back as 1872, in the case of Migneault v. Malo[5], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that a judgment of probate in the province of Quebec was not conclusive, and that the heir-at-law of the deceased, although he had been cited and opposed the grant of probate, could nevertheless impugn the will. It is therefore evident that the judgment of probate is not res judicata, even as to a party who appeared and objected to the probate, and consequently the respondent's allegations concerning this probate are entirely unnecessary, not to say irrelevant, in an action attacking the will.\nIrrespective of these allegations, the respondent's declaration attacks Wynne's will on four grounds:\u2014\n1. The will does not satisfy the requirements of article 851 C.C.\n2. The appellant handed the said John Francis Wynne a document all written out, which Wynne signed but did not read to the witnesses, and when he signed it J. C. James was the only witness present, Robert Mellor was called in as a witness after the document was signed, and Fred Tuck was not present at all. 3. Wynne never spoke anything about the paper he signed nor referred to it as being his will, and did not in any way acknowledge his signature to the said document as having been subscribed by him to his last will and testament.\n4. On the 2nd of November, 1918, when Wynne signed the said document he was not compos mentis, and was unable to make a will and to acknowledge his signature on a will previously made.\nIt is noticeable that the will is not attacked for undue influence or fraudulent manoeuvres (suggestion et captation) by the appellant. What Mrs. Wynne did is material only when taken in connection with the alleged grounds of nullity, and I must express the opinion that if Mrs. Wynne's testimony be believed\u2014and it was believed by the learned trial judge\u2014she did nothing improper to obtain the signing of the will. It is very unfortunate that Fred Tuck died shortly before the trial\u2014and inasmuch as he died of a lingering illness the parties should have obtained his testimony, or at least they should have shewn that he was incapable of giving it\u2014but Mrs. Wynne says that her husband was under the impression, and so stated, that she would get everything without a will. She adds that Tuck told Wynne that he had better make a will and he agreed to do so, and as Wynne expressed the intention to leave everything to his wife, Tuck wrote out a very short form which the appellant copied and which eventually became the will attacked in this case. Like many persons, Wynne disliked the idea of making a will, but this certainly does not shew that the will in question was forced on him, and I cannot see anything in the evidence that could support a charge of undue influence, if such a charge had been made. Discussing now the grounds of nullity alleged by the respondent, and dealing first with the fourth ground, the learned trial judge found on the facts that the will was signed by Wynne when of a free and disposing mind, and of sound intellect. What gives great weight to this finding is that it necessarily reposed on the credibility of the witnesses, especially of Mrs. Wynne. Moreover the physician called, Dr. Anderson, did not prove a general state of incapacity of the testator. He said that Wynne, who was dying of Bright's disease, was suffering very great pain; that twice a day, at eleven in the morning and at eight in the evening he administered morphine to quiet him, and that the effect of the narcotic would last two or three hours. This will was signed after two p.m., and in view of the testimony of the witnesses to the will, James and Mellor, it seems impossible to conclude that the finding of testamentary capacity by the learned trial judge should be set aside.\nI will now consider together the three first grounds of nullity which relate to the execution of the will itself. It is true that Mrs. Wynne handed her husband a document all written out, and that Wynne signed it but did not read it to the witnesses, nor was it necessary that he should do so. When Wynne signed the will, both James and Mellor were present and signed as witnesses in presence of the testator. No formal attestation clause was required and their signatures as witnesses sufficed. Tuck was not present at the execution of the will and signed it afterwards, but he cannot be considered as a witness to the will which however does not matter because two witnesses are sufficient. Wynne did not speak to the witnesses about the will and did not acknowledge his signature to them as having been subscribed by him to his will. However, as Wynne signed in the presence of the witnesses James and Mellor, it is Wynne material whether he acknowledged this signature which they saw him make: It was entirely unnecessary that he should do so.\nSo far the will stands the test of article 851 of the civil code which is as follows:-\n851. Wills made in the form derived from the laws of England, whether they affect movable or immovable property, must be in writing and signed at the end with the signature or mark of the tes\u00adtator, made by himself or by another person for him in his presence and under his express direction, which signature is then or subse\u00adquently acknowledged by the testator as having been subscribed by him to his will then produced, in presence of at least two competent witnesses together, who a,,,est and sign the will immediately, in pre\u00adsence of the testator and at his request.\nFemales may serve as attesting witnesses and the rules concerning the competency of witnesses are the same in other respects as for wills in authentic form.\nBut it is said that the witnesses, who undoubtedly signed the will in the testator's presence, did not do so \"at his request.\" Mellor testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. Who was present when you signed that will as a witness? A. Mr. James, Mrs. Wynne, myself and the deceased, the late Mr. Wynne.\nQ. Who received you at the door? A. I think it was Mrs: Wynne; I am not sure. I walked right in.\nQ. Did Mrs. Wynne talk to you about the will, then when she opened the door for you? A. No, only when we walked right up to the bed.\nQ. What did she say then? A. She asked me if we would be witnesses and put our signatures on his will; she said it aloud to both of us.\nMellor also says that when he entered he asked Wynne how he was, and the latter answered \"not well, not well.\" Both James and Mellor say that the testator recognized them. As to the signature of the witnesses at the request of the testator, undoubtedly this is a requirement of article 851 C.C., although it is not mentioned in the English Wills Act, 1 Vict., ch. 26, from which article 851 C.C. is derived. But it is to be remarked that when the will is signed or marked by another person than the testator, article 851 requires the \"express direction\" of the testator, while with regard to the signature of the witnesses at the request of the tes\u00adtator, nothing is said as to the form of this request. In my opinion, inasmuch as the legislature, in speaking of the direction or request of the testator, requires it to be expressed in one case and not in the other, it follows that this request can, in the latter case, be implied by reason of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will. Here Mellor testified that Mrs. Wynne, when the witnesses and she had walked right up to the bed, asked them if they would be witnesses and put their signatures on the will, and that she said this aloud to both of them. The request she thus made to James and Mellor must have been heard by Wynne, who then signed the will and saw or could see the witnesses sign it in his presence. In my opinion, but I say this with every deference for the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench who thought otherwise, it would be pushing formalism too far to reject this will for the lack of an expressed request of the testator to the witnesses, and the more so as this is an essentially simple and popular form of will, which undoubtedly the legislature desired to render as easy as possible to the least educated of the population.\nIf it be contended that Mrs. Wynne who went for the witnesses and asked them to attest the will, had no mandate from Wynne to do so, I would answer that evidently no express mandate was required. And the question really is whether Wynne intended to make a will and dispose in favour of his wife, and unless Mrs. Wynne's testimony be discredited, I must find that he did. The obtaining of witnesses, although essential, was not, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, a matter requiring any kind of mandate from the testator, for if we must take it as established that he wished to make a will, getting the witnesses necessary for the validity of the will was merely carrying out his desire.\nIt may be that this will is quite near to the danger point, but after full consideration I find myself unable to set' it aside and nullify the very natural and reason\u00adable disposition which Wynne made of his property, for he and his wife had been long married and had no children. Of course, Tuck's affidavit in support of the probate was untrue, as he did not see Wynne sign the will, although he probably could identify his signature. But nothing would now be gainer' by annulling the probate, for the testimony of James and Mellor chews that Wynne really signed the will. And, in my opinion, the attack on the will itself fails.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Act, a provincial public work can be made a \"work for the general advantage of Canada\" without an express declaration by Parliament therefor a lease of it to, and its subsequent operation by, the Dominion Government is not equivalent to such a declaration. But;\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. expressing no opinion, that the express declaration is necessary in every case.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the order of the Chief Justice who set aside the writ of summons in the cause as having been issued without authority.\nTwo questions were raised on this appeal. One that the lease of the railway to the Dominion Government made it a \"work for the general advantage of Canada,\" and the government of New Brunswick had, therefore, no power to remove the directors. The other was that the Act of the legislature authorizing the provincial governments to assume control and take over the stock was ultra vires as affecting the civil rights of the bondholders. As to this two of their Lordships held that the facts of the case did not bring it within the principle of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Royal Bank of Canada v. Rex[1], relied on by the appellant, and two, that this question could not be raised. The remaining Judge did not deal with it.\nJ. J. F. Winslow for the appellant.\nW. P. Jones K.C. and P. J. Hughes for the respondent, were not called upon.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action was one brought in the name of the St. John & Quebec Railway Company at the instance of Arthur P. Gould and his associates claiming to be the legal directors of the said company to restrain the defendants, the de facto directors, from acting as directors and for an account.\nThe learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick, the Honourable Sir J. Douglas Hazen, on an application made to him in chambers to set aside the writ of summons in this case on the ground that the same had been issued without the authority of the defendants who claimed to be the legal directors of the plaintiff company, granted the application and set aside the writ with costs to be paid by the plaintiffs (appellants') solicitors. On appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick the judgment or order of the Chief Justice was unanimously upheld in a judgment delivered by Crocket J. with costs to be paid by the plaintiffs' solicitors.\nFrom this latter judgment this appeal was taken to this court.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of Mr. Winslow for the appellant the court, being unanimously of the opinion that the appeal failed, did not call upon respondents' counsel, but dismissed the appeal with costs to be paid by the appellant plaintiffs' solicitors.\nThe main points to determine were:\nFirst, whether the Act of the provincial legislature in 1915 dispossessing and dismissing the then directors of the road, and providing for the appointment of other directors in their place, was legislation intra vires of the legislature of that Province. This hardly was or could be contested unless it was shewn that the railroad had previously passed from being a provincial road by Dominion legislation declaring it to be one for the general advantage of Canada. The contention was that the Dominion Act of 1911 authorizing the Dominion to take a lease of the road and the subsequent taking of that lease, combined with the statute of 1912, ch. 49, as amended by the Act of 1914, ch. 52, providing that the Dominion might build and own bridges on and over the road, amounted impliedly to a statutory \"declaration that the work was one for the general advantage of Canada.\" We were quite unable to accept or accede to that argument. It has never yet been decided by any court that the declaration required by the B.N.A. Act to change a provincial road into a Dominion one can be implied by or from such legislation as is here relied on, legislation which is quite consistent with the work in question being and remaining, as in fact it was and is, a purely provincial one. Nor have I ever been able to hold that anything short of the statutory declaration the Confederation Act requires can accomplish such a transfer.\nThe remaining point Mr. Winslow pressed was that laid down by the Privy Council in the case of the Royal Bank of Canada v. Rex[2], that provincial legislation affecting civil rights outside of the province was ultra vires.\nThe difficulty counsel here had was to establish facts at all analogous to those in the case which he cited and relied on. In fact no such analogous or other facts existed in this case which brought it within the principle on which the Royal Bank of Canada v. Rex2 was decided.\nThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants' solicitor.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was incorporated by the legislature of New Brunswick for the purpose of constructing a railway in that province. In course of time five directors were appointed. The management of the adventure produced such results that in 1915 the legislature saw fit for what seemed to it good and sufficient reasons to declare shares of the capital stock of the said appellant company to be vested in His Majesty the King, in behalf of the Province of New Brunswick, and at the same time authorized the Lieutenant Governor in Council to nominate, in place of the then directors, others whom he should be advised to so name. The original directors being those then in office were, by virtue of the said legislation, and the action of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, absolutely displaced from their respective offices as directors. From time to time, from thenceforward till this action was brought, the office of director of appellant was filled by the Lieutenant Governor in Council or by legislative enactment of the legislature of the province. Very important steps by way of carrying out the enterprise have been entered upon since, amongst others an agreement to enter into a lease of the whole line of railway, when fully constructed and equipped, to His Majesty the King on behalf of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe appellant, moved by some parties other than the de facto directors appointed in the manner above stated, instituted this action to remove the said de facto directors. The writ of summons was set aside by the order of the Chief Justice of the province. His judgment in that regard was upheld on appeal to the court of appeal for New Brunswick, and from that judgment the present appeal is taken. The pretension is set up that what was done by the legislature of the Province of New Brunswick as above recited was ultra vires and hence that the old original directors had never been displaced. The colour of pretension for this is alleged to be the leasing, or agreement to lease, to His Majesty the King on behalf of the Dominion of Canada. It is not pretended that there was any declaration such as required by the British North America Act by the Dominion Parliament declaring the work in question to be a work for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces. It is merely pretended that such is to be implied from the fact of the agreement to lease or leasing above referred to. It is my opinion that there is no foundation in fact or in law upon which to rest such alleged implication, in any event at the time when the appellant company's directors were displaced by the order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council pursuant to the above enactment.\nThere can be no doubt but that the said legislature had then full power over appellant and its organization.\nThe other questions sought to be raised as to the legislation which accompanied the displacement of the directors and the reconstituting the board of directors of appellant on the ground that these other enactments were ultra vires, can have nothing to do with what is involved in the bare question of the reconstitution of the board. The attempt made to bring this action, under all the attendant circumstances, as disclosed in the history of the road in the past four or five years, seems rather a bold attempt and one which should not be encouraged.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the costs be paid by those who promoted this litigation.\nDuff J.\u2014The Legislature of New Brunswick had full authority to enact legislation touching the ownership of the shares in this company which was a provincial company. There is nothing in the arrangement made between the company and the Dominion of Canada or in the Dominion legislation which affects this jurisdiction. The company's railway is nowhere declared in terms to be a work for the general advantage of Canada; and assuming that, in the absence of a declaration in terms to that effect, an intention to characterize a particular work as a work for the general advantage of Canada manifested by necessary implication from the language of a Dominion enactment could take effect under section 92 (10) of the B.N.A. Act and give to the Dominion Parliament exclusive jurisdiction under section 91 (29) and the provisions of section 92 (10)\u2014assuming this I am still clearly of the opinion that no such implication arises from the provisions of the Dominion enactments in question. On the contrary the intention of Parliament appears to be to treat the company's railway as a provincial work.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The present action is to restrain the defendants respondents, Jones et al., from acting as directors of the St. John and Quebec Railway Company.\nThe defendants were appointed under legislation passed in 1915 by the legislature of New Brunswick. It is contended by the appellant company that the railway was originally a local work and was then under the legislative control of the province but that it was later on operated under lease by the Dominion of Canada and was impliedly declared to be a \"work for the general advantage of Canada,\" and that the provincial legislature had lost its jurisdiction concerning the company which was the owner of that railway.\nIt is contended also by the appellant that the provincial legislature could not legislate as to bonds which had been issued by the company when it was under provincial control because they are situate outside the province, and it relies in support of this ground on the authority of The Royal Bank v. The King[3]. On this latter point raised by the appellant I may say that it cannot be validly raised in the present action which is instituted for the purpose of testing the validity of the election on the appointment of the respondents as directors of the appellant company. The Act of the legislature which authorized the election of the respondents might be ultra vires in that respect; but we are not concerned as to whether some other dispositions of the Act as to the bonds are legal or not. This is a suit involving the internal management of the company; and if the legislature had still in 1915 legislative control over the undertaking of the company, then its legislation concerning the status of directors is valid.\nIt is common ground that there never was any formal federal enactment declaring the railway in question to be a \"work for the general advantage of Canada\" under the provisions of s.s. 10, item (c) of sec. 92 B.N.A. Act. The appellant contends that such an implied declaration is to be found in some federal statutes, which authorized the Dominion Government to lease the railway and granted some railway subsidies. The power of the federal authorities to operate a provincial railway should not be construed as divesting the provincial authorities of any legislative authority as to this railway. There is nothing in The Railway Subsidies Act which should be considered as a declaration that the railway is declared a work for the general advantage of Canada. The different subsidy Acts of the federal Parliament provide not only for the subsidizing of federal railways but of local railways as well. I am of the view that the declaration which the British North America Act authorizes the federal Parliament to make concerning a provincial work, should be made in express terms. It should be done in such a way that there should be no doubt as to the will of the federal Parliament to assume legislative control over a provincial work.\nThe point was discussed in the case of Hewson v. Ontario Power Co.[4], and there it was stated by Mr. Justice Davies, who is now the Chief Justice of this court, that he was inclined to think that with respect to a work of a purely provincial kind solely within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature, a declaration by the federal Parliament to assume jurisdiction should not be inferred from its terms or deduced from recitals of the promoters in the preamble, but should be substantially enacted by the Parliament.\nI agree with such a proposition of law. I consider that the declaration should be a formal one.\nAs I am unable to find in the statutes quoted by the appellant company such a formal declaration its appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J. concurs with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

McKeage (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: October 24; 1921: November 21.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ. and Bernier J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Donation\u2014Obligation to provide home\u2014Refusal by donee\u2014Conversion into payment of money.\nUnder a deed of gift of a house from her father to the appellant, her brother, the respondent was entitled to a home with the donee as long as she remained single. Alleging failure by the appellant to fulfil his obligation, the respondent brought action to convert such obligation into a payment of money and to have the immovable charged with the amount awarded. The trial judge held that the appellant should pay the sum of $20 per month or provide the respondent with a home, but did not adjudicate upon the claim that the donated immovable be hypothecated as security, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench.\nHeld, that there was judisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal. Mignault J. dubitante. APPEAL by the intending appellant from an order of the Registrar affirming the jurisdiction of the Court and approving security.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThe Registrar: This is a motion to affirm jurisdiction.\nThe facts, from the pleadings and the papers filed, appear to be as follows:\u2014A donation was made by plaintiff's father on 8th October, 1887, and accepted by defendant by which certain lands conveyed to the defendant were charged or hypothecated in favour of the plaintiff. The deed of donation amongst other things provided as follows:\u2014\nThe said donee or his representatives * * * to pay or cause to be paid to his sister, Sarah S. McKeage the sum of $400 * * * That the said Sarah M. McKeage shall have a home with the said donee or his representatives as long as she will remain single * * * under all which charges and conditions the said donee doth hereby accept the foregoing donation consenting that the said lands shall remain affected and mortgaged for that purpose.\nSubsequently difficulties arose between the plaintiff and defendants and an action was instituted by the present plaintiff in December, 1910, in which she alleged that the defendant had failed to furnish her with a home and that his obligation in that regard was of the value to her of $200 a year and asked that the lands in question be declared hypothecated in her favour for such sum of money as would produce an annual rent of $200 a year and that the defendant be condemned to pay that sum. Judgment was pronounced in this case on the 18th December, 1911, by the Superior Court, in which was the following considerant: Considering that at the argument the interpretation to be given to the word \"home\" in the donation was by mutual assent of both parties submitted to the court for an expression of opinion, it proceeded to hold that the intention of the donor was to provide the plaintiff with a home on the premises and that she be supported as a member of the family as long as she would not marry and could not be expected to be supported elsewhere.\nAs the donation had not been actually registered, the court dismissed the conclusions of the action which asked for payment of $200 a year for the past year's board and for a yearly allowance in money, but declared that the plaintiff had according to the terms of the donation a right to have a home with the defendant or his representatives so long as she remained single and to have the immovable property affected by mortgage for the fulfilment of the obligation.\nNo appeal was taken from this judgment, but trouble did arise subsequently between the parties and the present action was brought, in which the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to comply with his obligation and asked that the donation should be converted into money and the defendant condemned to pay to plaintiff in lieu of the obligation imposed by the act of donation, $50 every month, and as a guarantee of such payment that the immovables in question should be hypothecated in favour of the plaintiff.\nVarious defenses were set up to the demand and the case went to trial before the Hon. Mr. Justice Pouliot who after reciting all the facts in his considerants gave judgment on 14th June, 1920, and awarded $20 a month to the plaintiff and condemned the defendant to pay that sum unless he should receive the plaintiff into his house as a member of his family and furnish her with support and maintenance until her marriage. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) and the defendant now appeals to the Supreme Court and asks to have the jurisdiction of the court affirmed.\nThe disposition of the present motion depends upon the construction to be placed upon section 46 of the Supreme Court Act:\u2014\"Does the matter in controversy relate to title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters and things, where rights in future might be bound?\" It was held in Rodier v. Lapierre, (1) that the words \"annual rents\" in this section mean \"ground rents\" (rentes fonci\u00e8res) and not an annuity or other like charge or obligation. The expression \"rentes fonci\u00e8res\" is discussed very fully in Pothier vol. LV, chap. 2, art. 14, by Planiol and other French authors and in its simplest form implies an obligation by a donee to make certain payments to the donor or a third party secured by a hypoth\u00e8que upon the lands donated. I do not understand the respondent to take exception to this construction nor would he seriously contend that if by the present judgment a \"rente fonci\u00e8re\" was granted that the present appellant would not have a right of appeal to the Supreme Court, but he argues that the judgment in this case places no charge upon the lands mentioned in the donation, or in other words that the judgment is a security of lesser value and importance than the plaintiff already had by reason of the donation and the judgment confirming.it, unappealed from, given in 1911. I cannot so construe the judgment in the present case. Although there is no express declaration as there was in the judgment of 1911 that the lands in question are charged in favour of the plaintiff, yet I think the judgment has that effect and that in the words of the statute the controversy relates to \"annual rents\". I therefore hold that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction.\nGirouard for the appellant.\nWalsh K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree that this appeal is, according to the jurisprudence of this court, within its jurisdiction and, therefore, that this appeal from the registrar's ruling should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal from the registrar's judgment should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The intended respondent appeals from an order of the registrar affirming the jurisdiction of this court.\nUnder a deed of gift from her father to her brother the plaintiff was entitled to a home with the donee (the defendant) so long as she should remain single, and also to be paid a sum of $400. In litigation between the present parties in 1911 the plaintiff was declared entitled to a home according to the terms of the donation and to have the immovable property, which was the subject of the donation, affected by a mortgage for the fulfilment of the donee's obligation to provide her with such a home. In the present action, instituted in 1919, and therefore subject to the Supreme Court Act as it stood before the amendment of 1920, the respondent sought to have the obligation to furnish her a home converted into a payment of money and the immovable donated declared subject to a charge in her favour for payment of whatever sum or sums she should be held entitled to. By the judgment of the Superior Court the appellant-defendant's obligation to provide a home for the respondent was so converted and he was condemned to pay the respondent $20 per month while she remained single, reserving to him however the right, instead of paying that sum monthly, to provide her with the home to the furnishing of which the donation to him had been made subject. No adjudication was made on the claim that the donated immovable should be declared charged with the payment of the sums so awarded. This judgment was affirmed on appeal to the Court of King's Bench. An appeal having been taken to this court by the defendant, the registrar on motion made on his behalf affirmed our jurisdiction. From that order the present appeal is brought.\nIt has been established by many decisions that in applying sec. 46 of the Supreme Court Act \"the matter in controversy\" means not the matter to be determined upon the appeal, or that disposed of by the judgment a quo, but the subject of the plaintiff's claim as disclosed by the declaration. That principle of construction is not confined to cases in which the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the value of the matter in controversy. It extends to the other cases covered by sec. 46 as well. Bisaillon v. City of Montreal[1]. In my opinion the defendant's title to the land donated to him would be affected by the plaintiff's obligation if established as a charge upon such land, as she sought. I am further of the opinion that this case also falls within the concluding words of paragraph (b) of s. 46\u2014 \"other matters or things where rights in future might be bound\". If the amount allowed the respondent should hereafter be found insufficient and she should desire to have it increased she would find herself bound by the judgment in this case. On the other hand, the representatives of the defendant, should the plaintiff survive him, would also find their rights in the land subject to the charge of the plaintiff's claim, had the judgment accorded her the declaration of such a charge. Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice de Montr\u00e9al v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[2].\nI am therefore of the opinion that the order affirming jurisdiction was rightly made and that this appeal from it should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The majority of the court being of opinion that we have jurisdiction to hear this case I will not enter a formal dissent, although I would be inclined to consider our jurisdiction as extremely doubtful, in view of the meaning placed on the words \"annual rents\" by Rodier v. Lapierre[3].\nBernier J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal from the registrar's judgment should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] Cameron's Supreme Court Practice, Vol. 2, App. C. 15.\n[2] 16 Can.

C. R. 99) Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the contract did not include an undertaking to tow \"scows\" and that the evidence at the trial of an action claiming damages for loss of a scow did not warrant a rectification to bring such towage within its terms.\nPer Duff J.: The trial judge was wrong in holding that he could resort to the negotiations prior to the contract for evidence of warranty of the tug's capacity and that the contract could be rectified on a mere preponderance of evidence.\nPer Duff J.: Qu. Has the Exchequer Court, setting as a Court of Admiralty, the equitable jurisdiction required to empower it to rectify instruments?\nThe owners of the tug \"Whalen\" wished to sell her to the respondent and entered into a contract to tow the latter's barges from Pointe Anne to Toronto, thus giving respondent an opportunity to test her capacity. In sending her to Pointe Anne the owners instructed her master to take orders from respondent's manager who tendered a loaded scow for towage. The tug had not sufficient power for this towage in November (the time of performance) and on the voyage the tow was cast adrift and lost.\nHeid, per Duff J.: Under the circumstances the respondent's manager in tendering the scow for towage was not a wrongdoer; the master of the tug was guilty of improper navigation on the voyage, and for this act of negligence the owners were responsible to the respondent. Per Davies C. J. and Duff J., Idington and Anglin JJ. contra and Mignault J. expressing no opinion. Such negligence of the master was without the fault or privity of the owners and the damages should be limited under sec. 921 of the Canada Shipping Act.\nOwing to this difference of opinion the judgment appealed from could neither be affirmed nor reversed in toto.

Jarvis for the respondent.\nIn any event the damages should not be limited \"The Minnehaha\"[4].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014After having given the facts of this case and the evidence a great deal of consideration, I have reached the conclusion that the reformation made by the trial judge of the written contract contained in the letter of the respondent plaintiffs to the appellants dated October 27th, 1920, by the addition thereto of the words \"and scows\" after the word \"barges\" cannot be upheld, and that the towing contract must be read and be held to have been as stated in the plaintiffs' letter covering barges only. The letter reads as follows:\u2014\nPOINTE ANNE QUARRIES LIMITED\nToronto, Ont., Oct. 27th, 1920.\nThe Kirkwood Steamship Line,\n14 Place Royale, Montreal, Que.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nThis will confirm arrangement made with your Mr. T. R. Kirkwood this morning, whereby you agree to send the \"M. F. Whelan\" to tow our barges between Pointe Anne, Presqu'Ille and Toronto at the following rates:\u2014\nFrom Pointe Anne to Toronto\u2014\nGeneral business\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 75c. per yard\nCrib filling stone\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 90c. per yard\nFrom Presqu'Isle to Toronto\u2014\nGeneral business\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 60c. per yard\nCrib filling stone\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 75c. per yard\nIt is understood that the tug will take her towing orders from the Superintendent Mr. Thompson, taking down whatever is light at this end and bringing up what is loaded at the quarry end; we to look after fuelling arrangements and purchase of supplies.\n(Sgd.) J. F. M. Stewart.\nManager.\nIn the absence in the above letter of the words added by the trial judge I do not think this action against the defendants would lie at all as the towed scow damaged was not under any construction a barge. There is a broad and well understood distinction between the two the \"scow\" not having any rudder or steering gear or crew. So the contract as altered or amended or reformed by the trial judge was a much more onerous one on the tug and its owners than that entered into by the appellants. The difference between a barge and a scow is fully explained by Mr. Kirkwood, the appellants' manager, in his evidence. \"One (the barge) has a rudder and crew which steer it, making it sure of navigation, towing behind, and the other (the scow) has no rudder, and is square built\"; and as Mr. Lambert, the naval architect and marine surveyor, testified this scow is \"a very lumbering, awkward heavy built boat\" and a very tough proposition for towing in any case and in rough weather tougher still.\nThe defendants sent their tug the \"M. F. Whalen\" specifically named in the contract to Presqu'Isle to carry it out giving the captain instructions as provided in the contract to take his orders from the plaintiff's superintendent Thompson. The captain obeyed his instructions and Thompson attached a laden scow to the tug instead of a barge. The captain knew nothing of the terms of the contract. The fact that Thompson attached a loaded scow which was not within the contract cannot make or create a new and more onerous contract as against the defendants. I have reached the further conclusion that even if the reformation of the contract by the trial judge is justified on the evidence, section 921 of the Canada Shipping Act (R.S.C. c. 113) applies to and limits the owners' liability in this action. That section limits, to an aggregate amount not exceeding thirty-eight dollars and ninety-two cents per ton for each ton of the ship's tonnage the liability whenever inter alia \"without their actual fault or privity\" any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of such ship caused to any other ship or boat or its cargo. I am clearly of the opinion that in this case there was no such actual fault or privity on the part of the owners of the tug which caused the damage complained of and in my opinion their liability, even under the reformed contract, must be limited to $4,389.01, and the judgment appealed from amended accordingly.\nThe tug was, as I have before mentioned, specifically named as the one defendants were to send to carry out the contract. If the loss or damage sued for occurred by reason of the improper or wrongful navigation of the tug that is just such a case as the statute expressly mentions and was intended to cover and even assuming the contract to have been rightly amended or reformed I cannot see how the specific thing, the tug \"M. F. Whalen,\" having been selected and agreed to by the parties and named in their contract as the tug to be sent, her alleged unsuitability for the work the contract provided for her to do can be successfully argued as a reason for refusing the statutory limitation of liability.\nIn an ordinary contract of towage when the tug is not specifically named there is an implied obligation that the tug shall be efficient and properly equipped for the services required. (See \"The Undaunted\"[5] \"The West Cock\"[6] cited and relied upon by the learned trial judge). But these two cases relate to general contracts to supply tugs for towage purposes and do not apply to contracts where a tug is specially named and agreed upon as was the case in this action.\nThe learned trial judge based his judgment for an unlimited liability on the part of the defendants, the Kirkwood Steamship Lines and T. R. Kirkwood,\nfor any deficiency that might be found in the amount owing to the plaintiffs after crediting them with the net amount realized by the sale of the tug \"M. F. Whalen\" upon first, the want of proper seamanship and resource on the captain's part, and, secondly,\nthe inability of the tug to maintain its horse power at an efficient figure\nwhich inability he thought was due\neither to want of capacity to develop or to maintain sufficient power in bad weather or to do so with the crew on board\nand he concluded that both factors were present on the occasion in question.\nAs I have already stated, the defendant owners' liability for damages arising from the improper or wrongful navigation of the tug by the captain and crew which are without the owners' fault or privity clearly come within the statute. With regard to the second ground of the judgment, the want of capacity of the tug to maintain sufficient horse power in the bad weather experienced, I am of the opinion that the implied rule or obligation which applies in an ordinary contract of towage, that the tug supplied should be sufficient as regards seaworthiness, equipment and power to perform the service she undertakes in weather and circumstances reasonably to be expected, does not apply to this case of the contract for the specially mentioned tug, the \"M. F. Whalen.\" Bucknill, 'The Law Relating to Tug and Tow,\" 1913, page 18 says:\nwhere a contract is made with reference to a specific thing, qualities in that specific thing which are in fact absent will not be implied bylaw. A tug cannot increase her size or power, and if a \"named\" tug is engaged to tow, there is no implied warranty by the tug-owner that the tug is different from her real nature, and the other contracting party must be taken to know the size and power of the tug which he has selected as the instrument of the towage.\n(See also Robertson v Amazon Tug Company[7] Court of Appeal, 1881.) Brett L. J., page 606:\nWhen there is a specific thing, there is no implied contract that it shall be reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is hired or is to be used. That is the great distinction between a contract to supply a thing which is to be made and which is not specific, and a contract with regard to a specific thing. In the one case you take the thing as it is, in the other the person who undertakes to supply it is bound to supply a thing reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is made.\nBramwell L. J. dissented upon another point, but he also dealt with this question as follows p. 602 :\nNow the plaintiffs' complaint was not that the vessel was unfit for the voyage and work; that it was not properly built or strong enough. Nor did he complain that the machinery or boiler was inadequate, not of the best make, or a good make, or strong or large enough. Had such been his complaint, then I think it ought to have failed because his engagement was with respect to specific things, and he took them for better or worse.\nSee also Marsden, \"Collision at Sea,\" pages 181, 186 and 187, The Warkworth[8] The Diamond[9].\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal arises under the following circumstances: The owners of the appellant were desirous of selling her to respondent and negotiations opened by the son of the owner of the appellant with that in view; after conversations with someone on behalf of respondent and correspondence with respondent in course of which he wrote, on 11th September, 1920, a long letter describing her and a sister ship in laudatory terms at the conclusion thereof he says :\u2014\nThey will stand very heavy weather, and therefore will not lose any money on that score. They are certainly an exceptional bargain at the price which, of course, is subject to being unsold.\nThat was followed by a submission to him of an account of what another vessel owned or managed by one Russell had done in the month of August from which it appears that said vessel had been engaged by respondent in the service it required and that set forth fourteen trips of towing service of which ten were towing scows and only four for towing barges.\nThen ensued the bargain now in question which evidently was intended as a test of the suitability of the appellant for such a service as now in question.\nUsing that as a basis or rather guide of what might be reasonable in regard to charges for such an experiment, the said representative of the appellant's owner and the agent of respondent orally agreed upon the terms upon which she should do towing service for respondent.\nThereupon the respondent's agent dictated to a stenographer the following:\u2014\nPOINTE ANNE QUARRIES, LIMITED\nToronto, Ont., Oct. 27th, 1920.\nThe Kirkwood Steamship Line,\n14 Place Roy ale,\nMontreal, Que.\nDear Sirs,\nThis will confirm arrangement made with your Mr. T.

J. F. M. Stewart,\nManager. It is to be observed this is not signed by any one on behalf of the appellant but seems to have been given as evidence of the oral contract that preceded it.\nIt was argued before the learned trial judge that the word barges did not include scows. At first he seemed of the opinion that it would cover the towing of scows, but later allowed an amendment by way of reforming the contract, as he expressed it, and evidence was directed to that which taken with what appears above clearly demonstrated that towing of scows as well as barges was understood to have been the bargain in fact.\nThere was a conflict of evidence between the agent of appellant's owner and the signer of the above memo. as to whether scows as well as barges had been mentioned.\nThe learned trial judge accepted the latter's version of the facts, disregarded that of appellant's agent, and allowed the reformation of the contract, if such necessary to maintain respondent's action, for evidently in his own opinion it was not.\nIt seems to me not only from the foregoing but from that to which I am about to refer, that the evidence is overwhelmingly against appellant on this point.\nNot only did the appellant entering upon the service accept the duty of towing barges, but towed also the scow, without any remonstrance as to the latter before towing the scow now in question but also when the master of the appellant cut loose her tow in a storm and went into port and refused to go next day after it when the storm had abated, there ensued the following correspondence by telegraph.\nThe master of the appellant early on the day following his cutting the scow adrift sent the following:\u2014 Cobourg, Ont., Nov. 12.\nKirkwood Steamship Lines,\n14 Place Royale, Montreal, Que.\nLost scow last night about two miles west Port Hope south west gale.\nFiled June 4th, 1921.\nC.M., R.E.C.\nH. Mallette.\nThat was apparently followed by a message from respondent as follows:\u2014\nToronto, Nov. 12-20.\nKirkwood Steamship Co.,\nMontreal, Que.\nWhalen threw big scow adrift off Port Hope twelve last night. Absolutely no reason except Capt. not control his crew. Scow still floating and have sent steamer from here but cannot reach scow till dark. Whalen in Cobourg wind off shore and crew refuses to go for scow.\nPointe Anne Quarries Ltd.\nAnd that in turn by the following:\u2014\nMontreal, Nov. 12, 1920.\nCaptain Harry Mallette,\nTug Mary Francis Whalen,\nCobourg, Ont.\nPointe Anne Quarries wire that you threw scow adrift without reason and that scow still floating and you refuse to go for it. If you can save this scow without risk to your tug do so.\nKirkwood Steamship Line\nWhich was followed by the following:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., Nov. 12-20.\nKirkwood Steamship Line,\n14 Place Royale Montreal, Que.\nThe scow the Whalen lost was built last year and cost over thirty thousand dollars. She carried a cargo worth twenty-five hundred dollars. No reason why tug should not get it and you should give Captain orders to this effect.\nPointe Anne Quarries Ltd. And again replied to by the following:\u2014\nMontreal, Nov. 12, 1920.\nPointe Anne Quarries Ltd.,\nMcKinnon Bldg., Melinda St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nWire received T. R. Kirkwood leaving for Cobourg first train to investigate have wired Captain to save scow if at no risk to tug.\nKirkwood Steamship Line.\nAnd the man who pretends he never would have undertaken to tug a scow with the appellant followed all the foregoing by an expensive trip to find out what became of this scow.\nAnd in all this not a word of remonstrance or objection to the towing of a scow, though he pretends he contracted only to tow barges, whatever that may mean in English.\nIt requires more than usual boldness in face of such recognition of duty to try to support the contention that someone later on no doubt suggested as to scows not being covered by the generic word barges.\nSuch a surprising suggestion has induced me to look up the meaning of the words \"barge\" and \"scow\".\nI find in the Century Dictionary the following, of many meanings:\u2014\nBarge. 1. A sailing vessel of any sort. 2. A flat-bottomed vessel of burden used in loading and unloading ships, and, on rivers and canals, for conveying goods from one place to another.\nScow. 1. A kind of large flat-bottomed boat used chiefly as a lighter; a pram. 2. A small boat made of willows, etc., and covered with skins; a ferry-boat.\nMurray has the following :\nBarge. 1. A small sea-going vessel with sails; used specifically for one next in size above the Balinger, and generally as\u2014Ship, vessel (in which use it is now superseded by Bark) Obs. (except when historians reproduce it in a specific sense).\n2. A flat-bottomed freight boat, chiefly for canal and river-navigation, either with or without sails; in the latter case also called a lighter; in the former, as the Thames barges, generally dandy-rigged, having one important mast. There are besides these two leading meanings in Murray five others which show how comprehensive the word barge is, and how it has been applied to a great variety of vessels by no means consistent with the local application of the term as suggested herein. Then follow illustrations from many authors.\nIllustrative of what I have just said the following appears in the Encyclopedia Britannica, descriptive of a barge.\nBarge. Formerly a small sailing vessel, but now generally a flat-bottomed boat used for carrying goods on inland navigations. On canals barges are usually towed, but are sometimes fitted with some kind of engine; the men in charge of them are known as bargees. On tidal rivers barges are often provided with masts and sails ('sailing barges') or in default of being towed, they drift with the current, guided by a long oar or oars ('dumb barges'). Barges used for unloading, or loading, the cargo of ships in harbours are sometimes called 'lighters' (from the verb 'to light'\u2014to relieve of a load). A state barge was a heavy, often highly ornamented vessel used for carrying passengers on occasions of state ceremonials. The college barges at Oxford are houseboats moored in the river for the use of members of the college rowing clubs. In New England the word barge frequently means a vehicle, usually covered, with seats down the side, used for picnic parties or the conveyance of passengers to or from piers or railway stations.\nand no meaning is found in that work for the word \"scow\".\nThe word \"scow\" appears in Murray as a \"large flat-bottomed lighter or punt\", and a number of meanings cited from different authorities but nothing to justify the local description presented in argument herein.\nIt would seem from the evidence that there must be a local form of English and if that is resorted to and to be relied upon I prefer the conduct of the parties as above set forth as explanatory of what was intended by the use of the word barges. I agree, in regard to other points made, fully with the reasoning of the learned trial judge and Mr. Justice Audette in appeal, but have thought it well to develop the foregoing as my own way of looking at what in the argument seemed to me rather a remarkable contention.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am unable to say that the conclusion I have reached in this case is entirely satisfactory to my own mind. I can only say that of the three possible results, each one of which has met with acceptance by one or more members of this court, that conclusion appears to me to be supported by the weight of argument.\nThe first point for examination is whether the express contract between the parties is to be considered as embodied in the letter of the 27th October signed by Mr. Stewart, the manager of the respondent company, and addressed to the owners of the appellant ship whom I shall refer to as the appellants. That letter was dictated on the day of its date by Mr. Stewart in the presence of Mr. Kirkwood, the appellants' manager. Beyond question it was, as Mr. Stewart explicitly says, intended to record the arrangement between the two parties and it was dictated by him, as already mentioned, in the presence of Mr. Kirkwood as embodying that arrangement and it was afterwards received and accepted by Mr. Kirkwood as the authentic record of it.\nThis document therefore, prima facie, constitutes the exclusive evidence of the contract between the parties. On behalf of the respondent it has, however, been contended that in truth the contract was something different; that the parties had agreed upon a contract in different terms and that it was through the common mistake of both of them that the letter does not express the terms of the bargain they had concluded. This contention raises perhaps the most important issue on the appeal. Before proceeding to discuss it I quote the letter, which is as follows:\nPOINTE ANNE QUARRIES LIMITED\nToronto, Ont., Oct. 27th, 1920.\nThe Kirkwood Steamship Line,\n14 Place Royale, Montreal, Que.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nThis will confirm arrangement made with your Mr. Kirkwood this morning, whereby you agree to send the \"M. F. Whalen\" to tow our Barges between Pointe Anne, Presqu'Isle and Toronto at the following rates:\u2014\nFrom Pointe Anne to Toronto\u2014\nGeneral Business\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 75c. per yard.\nCrib filling stone\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 90c. per yard\nFrom Presqu'Isle to Toronto\u2014\nGeneral Business\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 60c. per yard\nCrib filling stone\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 75c. per yard\nIt is understood that the Tug will take her towing orders from our Superintendent Mr. Thompson, taking down whatever is light at this end and bringing up what is loaded at the Quarry end; we to look after fueling arrangements and purchase of supplies.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) J. F. M. Stewart,\nManager.\nThe respondent company says that the agreement was one to tow scows and barges and that it was by mistake that Mr. Stewart used the words \"to tow our barges\" when to express the meaning of the parties the words should have been \"to tow our barges and scows\".\nI refer for a moment to the suggestion that the word barge is in itself sufficient, that it denotes scow as well as barge. The distinction is drawn very clearly in the evidence. What is more important to note is this: The evidence of Mr. Stewart, that of Mr. Lambert as well as that of Mr. Kirkwood establish (and indeed I should be surprised to hear it disputed) that the distinction is one regularly observed in common speech and Mr. Stewart gives point to this by insisting that during the interview at the conclusion of which the letter was written scows were specifically mentioned and that the distinction between barges and scows was present to the mind of Mr. Kirkwood as well as his own and implies that the word \"barge\" would not have been used by either of them as a common term designating scows as well as barges. In answer to a request for an explanation of the terms of the letter he says:\nI dictated it and there is no explanation except that that is the way the letter was written. It don't convey the intention.\nThe evidence negatives decisively this suggestion as to the scope of the word \"barge\".\nMy conclusion is that on this issue (as to the terms of the contract) the respondent company fails. I shall first give my reasons based upon the record as presented to us before discussing the judgments in the Exchequer Court. This, I think, is the more convenient course because I think effect ought not to be given to the findings of the two courts below. This is not a case failing within the general rule which gives an almost conclusive effect to such concurrent findings for reasons which will be discussed later. Before proceeding to discuss the facts it should be observed that the proposition of the respondents in the form it ultimately assumes is this: That the appellants warranted the sufficiency of the tug Whalen for all the purposes of their business in the transportation of stone from their quarries at Pointe Anne to Toronto and that this included a warranty of sufficiency to tow a scow of the type of that lost carrying a burden of 1875 yards of stone in the heavy weather of November.\nBy their statement of claim the respondents rested their cause of action upon the contract of the 27th October, paragraphs 2 and 3 being in the following terms:\u2014\n2. On October 27th, 1920, a contract was entered into between the plaintiff and the owners of the Ship \"M. F. Whalen\", an ocean going steam tug of 200 I.H.P. registered at Halifax, for towage by the \"M. F. Whalen\", of the plaintiff's barges, light and loaded, between Pointe Anne, Presqu'il and Toronto.\n3. On the 11th day of November, 1920, in pursuance of the said contract, the \"M. F. Whalen\" left Presqu'il for Toronto at about 7 a.m. having in tow a barge of the plaintiff's laden with a cargo of stones. The tow was under control of the \"M. F. Whalen\" and the latter was manned and controlled by the servants of the owners of the \"-M. F. Whalen\" and no officer, agent or servant of the plaintiff was on board either the \"M. F. Whalen\" or the tow.\nThe appellants by their statement of defence set up the writing of the 27th October and denied that under the contract thereby disclosed they were under any obligation to assume the towage of scows. At the trial the letter of the 27th October was first put in by the defence and it was only in rebuttal that respondents produced the evidence of Mr. Stewart who signed the letter, to the effect that the agreement between himself and Mr. Kirkwood in the interview on the 27th October was an agreement to tow scows as well as barges. During the cross-examination of Mr. Kirkwood, counsel for the defence objected to cross-examination on the ground that the contract spoke for itself and that matter dehors the contract was inadmissible. The learned trial judge overruled the objection apparently taking the view that as some evidence of this character had been received without objection it was too late for the appellants to insist upon the contract as it stood and thereafter the trial proceeded upon that footing. At the conclusion of the evidence counsel for the respondents asked for leave to amend by adding a plea for rectification. This application was reserved by the trial judge and granted by him in giving judgment in the action.\nIn discussing the point now under consideration it ought to be unnecessary to observe that where the parties have finally reduced their agreement to writing, a writing that is to say which is intended to be the record of the agreement between them, it was not at common law competent to either of them to resort to previous negotiations or contemporary conversations or other matters for the purpose of varying or adding to its terms as expressed in the writing; and where the language is unambiguous, that is to say, capable of only one necessarily exclusive signification, that it was not competent to refer to such extraneous matter for the purpose of giving colour to the plain meaning of the document. As Lord Bramwell, then Bramwell B. said in Wake v Harrop[10]\nthey put on paper what is to bind them and so make the written document conclusive evidence between them.\nThe rule is obviously not a technical rule. It is founded upon the highest considerations of convenience and the value of it could hardly be better illustrated than by a case such as this where two men of affairs, thoroughly accustomed to transacting business, meeting after a negotiation with the object of making an agreement upon business which had been the subject of full consideration by each and after discussion of the matter deliberately set down in writing in perfectly unambiguous language that upon which they have agreed. In commercial affairs it is of great importance that such documents should be regarded as final and on this principle the courts have uniformly acted recognizing that the very purpose of expressing agreements in writing is to reduce the terms of them to permanent form and to preclude subsequent disputes as to such terms.\nCourts of equity on the other hand have from early times possessed and exercised authority to rectify documents in which parties have professed to express their contracts, a jurisdiction now exercisable by courts having equitable powers. The point was not argued and I express no opinion upon it but I am not prepared without further consideration to say whether the Exchequer Court of Canada in its Admiralty jurisdiction under the Admiralty Act of 1861 is endowed with the power to rectify instruments. Assuming that to be so it is important to note that an attempt to reform an instrument by invoking this equitable jurisdiction can only succeed where two conditions are fulfilled.\nFirst, it must be shown not only that the agreement as stated in the writing, the agreement in this case to tow barges, was not the whole of the agreement between the parties and it must further be shown that the parties did agree upon something which did not appear in the writing, in this case to tow barges plus scows, and that the agreement, that is to say the intention to contract in this sense, continued concurrently in the minds of both parties down to the time the document went into operation. The other condition relates to the character and probative force of the evidence required. Where one of the parties denies the alleged variation the parol evidence of the other party is not sufficient to entitle the court to act. Such parol evidence must be adequately supported by documentary evidence and by considerations arising from the conduct of the parties satisfying the court beyond reasonable doubt that the party resisting rectification did in truth enter into the agreement alleged. It is not sufficient that there should be a mere preponderance of probability; the case must be proved to a demonstration in the only sense in which in a court of law an issue of fact can be established to a demonstration, that is to say, the evidence must be so satisfactory as to leave no room for such doubt. Hart v Boutilier,[11] at page 630; Fowler v Fowler[12] at page 264; Clarke v Joselin[13] at page 78.\nHere as in all such cases the fundamental fact is the existence of the document prepared and executed with the intention of stating the terms agreed upon by the parties so executing it; and the importance of that fact in the present case is increased by the cirsumstance that it was prepared on the very occasion on which the parties concluded their agreement and prepared in such circumstances as virtually to make it their joint production. I do not attach as much weight to the fact, although that is by no means without importance, that the letter was dictated by Mr. Stewart, as to the fact that it was dictated in the presence of Mr. Kirkwood when the very words of their conversation must have been fresh in the minds of both of them and in circumstances calculated to bring the attention of both to bear upon the phraseology used. I find it very difficult indeed to reconcile with these facts the statement of Mr. Stewart that he was mainly concerned as to the capacity of the tug in respect of the towage of scows and that this point had been the subject of specific discussion during the moments which preceded the dictation of the letter.\nThe circumstances mainly relied upon by the respondents in corroboration of Mr. Stewart's evidence may conveniently be commented upon in discussing the judgments in the Exchequer Court. As regards these judgments it should first be observed that there are cogent reasons why in this court the findings of fact cannot be regarded as decisive. The learned trial judge appears to have proceeded upon the view that even assuming the letter of the 27th October embodied the concluded contract between the parties he was still bound to give effect to a warranty which he conceived to be disclosed by the correspondence preceding the contract; and in deciding that the document of October 27th was to be rectified it seems reasonably clear that his attention was not drawn either to the rules by which courts of equity have governed themselves in granting this relief or to the force of the considerations derived from the circumstances in which the letter was written. The letter, indeed, is treated by the learned judge as only one of a series of facts of co-ordinate evidentiary value.\nThe question of rectification is thus disposed of:\nThe evidence makes it clear that these words were omitted by inadvertance, to use the language of Mr. Kirkwood, and also that he knew the equipment of the plaintiffs included 'scows' and that the \"Whalen\" was intended to do for the plaintiffs the work done by Russell's tug \"Lakeside\" whose place this tug was to take, and I so find. There is no explicit finding that there was a concluded agreement made orally on the 27th October binding the respondents to employ the Whalen and the appellants to tow the respondent's scows with her. Rather excessive importance seems to be attached to a statement by Mr. Kirkwood at the trial that he had become convinced that Mr. Stewart had not intended \"to deceive\" him but had intended to provide for the towage of scows as well as barges. Mr. Kirkwood did, with a candour that does him no discredit, say that but at the same time he insisted explicitly that while he knew the barges of the respondents and was willing to undertake their towage and to warrant the capacity of the Whalen to tow them he would not have agreed to undertake the towage of scows of undefined weight and dimensions in the rough weather of November and he adds that he never would have agreed to tow a scow of the type of that which was lost since the Whalen, and this is common ground, was insufficiently powered for that purpose. He denies, moreover, that he knew that scows formed part of the \"equipment\" of the respondents although he admits that he was aware that scows had been used for the purpose of carrying the respondents' stone in August by one Russell whose account had been brought to his attention, adding however, that he was unaware whether or not these scows belonged to the respondent or to Russell himself; and stating moreover, that it was one thing to undertake the towage of such craft in August when steady weather would be assured and a totally different thing to consider the towage of them in November. He denies also in the most explicit manner that the scows were mentioned during the interview. The learned trial judge in finding that Kirkwood knew the intention of the respondents to be that the Whalen was intended to tow in November the same class of craft as Russell towed in August is drawing a conclusion from the evidence of Stewart alone; so likewise when he finds that Kirkwood knew scows were part of the \"equipment\" of the plaintiffs. It is not denied that Kirkwood had not seen the respondents' scows and it is not suggested that he had any information as to their weight or size. The view taken by the learned trial judge is in effect that the appellants being in ignorance upon these points undertook to tow whatever might be assigned for towage.\nStewart says that on the voyage in which the mishap occurred he was engaged in testing the capacity of the tug and the question at this point for consideration is: Is it conclusively (in the sense above mentioned) established that Kirkwood intended to enter into a contract and did enter into a contract warranting the capacity of his tug to tow in November successfully any scow which the respondents might see fit to provide for the purpose of giving her what they might consider to be a satisfactory test for the purposes of their business?\nIt is common ground, and indeed it is the basis of one branch of the respondents' case, that the Whalen was insufficiently powered for the towage of the lost scow in November and there seems little reason to doubt Kirkwood's statement that he would never have entered into a contract for the towage of such a craft at that season, that is to say a contract warranting the tug's capacity to deliver her tow safely; nor does there seem any reason to doubt his statement that he would not have entered into a contract for the towage of craft of that character of which he did not know the weight or dimensions. One must' assume that he is a normally prudent man; and in examining Kirkwood's evidence it should be remembered that it was on his cross-examination that for the first time he received notice that he was expected to discuss the allegation by the respondents that he had entered into a contract of the kind now set up and notwithstanding this his evidence on the various points made against him is clear and consistent throughout. Weighing against Stewart's oral evidence the fact of the document itself and the facts connected with the litigation\u2014 the allegation that the contract of the 27th was a contract to tow barges and only barges, and the basing of the plaintiff's claim upon that contract the failure to bring forward the suggestion of mistake in the writing of the letter until the latest possible moment\u2014 I am unable to discover anything to justify the conclusion that the prayer for rectification is supported by that kind of weighty proof which the law demands in such cases. One must bear in mind, in the language of Sir W. M. James in MacKenzie v Coulson[14]\nthat it is always necessary for the plaintiff to show that there was an actual concluded contract antecedent to the instrument which is sought to be rectified ******* it is impossible for this court to rescind or alter a contract with reference to the terms of the negotiation which preceded it.\nI cannot pass by the suggestion made during the argument founded upon a statement of Stewart's that the defence resting upon the terms of the contract was an afterthought of Kirkwood's and that Stewart became aware that these terms were limited only when the statement of defence was filed. That is an extraordinary and incomprehensible suggestion having regard to the terms of the second paragraph of the statement of claim. Independently of the letter of the 27th October the learned trial judge finds in the correspondence a warranty of capacity\nto tow whatever the plaintiffs had been in the habit of trusting to tug-boats.\nI have already pointed out that the letter is the governing document. I am unable, moreover, to agree with the trial judge in his construction of this correspondence considered independently. Let us see what it discloses. The appellants had two tugs which they wished to dispose of, and with a view to a sale they had been pressing the respondents to inspect them and to make trials of them. After some delay the appellants were informed by the respondents that they were not likely to make a purchase before the following spring. At the same time the respondents suggest that they employ one of these tugs in their service between Pointe Anne Quarries and Toronto and they add that this will give them an opportunity of making a test. The fact that in August scows were employed seems to have been magnified beyond its real significance; it did not follow that the respondents would entrust their cargoes to scows in November.\nThe trial judge also proceeds upon the instructions given to the master. The master, he says, was given definite instructions to take orders from the plaintiffs and there was no limitation upon these instructions. This he seems to think is sufficient to fasten upon the respondents responsibility for everything undertaken by the master on the instructions of Thompson. It is important in considering the effect of this circumstance to bear in mind the terms of the contract. The contract provided that the captain of the Whalen was to take his towing orders from the respondents, but this provision, it is quite plain, is a provision touching the execution of the contract, that is to say, it is a provision relating to the employment of the Whalen in the towing of barges. To enlarge the obligations of the contract by reason of a general provision of this nature is quite inadmissible. The instructions to the master were given pursuant to this term of the contract and in performance of it and can have no significance or effect as touching legal responsibilities of the parties.\nThe reciprocal rights and liabilities therefore of the parties to the appeal are to be determined by the application of the law to this state of facts. The appellants had undertaken to tow the respondent company's barges and for that purpose had placed their tug with its master and crew under the control of one of the respondent company's officers which officer used the tug for a service the appellants had not agreed to perform\u2014a service admittedly more difficult and admittedly one which the tug was incapable efficiently to perform in the event which supervened\u2014 an event which might have been anticipated\u2014heavy weather on Lake Ontario in November.\nIn these circumstances it seems clear, too clear for discussion, that the appellants are not responsible as for a warranty of sufficiency of power, of equipment or of crew. But a question arises, and it is this question which occasioned me the greatest concern in determining the appeal, the question whether, namely, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the appellants are not in some degree responsible. Thompson, in so far as he professed to act under the contract, was doing an unauthorized thing when he directed the master of the tug to take the scow in tow, but I think, not without much hesitation, that having regard to the facts as a whole he was not, strictly speaking, a wrongdoer. I think there are facts in evidence pointing to the conclusion that the appellants, while they would not contract to tow scows and did not contract to tow scows, were not unwilling that Thompson should in any reasonable way test the capacity of the tug with reference to the possibility of purchasing her.\nLooking at the relations between the parties and considering the object they both had in view, I have come to the conclusion that Thompson was not a wrong-doer in using the Whalen for the purpose of testing her with regard to the towing of scows. Admittedly that is what he was doing; Mr. Stewart, the manager of the respondents, says so explicitly. I think that, having regard to all the circumstances, Thompson might not unreasonably have assumed that he was at liberty to employ the tug in this way, but what is the legal relation arising from such employment? There was no contract by the owners of the Whalen respecting the capacity of their tug in relation to the towage of scows; the respondents employed the tug at their own risk, they took her as she was with her imperfections whatever they might be. At the same time while the captain was to take his towing orders from Thompson, he still was, in the navigation of the tug, I think, the servant of the appellants and therefore the appellants would be answerable for his negligent misfeasance in the course of such navigation. In the result the risk of deficiency of power must be borne by the appellants, and while adequate power would have saved the situation it is equally true that proper seamanship as the trial judge has found and I think satisfactorily found, would also have saved the situation. It follows, I think, that the appellants are responsible for the consequences of the negligent navigation. With respect to the events of the 12th, I am unable to ascribe to the appellants responsibility for any wrong arising out of those events; the refusal of the crew to go out was due, no doubt, to the experience of the day before, which was the consequence largely of the fact that Thompson had exercised his discretion by assigning to the tug a task which she was incapable of performing. That must have been obvious to the crew and it is not surprising that they declined to go; and it was not an unreasonable thing I think for the appellants, having been informed of the fact that the crew had refused to go out, to attach the condition that the tug should not be put in danger. They had not contracted that the safety of the tug should be risked in the towage of scows.\nIn the result the appellants are responsible but are entitled to a declaration limiting their liability under the statute.\nHaving regard to the difference of opinion, I agree to the disposition of the costs proposed.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Hodgins, sitting as local judge in Admiralty, I would affirm the judgment in favour of the respondents on the two matters to which the defendants restricted this appeal, viz., the reformation of the contract, or, more accurately, the determination of its scope, and the refusal of limitation of liability under section 921 of the Canada Shipping Act.\nThe question as to the terms of the contract depends chiefly on the respective credibility of the witnesses Kirkwood and Stewart. Giving to the letter on the 27th of October the weight to which it is undoubtedly entitled as evidence, nothing brought to my attention would lead me to boubt the soundness of the view on this aspect of the case, taken by the learned trial judge and affirmed on appeal. It would, I think, be a rash proceeding on our part to reverse the finding of the judge who tried the case and saw the witnesses on a pure question of credibility. Nocton v Ashburton[15] at page 945; Wood v Haines[16].\nAssuming therefore that the contract included the towing of the plaintiff's scows, the evidence is abundantly clear that the owners of the defendant tug were fully cognizant of the inadequacy of her power and equipment to handle those scows in such weather as was to be expected on Lake Ontario during November. Indeed the witness Kirkwood himself says that he would not have undertaken that responsibility because\nshe (the M. F. Whalen ) was not capable for it at that time of the year. It was dangerous. She might land them in, but it was risky business.\nThe evidence supports the finding that the inadequacy of the Whalen's powers was a contributing cause\u2014probably the chief cause\u2014of her captain finding himself obliged to cut the plaintiff's scow adrift.\nThe Whalen was not chosen by the plaintiffs for the purpose of towing their vessels. She was selected by her owners and accepted for their towing by the plaintiffs who had never seen her, on the assurance of the owners that she was equal to the \"Metax\" for which they had asked. Admittedly the Whalen did not develop as much power as the \"Metax\" did and her crew was inferior to that carried by the sister tug. The owners when sending the Whalen knew the capacity of the plaintiff's scows and, if they did not impliedly warrant that that tug was capable of handling them in such weather as might be expected at the season when it was employed, they at least undertook that she was as fit for that purpose as care and skill could render her. The West Cock[17]. Their knowledge of her deficiency in power and probably likewise of the inefficiency of her crew, which seems also to have been a contributing cause in bringing about the situation that led to the sending of the scow adrift, constituted fault on their part and deprives them of the benefit of section 921 of the Merchant Shipping Act.\nI also rather incline to accept the view put forward on behalf of the respondents that the refusal of the master of the Whalen to go out from Cobourg on the 12th day of November to pick up the plaintiff's scow, held to have been wrongful, was not \"improper navigation\" within sec. 921 (d) and that so far as it may have rendered the defendant liable the case is therefore not one for the application of that section.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant's counsel submitted his case on two points only:\u2014\n1. The learned trial judge should not have reformed the written contract by adding the words \"and scows\" after the word \"barges,\" thus making the agreement one for the towage of the respondent's scows as well as barges.\n2. The appellant is entitled to claim limitation of liability under section 921 of the Canada Shipping Act. On the first point we have the fact that the letter prepared by the respondent's manager, Mr. J. F. M. Stewart, on the 27th of October, 1920, after an interview of an hour's duration with Mr. T. R. Kirkwood, manager of the Kirkwood Steamship Line, owner of the appellant ship, mentions the towage of barges only. I must assume that this letter was deliberately prepared and that Mr. Stewart, who had dictated it, read it before he signed it. We have the further fact that when this action was started, the respondent, in its statement of claim, dated the 8th of January, 1921, alleged a contract made by the owners of the appellant ship for the towage \"of the plaintiffs' barges, light and loaded.\" And when the statement of defence, dated the 15th of January, 1921, set out that the contract did not cover the towage of the plaintiffs' scows, but only of its barges, the plaintiff, on the 21st of January, joined issue on the statement of defence without otherwise referring to the contract.\nUp to the time of the trial, it was therefore common ground between the parties that the contract was for the towage of the respondent's barges. During the trial, the respondent asked leave to amend its reply so as to claim that the towage included its scows as well as its barges, and by his judgment the learned trial judge rectified the contract accordingly.\nOn the issue of rectification of the contract, the evidence is restricted to the testimony of Kirkwood and of Stewart, the former of whom denied that the towage of the plaintiff's scows had been discussed. Stewart began by stating that the agreement with Kirkwood was that the tug furnished by him would tow all \"our equipment.\" When the learned trial judge asked Stewart why he called it \"equipment\" all the time, he answered \"it was a floating plant,\" and to a further question whether that was the word used by him throughout, he replied \"no, we would speak of barges by name and the scows by scows.\" Stewart cannot say whether Kirkwood ever saw the scows, but he says he certainly heard of the scows at that interview. He is unable to explain the letter of October 27th, except that \"that is the way the letter was written, it don't convey the intention\".\nI would naturally give every weight to the finding of a trial judge on a question of fact. But here I cannot agree that a proper case was made out at the trial for adding to the contract, after the word \"barges,\" the further words \"and scows.\" With deference, this is permitting a plaintiff, who finds that the letter evidencing the contract which he himself prepared and which he alleges and produces does not support his action, to have it rectified at the trial on his own testimony so as to bring in something which the writing does not mention. I do not think that Stewart's evidence really goes further\u2014and in this he is contradicted by Kirkwood\u2014than to state that scows were discussed at the interview with Kirkwood, and to say that Kirkwood was mistaken when he stated that he did not know that the boat was to tow scows. Stewart entirely fails to explain why, if scows were discussed, they were not mentioned in the letter, and it is his own letter which he now attempts to contradict. In my opinion he has failed in his attempt to contradict it and I find no evidence explicit enough to show that the towage of scows was a part of the contract agreed to by the owners of the tug. And if such towage was not a part of the contract the action cannot be maintained. On this point, therefore, without it being necessary to discuss the second question, I would allow the appeal.\nJudgment appealed from varied with a special direction as to costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Hague, Shaughnessy & Heward.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rowell, Reid, Wood, Wright & McMillan\n[1] 21 Ex.

Samson Es-qual (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nAlphonse Decarie (Defendant) Respondent.\n1921: October 24, 25; 1921: November 21.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ. and Bernier J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nSale\u2014Immoveable\u2014Registration\u2014Priority\u2014Fraud\u2014Title from the same vendor\u2014Registration of notice of verbal sale\u2014Effect as to third parties\u2014Arts. 1025, 1027, 2082, 2085, 2089, 2098 C.C.\nOn the 15th of October, 1910, the appellant's wife bought an immoveable property by oral contract from one D. She having died the appellant was appointed tutor to her children, heirs to the estate. On the 29th of November, 1910, D. was legally asked to sign a deed of sale but refused to do so. The next day D. died, leaving his wife B. as usufructuary legatee of his estate and naming her testamentary executrix with power to sell. In January, 1911, an action en passation de titre was brought by the appellant against B. In February, 1911, the appellant registered a notice or bordereau alleging the mis-en-demeure served upon D. On the 23rd of June, 1913, judgment was rendered maintaining the appellant's action, which judgment was confirmed on appeal, both judgments being registered as soon as rendered. On the 3rd of March, 1911, B. sold the same property to the respondent, who had knowledge of the alleged sale to appellant's wife and of the institution of the action en passation de titre, this deed of sale being registered some days later. After judgment had been rendered by the appellate court in the above action, the appellant brought the present action au petitoire against the respondent in order to be put in possession of the immoveable property.\nHeld that the mere fact of the respondent's knowledge of the anterior sale did not deprive him of the benefit of priority of registration of his own title. Held, also, that the registration by the appellant of a bordereau indicating a verbal sale to him of the property is not equivalent to the registration of a right in or to that property within the purview of the registration provisions of the code.\nHeld, also, that the appellant and the respondent \"derive their respective titles from the same person\" within the terms of art. 2089 C.C., although the first bought the property from the owner and the second from his universal legatee and testamentary executrix.\nPer Duff, Mignault and Bernier JJ.\u2014Although there is res judicata against the respondent as to the validity of an anterior title to the appellant, that does not deprive the respondent of the benefit of the prior registration of his own title.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 29 K. B. 273) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review and affirming the judgment of the trial court by which the appellant's action was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nPaul St.-Germain K.C. for the appellant: The registration of the bordereau was sufficient within the terms of article 2085 C.C. to give knowledge to third parties of appellant's rights to the property.\nThe appellant and the respondent did not \"derive their respective titles from the same person\" within the terms of article 2089 C.C.\nThere is res judicata against the respondent as to the validity of appellant's title.\nThe respondent's title is void on account of fraud.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Alphonse D\u00e9cary K.C. for the respondent:\u2014The notice received or knowledge acquired of an unregistered right cannot prejudice the rights of a subsequent purchaser whose title is duly registered (art. 2085 C.C.).\nPaul St.-Germain K.C. for the appellant\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Alphonse D\u00e9cary K.C. for the respondent\nIdington J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs. I agree that there are some suspicious circumstances tending to establish fraud but when the mere fact of knowledge is eliminated therefrom by virtue of art. 2085 C.C. I cannot say that the courts below have clearly erred in failing to find fraud, and thereby render inoperative the provision in said article.\nDuff J.\u2014On the whole I think the charge of fraud fails and as on that point I agree with the view taken in the courts below it is unnecessary to discuss it. I observe only with respect to article 2085 C.C that while it deprives notice or knowledge of an unregistered right of any effect as prejudicing the title of the purchaser who complies with the provisions of the law in relation to registration, it does not follow that such knowledge may not be cogent evidence which coupled with other circumstances may afford adequate proof of fraud on part of such purchaser disentitling him to rely upon the rights which otherwise would be his. On the other hand it is important to be on one's guard against applying this process of inference in such a way as virtually to equiparate knowledge itself with fraud thereby in effect sterilizing the enactment of the article.\nMr. St. Germain's contentions subdivide themselves under two heads. 1st, he invokes article 2089 C.C. and argues that the respondent did not derive his title from a person who is \"the same person\" as the appellant's auteur. The provisions requiring consideration under this head are articles 2082, 2089 and the first two paragraphs of 2098. Textually they are as follows:\u2014\n2082.\u2014Registration gives effect to real rights and establishes their order of priority according to the provisions contained in this title.\n2089.\u2014The preference which results from the prior registration of the deed of conveyance of an immoveable obtains only between purchasers who derive their respective titles from the same person.\n2098.\u2014All acts inter vivos conveying the ownership of an immoveable must be registered at length, or by memorial.\nIn default of such registration, the title of conveyance cannot be invoked against any third party who has purchased the same property from the same vendor for a valuable consideration and whose title is registered.\nThe farm in question was orally sold in October, 1910, to the appellant's wife by J. B. Brien dit Desrochers, who died in the following month leaving a will by which he appointed his wife usufructuary for life of his estate and his sole testamentary executrix with power to dispose of the estate. In January, 1911, she sold the farm to the respondent by a notarial deed which was registered in the following August. In February, 1911, the appellant's wife filed in the registry a declaration setting forth the facts in relation to the oral sale (a declaration admittedly without effect under the registration provisions of the code) and, on some day prior to July, 1911, she commenced an action to enforce her rights under this sale. In this action judgment was given in her favour in June, 1913, by the Superior Court and this judgment was confirmed in September, 1914, by the Court of King's Bench.\nMr. St. Germain argues that the respondent's title is derived at least in part through a sale by Madame Desrochers as devisee under her husband's will and that Madame Desrochers in her quality as such devisee is not within the meaning of the article \"the same person\" as her husband, the contract with whom constitutes in essence the basis of his client's title. Whether the respondent does in truth take his title in part from Madame Desrochers as devisee or whether it ought not rather to be held that he derives his title in its entirety from her as executrix of her husband's will is a debatable point. I assume that Madame Desrochers, who in the deed of conveyance professed to act as testamentary executrix of her husband as well as in her own personal right, did convey the interest vested in her by the devise to her as usufructuary in her capacity as owner of the usufruct and not in her capacity as executrix.\nThe question then arises whether article 2085 C.C. applies where the \"titles\" coming into competition are on the one hand a \"title\" derived directly by a sale for valuable consideration from the owner and on the other hand a \"title\" derived by such a sale from a donatee, devisee or legatee of the same owner.\nBefore proceeding to an examination of the language of article 2089 C.C. and of 2098 C.C., which must be considered with it, let us note the general effect of these provisions of the code on the subject of registration. By the first of the articles above quoted registration \"gives effect to real rights and establishes their priority.\" Certain classes of rights are, by article 2087 C.C., exempt from registration, but this provision does not concern us here. The object of the provisions as of all analogous systems is to facilitate the acquisition of title to land and to enhance the security of the possessors of such titles by diminishing the causes and occasions of uncertainty, an object too obviously important to require comment. The common law rule that one can give a title only to that of which one is owner is profoundly modified by these provisions. Speaking generally notwithstanding one has made a sale of one's real property for valuable consideration and notwithstanding the property has, as between the parties, passed to the purchaser yet the title of the earlier purchaser may be displaced outright through the superior activity of a subsequent purchaser (for valuable consideration) in registering his own.\nOn the other hand it must be noted that the system of registration set up by these provisions of the code is, broadly, a system of registration of instruments rather than a system of registration of titles. Speaking without reference to some possible exceptions at present immaterial, registration does not in itself afford protection erga omnes. As usual in a system of registration of instruments as contrasted with a system of registration of titles, registration is available only in favour of the recipient of a given title through transfer or devolution as against another claiming to have acquired the same title, that is to say, claiming to have acquired a title from the same ultimate source. Registration may protect A. who has acquired the title of B. either directly or mediately as against C., who claims also to have acquired the title of B., and would have been able to make good his claim but for the obstacle created by the competition of A; but registration would not assist a purchaser relying upon a transfer from a grantee under a patent from the Dominion Government as against another deriving his title by grant from the Crown in right of the province where the property was prior to its transfer in point of law the property of the province. This appears to be the characteristic of the system which articles 2089 C.C. and 2098 C.C. are intended to mark, the first speaking from the point of view of the advantages attached to prior registration and the second envisaging the situation with special reference to the penalty incurred in consequence of default in registration. Referring to the language of article 2089 C.C. the words \"purchasers who derive their respective titles from the same person\" seem on the fair construction of them to apply to and to include purchasers who claim to have acquired the same title. The language of article 2098 C.C. ought to be read with that of 2089 C.C. and construed by the light of it. The narrow construction contended for by Mr. St. Germain would greatly restrict the operation of these provisions and impair their efficacy in furtherance of the object designed to be secured by them.\nUnder the second head Mr. St. Germain contends that the question in controversy was determined by earlier litigation. Mr. St. Germain is on solid ground when he argues that where a title to real estate is in controversy res judicata is not necessarily limited in its effect to the immediate parties to the action. It has often been said that the real basis of the res judicata doctrine is to be found in the considerations indicated in the brocard, interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium. From this point of view the rule would entirely fail of its purpose if it were possible to evade it by successive transfers of the property in dispute. But here again we are under the dominion of this system of registration. I find nothing in these articles implying such an exception as Mr. St. Germain must establish in order to make good his argument. There is nothing here to indicate that a registered title is subject to a claim based upon some unregistered transaction merely because that claim has been put in suit prior to the date of the instrument or contract upon which the registered title rests. It is perhaps unfortunate that the articles contain no provision for the registration of lis pendens. But that lis pendens should override rights which otherwise would follow from registration\u2014lis pendens necessarily unregistered because there is no provision for such registration\u2014would constitute a most serious defect which one is not sorry to find is not disclosed on a scrutiny of these provisions.\nAnglin J.\u2014This appeal in my opinion fails. The deposit and recording in the registry office of a protest formulating the claim of the plaintiff to the property in question was not registration of the right in or to that property which the court subsequently held that her oral contract gave her.\nThe plaintiff and the defendant were purchasers who derived their respective titles from the same person (auteur). The contract of the former was with the testator, Desrochers; her title was the judgment of the court declared to be equivalent to a deed from his executrix. The contract and title of the latter were with and from the executrix es-qual. The defendant is entitled to the benefit of priority of registration established by art. 2089 C.C.\nThe plaintiff's judgment against Desrochers' executrix, recovered after the conveyance to the defendant, was nothing more than an enforcement of the rights conferred by Desrochers' unregistered oral contract with the plaintiff. Those rights, declared by Art. 1025 C.C. are, by Art. 1027 C.C., expressly made subject to the special provisions of the code for the registration of titles and claims to property. The plaintiff's judgment gave her no higher right than the contract which it purported to enforce. The prior registration of the defendant's deed therefore prevails against it.\nWhile there is not a little in the evidence to suggest fraud, it is not so clearly shown as to warrant our making the finding for the plaintiff on that issue which she failed to obtain in the Superior Court, the Court of Review, and the Court of King's Bench. Notice or knowledge of a prior unregistered right, however direct and distinct, does not suffice to render subject to it the registered title of a subsequent purchaser for value.\nMignault J.\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente un conflit entre deux parties qui r\u00e9clament le m\u00eame immeubie en vertu de deux titres translatifs de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et le jugement dont l'appelant se plaint a r\u00e9solu ce conflit en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 qui a la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement.\nLe 15 octobre 1910, l'\u00e9pouse de l'appelant, maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e et que l'appelant repr\u00e9sente comme tuteur de ses enfants h\u00e9ritiers de leur m\u00e8re, a achet\u00e9 cet immeuble du nomm\u00e9 Jean\u2013Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers par une vente verbale. Celui-ci mourut peu apr\u00e8s, laissant un testament par lequel il donnait l'usufruit de ses biens \u00e0 sa femme, Dame Marguerite Bricault, qu'il nommait son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire avec des pouvoirs d'ali\u00e9nation tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus\nMise en demeure de signer un acte de vente en faveur de Mde. Samson, Marguerite Bricault s'y refusa, et une action fut intent\u00e9e contre elle pour l'y contraindre. Marguerite Bricault contesta cette action, pr\u00e9tendant qu'il n'y avait eu que des pourparlers et non pas une vente conclue, mais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure donna raison \u00e0 l'appelant et \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse par jugement rendu le 23 juin, 1913, et Marguerite Bricault ayant port\u00e9 la cause en appel, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi le 30 septembre, 1914[2]. Chacun de ces jugements fut enregistr\u00e9 peu apr\u00e8s sa reddition.\nJusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il e\u00fbt obtenu jugement dans Taction en passation de titre, l'appelant n'avait pas de titre qui p\u00fbt \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9, la vente \u00e9tant verbale, mais, en f\u00e9vrier 1911, avant la date du titre de l'intim\u00e9, sa femme fit enregistrer un avis, sous forme de bordereau, de sa pr\u00e9tention d'avoir achet\u00e9 l'immeuble par vente verbale.\nLe 3 mars, 1911, pendant que l'action en passation de titre suivait la marche assez lente que les d\u00e9lais de la proc\u00e9dure et l'encombrement des affaires judiciaires lui imposaient, l'intim\u00e9 acheta cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Marguerite Bricault \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire de son mari, et son contrat de vente fut enregistr\u00e9 au mois d'ao\u00fbt de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Lors de cette acquisition, l'intim\u00e9 savait que l'\u00e9pouse de l'appelant avait poursuivi Marguerite Bricault en passation de titre, mais comme il a priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement, il pr\u00e9tend que cette connaissance n'affecte pas la validit\u00e9 de son achat. L'appelant, qui a maintenant un titre judiciaire, conteste cette pr\u00e9tention. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelant, qui avait eu gain de cause devant la Cour de Revision \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 des juges, et dans la Cour du Banc du Roi, l'honorable juge Pelletier aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis de confirmer le jugement de la Cour de Revision. Cette diff\u00e9rence d'opinion parmi les juges qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis de cette cause fait bien voir qu'elle n'est pas d'une solution facile. On ne saurait douter de la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement de l'intim\u00e9, et si la question d'enregistrement prime toutes les autres questions que soul\u00e8ve l'appelant, celui-ci ne peut r\u00e9ussir dans son appel \u00e0 cette cour; car l'enregistrement du bordereau \u00e9non\u00e7ant la pr\u00e9tention de Mme Samson d'avoir acquis l'immeuble par vente verbale ne peut compter comme l'enregistrement du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement reconnu par les tribunaux, et aucune disposition du code n'autorisait l'enregistrement d'un tel avis. Du reste, ce n'est qu'un avis, et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'intim\u00e9 invoque l'article 2085 C.C. qui rend un tel avis inefficace contre celui qui a la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement. Cet article, qui vient des statuts refondus du Bas-Canada, chapitre 37, art. 5, et de l'ordonnance de l'enregistrement de 1841, 4 Vic., ch. 30, art. 1er, se lit comme suit:\nL'avis re\u00e7u ou la connaissance acquise d'un droit non-enregistr\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 un tiers et sujet \u00e0 la formalit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement ne peut pr\u00e9judicier aux droits de celui qui a acquis depuis pour valeur, en vertu d'un titre d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9, sauf les cas o\u00f9 l'acte proc\u00e8de d'un failli.\nLes conditions requises ici sont l'acquisition pour valeur, l'enregistrement du titre, et le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement du droit du tiers Quand ces conditions se rencontrent, malgr\u00e9 l'avis re\u00e7u ou la connaissance du droit du tiers, le titre enregistr\u00e9 le premier, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa date, l'emporte sur le droit non enregistr\u00e9 ou qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 que plus tard. Et bien que le titre post\u00e9rieur en date, quand il s'agit de ventes successives consenties par la m\u00eame personne, proc\u00e8de d'un non-propri\u00e9taire et ne conf\u00e8re aucun droit d'apr\u00e8s les principes du droit civil, n\u00e9anmoins, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des tiers et pour leur protection, si ce titre post\u00e9rieur en date a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 le premier, il pr\u00e9vaudra contre la premi\u00e8re vente qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e ou qui ne l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 que plus tard. Comme le faisait observer Sir Alexandre Lacoste, juge-en-chef, dans la cause de Barsalou v. The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning[3], notre syst\u00e8me d'enregistrement a profond\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9 notre droit. Il convient de tenir compte de cette remarque dans l'\u00e9tude de la cause qui nous est soumise.\nC'est ainsi qu'apr\u00e8s avoir rendu la vente un contrat purement consensuel, sans que la d\u00e9livrance soit n\u00e9cessaire comme autrefois (art. 1025 C.C.), le code subordonne cette r\u00e8gle, quand il s'agit de la vente immobili\u00e8re et des droits des tiers, aux lois de l'enregistrement (art. 1027 C.C.). Mais pour que la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement fasse pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer la seconde vente \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re, il faut que les deux ventes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le m\u00eame auteur (art. 2089 C.C.) (la version anglaise dit \"the same person\"), ou pour me servir de l'expression de l'article 2098 C.C. par le m\u00eame vendeur.\nL'appelant dit: \"J'ai achet\u00e9 de Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers, l'intim\u00e9 a achet\u00e9 de Marguerite Bricault, son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire. Il est vrai que j'ai poursuivi cette derni\u00e8re en passation de titre, mais je ne pouvais faire autrement, Brien dit Desrochers \u00e9tant mort, et son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire \u00e9tant la seule personne qui p\u00fbt me donner un titre. Les deux ventes ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par deux personnes diff\u00e9rentes.\"\nS'il en \u00e9tait ainsi, les articles 2085, 2089 et 2098 C.C. ne s'appliqueraient pas \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce, et la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement serait indiff\u00e9rente, la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre \u00e9tant de savoir lequel des deux vendeurs avait le droit de vendre l'immeuble. L'argument que formule ici l'appelant se rattache \u00e0 une autre de ses pr\u00e9tentions que son avocat a soutenue avec beaucoup de talent, savoir qu'il y aurait chose jug\u00e9e entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 quant au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du premier.\nParlons d'abord de cette question de chose jug\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 est le successeur \u00e0 titre particulier de Dame Marguerite Bricault. Or le successeur \u00e0 titre particulier est li\u00e9 par le jugement rendu contre son auteur avant la naissance de ses droits, ou l'accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s qui les ont rendus opposables aux tiers. Si la transmission des droits du successeur \u00e0 titre particulier se fait pendant l'instance, il est pareillement li\u00e9 par le jugement qui en d\u00e9termine l'existence ou la nature puisque ce jugement r\u00e9troagit au jour de la demande. J'emprunte \u00e0 Huc, tome 8, No 314, l'exposition de cette doctrine qui rencontre tous les suffrages sur le premier point, et qui, sur le second, est celle de la majorit\u00e9 des auteurs, (Demolombe, Contrats, tome 7, nos 552 et suivants, \u00e9tant, autant que je puis le constater, le seul dissident):\n314. Quant aux successeurs \u00e0 titre particulier, ils auront \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par leur auteur dans les jugements rendus avec celui-ci ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la naissance de leurs droits ou plus exactement avant que leurs droits soient devenus opposables aux tiers par l'accomplissement, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, des formalit\u00e9s requises \u00e0 cet effet (Comp. art. 939; L. 23 mars 1855, art. 1, art. 1690).\nSi la transmission a eu lieu avant la demande, le jugement qui s'en est suivi ne sera pas opposable au successeur. Il en est des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires comme des conventions qui ne sauraient avoir effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers en possession de droits r\u00e9els, que si elles sont ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces droits sont devenus opposables \u00e0 ceux qui n'ont pas concouru \u00e0 leur \u00e9tablissement. C'est ce qui est admis sans difficult\u00e9 pour les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'usufruit et autres d\u00e9membrements de ce genre. Mais il y a controverse pour l'hypoth\u00e8que, et on a soutenu que le r\u00e9sultat d'un proc\u00e8s post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la constitution de ce droit r\u00e9el, qui est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un d\u00e9membrement du jus abutendi, nuira au cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie au proc\u00e8s. La raison de d\u00e9cider para\u00eet cependant \u00eatre la m\u00eame. Nous reviendrons plus tard sur ce point. Enfin, la transmission peut se placer entre la demande et le jugement. Il semble que cette hypoth\u00e8se doive rentrer dans la premi\u00e8re, puisque le jugement ayant un effet seulement d\u00e9claratif remonte en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 au jour de la demande. Par cons\u00e9quent, il suffit que le titre d'acquisition de l'ayant cause \u00e0 titre particulier soit post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'introduction de l'instance li\u00e9e avec son auteur, ou que ce titre n'ait produit d'effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du tiers qu'apr\u00e8s l'introduction de l'instance, pour que la chose jug\u00e9e entre l'auteur et le tiers puisse \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ayant cause, acqu\u00e9reur, donataire, cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire ou privil\u00e9gi\u00e9, usufruitier ou possesseur d'une servitude.\nS'il y a chose jug\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9, ce serait sur le fait que le 15 octobre, 1910, Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers a vendu \u00e0 Madame Samson l'immeuble que l'intim\u00e9 a subs\u00e9quemment achet\u00e9 de son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, car c'est l\u00e0 tout ce qu'on a jug\u00e9 dans l'action en passation de titre. C'est comme si l'appelant apportait un acte notari\u00e9 de vente consenti ce jour-l\u00e0 par Brien dit Desrochers. D'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles du droit civil, ind\u00e9pendamment des lois d'enregistrement, l'appelant dans cette hypoth\u00e8se devrait avoir gain de cause.\nMais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment il y a les lois de l'enregistrement et nous avons vu qu'elles ont profond\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9 les principes du droit civil. L'article 2085 C.C. suppose que le tiers a un droit r\u00e9el certain, ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9, mais ce droit, ou plut\u00f4t l'\u00e9crit qui le constate, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9, et il aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre.\nSi l'effet de la chose jug\u00e9e dans l'esp\u00e8ce est que l'intim\u00e9 ne peut contester maintenant que Mme. Samson ait achet\u00e9 cet immeuble de Jean Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers le 15 octobre 1910, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire qu'elle avait un titre ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de l'intim\u00e9, tout comme si elle produisait un acte de vente devant notaire pass\u00e9 le 15 octobre 1910. Cependant ce titre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 avant celui de l'intim\u00e9 et ce dernier, malgr\u00e9 la connaissance qu'il en a eu et la pr\u00e9somption de chose jug\u00e9e qui l'emp\u00eache de le contester, peut se pr\u00e9valoir de son d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement. Pour cette raison, la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e ne fournit pas une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'objection fond\u00e9e sur Particle 2085 C.C.\nMais l'appelant soutient qu'il ne s'agit pas ici de deux ventes consenties par le m\u00eame auteur ou le m\u00eame vendeur. Il dit avec une certaine plausibilit\u00e9 que la vente du 15 octobre 1910 a distrait cet immeuble de la succession de Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers, qu'il ne tombe pas sous l'empire de son testament et, partant, que l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire n'a pas re\u00e7u mandat de le vendre.\nA mon sens, c'est la principale difficult\u00e9 en cette cause. Pourtant cette difficult\u00e9 deviendra moindre si on peut dire, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9, que Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers, l'auteur de Mme. Samson, et son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, l'auteur de l'intim\u00e9, sont la m\u00eame personne juridiquement parlant. Car alors nous aurons la situation m\u00eame qu'envisage l'article 2098 C.C., un deuxi\u00e8me contrat de vente qui est consenti par un non-propri\u00e9taire, mais qui, \u00e0 raison de sa priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement, l'emporte sur le premier contrat.\nDu reste, prenons l'hypoth\u00e8se la plus favorable \u00e0 l'appelant, une vente par Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers de l'immeuble en question, vente qui a distrait cet immeuble de sa succession et qui a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, pro tanto, le mandat donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire de vendre ses biens. Il est \u00e0 remarquer que l'article 897 C.C. quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9vocation tacite d'un legs par l'ali\u00e9nation de la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, ne s'applique normalement qu'au legs \u00e0 titre particulier, mais supposons qu'il y ait eu ici r\u00e9vocation, bien qu'il soit plus exact et enti\u00e8rement suffisant de dire que cet immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 distrait de la succession. Dans ce cas l'appelant peut-il pr\u00e9tendre que le titre de l'intim\u00e9 est nul? Malheureusement je suis forc\u00e9 de conclure que les lois de l'enregistrement lui barrent encore le chemin, car je suppose qu'il a maintenant un titre provenant du testateur. Mais ce titre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l'enregistrement du contrat de l'intim\u00e9. D'autre part, le testament de Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 lors de la vente faite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, avec, nous a dit le savant avocat de l'appelant, la d\u00e9claration requise par l'article 2098 C.C., contenant la d\u00e9signation de l'immeuble en question. Dans ces circonstances l'appelant, avec sa vente non-enregistr\u00e9e provenant du testateur, peut-il attaquer le titre du tiers qui a trait\u00e9 avec l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire sur la foi de l'enregistrement du testament et de la d\u00e9claration de transmission d\u00e9signant cet immeuble? Je r\u00e9ponds n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 cette question, car autrement la protection des tiers par l'enregistrement serait enti\u00e8rement illusoire. On ne devrait certainement pas donner plus d'effet au titre obtenu par l'appelant que si Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers avait, apr\u00e8s ce titre, accord\u00e9 sans droit un titre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et alors la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement r\u00e9glerait le conflit.\nReste un seul point. Jean-Baptiste Brien dit Desrochers et Marguerite Bricault, son ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, sont-ils la m\u00eame personne juridiquement parlant? L'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire est le mandataire du testateur de qui il tient tous ses pouvoirs. Or les actes accomplis par le mandataire sont les actes du mandant, car qui facit per alium facit per se. La loi a permis au testateur de conf\u00e9rer un mandat qui commencerait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque m\u00eame o\u00f9 finit le mandat ordinaire, le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mandant. Mais ce mandat, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, produit les m\u00eames effets que le mandat inter vivos, et les actes du mardataire \u00e9tant ceux du mandant, la vente faite par l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire en vertu de ce mandat de vendre est, juridiquement parlant, une vente faite par le testateur. Il y a donc identit\u00e9 juridique de personnes dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nIl y a bien la question de fraude. Je dois avouer que la bonne foi de l'intim\u00e9 me para\u00eet suspecte, mais je ne puis aller jusqu'\u00e0 dire qu'il y a eu de sa part collusion frauduleuse avec Marguerite Bricault qui, elle, a commis une fraude bien \u00e9vidente \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'appelant. Aucun des juges, \u00e0 l'exception de l'honorable Juge Pelletier, n'est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y avait eu collusion frauduleuse, m\u00eame la Cour de R\u00e9vision qui a maintenu l'action de l'appelant. Si la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu fraude, je ne me serais pas cru autoris\u00e9, avec la preuve au dossier, \u00e0 infirmer son jugement, mais le savant juge qui a vu tous les t\u00e9moins a rejet\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de fraude de l'appelant. Dans ces circonstances, je ne crois pas que cette cour, la quatri\u00e8me \u00e0 \u00eatre saisie du proc\u00e8s, doive accueillir maintenant cette accusation de fraude.\n\u00c0 tous \u00e9gards, je suis forc\u00e9 d'en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appel est mal fond\u00e9. Cependant l'appelant est r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 plaindre car, avec toute diligence possible, apr\u00e8s son imprudence initiale de traiter verbalement d'une vente immobili\u00e8re, il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d'obtenir la protection de l'enregistrement. Cela d\u00e9montre qu'il y a une lacune dans la loi de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec. Dans les autres provinces, lorsqu'on intente un proc\u00e8s relativement \u00e0 un immeuble, on peut obtenir sommairement d'un juge l'autorisation de faire enregistrer ce qu'on appelle un lis pendens, et alors les tiers traitent avec le propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 leurs risques et p\u00e9rils. Rien de tel n'existe en la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et cette lacune devrait attirer l'attention du l\u00e9gislateur. Dans cette cause je ne puis faire autrement que de suivre la loi telle qu'elle existe et il en r\u00e9sulte que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nBernier J.\u2014Deux appels nous sont soumis; l'un sur une action p\u00e9titoire de l'appelant contre l'intim\u00e9, et l'autre sur une action en radiation d'hypoth\u00e8que de l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelant.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a rendu jugement, dans les deux causes, en faveur de l'intim\u00e9; mais la Cour de R\u00e9vision a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement et sur appel la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenu le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLes principales questions \u00e0 d\u00e9cider sont les suivantes :\n1. Le document enregistr\u00e9 le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1911 par l'appelant ou son auteur, et comportant une d\u00e9claration qu'il aurait achet\u00e9 par vente verbale, le 13 octobre 1910, certains biens de feu J.-B. Brien dit Desrochers, comporte-t-il l'enregistrement d'un droit r\u00e9el suffisant pour prot\u00e9ger ses droits, aux d\u00e9sirs de la loi?\nJe ne crois pas. Ce document est unilat\u00e9ral; il n'est pas le bordereau d'un titre ou d'un contrat \u00e9crit et consenti entre deux parties; il \u00e9nonce un droit d'acheteur seulement; Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 l'inscription ou le bordereau dont parle le code quand il s'agit d'enregistrer un acte de vente.\n2. L'intim\u00e9 ayant achet\u00e9 les m\u00eames terrains de l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire de feu Desrochers, savoir Dame Marguerite Bricault, le 3 mars 1911, et ayant fait enregistrer cet acte le 4 avril 1911, l'appelant ne p\u00fbt faire enregistrer le jugement dans l'action en passation de titre, qu'il avait prise contre cette derni\u00e8re, que le 15 juillet 1913. Dans ce cas, ce jugement, ayant effet r\u00e9troactif jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la prise de l'action en passation de titre, savoir \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e 1910, ou au commencement de 1911, conf\u00e9rait-il \u00e0 l'appelant des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les biens \u00e0 lui vendus?\nNon, car l'enregistrement de l'acte d'achat de l'intim\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avant l'enregistrement du jugement obtenu par l'appelant, privait ce dernier du b\u00e9nifice de son achat verbal et du jugement qui lui en a accord\u00e9 le titre. (Art. 1027, 2085, 2089, 2098 C.C.).\nL'enr\u00e9gistrement des droits r\u00e9els est d'ordre public; on ne peut, partant, interpr\u00e9ter les articles du code qui y ont rapport, dans un sens diff\u00e9rent de celui qu'ils indiquent tr\u00e8s clairement. Vouloir faire des distinctions, alors que le code n'en fait pas; invoquer la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 d'un jugement pour faire primer l'enregistrement d'un jugement sur l'enregistrement ant\u00e9rieur d'un contrat, serait ouvrir la porte \u00e0 l'arbitraire.\nA l'\u00e9gard des tiers par cons\u00e9quent, la vente des biens immeubles n'est parfaite que par l'enregistrement du titre de vente; cette formalit\u00e9 est essentielle, quoiqu'en principe une vente soit parfaite par le seul consentement des parties contractantes.\nLes lois d'enregistrement sont une exception \u00e0 bien des principes de droit civil, puisqu'une m\u00eame personne peut vendre successivement \u00e0 deux acheteurs un m\u00eame immeuble, et conf\u00e9rer au second, s'il fait enregistrer son titre avant le premier, un droit valable de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n3. Les deux actes d'achat qui sont en pr\u00e9sence dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, proviennent-ils du m\u00eame auteur, dans le sens l\u00e9gal? L'auteur de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire de l'auteur de l'appelant; de plus, par le testament, elle avait le pouvoir de vendre les biens de la succession.\nElle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement h\u00e9riti\u00e8re en usufruit de ces m\u00eames biens.\nJe suis d'opinion qu'elle avait, en ces diverses qualit\u00e9s d'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re, de mandataire et d'ex\u00e9cutrice la saisine l\u00e9gale et requise pour continuer la personnalit\u00e9 juridique du testateur.\nElle repr\u00e9sentait le testateur; elle n'avait pas plus de droits que lui peut-\u00eatre, de vendre les biens en question; mais elle \u00e9tait dans la m\u00eame condition que lui, c'est-\u00e0-dire, que serait une personne qui vend un bien \u00e0 deux acheteurs successifs et dont le second fait enregistrer son titre d'achat avant le premier.\n4. L'appelant invoque la fraude dont se serait rendu coupable l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire et l'intim\u00e9, pour le priver de ses droits.\nLes t\u00e9moignages ne sont pas absolument convaincants pour en venir \u00e0 d\u00e9cider ce point en faveur de l'appelant.\nL'intim\u00e9 avait certainement connaissance des droits que pr\u00e9tendait, avec raison, avoir l'appelant ; il a su \u00e9galement que ce dernier avait intent\u00e9 son action en passation de titre, lorsqu'il a fait enregistrer son acte d'achat.\nMais telle connaissance n'est pas suffisante pour \u00e9tablir fraude de sa part. Cette connaissance, dit l'article 2085 C.C., ne peut pr\u00e9judicier aux droits de celui qui a acquis pour valeur, en vertu d'un titre d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9.\nEn supposant m\u00eame qu'il f\u00fbt de mauvaise foi\u2014 ce qui n'est pas absolument prouv\u00e9\u2014il n'y a pas de preuve suffisante pour dire qu'il y a eu fraude concert\u00e9e entre lui et son auteur, pour priver l'appelant de ses droits. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite non plus, que l'acte d'achat de l'intim\u00e9, \u00e9tait un acte simul\u00e9.\nJe suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent : D\u00e9cary & D\u00e9cary.\n[1] Q.

[1906] s. 20; 7-8 Geo. 7, c. 23.\nUnder a lease for an indefinite period and terminable on fourteen days' notice the Government of Canada occupied the basement and first floor of a building as a recruiting station in 1916-17. A fire originating on the premises while so occupied destroyed property belonging to the tenants of adjacent premises who claimed compensation by petition of right.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court (20 Ex. C.R. 306) Duff J. dissenting, that the portion of the building so occupied by the Government was not a \"public work\" within the meaning of that term as used in subsec. (c) of sec. 20 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nPer Duff J.: The meaning of \"public work\" as that term is used in subsec. (c) is not confined to property of which the Crown has a title not less ample than a title in fee simple or to property constructed or in course of construction by the Crown.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.: It includes any operation undertaken by or on behalf of the Crown in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the Crown.\nThe material question raised by the appeal and the facts on which it depends are stated in the head-note. As to whether or not the fire which destroyed the suppliant's property was caused by the negligence of an officer or servant of the Crown the opinion of the majority of the Court appears to be against the judgment appealed from.\nFripp K.C. for the appellants. The fire was caused by negligence of servants of the Crown in placing a stove close to inflammable woodwork. See Scott v. London and St. Katherine Dock Co.[2]. McLean v. Rhodes Curry & Co.[3].\nThe recruiting station was a public work for the purposes of the Exchequer Court Act. The provisions of the Public Works Act may be applied to construe subsection (c) and leave no doubt on the matter.\nHogg K.C. for the respondent referred to Larose v. The Queen[4]; City of Quebec v. The Queen[5]\nFripp K.C. for the appellants.\nHogg K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The suppliants in each of these cases in their respective petitions of right claimed damages against the Crown, the former to the extent of $23,245.85 and the latter to the extent of $18,800.00, on the grounds that they were carrying on business in Ottawa on the 13th of December, 1917, and for some years previously and that as stated in their petition on the said 13th day of December, A.D. 1917, the Department of Militia and Defence occupied the adjoining premises, a public work of Canada, and, owing to the negligence and want of proper care on the part of the said Department, its servants and agents, by using a defective stove and pipes and by negligence over-heating of the same and by neglect of a watchman in charge of said stove in leaving the premises while the stoves and pipes were overheated, the said premises were carelessly and negligently set on fire, destroying the said building and premises so occupied by the Department, and also the stock-in-trade of the suppliants.\nThe two appeals were by order consolidated and heard together.\nThe two questions on which the appeals turned were whether the premises occupied by the Department of Militia and Defence at the time of the fire were a public work within the meaning of the Exchequer Court Act, or the Public Works Act of Canada, and, if so, whether the fire originated from the negligence of the officials of the department acting within the scope of their duties or employment.\nMr. Justice Audette of the Exchequer Court held adversely to the appellants on both grounds and after giving the arguments at bar and the evidence every consideration, I have reached the conclusion that he was right.\nAs a fact it appears that the Department of Militia occupied only the basement and ground floor of the Arcade Building as a recruiting station for soldiers under an agreement to vacate at any time after giving fourteen days' notice. The Arcade Building itself was not leased nor occupied by the department but only the ground floor and basement, and the occupation was merely temporary, determinable on giving fourteen days' notice.\nIt may be, I admit, somewhat difficult to decide in some cases what is or is not a public work within the meaning of the Act and I do not think it desirable to attempt any definite interpretation of the words \"public work\". Every case arising must be determined on its own special facts. But in the cases now before us it is sufficient to say, and I have no hesitation in holding, that the temporary occupation of the basement and ground floor of the Arcade Building subject to its being determined on a fourteen days notice could not constitute the whole building a public work or, apart from the whole building, make the basement which was occupied such a work. To my mind such a conclusion offends one's common sense and I agree with the finding of Audette J. when he says:\nThe words \"public work\" mentioned in section 20 of The Exchequer Court Act must be taken to be used as verily contemplating a public work in truth and reality, and not that which is mentioned in The Public Works Act or in The Expropriation Act for the purposes of each Act.\nThis conclusion makes it, perhaps, unnecessary to determine the other point of alleged negligence on the part of the Crown officials causing the fire. I feel bound to say, however, after a close examination of the evidence, that I am unable, like the learned trial judge, to discover any such negligence. The evidence given by the fire inspector, Latimer, as to conditions found by him after the fire was over, was that the stove standing in the south-east corner of the basement and which it was suggested caused the fire, had not burnt the floor on which it stood; \"that part of the floor\", he said \"was all right and the wood-work around there was there still. The woodwork, except a piece of the ledge of the window, was intact\". Altogether I could not help being satisfied from this and other evidence that the surmise of some witnesses of the fire having originated from the stove in the south-east corner of the basement could not be upheld. On the contrary, it is my opinion that the fire originated from other causes unknown.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014I have read the evidence in this case to see if by any possibility there was any evidence upon which to rest the claims herein of negligence on the part of those in respondent's service being the cause of the fire in question.\nI can find none. The mere surmise or suspicion of a fire inspector is far from proof of anything.\nWe cannot hold, even if a negligent state of things exist in a given place, that a fire which started in that place must of necessity be attributable to such negligence.\nIt needs something else to establish legal liability and I cannot find such facts existent herein as to justify the inference we are asked to draw.\nThese appeals should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The Department of Militia and Defence leased and occupied the basement and first floor of the Arcade Building at a rental of $200 a month, a term of the agreement being that the department was to be at liberty to vacate the premises so leased at any time upon giving 14 days notice to the owner of their intention to do so. The three flats above the first floor in the same building were vacant. The Militia Department used the building as a recruiting office and for that purpose occupied it during the years 1916-7. On the 13th December, 1917, these premises were destroyed by fire and the appellants, Wolfe & Co. and Powers Bros., who occupied the premises immediately adjoining on either side, had their several stocks in trade destroyed by a fire which indisputably originated in the recruiting office. The question to be determined is whether a right of action against the Crown has been established within the scope of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act as amended in 1917. As a result of that amendment s.s. (c) of that section takes the following form:\u2014\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to a person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nThe first point for examination, and indeed it is the point upon which Mr. Hogg chiefly relied, is whether, assuming the allegation that the fire in question arose from the negligence of some officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties in the recruiting office, that office, that is to say, the basement and the first floor of the Arcade building occupied by the Militia Department for the purposes of that office, was a \"public work\" within the meaning of this subsection. Public money, it may be mentioned, had been expended upon improving and fitting the premises in order to adapt them to the purposes for which they were occupied.\nI have little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that these premises were a \"public work\" within the meaning of the enactment under consideration. The term \"public work\" is defined in at least two statutes, the Public Works Act and the Expropriation Act. In the Public Works Act it includes \"the public buildings\", \"property, * * repaired and improved at the expense of Canada\". And by definition in the Expropriation Act it also includes in the same terms \"the public buildings\" and \"property repaired or improved at the expense of Canada\". The definitions of the term \"public work\" to be found in these two statutes (they are substantially, if not quite, the same) have immediate statutory effect only in the interpretation of the enactments in which they are found; but they may very properly be resorted to for the purpose of throwing light upon the meaning of the same phrase found in another enactment with no legislative interpretation expressly attached to it. Prima facie it appears to me that the meaning of the phrase in the Exchequer Court Act is no less comprehensive than that to be gathered from these two definitions. Prima facie therefore the premises in question were a \"public work\" within the meaning of the Exchequer Court Act. Two points, however, are raised for consideration by the argument. 1st, it is argued that a \"public work\" within the meaning of this provision means a work of which the Dominion Government is proprietor and by that is meant, I presume, a work vested in the Crown by virtue of an estate not less ample than an estate in fee simple.\nThat appears to me to be a contention which must be rejected. It would exclude from the operation of this clause a building erected by the Crown under the provisions of a building lease giving a right of occupation for a very extended term and it is difficult to understand how a restriction involving such a consequence can be discovered in or attached to the general language employed by the Act. Sub-section 2 of section 8 of the Expropriation Act makes provision for taking lands compulsorily, for the purpose of constructing a public work, for a limited period only. It is a provision which appears to be sufficiently comprehensive to entitle the Crown to take such premises as those under consideration for a limited period. The word \"land\" in the Expropriation Act is comprehensively defined to include \"all real estate\" and consequently includes erections upon land as well as the soil itself. I can see no reason why the basement and first floor of the Arcade Building might not have been expropriated by the Crown; and if so, there is no question that the Crown could have taken those premises compulsorily upon the very terms upon which they were occupied by the agreement with the owner. Why that property so taken should not be embraced within the meaning of the phrase \"public work\" as well as a building actually constructed by the Crown, I am unable to comprehend, and it can make no possible difference that the property was not compulsorily acquired but procured through private treaty.\nThe other point raised for consideration rests upon the language of s.s. (b) of sec. 20 of the Exchequer Court Act. That Act gives jurisdiction to the court to entertain claims for damage to property injuriously affected by the \"construction of any public work.\" It is suggested that in some way which I do not fully comprehend the juxtaposition of s.s. c with this s.s. b is a reason for limiting the scope of the phrase \"public work\" in the first named subsection. It is quite true that s.s. b applies only to cases where something falling within the category \"public work\" has been constructed or is being constructed but it seems an extraordinary conclusion from this that the class of things denoted by \"public work\" is limited to those members of that class to which s.s. b applies. It seems an unwarranted conclusion. The meaning of \"public work\" is not limited by s.s. b, it is only the application of this sub-section which is necessarily limited by the language defining the class of cases to which it applies. My conclusion is that these premises were a \"public work\" within the meaning of the Act.\nThe last question for consideration is, was there evidence of facts giving a cause of action? On this point I think the learned judge of the Exchequer Court has failed to take account of this, namely, that the fact being established that a fire originated on these premises, and that is not disputed, the onus rested upon the occupier to exculpate himself by shewing that the fault neither of the occupier nor of the occupier's servants nor of his contractor, was the cause of the fire. Becquet v. MacCarthy[6]. Therefore if on the facts the matter is left in doubt the occupier does not escape responsibility.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinion to be delivered by my brother Mignault. I concur in his conclusions and, speaking generally, with the reasons on which they are based. If the building in which the fire that destroyed the appellant's property originated had been a \"public work\" within the meaning of that term as used in s.s. (c) of s. 20 of the Exchequer Court Act I should, with respect, have inclined to the view that the proper inference from the evidence, taken as a whole, is that it was ascribable to the negligence of some\nofficer and servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nIf s.s. (c) of s. 20 as enacted by 7 & 8 Geo. V. c. 23, stood alone I should be disposed to give to the words \"upon any public work\" a very wide meaning\u2014 to treat them as equivalent to \"while engaged in any public undertaking.\" But in the construction of clause (c) we must not lose sight of the fact that Parliament has placed it in juxtaposition to clause (b) which confers jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court to entertain\nevery claim against the crown for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work.\nThe words \"any public work\" in this subsection are undoubtedly limited to physical works which are the subject of \"construction\". I am, with respect however, not inclined to accept the view that the jurisdiction conferred by clause (b) is restricted to claims for compensation against the Crown for injurious affection of property occasioned by the exercise of powers to take land, etc., under the Expropriation Act. I would prefer to leave that question open. I am therefore not prepared, for the present at least, to accept the definition of \"public work\" in clause (d) of s. 2 of the Expropriation Act as applicable to s.ss. (b) and (c) of s. 20 of the Exchequer Court Act. While, because the phrase \"any public work\" is found in s.s. (b) of the Exchequer Court Act as well as in s.s. (c) its construction in the latter phrase should be governed largely by that given to it in the former, Blackwood v. The Queen[7] at page 94, I find nothing in either clause at all inconsistent with the construction which, in Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Enterprises Publiques v. The King[8] at page 532, I placed on the words \"any public work\" as used in s.s. (c) as it stood before the amendment of 1917, viz.,\nnot merely some building or other erection or structure belonging to the public, but any operation undertaken by or on behalf of the Government in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property. To that view I respectfully adhere. The Arcade Building temporarily occupied as a recruiting station did not in my opinion fall within the purview of the phrase \"any public work\" as used in s.s. (c) even with the extended meaning which I would be disposed to place on it.\nMignault J.\u2014These two petitions of right were argued together. The same evidence applies to both, and both involve the question whether under the circumstances an action in tort lies against the Crown. The learned trial judge dismissed both petitions of right, holding that the cases did not come within subsection (c) of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act. He also held that the fire which caused damage to the appellants was of an accidental character and that negligence had not been proved. These two questions are the only ones which call for determination on this appeal.\nFirst question. Does the cause of action come within the terms of subsection (c) of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act?\nThe object of section 20 is to determine in what matters the Exchequer Court has exclusive original jurisdiction, although of course it also creates liability. Subsection (c) as amended in 1917, by 7-8 Geo. V., ch. 23, reads as follows:\u2014\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nIn the French version the words \"any public work\" are translated by \"tout ouvrage public\". Before this amendment subsection (c) was as follows (R.S.C. ch. 140):\u2014\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any public officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe change in subsection (c) was effected by the transposition of the words \"on (upon) any public work\". Before the amendment an action lay against the Crown for any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence, etc. Now an action lies for any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting, etc., upon any public work.\nBefore the amendment, in Piggott v. The King[9] servants of the Crown engaged in building a cement dock on the Detroit River caused damage by their blasting operations to the suppliant's dock adjoining the work carried on by the Crown. The Exchequer Court and this court held that to render the Crown liable under subsection (c) for injury to property such property must be on a public work when injured. Some of the learned judges criticised the law as it then stood, holding that the words \"on any public work\" were misplaced. The amendment having been made in the year following this decision, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the intention was to bring such a claim as the one dismissed in Piggott v. The King9 within the ambit of the amended clause.\nThe learned trial judge however held himself bound by the construction of the words \"any public work\" in a series of decisions enumerated in his reasons for judgment. Before referring to these decisions it will be well to mention that the appellants' claims arise out of the following circumstances. In March, 1916, the Department of Militia and Defence rented, from Messrs. A. E. Rea & Co., the ground floor and the basement of the Arcade Building, 194 Sparks Street, Ottawa, as a recruiting station for soldiers, the rent being $200.00 per month and the tenancy being terminable at any time on fourteen days notice. While the building was thus occupied, it was destroyed by fire on the night of the 12th to the 13th December, 1917, as well as the adjoining buildings occupied by the appellants, and it was alleged that their stock in trade was destroyed. The petitions of right claimed damages.\nI have very carefully examined the following decisions of this court, referred to by the learned trial judge, where the construction and effect of subsection (c) before its amendment were considered.\nCity of Quebec v. The Queen[10]; The Queen v. Filion[11]; Larose v. The King[12]; Hamburg American Packet Company v. The King[13]; Letourneux v. The King[14]; Paul v. The King[15]; The King v. Lefran\u00e7ois[16]; Chamberlin v. The King[17]; Compagnie Generale d'Enterprises Publiques v. The King[18].\nIn all these cases the collocation of the words \"any public work\", in subsection (c) before its amendment\u2014 which words were considered as descriptive of the locality in which the death or injury occurred\u2014 was held to govern their construction, and consequently recovery was restricted to cases where the death or damage took place \"on a public work\". The words themselves were not construed independently of their collocation, but in the last mentioned case it was suggested by Mr. Justice Anglin that \"public work\" might be read as meaning not merely some building or other erection or structure belonging to the public, but any operations undertaken by or on behalf of the Government in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property.\nIt is to be observed that subsection (b) of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act, which has not been amended, also contains the words \"any public work\". This subsection gives the Exchequer Court exclusive original jurisdiction as to\nevery claim against the Crown for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work.\nIn view of the collocation of the words \"any public work\" in subsection (c) with the same words in subsection (b), it follows that, according to the familiar rule of legal construction, these words should, if possible, receive the same construction in both subsections. Maxwell, Interpretation of Statutes, pp. 56, 57.\nI think that subsections (a) and (b) deal with claims for compensation against the Crown in the exercise by the latter of statutory powers, and not with claims for damages against the Crown in respect of a tort, the latter being the subject of subsection (c) (see opinion of Fitzpatrick C. J. in Piggott v. The King[19], but this does not present any obstacle to giving to the words \"any public work\" in subsections (b) and (c) the same construction which no doubt was in the mind of Parliament when it enacted section 20. It appears obvious that the \"public work\" mentioned in subsection (b)\u2014the construction of which might injuriously affect property and thereby cause damage\u2014 is a public work coming within the definition of \"public work\" and \"public works\" in section 2 of the Expropriation Act (R.S.C. ch. 143), to which Act subsections (a) and (b) of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act are properly referable. It is noticeable that no definition of a public work is contained in the latter statute, and I cannot doubt that the public work referred to in subsection (b) is the public work contemplated in the Expropriation Act, for we find, in sections 22, 25, 26 and 30 of the Expropriation Act, the very words\nproperty injuriously affected by the construction of any public work\nwhich are in subsection (b), which property, so affected, is a subject for compensation.\nThe definition of the words \"public work\" in section 2 of the Expropriation Act is very comprehensive, and I think, for the reason stated, that we can take it as indicating the meaning of the words \"any public work\" in subsection (b) and also, because of their collocation, in subsection (c) of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act. It would at all events be impossible to give a wider meaning to these words in subsection (c) than in subsection (b).\nThe definition in question reads as follows:\u2014\n(d) 'public work' or 'public works' means and includes the dams, hydraulic works,. hydraulic privileges, harbours, wharfs, piers, docks and works for improving the navigation of any water, the lighthouses and beacons, the slides, dams, piers, booms and other works for facilitating the transmission of timber, the roads and bridges, the public buildings, the telegraph lines, Government railways, canals, locks, dry-docks, fortifications and other works of defence, and all other property, which now belong to Canada, and also the works and properties acquired, constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired or improved at the expense of Canada, or for the acquisition, construction, repairing, extending, enlarging or improving of which any public moneys are voted and appropriated by Parliament, and every work required for any such purpose, but not any work for which money is appropriated as a subsidy only;\nCan it be said that the Arcade Building was a building\nrepaired or improved at the expense of Canada?\nIf these words stood alone, such a contention might be possible, but they must be taken with the words which precede and which, to quote the whole sentence, are:\n* * * and all other property, which now belong to Canada, and also the works and properties acquired, constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired or improved at the expense of Canada.\nIt seems impossible to contend that any repairing or improving of the Arcade Building, under a lease terminable at any time on fourteen days notice, for the purposes of a recruiting office in connection with the late war, would come within the description of the property referred to in the words I have just quoted. And if I am right in this view, I think it cannot be said that the cause of action in these two cases comes within the meaning of subsection (c). It must not be forgotten that without this subsection no action would lie against the Crown in respect of a tort, and the only recourse would be against the tortfeasor if the latter could not answer that he had exercised a statutory power and was therefore not liable. As to such a defence, I may refer to what I said in Salt v. Cardston[20] at page 621.\nI have therefore come to the conclusion\u2014and but for the collocation of the words \"any public work\" in subsection (c) with the same words in subsection (b) I would have been inclined to adopt the contrary view\u2014 that the first question must be answered adversely to the contentions of the appellants. Under these circumstances, it becomes unnecessary to answer the second question, but, having carefully read the whole evidence, I may perhaps say that I would have had great difficulty in considering the fire as purely accidental and not as having been caused by the negligence of officers and servants of the Crown in placing the stoves in too close proximity to inflammable partitions in the part of the premises where the medical examinations were held.\nThe appeals must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fripp & Burritt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hogg & Hogg.\n[1] 20 Ex.

C.O. [1915] c. 94, ss. 41, 44, 45. J. and his son, the respondent, had been partners in farming operations. J. died and by his will directed payment of his share of the net profits to his wife, one of the appellants, during her lifetime. The respondent and others, executors to the will, neglected to apply for probate or to have a legal representative of the estate appointed with whom he could establish business relations. After the respondent had carried on the business of the farm for a considerable time, the widow brought action asking for the appointment of an administrator cum testamento annexo, a declaration that the partnership was dissolved by the death of J and a winding up including a charging of the respondent with the profits. The appellant, the Trusts and Guarantee Co., was named administrator and was later added as a party plaintiff; and both the appellants then filed a claim of election to take interest in lieu of profits, relying on section 44 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\". The referee named in the winding up proceedings found that there had been no profits from the operations of the farm since J's death.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the administrator had the right, under the above section 44, to claim interest from the testator's death on the amount of his share of the partnership assets as the business had been carried on by the respondent \"without any final settlement of accounts as between the firm and the outgoing partner's estate\" and as nothing in the will authorized explicitly the continuation of the business by the respondent. The will directed that at the widow's death a certain half of the partnership land should be conveyed to the respondent on condition of his releasing his interest in the other half and paying off half of the mortgage indebtedness. The respondent was willing to carry out the conditions and to meet his share of the partnership debts.\nPer Davies C.J. and Idington and Anglin JJ.:\u2014Notwithstanding the devise of it to respondent, this west half of the land was still liable to be sold to satisfy claims against the partnership.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (16 Alta.

A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The late William Crawford Jamieson and his son, the respondent John Archibald Jamieson, had been for some time before the death of the former, on the 4th April, 1917, carrying on a general farm business in section 31, township 37 range 15, west of the 4th meridian in the Province of Alberta. The memorandum of agreement dated the 16th March, 1912, forming the said partnerphip, consisted of two paragraphs as follows:\u2014\nThat the partnership heretofore existing between the above partners is this day dissolved, the said William C. Jamieson taking over the interest of the said Albert A. Jamieson and all his assets in the said partnership except the lands; and the said William C. Jamieson and John A. Jamieson taking over the interest of the said Albert A. Jamieson in the said lands, being section 31, in township 37 and range 15, west of the fourth meridian.\n2. It is agreed between William C. Jamieson and John A. Jamieson that they shall continue in the partnership together under the terms of the existing partnership agreement between the three herein mentioned,\u2014except that the said interest of the said William C. Jamieson in the chattels shall be two-thirds, instead of one third as heretofore; and the interest in the land shall be each an undivided one half interest; and the firm shall be known as \"William C. Jamieson & Son.\"\nThere had been a firm partnership between the father, the said J. A. Jamieson and another son which explains the reference in the above paragraph no. 2.\nThe father by his last will and testament, dated the 18th February, 1915, appointed said respondent, John A. Jamieson, and the two other partners executors of said will and trustees of the estate and by paragraph three thereof provided as follows:\u2014\n3. I give devise and bequeath unto my said trustees and the survivors and survivor of them all my estate, real and personal, and wheresoever situate and being upon and subject to the following trusts; (A) During the lifetime of my wife Margaret to pay over to her my estate's share of net profits derived from the operation of the Bandeath Stock Farm being two thirds of the net profits of the said farm and to pay to her all net income of every nature, kind and description derivable from my estate. (B) at the death of my wife to convey unto my son, John A. Jamieson, the west half of section 31, township 37 range 15, west of the 4th meridian being that half of the Bandeath Stock Farm upon which the buildings are situated; this devise is made upon the conditions that the said John A. Jamieson do release at that time his undivided half interest in the east half of said section and also upon the condition that the said John A. Jamieson do assume and pay half of the principal and interest owing at the time of my death or subsequently accruing on any mortgage encumbrance upon the said section. (C) Also at the time of my wife's death to convert into money the east half of said section and to convert into money unless a division is agreed on by all parties interested by two thirds undivided interest (the other one third being owned by my said son, John A.) in the stock and other chattel property on the said farm, and all my personal effects and to pay and to divide the same equally amongst my children then living except John A. the said children now being Jessie McTavish, wife of John S. McTavish, Isabella Jane, Florence Margaret Nellie, Charles, James and Albert, deducting however, from the share of my two sons, James and Albert, each the sum of $500 advanced to them in my lifetime and divide the sum of the two deductions, being $1,000, equally between my daughters Isabella Jane and Florence Margaret and Nellie. (D) To pay or deliver over unto any child or children of any of my children who should die before the time of distribution arrives the share of its or their parent per stirpes\nThe partnership was admittedly one terminable at will or death of either party.\nSection 41 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\" of Alberta provides that:\u2014\nOn the dissolution of a partnership every partner is entitled, as against the other partners in the firm, and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interest as partners to have the property of the partnership applied in payment of what may be due to the partners respectively after deducting what may be due from them as partners to the firm; and for that purpose any partner or his representatives may on the termination of the partnership apply to the court to wind up the business and affairs of the firm.\nClearly that right came into force and became effective on the death of the father but nothing was done by the respondent son, John A. Jamieson, or others named as executors as above set forth, to procure probate of said will or to establish any business relation of any kind with the widow, one of the appellants, or any one else concerned as legatees or devisees for carrying on the business. Yet the said respondent John A. Jamieson, without consulting any such interested parties continued carrying on the said farm sending no accounts to any one until appellant Margaret Annie Jamieson, the widow of his father, instituted this action on the 14th of August, 1919. In the course of the trial thereof the appellant, the Trusts and Guarantee Company, Limited, by the direction of the court obtained, after renunciation by the executors, probate of said will, and was added party plaintiff with said widow.\nA good deal of confusion of thought might have been avoided by bringing about this creating of a duly constituted representative of the estate before launching this suit.\nFor clearly to my mind the question raised herein, save as to the peculiar right of the widow, to which I will presently advert, must be determined by measuring the respective rights of the Trust Company as administrator and the respondent as a surviving partner.\nThe learned trial judge by his formal judgment expressly and properly, as I understand the law, declared as follows:\u2014\n1. This court doth declare that the partnership subsisting between the testator and the defendant, John Archibald Jamieson, was dissolved by the death of the testator.\n2. And this court doth order and adjudge that the said partnership be wound up and that for such purpose it is hereby referred to the master in chambers at Calgary to take the usual and necessary partnership accounts.\n3. And this court doth further order and adjudge that the master in taking such accounts shall distinguish between the operations of the partnership up to the date of the testator's death and the operations subsequent thereto.\nBy subsequent order Mr. Chadwick, a barrister in Calgary, was substituted for the master and discharged a somewhat difficult duty ably and well.\nHe took the accounts on the footing he was directed in way of distinguishing the operation of the partnership from subsequent operations. In taking the accounts of the subsequent operations the appellants properly declined to consider profits and losses, but declared their right of charging the respondent, John A. Jamieson, with interest on the amount of the testator's share in the partnership assets used in carrying on the business after the death of the testator and the dissolution thereby of the partnership.\nThe relevant law is clear and express in sections 44 and 45 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\" of Alberta, which read as follows:\u2014\n44. Where any member of a firm has died or otherwise ceased to be a partner, and the surviving or continuing partners carry on the business of the firm with its capital or assets without any final settlement of accounts as between the firm and the outgoing partner or his estate, then, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the outgoing partner or his estate is entitled at the option of himself or his representatives to such share of the profits made since the dissolution as the court may find to be attributable to the use of his share of the partnership assets or to interest on the amount of his share of the partnership assets.\n45. Subject to any agreement between the partners, the amount due, from surviving or continuing partners to an outgoing partner or the respresentatives of a deceased partner in respect of the outgoing or deceased partner's share is a debt accruing at the date of the dissolution or death.\nThe Trust Company, the appellant, would have been grossly negligent in its discharge of duty if it had failed to make such a declaration when it was quite clear that respondent, John A. Jamieson, without the slightest foundation of right to do so, proceeded as he had done.\nIf he had any right to suppose he had been so authorized by his father's will, he should have got it probated first and then submitted his course of duty to the court failing to reach any basis of action between himself and those others concerned. The statutory enactment is a most righteous one intended to provide against just such lawless courses as he pursued and as a deterrent imposes the obligation of paying the profits or interest whichever may, in the judgment of those administering the estate of a deceased partner, elect.\nThe widow's election or non-election is not what is to be considered.\nIt is the interest of the estate which, for this purpose, is represented by the party acting as duly constituted executor or administrator.\nI respectfully submit that the learned judge hearing the appeal from the report of the referee who followed the law as disclosed by the statute above quoted, erred in overruling his finding of $1,592.78, as due in that respect.\nThat part of the judgment appealed from maintaining that ruling, I hold should be reversed and the referee's finding restored\nThe next ground of appeal is against the ruling of the court below that the lands of the partnership should not be sold at present\nDuring the argument I was inclined to think as the case was presented that possibly it was a mere temporary refusal with which we should not interfere but, enlightened by a perusal and consideration of the case and the many authorities cited in appellant's factum, I am clearly of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed on this point also.\nThe provision in section 41 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\" quoted above, expressly gives the power to the representative to apply to the court, as the Trust Company appellant did and got a judgment founding proceedings for that purpose. I do not think, under such circumstances, that either the learned trial judge should have on the hearing of motion for further directions or the Appellate Division should have, unless to rectify mere error in the course of the trial or making of such a decree as I have above quoted from, change the clear effect of such a judgment.\nBut it is in effect said that the trustee is exceeding his rights and powers by insisting upon the sale of the lands because the testator had expressed in the clauses of his will above quoted another intention.\nIt is very difficult to understand how the testator came to make such a will without making provision for carrying it out. Clearly in law there is no power in the administrator of such a will to carry on the business of the firm, and the only chance the respondent, John A. Jamieson, ever had of doing so he renounced.\nHad he taken probate of the will he might have been able to argue plausibly that the carrying on of the farm was part of the duty cast upon him as trustee, and if he had duly rendered accounts and done his best, though I do not think he should have succeeded in such contention in face of the enactments I have referred to above, and the peculiar wording, or want of wording, of the will, yet he would have had something more arguable than he has now.\nIndeed, though his position in doing so would, in my opinion, be untenable, yet it would not have been so utterly hopeless as the present contention that he can hang on to the west half of the section and insist on the widow taking one third of the profits in that as fulfilment of the provision or supposed provisions, of the will. I most respectfully submit, and ask, can anything be more absurd in face of the large indebtedness, the absolute necessity to resort to the sale of lands to liquidate it, and the rights given by the Alberta statute to the widow who wishes to know exactly what she may get under the will and then elect to take her rights under said statute if more beneficial than to attempt to carry out part of such a will?\nI am of the opinion that under such circumstances the court cannot sell part of the lands and thus protect John A. Jamieson in his supposed rights disregarding the rights of the widow and all other parties.\nThe learned judge who heard the motion, on further directions relied upon In re Holland[3].\nI, with great respect, cannot see in the respective surrounding circumstances and devise or bequest there in question, and those herein involved and the nature of the devise or bequest in question here, the slightest resemblance.\nThe case of Farquhar v Hadden[4] referred to by the learned judge deciding In re Holland3 has much more resemblance to this case.\nIndeed if the litigation herein continues I imagine the resemblance will soon become identical.\nThe cases cited in argument in this latter case and of which one is again cited herein by appellants' factum, are much more in point on that aspect of the case.\nI am, however, of opinion that the point taken therein of a condition precedent being created by the will before it became operative in the way applied below, supported by the cases of Acherley v Vernon[5]; Priestley v Holgate[6]; In re Welstead [7] is an effective answer to respondent's contention. I need not elaborate for it seems to me self evident that on the facts presented herein none of the conditions have been or can be observed.\nHence the duty is obligatory on the court to direct the sale of all the lands as declared in the case of Wild v Milne[8].\nIt is not necessary to follow alternative suggestions and authorities relevant thereto cited in a well prepared factum.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below, so far as relevant to the said several contentions.\nI may be permitted to suggest that respondent, John A. Jamieson, can protect himself by being allowed to bid at the sale of the lands.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014The point of substance to be considered on this appeal turns upon the claim by the appellant against the respondent for interest. The deceased, William Crawford Jamieson, the father of the respondent and the husband of Margaret Annie Jamieson, one of the appellants, died in April, 1917, and the claim for interest arises in this way. At the time of his death W. C. Jamieson was carrying on the business of a stock farm in partnership with his son, the respondent, on section 31, township 37, west of the fourth meridian, each partner having an undivided one half interest in the land, William Jamieson's interest in the chattels being two thirds and that of the son one third. The partnership was a partnership at will. Prior to his death the father made a will by which he gave to his three trustees, who included his son, all his real and personal estate and among other things directed as follows:\u2014 During the lifetime of my wife Margaret to pay over to her my estate's share of net proceeds derived from the operation of the Bandeath Stock Farm, being two thirds of the net profits of the said Farm and to pay to her all net income of every nature kind and description derivable from my estate.\nThe will was not proved until December, 1919, when letters of administration with the will annexed were delivered to the Trust Company. During the interregnum the business was carried on by the son there being no profits for the years 1917-18. The action was brought by the widow in August, 1919 claiming an account and praying that the defendant should be charged with the profits made in the business since the testator's decease.\nThe claim for interest is based upon section 44 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\" of Alberta (CO. 1915, ch. 94) which corresponds with section 42 of the English \"Partnership Act.\" In so far as relevant it is in the following words:\u2014\nWhere any member of a firm has died or ceased to be a partner, and the surviving or continuing partners carry on the business of the firm with its capital or assets without any final settlement of accounts as between the firm and the outgoing partner or his estate, then, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the outgoing partner or his estate is entitled at the option or himself or his representatives to such share of the profits made since the dissolution as the Court may find to be attributable to the use of his share of the partnership assets, or to interest on the amount of his share of the partnership assets.\nI am unable to agree that this section has any application to the circumstances of the present case. Impliedly the will directs that the business of the stock farm shall be carried on. The testator's interest in the partnership passed to his executors and trustees of whom the respondent was one. But the intention of the testator was that the business of the stock farm should be carried on, and there was to be no interruption, no settlement at his death. The respond- ent was entitled to insist upon this and if the representatives of the estate declined to participate, he was still entitled to have the business proceed as directed. The co-executors might, actuated by misgivings as to the personal responsibility they would incur in carrying on the business, be loath to assume the burden of administration and difficulties so arising might be so great as to compel the son to proceed without the assistance of co-executors or co-trustees; still he was entitled to do so. There was, if my reading of the will is right, no discretion vested in the trustees upon this point. If the son was willing to proceed then the course to be pursued by the estate, whoever the representatives of the estate might be, was marked out by the will.\nNotice first then that section 44 operates where the surviving partner carries on without \"any final\" settlement of accounts as between the firm and \"the outgoing partner or his estate.\" The presuppositions are that there is an \"outgoing partner\" and that it is a case in which it is the duty of the firm on the one hand to account and the right of the \"estate\" to demand an account on the other. Here there was in this sense no \"outgoing partner\". There was no duty on part of the son to account, no right on part of the estate to demand a settlement of accounts. The section therefore by its very terms excludes this case.\nBut the judgment of the Appellate Division may be rested on broader grounds. The enactment (sec. 44) did not change the law as it stood at the time the Act was passed The rule to which it gives statutory expression is fully explained and discussed at p. 673 of the 8th ed. of Lindley on Partnership. It is based upon the principle that where a wrongdoer has employed the property of another in trade his respons- ibility is to restore the property and to make the owner proper compensation for its detention. And it was considered to be just that where there were profits the wrongdoer should not be allowed to profit by his own wrong and where there were no profits that the owner should not be deprived of compensation; and consequently the rule was that the owner should have the right to claim at his option either the profits actually made or interest at the current rate. It is not of course permissible in construing a statute passed with the object of codifying some branch of the law as was the Partnership Act to resort to previous decisions for the purpose of controlling the construction of the language of the code; but it is permissible to refer to the principle which is the foundation of a statutory rule and to the applications made of that principle for the purpose of illustrating it.\nIt is a misapprehension to suppose that the executor derives his authority from probate. \"The probate is\" in the language of a work of long established reputation and weight (Williams on Executors, at p. 207)\nhowever merely operative as the authenticated evidence and not at all as the foundation of the executor's title; for he derives all his interest from the will itself and the property of the deceased vests in him from the moment of the testator's death;\nand this passage is supported by unimpeachable authority; Smith v. Milles[9]; Comber's Case[10].\nAnd upon these principles, it is settled law that the executor, before he proves the will,\nmay do almost all the acts which are incident to his office except only some of them which relate to suits. Williams, Executors, p. 213; and such acts will stand good though the executor die without proving the will. Brazier v. Hudson[11]. Indeed, it is clear that the respondent could not have refused to prove the will if the interested parties had required him to do so. In re Stevens[12]. It is true no doubt that upon the grant of administration to the Trust Company the powers of the executors ceased; but that (the grant operated to vest a title in the administrator only as from its date) is a circumstance as I conceive of no relevancy to the present question. Technically the act of the respondent in dealing with the testator's interest in the partnership property would be the act of all the executors; and it must be assumed\u2014 there is no suggestion to the contrary\u2014 that the respondent acted without the dissent of his co-executors.\nThe respondent, who in substance carried out the will, acted as the will required him to act both as partner and as executor, cannot therefore be regarded either technically or otherwise as a wrongdoer within the principle upon which the statutory rule is founded.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Upon the material which the record contains\u2014and there is nothing to warrant our surmising the existence of a state of facts other than it discloses\u2014 subject to the dominant rights of the creditors and apart from legal considerations, having regard to the provisions of the will of the late Wm. C. Jamieson, I would be inclined to regard the disposition made in this case in the provincial courts as doing substantial justice between the appellant Margaret Annie Jamieson and the respondent John Archibald Jamieson. But the Partnership Ordinance (s. 44) appears to present an insuperable obstacle to maintaining the judgment of the Appellate Division. The business of the partnership formerly subsisting between the respondent and his deceased father was undoubtedly carried on after the death of the latter \"without any final settlement of accounts as between the firm and the outgoing partner('s) * * * estate\". It could not have been otherwise, no legal representative of that estate having been appointed. Under these circumstances the statutory right of the representatives of the deceased partner to elect either to claim profits or to claim interest appears to be absolute.\nAssuming that by sufficiently distinct and definite directions in the will of a deceased partner the carrying on of the business by the surviving partner so as to bind the estate of the former, without concurrence of his personal representatives and without any accounting having taken place, could be authorized and the surviving partner thereby relieved of any obligation to the estate other than that of accounting for such profits as he might make out of the business, with respect, I do not find in the will before us anything which would suffice to sanction that being done or to exclude the operation of the statute or justify the court in declining to give effect to its explicit language. The widow, although she is a life beneficiary under the will and is also the assignee of nine of the twelve children of the testator including six of the seven, other than the respondent, who take under his will subject to her life interest (the children of the seventh, Isabella, who is dead, being minors), could not elect for profits so as to bind the personal representatives to forego the right of the estate to claim interest under the statute. On this branch of the case therefore the appeal must be allowed and the report of the master restored. The west half of section 31, devised to the respondent after the widow's death, having formed part of the partnership assets, is liable to be sold to satisfy claims against the partnership. The other assets being apparently insufficient to meet the partnership debts, this land, notwithstanding the devise of it by the deceased partner to the surviving partner, must be so dealt with. Of course all that is devised to the respondent is his deceased partner's interest and that, it is needless to say, can be ascertained only when claims of creditors of the partnership have been satisfied. Moreover the devise to the respondent is no more specific than is the bequest of the proceeds of the east half of the section and of the testator's interest in the stock to seven others of his children nominatim. No doubt it is desirable to carry out the provisions of the will as far as possible. But the specifically devised assets are bound to contribute ratably towards satisfaction of the debts of the partnership which bear alike on the testator's interest in all the partnership assets. Nothing in the will exempts the respondent and imposes the exclusive burden of the debts on the other beneficiaries inter se.\nUnless some real prejudice to the creditors might ensue, however, the master in carrying out the sale of the assets should, I think, offer the west half and the east half of section 31 as separate parcels so that the amount of the proceeds of each may be ascertained and the respective interests of the children inter se under the will may be protected.\nThe matter is not yet ripe for the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the \"Married Women's Relief Act.\"\nThe appellants are entitled to their costs here and in the Appellate Division. MIGNAULT J.\u2014The respondent was in partnership with his father, the late W. C. Jamieson, for the purpose of farming and stock raising. The father died in April, 1917, leaving a will whereby he directed his executors to pay to his wife, one of the appellants, his estate's share of net profits derived from the operations of the stock farm, and also all net income of every nature, kind and description derivable from his estate, the west half of the farm, on the death of his wife, to become the property of the respondent. The executors neglected to apply for probate and subsequently renounced thereto, and, during the pendency of this litigation, the Trusts and Guarantee Co. Ltd., the other appellant, was appointed administrator with will annexed of the property of the deceased) and was added as a party plaintiff. After his father's death the respondent continued the business.\nMrs. Jamieson, the widow, brought this action in August, 1919, against the respondent, her son. She had previously acquired the shares in the estate of all her children, with the exception of those of the respondent and of one daughter, Isabella Jane Jamieson. All the children (some of them infants represented by the official guardian) were, during the suit, added as defendants.\nMrs. Jamieson's statement of claim alleged that the partnership had come to an end on the death of W. C. Jamieson, and asked, inter alia, that an administrator be appointed to the estate, that an account be taken of the profits of the continuation of the business by the respondent, and that the latter be charged with the profits, if any, made in the business since the testator's death.\nAfter its appointment as administrator and its joinder as a party plaintiff, The Trusts and Guarantee Co. Limited, elected to charge the respondent with interest in lieu of any profits on the deceased's share in the partnership. The widow had 'made a similar election some time previously, but I think that having in her action demanded profits on the deceased's share, she could not change her election and ask for interest. However the administrator, as representative of the deceased's estate, was not precluded from demanding interest in lieu of profits and its election stands.\nThe learned trial judge, in an order dated November 27th, 1919, declared that the partnership had come to an end on the death of W. C. Jamieson, and ordered that it be wound up, referring the matter to the master in chambers at Calgary to take the usual and necessary partnership accounts.\nThe master found that the share of the deceased in the partnership amounted to $11,987.38 and allowed interest at 5% from April 4th, 1917, to November 30th, 1919, to wit: $1,592.78. The latter amount is the chief bone of contention between the parties, for it is common ground that the operations of 1917 and 1918 gave no profits, and the appellants will be gainers if they can demand interest in lieu of profits.\nThe parties having appealed from the master's report, the learned trial judge decided that the will allowed the respondent to continue the partnership, subject to paying over to the widow the share of profits attributable to the deceased's share in the partnership, and that interest could not be claimed on the deceased's share. In so far as it granted interest the master's report was set aside. This judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division.\nNot without considerable reluctance, in view of the nature of the claim made against her son by Mrs. Jamieson, I have come to the conclusion that the will did not sufficiently authorize a continuation of the business after the death of the testator, and I think also, under section 44 of \"The Partnership Ordinance\" (Alberta), that the administrator of the testator's estate is entitled to claim interest in lieu of profits on the share of the deceased. I would not have agreed to allow the widow to change the election she had already made to take profits, but she does not represent the estate and the administrator does, so that the latter clearly has the right of election given by section 44 to the respresentative of the deceased partner's estate.\nThe courts below made no order for the sale of the land and I would make none myself, the more so as the refusal to order the sale was not a final one, and it is still open to the parties to apply for it should circumstances, such as claims made by creditors, render it necessary. The majority of my colleagues think, however, that the land should be sold.\nThe widow also desired to avail herself of the \"Married Women's Relief Act\". The court below considered that the proceedings were not so constituted as to make it possible to deal with this question. In that I agree.\nThe appeal must be allowed to the extent of restoring the master's allowance of interest in favour of the administrator of W. C. Jamieson's estate. The appellants are entitled to costs here and in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 16 Alta.

I direct and desire that my executors whom I also name as trustees, shall set apart a sum of twenty-five thousand dollars and invest the same in the securities provided by law, and pay the interest or dividends from the said sum as the same are payable to my said wife during her lifetime so long as she remains my widow but in the event of her marrying then in such case the said interest or dividends shall cease and the said sums shall revert to my estate in the same manner as it will revert to my said estate upon the death of my said wife.\"\n* * *\n\"15.

J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. Held that, upon the testator's death without issue and subject to the condition against re-marriage, the sum of $25,000 passed to the wife of the testator as part of the residue of the estate bequeathed to her and did not devolve upon the heirs at law as on an intestacy Judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 31 K.B. 157) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe late C. B. Carter, K.C., of Montreal, made on the 28th of June, 1905, his will under the olograph form, which contained the clauses above recited. He had married on the 19th of April, 1905, dame Emma Blunden; and when he died on the 9th of August, 1906, there was no issue. Mrs. Carter died on the 21st of August, 1917, leaving a will under which the respondent was appointed executor. The latter brought action against the defendants, who were the executors of Mr. Carter's will, to recover the sum of $25,000 as being part of Mrs. Carter's estate. The lawful heirs of Mr. Carter were called in the case as mis-en-cause and they contested the action on the ground that that sum had been devolved upon them as on an intestacy.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and J. E. Labette for the appellants\u2014 The testator, by clause 5, has clearly stated his intention not to give the property of that sum of $25,000 to his wife, as he said in formal terms: \"said sum shall revert to my estate * * * upon the death of my wife\".\nIf Mrs. Carter had remarried that sum would have reverted to her husband's estate. Then, if his wife and his succession had been one and the same person, his wife if she had remarried would have received, by clause 15, what she was losing by clause 5, which conclusion brings to an absurdity. Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Pierre Beullac K.C. for the respondent:\u2014The sum of $25,000, in case of no issue, was bequeathed to the wife under clause 15, subject to the condition against re-marriage contained in clause 5.\nThe word \"estate\" in the phrase \"shall revert to my estate\" means \"succession\" or property.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and J. E. Labette for the appellants.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Pierre Beullac K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question arising on this appeal was whether a sum of $25,000 passed to the widow of the testator as part of the residue of his estate bequeathed to her, or devolved upon the heirs-at-law of the testator as on an intestacy.\nI have little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the $25,000 in question did pass to the widow of the testator.\nThe two clauses of the will in question upon the construction of which the dispute in question must be determined read as follows:\u2014\n5. In addition to the sum given to my said wife, I direct and desire that my executors, whom 1 also name as trustees, shall set apart a sum of twenty-five thousand dollars and invest the same in the securities provided by law, and pay the interest or dividends from the said sum as the same are payable to my said wife during her lifetime so long as she remains a widow, but in the event of her marrying then in such case the said interest or dividends shall cease and the said sum revert to my estate, in the same manner as it will revert to my said estate upon the death of my said wife.\n* * * *\n15. Should there be any issue of my marriage the residue of my estate shall be kept in trust for such issue until such issue shall attain the age of twenty-one years but the interest or revenue shall be employed in the education and support of such issue, but in default of such issue, the said residue shall go to my wife to whom I give the same absolutely.\nIn clause 5 the testator directed the $25,000 to be set apart and the interest or annual proceeds to be paid to his widow during her lifetime and widowhood, but that in the event of her marrying the interest or dividends should cease and the \"said sum revert to\" his estate in the same manner as it would revert to his estate upon his wife's death.\nI construe the word \"revert\" to mean \"fall back into\" his estate. In that paragraph, however, he made no further disposition of the corpus of the $25,000 beyond saying that under the specified contingencies it should revert to his estate.\nWhen, therefore, in the fifteenth clause he provides that in default of issue from his marriage the residue of his estate should go absolutely to his wife, that residue necessarily included the corpus or principal of the $25,000 which was previously undisposed of. When the possiblity of issue from his marriage ceased, the absolute devise of the corpus of the $25,000 being part of the residue of his estate, would attach and become operative.\nAs the widow survived him and there was no issue of the marriage the bequest to her absolutely of the corpus of the $25,000 attached and became operative.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The late Christopher Benfield Carter who married Emma Blunden on the 19th April, 1905 and made his last will and testament on the 28th of June, 1905, died on the 9th of August, 1906.\nHe had by a marriage contract on the day of his said marriage, but preceding same, bound and obliged\nhimself, his heirs and representatives to pay to the future wife within three months after his death, the sum of $10,000, with the right to secure the same during his lifetime and to make payments on account either by investments in the name of the future wife, by insurance on his life, by mortgage or hypothec upon immovable property or in any other way. This transaction is of no consequence save as illustrating the provisions made in said will in respect thereof and also, I may be permitted to think, of the mentality of the testator whose said will we are now asked by this appeal to consider and reverse the construction put thereon by the Court of King's Bench which reversed that put upon it by the Superior Court.\nThe said wife survived the testator and died on the 21st of August, 1917, after having made her last will and testatment in the preceding February of the same year.\nThe respondent Goldstein was appointed thereby executor and trustee thereof.\nThe Montreal Trust Company and one Armstrong, a brother-in-law of the deceased testator, were the acting trustees of the said testator's estate under the said will.\nThe respondent Goldstein, as executor and trustee, brought before the said Superior Court the question of his right as executor of the will of the said testatrix to recover from said trustees the sum of $25,000 or the securities in which the said sum had been invested in course of their executing the trusts under the said testator's will.\nThe whole difficulty arises in regard to the proper interpretation and construction of the 5th and 15th clauses of said will of the testator.\nThe first clause revokes all former wills.\nThe second deals with his burial, and the third with the direction to pay all debts and funeral expenses.\nThe fourth refers to the said marriage contract, directs the sum of money due thereby to be handed over and paid his said wife absolutely to be disposed of by her as she thinks proper, and asks his executors to assist his wife in the investment of said sum so that she shall not suffer any loss, and that the investment should be in the best securities. Then follows the fifth clause which reads as follows:\n5. In addition to the sum so given to my said wife, I direct and desire that my executors whom I also name as trustees, shall set apart a sum of twenty-five thousand dollars and invest the same in the securities provided by law, and pay the interest or dividends from the said sum as the same are payable to my said wife during her lifetime so long as she remains my widow but in the event of marrying then in such case the said interest or dividends shall cease and the said sums shall revert to my estate, in the same manner as it will revert to my said estate upon the death of my said wife.\nThen there follow a great many bequests in which appellants and others are given personal bequests.\nAnd amongst other bequests of that kind, he gives a total of eight thousand dollars to a number of institutions as objects of charity.\nAs his entire estate did not much exceed, if at all, ninety thousand dollars he clearly did not think of his own relatives, amongst whom he distributed the bulk of his estate, as needy objects of further generosity or charity, or we should have, I submit, expected something more presented in his will than what I am about to refer to which it is contended was an expression of such intention.\nThe fifteenth clause (which is the last in the will, save an injunction in way discharge of duty on the part of his executors was to be observed and power to discharge same), is as follows:\u2014\n15. Should there be any issue of my marriage the residue of my estate shall be kept in trust for such issue until such issue shall attain the age of twenty-one years, but the interest or revenue shall be employed in the education and support of such issue, but in default of such issue, the said residue shall go to my wife to whom I give the same absolutely.\nI do not find the serious difficulty that the appellants do in the interpretation or construction of this will. I think that these two clauses, 5 and 15 read together and in light of the whole will clearly gave the whole of that fund of $25,000 to his testators to hold as an investment solely for the benefit of his widow and possible children, but to be subject to the condition against re-marriage.\nIt was clearly to be for her and them subject only to a forfeiture on re-marriage.\nSo interpreted and construed there arises no such difficulty as suggested in argument of a bequest only to become operative on her death.\nThere seems to me neither such difficulty nor room for the rather curious suggestion of interpreting the words in the last part of clause 5, reading as follows\nthe said sums shall revert to my estate, in the same manner as it will revert to my said estate upon the death of my said wife.\neither as a bequest to his heirs or as a case of intestacy.\nHe certainly did not (being a member of our profession) in making such a will as before us intend that as a bequest to any one; nor did he expect to die intestate, unless his widow should remarry which as a reasonable man he would, in confronting her with forfeiture of such a bequest, consider highly improbable.\nWe must never forget, if we would interpret correctly the situation, that this will was made within a little more than two months after his marriage when the possibility of issue was quite conceivable.\nI do not think the contention should have been continued beyond the decision of the Court of King's Bench and hence conclude that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The intention of the testator is, I think, plainly enough evinced to dispose by testamentary disposition of the whole of his property both in extent and in interest. A certain interest in the investments representing the sum of $25,000 passes (under clause five) to his wife\u2014it is not necessary, I think, to determine with precision the character of that interest. What of the interest left untouched by that clause? I see no good reason why it should be supposed that it is not captured by the residuary clause\u2014clause fifteen\u2014 so as to pass in one event to the issue and in the other to the wife. There being no issue, the combined effect of the two pertinent clauses (five and fifteen) is to give to Mrs. Carter the entire property in the sum of $25,000 and the investments respecting it.\nAnglin J.\u2014The late C. B. Carter bequeathed $25,000 to trustees to pay the income derivable therefrom to his wife until her death or remarriage and directed that in the latter event\nthe said sums (sic) shall revert to my estate in the same manner as it (sic) will revert upon the death of my said wife.\nThe residue of the estate was bequeathed to the testator's children if any (to be held in trust for them until they should attain 21 years, the income meantime to be applied for their education and support) and, if he should die without issue, to his wife absolutely. He died childless. The single question is whether the sum of $25,000 passed as part of the residue bequeathed to the wife or devolved on the heirs-at-law as on an intestacy.\nI find nothing in the context to limit the universality of the word \"residue\". 6 Aubry & Rau, 4 ed. p. 466. There may be a question, of no practical importance since Mrs. Carter's death, whether, having regard to the trust for her of the income, she could have claimed payment of the corpus of the sum of $25,000 during her lifetime. But that the ownership of that sum became vested in her on her husband's death without any child born or en ventre, so as to form part of her estate, I entertain no doubt whatever.\nCounsel for the appellant relied greatly on the testator's direction that in the event of his widow's remarriage the $25,000 should revert to his estate. In the first place it should be noted that the widow did not remarry and therefore this direction was inoperative. The corpus in fact does not pass under it but is undisposed of by any provision of the will other than that dealing with the residue. Moreover, the direction for reverter appears to signify nothing more than that in the event of the widow's remarriage the same disposition of the $25,000 shall ensue as would occur under the other terms of his will upon her death.\nThe word \"revert\" is obviously not applicable in the technical sense to the corpus of the $25,000. Since that sum was never taken out of the testator's estate, it could not revert to it. But in using this word the testator would seem to have had in mind as well the payments of income to his wife for the rest of her life, which had been in a sense taken out of his estate by the gift of them to her defeasible in the event of her contracting a second marriage. His use of the word \"sums\" would so indicate. This may explain his employing the word \"revert\", notwithstanding its inconsistency, if so used, with the succeeding phrase\nin the same manner as it will revert to my estate upon the death of my said wife.\nNote that the singular pronoun \"it\" is used to signify the \"sums\" directed to \"revert\". Inaccuracy of diction is perhaps the most notable characteristic of this entire provision. I cannot find in the use of the word \"revert\" however, any indication of an intention to divert the otherwise undisposed of corpus from the residuary legatees or legatee to the heirs-at-law. Still less can I discern in the word \"estate\" a designation of such heirs-at-law as its ultimate recipients to the exclusion both of the children and the widow of the testator as residuary legatees. For both would have been alike excluded if the appellant's contention is sound. I cannot conceive that that was the testator's intent. His future children, if any, were the first and direct objects of his residuary bequest.\nThe objection made against the wife claiming under the bequest that the benefit of it would enure only to her estate after her death does not apply to the bequests to the children. Yet if the children were to take under the residuary bequest the undisposed of corpus must have been included in the residue. Once there it is there for all the purposes of the bequest including the gift over to the wife Any other construction seems impossible unless the clearly outstanding purpose of the testator\u2014to deal with the entire residue of his estate, including all property not otherwise effectively disposed of by his will (Fuzier-Herman, vbo. Legs. No. 8778), for the benefit in the first place of his children, if any, and failing issue, for that of his wife\u2014should be disregarded. It is trite law, recently restated in the Privy Council (Auger v. Beaudry[2], that speculation or conjecture as to the motives that may have influenced the testator in giving to his bequests the form in which we find them cannot warrant a refusal to give effect to the fair and literal meaning of the actual language he has used. We may not reject the plain bequest to the wife because in the result it may benefit her heirs rather than the heirs of the testator. If the right of the widow to payment of the $25,000 under the residuary bequest accrued immediately on the testator's death without children, the objection, strongly urged by Mr. Lafleur, that the bequest was to a person in whose favour it could not take effect until after her death and therefore in contravention of Art. 838 C.C. would obviously have no application. The same observation might be made if her right to payment of the corpus had arisen by reason of her remarriage. But assuming that the effect of the trust created by clause 5 of the will was, in the event which happened, to defer any right to actual payment of the corpus under the residuary bequest until her death, that suspension merely postponed the execution of the residuary disposition and did not prevent her having under it during her lifetime \"an acquired right transmissible to her heirs,\" Art. 902 C.C.\" The event which gave effect to\" the residuary legacy to the widow was the death of the testator without any children either born or en ventre. Thereupon she became \"seized of the right to the thing bequeathed\". Art. 891 C.C.\nWhatever justification any obscurity in the late Mr. Carter's testamentary dispositions may have afforded for instituting this litigation and carrying it to the Court of King's Bench, the mis-en-cause might well have been content to abide by the judgment of that court. They should pay the respondents their costs of the unsuccessful appeal here.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Le point en litige en cette cause est de savoir si une somme de $25,000 sp\u00e9cifiquement mentionn\u00e9e au testament de M. l'avocat C. B. Carter de Montreal appartient aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de ce dernier ou \u00e0 sa femme. M. Carter s'est mari\u00e9 le 19 avril 1905, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, avec Mlle. Blunden; et par son contrat de mariage, il avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme une somme de $10,000 payable \u00e0 sa mort, avec stipulation cependant que si elle pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9dait, la donation deviendrait de nul effet. Environ deux mois apr\u00e8s son mariage, soit le 28 juin 1905, M. Carter faisait son testament par lequel il instituait comme ses l\u00e9gataires universels les enfants qui na\u00eetraient de son mariage; et il ajoutait que s'il n'avait pas d'enfants alors l'universalit\u00e9 de ses biens irait \u00e0 sa femme. Ce legs universel est stipul\u00e9 dans la clause 15 du testament et se lit comme suit:\n15. Should there be any issue of my marriage, the residue of my estate shall be kept in trust for such issue until such issue shall attain the age of twenty-one years but the interest or revenue shall be employed in the education and support of such issue, but in default of such issue, the said residue shall go to my wife to whom I give the same absolutely.\nIl avait dans les clauses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes confirm\u00e9 et ratifi\u00e9 la donation de $10,000 mentionn\u00e9e au contrat de mariage; il avait nomm\u00e9 un de ses parents et un de ses amis comme ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et fiduciaires et il avait aussi fait plusieurs legs particuliers \u00e0 ses parents et \u00e0 ses amis; il avait au paragraphe 5 dispos\u00e9 d'une somme de $25,000 dans les termes suivants :\n5. In addition to the sum so given to my said wife I direct and desire that my executors, whom I also name as trustees, shall set apart a sum of twenty-five thousand dollars and invest the same in the securities provided by law and pay the interest or dividends from the said sum as the same are payable to my said wife during her life time so long as she remains my widow, but in the event of marrying then in such case the said interest or dividends shall cease and the said sums shall revert to my estate in the same manner as it will revert to my said estate upon the death of my said wife.\nM. Carter est mort un peu plus d'un an apr\u00e8s avoir fait son testament. Sa femme lui a surv\u00e9cu et aux termes du testament 'elle est devenue l\u00e9gataire universelle, vu qu'ils n'ont pas eu d'enfants. La somme de $25,000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9e par les fiduciares, qui \u00e9taient en m\u00eame temps ex\u00e9cuteurs testatmentaires, et le revenu en a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Carter, qui ne s'est pas remari\u00e9e et qui est morte elle-m\u00eame le 21 ao\u00fbt 1917, laissant un testament par lequel elle nommait l'intim\u00e9, M. Goldstein, son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et son fr\u00e8re et sa soeur qui demeuraient en Angleterre, ses l\u00e9gataires universels.\nLes h\u00e9ritiers de M. Carter, qui sont les appelants, pr\u00e9tendent que cette somme de $25,000 mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe 5 du testament de M. Carter leur appartient et que les mots \"revert to my estate\" veulent dire \"retourne \u00e0 mes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux.\" M. Goldstein, l'intim\u00e9, pr\u00e9tend, au contraire, que cette somme devait revenir d'abord \u00e0 ses enfants sous la clause 15 de ce testament et qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants cette somme devenait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Madame Carter, et que les repr\u00e9sentants de cette derni\u00e8re ont le droit de la revendiquer.\nM. Carter avait fait son testament dans l'espoir qu'il aurait des enfants; aussi il les avait institu\u00e9s ses l\u00e9gataires universels. En m\u00eame tremps, il voulait assurer \u00e0 sa femme les moyens de vivre et il y avait stipul\u00e9 qu'elle aurait la jouissance d'une somme de $25,000 pendant sa viduit\u00e9 ou sa vie durante. Si M. Carter e\u00fbt laiss\u00e9 des enfants \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, il ne peut pas y avoir de doute que la nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette somme de $25,000 aurait fait partie du patrimoine de ces enfants comme h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes ou comme l\u00e9gataires universels de leur p\u00e8re Mais il n'a pas laiss\u00e9 d'enfants et alors le legs universel stipul\u00e9 en leur faveur devenait caduc et sa femme recueillait la succession comme l\u00e9gataire universelle. Maintenant dans cette succession se trouvait cette somme de $25;000 (art. 596 C.C.) Malgr\u00e9 l'expression un peu \u00e9trange dont se servait M. Carter dans ces mots \"revert to my estate,\" il ne pouvait pas emp\u00eacher la nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette somme d'appartenir \u00e0 quelqu'un \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Ce b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ne pouvait pas \u00eatre l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ou le fiduciaire qui n'est \"qu'un l\u00e9gataire pour la forme\", oblig\u00e9 de tenir en d\u00e9p\u00f4t la somme l\u00e9gu\u00e9e et de l'administrer jusqu'au jour de la remise au \"l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9el.\" Michaux, Des Testaments, p. 220, no. 1428; Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire, vbo. fiduciaire, no. 3; Zachariae, Aubry & Rau, vol. 6, par. 694, texte et note 9.\nCette somme de $25,000, en supposant que M. Carter e\u00fbt eu des enfants \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, aurait donc appartenu en jouissance \u00e0 sa femme et en nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants. Du moment qu'il n'avait pas d'enfants, la somme appartenait \u00e0 sa femme en jouissance et en nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9, vu qu'elle \u00e9tait institu\u00e9e sa l\u00e9gataire universelle \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants. Elle aurait eu le droit de revendiquer cette somme des l\u00e9gataires universels \u00e0 raison des dispositions de l'art. 479 du Code Civil qui d\u00e9clare que l'usufruit qui \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 au testament en sa faveur \u00e9tait \u00e9teint\npar la consolidation ou la r\u00e9union sur la m\u00eame t\u00eate des deux qualit\u00e9s d'usufruitier ou de propri\u00e9taire.\nCe qui caract\u00e9rise le legs universel, c'est la vocation du l\u00e9gataire \u00e0 l'universalit\u00e9 des biens qui composent le patrimoine du testateur. Dans le cas actuel, le testateur, en l\u00e9guant le surplus de ses biens \u00e0 sa femme, a montr\u00e9 son intention bien \u00e9vidente d'exclure ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes de sa succession. Laurent, vol. 13, no. 516.\nAubry & Rau, vol. 7, p. 466, parag. 714.\nDemolombe, vol. 4, Donations, p. 542.\nCette somme d\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Carter est devenue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue de Mme Carter; et alors il n'y a pas lieu d'invoquer au soutien de leur pr\u00e9tention, comme les appelants Font fait, l'article 838 du Code Civil. Le transmission de la nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette somme de $25,000 ne devait pas s'accomplir qu'apr\u00e8s la mort de Madame Carter, comme le disent les appelants, mais cette transmission s'est produite d\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur; autrement nous serions en pr\u00e9sence d'une disposition testamentaire ill\u00e9gale parce qu'elle laisserait une partie des biens sans propri\u00e9taire au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur.\nLe mot succession ou \"estate\" ne se rapporte pas simplement \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de la succession l\u00e9gitime; il couvre aussi la succession testamentaire. De fait, la succession l\u00e9gitime n'a lieu que dans le cas o\u00f9 le de cujus n'a pas laiss\u00e9 de testament. S'il y a un testament, et s'il y a institution d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 on un l\u00e9gataire universel de nomm\u00e9, alors cette disposition testamentaire \u00e9carte la succession l\u00e9gitime. (Art. 597 C.C.)\nM. Carter, en donnant le surplus de ses biens \u00e0 ses enfants et \u00e0 leur d\u00e9faut, \u00e0 sa femme, a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re la vocation, comme disent les auteurs, \u00e0 l'universalit\u00e9 des biens qui composant son patrimoine. [Beaudry-Lacantinerie, Des Testaments, nos. 2288 & 2298]\nJe suis donc d'opinion que les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes de M.

(1888)\u2014Art. 1537 C.C.\nThe appellant obtained in 1896 a location ticket for a colonization lot situated in the Province of Quebec, but no letters patent were issued. In 1909, he was served with a notice of cancellation on the ground of non-compliance with the conditions of the licence 1\u00b0 as to residence, 2\u00b0 as to cultivation and building of an habitable house, and 3\u00b0 as to non-payment of the nominal purchase price. Within the delays mentioned in the notice, the appellant sent a declaration under oath setting forth his reasons against cancellation, which affidavit was duly received and put on file in the department of Crown Lands. Later a superior officer of the department made a report on a printed form recommending the cancellation of this license, amongst many others, on the ground of non-compliance with all the three above-mentioned conditions and also stating that there had been no opposition by the ticket holders. The appellant's location ticket was subsequently cancelled and the same lot was re-sold under similar license to the respondent L'Heureux. The appellant then brought an action p\u00e9titoire against the respondent L'Heureux asking for a declamation that he was the owner of the lot; and the Attorney General for Quebec intervened in the case. The evidence shows that the two first grounds for cancellation contained in the notice were well founded but that the third one was not. At the trial, only the superior officer could give some explanations on the matter, as the deputy minister had previously died.\nHeld, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that upon the evidence the deputy minister, notwithstanding the erroneous report made to him, was fully acquainted with all the essential facts of the case and that he must have, after full consideration of appellant's objections, cancelled the licence for non-compliance with the two first conditions contained in the notice.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.

(1909) that the owner or occupant may, during the delay between notice and cancellation \"set forth his reasons against such cancellation,\" impliedly prescribes consideration of such reasons by the officer empowered to order cancellation as a condition precedent to his exercising that power, and in this case the deputy minister ordered the cancellation of the appellant's location ticket relying upon a report made to him that there was no opposition.\nAt the time the appellant obtained his licence the statute law required sixty days notice of cancellation to be given; but, at the time the notice in this case was given, this law had been amended and the time reduced to thirty days. A thirty days notice was given to the appellant, who filed his objections within such delay.\nHeld, Duff J. contra, and Anglin J. expressing no opinion, that the new law was applicable to the appellant, as the statutory change was not one dealing with the conditions and obligations of the license but one pertaining to the mode and method by which the minister could exercise his jurisdiction to cancel.\nPer Duff J.\u2014A \"licence of occupation\" under sect. 1270 R.S.Q. [1888] confers upon the licensee not only a right of occupation and possession but an interest in the land sui generis; and the above legislation must be treated as affecting substantive rights of the licensee and not as an enactment relating to procedure.\nPer Davies C. J. and Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The deputy minister had express power to adjudicate and sign the cancellation under art. 1244 R.S.Q. (1888); and, per Davies C. J. and Idington, J., if this article only meant that the deputy minister could sign on behalf of the minister after the latter had himself determined to cancel, it must be presumed that the minister has authorized his deputy to do so.

Holland v Ross[1]; Dech\u00e8ne v City of Montreal[2]; Ross v Beaudry[3].\nThe minister of Crown Lands alone has power to order the cancellation; and the deputy minister has not that power under art. 1527 R.S.Q. (1909).\nThere has not been a valid exercise of the power of cancellation owing to ignorance or misrepresentation of material facts, and there has been disregard of the fundamental principle of extending to a person a iair and impartial hearing before subjecting him to confiscation.\nLanctot K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the Attorney General\u2014Notwithstanding the inaccurate report made to him, the deputy minister rightly signed the revocation with the whole file relating to the matter before him and in full knowledge of all the facts of the case. The change in the statute law relating to the delays of notification has a retrospective operation, as the enactment deals with procedure only and does not affect vested rights under a contract.\nMajor for the respondent L'Heureux.\nLafleur K.C. and Beauregard for the appellant.\nMajor for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This was a dispute between two location ticket holders of provincial crown lands, lot no. 11 in the township of Nedelec, Province of Quebec. Marcoux the plaintiff, appellant, in 1896, obtained his location ticket for the lot which was subsequently cancelled by the deputy-minister of the department of Crown Lands and the lots re-sold under similar location ticket to respondent L'Heureux.\nThe present action is brought by Marcoux against L'Heureux to have the cancellation of the former's location ticket declared to be illegal on the grounds that (1) proper notice of the intention to cancel was not given; (2) that the deputy-minister had not the power to cancel; and (3) that if he had the power to cancel, he did so acting under false representations made to him by the superintendent Grenier to the effect that Marcoux had not paid the nominal purchase price of the lot (some $25.00) and had not made objection to the cancellation.\nAs to the first ground of proper notice of cancellation, I am of the opinion that it is not tenable. At the time Marcoux obtained his licence the statute law required 60 days notice of cancellation to be given, but, at the time the notice was given, this law had been amended and the time reduced to thirty days.\nThe contention of counsel for the appellant was that the 60 days required by the statute when the location ticket was issued governed, and that the amendment reducing the time to 30 days did not apply to the location ticket of appellant Marcoux which was granted previously to that amendment.\nThe statutory provisions at the time the notice of cancellation was given were articles 1574 to 1579 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909). They provided inter alia for the time and manner in which the notice should be given and that it should\nstate that the cancellation shall take place if necessary, at any time after thirty days from the date of the posting and that during such thirty days the owner or occupant of the lot may set forth his reasons against such cancellation.\nThe appellant complied with this statutory right or privilege and filed his reasons against the cancellation with the department within the thirty days.\nAs to the conditions or obligations of the licensee under his location ticket non-compliance with which gave rise to a cause for forfeiture, they were: (1) taking possession of the land within six months; (2) continued residence thereon and occupation either by himself or other persons for at least two years; (3) within four years at the outside clearing and bringing under cultivation an area equal to at least ten acres for every hundred acres and the building of a habitable house at least sixteen feet by twenty feet.\nIt was not and could not be contended that these conditions were complied with. Appellant never built such habitable house, or resided on the lot personally or by others for him, or cleared or brought under cultivation part of it. The evidence as to such non-compliance was conclusive in my opinion. What was done by him was in conjunction with Dr. Bour-bonnais, his brother-in-law, to erect a saw mill on certain other lands obtained by them from the Dominion government on an Indian reserve, over a mile distant from the lot in dispute, and to strip or partially strip this lot 11 and other adjoining lots which they held under other location tickets of lumber to supply the mill. The residences of Dr. Bourbonnais and the appellant were erected in proximity to the mill and neither of them on or near the lot in question.\nThe question then remains whether, even admitting such non-compliance, the necessary notice of cancellation was given before cancellation, i.e. whether the 30 days' notice given was sufficient.\nA broad distinction exists and must be drawn, in my opinion, between a statutory change in any of the conditions or obligations of the licence noncompliance with which would give rise to a forfeiture, and such changes in the mode and method by which the Commissioner of Crown Lands when attempting to exercise his jurisdiction to cancel was to be governed. The former are, of course, part of the contract and unless covered by the express words of the amending statute would not be held applicable to location tickets, such as the one in question, previously issued.\nBut the manner and methods by which the commissioner should proceed in order to exercise his powers of cancellation were mere procedure. I think the statutory change in the notice required to be given to the licensee of the location ticket before cancellation from 60 to 30 days was of this latter character.\nAs a fact the appellant Marcoux acted upon this notice and within the thirty days filed with the Department his objections. From the evidence in the case I cannot doubt that they were considered by the deputy-minister Tach\u00e9 when he cancelled the location. It is true that the report of his officer Grenier to him, which was made on a printed form recommending the cancellation of this licence amongst many others, stated as the ground of such recommendation not only the non-compliance with the conditions of the licence as to residence, cultivation, building of habitable house, etc., but also non-payment of the nominal purchase price and the want of objections to the cancellation. These two latter grounds were inaccurate. The nominal price had been paid and the objections to cancellation had been submitted to the department and were on file.\nI have not any doubt at all from the evidence that Mr. Tach\u00e9, the deputy minister, was fully acquainted with all the essential facts of this case, including the payment of the purchase price, the filing of the licensee's objections to cancellation and the non-compliance with the conditions of the licence. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Tach\u00e9 had died before the trial.\nThe dossier or file before him with reference to this lot in question and the number of times the question had been discussed in the department and the nature of the objections to cancellation made by the appellant and Dr. Bourbonnais preclude me from thinking that the deputy minister could have been misled by the report of Mr. Grenier on the two points mentioned. But this Grenier report was one referring to a number of lots besides the one in question as to which lot I am convinced the deputy minister Tach\u00e9 knew well the purchase price had' been paid and the objections to cancellation filed. He made his order of cancellation, in my opinion, clearly on the ground of noncompliance with the conditions of the location ticket, those relating to residence, cultivation, building of a habitable house, etc., which was quite sufficient and of which there was the amplest evidence. As to his power to adjudicate and sign the cancellation, I am of the opinion that Art. 1244, R.S.Q. conferred upon him the express power to do so. If it only meant, as contended, that he could sign on behalf of the minister himself and that after the latter had determined to cancel, then I would say that the presumption would be that the minister has authorized him to do so. But I cannot accept the argument as to the limited character of the powers of the deputy minister under Art. 1244. I think he had ample power to adjudicate and formally to sign the cancellation.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant obtained the following location ticket on the date thereof:\u2014\nAGENCE DES TERRES DE LA COURONNE\nBaie des P\u00e8res, 3 nov. 1896.\n$4.86.\nRe\u00e7u de Elie Marcoux la somme de quatre 86\/100 piastres, \u00e9tant le premier versement d'un cinqui\u00e8me du prix d'achat de 81 acres de terre contenus dans le lot no. 11 dans le township de N\u00e9d\u00e9lec, P.Q., la balance \u00e9tant payable en quatre versements \u00e9gaux avec int\u00e9r\u00e9t de cette date.\nCette vente, si elle n'est pas desapprouv\u00e9e par le Commissaire des Terres de la Couronne, est faite sujette aux conditions suivantes, savoir:\nL'acqu\u00e9reur devra prendre possession de la terre ainsi vendue dans les six mois de la date de la pr\u00e9sente vente, et continuer d'y r\u00e9sider et de l'occuper, soit par lui-m\u00eame, soit par d'autres, pendant au moins deux ans \u00e0 compter de ce temps; et, dans le cours de quatre ann\u00e9es au plus, il devra d\u00e9fricher et mettre en culture une \u00e9tendue d'icelle \u00e9gale \u00e0 au moins dix acres par chaque cent acres, et y construire une maison habitable d'au moins seize pieds sur vingt.

E. GUAY,\nAgent.\nAt foot thereof was printed on same sheet as the foregoing but in no other way forming part of the contract created by the location ticket itself, the following:\u2014\nAvis:\u2014Lorsque le Commissaire des Terres de la Couronne est convaincu qu'aucun acqu\u00e9reur de terres publiques ou son concession-aire, repr\u00e9sentant ou ayant cause s'est rendu coupable d'aucune fraude ou abus, ou a enfreint ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d'accomplir quelque condition de la vente; aussi lorsqu'une vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par m\u00e9prise ou erreur, il peut canceller telle vente, reprendre la terre y d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, et en disposer de m\u00eame que si elle n'eut jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. (Voir l'article 1283 des Statuts Refondus de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.)\nThe appellant never erected on said land such a dwelling house as the conditions required, never in fact resided thereon, never cleared and cultivated the prescribed quantity of land required by the conditions. Yet he paid in course of time the price named of which the last instalment was paid on 7th Nov., 1903.\nOn the 15th April, 1909, the officers of the Crown Lands department began proceedings to have appellant's rights forfeited for breach of the conditions in said contract.\nThe statutory provisions then in force relative thereto were sections 1574 to 1579 inclusive, R.S.Q. [1909].\nThe first of these empowered the minister for many reasons, including such as I have already mentioned above as indicative of conditions, to take steps to cancel such sale as above set forth. By section 1575 such cancellation was declared to effect a complete forfeiture, but provided also that the minister might nevertheless grant such compensation or indemnity as he might consider just and equitable.\nSections 1576 to 1579 are as follows:\u2014\n1576. Such right of revocation shall not be deemed an ordinary right of dissolution of a contract for non-fulfilment of conditions; it shall not be subject to article 1537 of the Civil Code, and may always be exercised as occasion may require, whatever time may have elapsed since the sale, grant, location, lease or occupation licence.\n1577. No cancellation under article 1574 shall be made before a notice is given by the Minister or by a Crown lands' agent authorized by him in the manner hereinafter indicated.\n1578. Such notice shall be posted by the Crown lands' agent, or by any person authorized by him, on the door of the church or chapel or other public building nearest to the lots in question, and shall be sent by post card to the purchaser, grantee, locatee, or lessee of any public land or his assigns mentioned in article 1574.\nThe notice shall state that the cancellation shall take place, if necessary, at any time after thirty days from the date of the posting.\n1579. During such thirty days the owner or occupant of the lot may set forth his reasons against such cancellation.\nIt is upon the operative effect of one or all of these provisions that this appeal should turn and upon the question of the deputy minister to act instead of the minister to which I will presently advert.\nIt was argued before us by the counsel for the appellant that the article 1283 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec referred to in the above notice, formed part of the contract in question, by virtue of the notice being so given, and by force of the statutory provision, existent in said article which was in full force and effect at the date of the location ticket and hence that the sixty days' notice required thereby, and so far as like contracts, made whilst that was in force, imperatively governed the terms upon which the Minister could act in declaring the rights acquired by the location ticket forfeited.\nI cannot assent to such a proposition of law. Of course if I could come to the conclusion, by any correct process of reasoning, that the said statute formed an essential part of the contract or created an obligation on the Crown in relation thereto and that it must be read as if it had formed part thereof, I would find some difficulty in upholding any decision wherein the minister had acted in that regard without giving the sixty days' notice.\nFor example we have many statutory provisions such as those declaring that, in certain cases of insurance, statutory conditions set forth must be and form part of the terms of that class of contract; in some of our western provinces provisions that certain named conditions in machine contracts are essential to the validity thereof; and in Ontario and others, as well as in England, that certain conveyances of land, or leases made pursuant thereto, must be held to contain certain covenants or other provisions which must be observed and I think in some cases of leases the right to terminate is made dependent on the observation of certain specified statutory terms.\nIn all such like contracts falling within the respective ambits of such like statutory rights or obligations the statutory enactment must be read as if it had by consent of the contracting parties formed part of their contract. And the provisions of later enactments cannot be regarded as a means of terminating the contractual relations so formed unless the legislature in the exercise of its supreme power over all rights of contract or property saw fit to declare same forfeit.\nThe means of terminating such a contract as in question herein (for breach of contractual condition) I respectfully submit is a subject entirely within the province of the legislature, a mere matter of judicial procedure or otherwise which maybe changed from year to year as it deems fit and forms no part of the contract. Any other view seems to lead to the conclusion that inasmuch as the clause was obliterated by its repeal by virtue of another being substituted, there was left no remedy.\nThe reorganizing of our courts of judicature often imposes hardships or confers benefits not expected by contracting parties.\nAnd we see by article 1576, above quoted, how careful the legislature was to observe that conception of the law by expressly withdrawing therein the peculiar procedure enacted herein from any possible operation of article 1537 of the Civil Code.\nIndeed it goes so far as to substitute thereby rules of its own for the purpose by which, but for the above enactment, reliance might have been placed upon some of the other articles of the Code referred to therein somewhat of the character of legislation I have just now adverted to.\nI think beyond any question the minister had the power to determine herein such questions as he did, or his deputy (if in fact he so acted in his stead) did, and the only remaining questions are, first, whether the deputy minister had the like power under and by virtue of article 1527 of the R.S.Q. 1909, which reads as follows:\u2014\n1527. Without prejudice to the control of the minister, the deputy minister shall have the superintendence of the other officers, clerks, messengers or servants, and the general control of all the affairs of the department. His orders shall be executed in the same way as those of the minister himself, and his authority shall be deemed to be that of the head of the department, so that he can validly affix his signature in his said capacity, and thereby give force and authority to all acts, receipts, occupation licences, contracts or deeds of sale, location-tickets, letters patent, adjudications, revocations of sales or locations, and all other documents within the jurisdiction of the department. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, from time to time, whenever he thinks proper, revoke the powers of the deputy minister, wholly or in part.\nI am of the opinion that the deputy minister had in law thereby such a power as exercised herein and now in question.\nIn any event, until the contrary is established by evidence, the presumption must be, if only the minister could determine, that the minister had so disposed of the matter, and the deputy minister in signing was properly discharging the duty of affixing his signature to that which his superior had determined.\nThere is unfortunately no evidence of fact as the deputy minister has since died.\nThe slovenly manner in which the formal judgment was drawn up and submitted, by alleging non-payment of the price when in fact paid, and the allegation of absence of any answer on the part of the appellant to the notice, when in fact there was abundant evidence that he had answered it, tends to shake one's confidence in the legal presumption I rely upon, yet I do not think it can be ignored when either party might, as it affected both, have adduced evidence to the contrary if it would have served him.\nI suspect each knew there was nothing to be gained thereby.\nAs to the question so much relied upon, of no hearing given to the other side, I presume the forcible presentation thereof largely depended on the proposition that sixty days' notice was required.\nI find that contention untenable, and such presentations of the appellant's case as made by himself and on his behalf by Dr. Bourbonnais, his brother-in-law, were such as secured to them all that could be said. In regard to the case of Paulson v. The King[4] cited in argument as sufficient to entitle appellant to claim waiver I do not, on an examination of the facts, find it applicable here.\nThe last payment was as stated above made in 1903 and I do not see how that would help to protect appellant to cover his persistent breach of conditions for five and a half years longer.\nAnd in that connection I may remark that the entire misconception of appellant, as to his rights, seems to have been rather remarkable, else he never should have taken a location on such lot. Yet notwithstanding all that I should have been disposed, if given the power, to exercise that given the minister, if the facts, possibly one sided, in this case, in regard to the expense of drainage improving the land warranted doing so.\nHence I have from that and undesirable features the case presents considered whether or not costs of this appeal should be allowed but concluded we cannot afford to encourage litigation by acting in regard to costs further that it concerns those directly concerned.\nAnd hence, hoping the intervenant may reconsider some things though deprived of costs, I would dismiss this appeal but only with costs to the respondent and no costs to intervenant despite the excellent argument presented on his behalf enuring to the benefit of respondent.\nDuff J. (dissenting)\u2014A \"licence of occupation\" under sec. 1270 of the Revised Statutes of 1888 although described in terms as a licence confers upon the licensee not only a right of occupation and possession but an interest in the land, a true droit r\u00e9el; an interest, it may be, not easily definable by reference to the ordinary juristic categories and perhaps sui generis, but an interest of quite definite characteristics deducible from the statute itself. This was in effect held in a series of cases in the courts of Upper Canada and Ontario decided upon statutory provisions not differing in substance from the articles of the Quebec statute now before us; and the propriety of these decisions has never been questioned. Hendersonv. Seymour[5]; Henderson v. Westover[6].\nIt was conceded by counsel for the respondents that failure on part of the licensee to perform the conditions of the licence would not ipso jure operate to put an end to his interest; that, it was admitted, could only take place through the act of the commissioner in exercise of the power of cancellation given by Art. 1283; and it seems permissible to speak of this divestive condition as one of the elements determining the character of the licensee's right; and consequently to describe any alteration of the terms upon which this right of cancellation becomes operative (making that right more onerous for the licensee) as an alteration of the law prejudicing the licensee in his substantive rights.\nPrima facie therefore any change in the law which would, if applicable, have such effect must, if expressed in general terms, be held to exclude existing licences of occupation from its purview. \"Retrospective laws are\" said Willes J. for the Exchequer Chamber in Phillips v Eyre[7] no doubt prima facie a questionable policy, and contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of then existing law. \"Leges et constitutiones futuris certum est dare formam negotiis non ad facta praeterita revocari; nisi nominatum et de praeterito tempore et adhuc pendentibus negotiis cautum sit.\" Accordingly, the court will not ascribe retrospective force to new laws affecting rights, unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that such was the intention of the legislature.\nIs this a case governed by this general principle or does it fall within the special rule that no suitor has a vested interest in any course of procedure? Is the provision of the law requiring 60 days notice as a condition of the exercise of the power of cancellation a provision relating to \"procedure\" within the meaning of this rule? I have no doubt that \"procedure\" within this rule means procedure in a court of justice and therefore the present case is not strictly within the terms in which this exception to the general principle is commonly stated. On the other hand, the general principle itself is a principle of construction (based, Lord Coke says, 2 Inst. 292, upon \"a rule and law of parliament\") and the inference from this practice of parliament must, of course, give way where an intention to the contrary is plainly manifested and this intention to the contrary has sometimes been inferred from the subject matter and the circumstances of the legislation. Gardner v. Lucas[8]; West v. Gwynne[9]; Welby v. Parker[10]. Is the analogy between this provision and an enactment relating to procedure in the strict sense, that is to say, a processual enactment sufficiently close and sufficiently obvious to justify that inference? Such enactments may safely be assumed to be fashioned with a view to removing anomalies and causes of unnecessary delay and to securing the proper object of all forensic procedure, the judicial determination of controversies about legal rights after a fair hearing of the parties and to be administered accordingly, and (see Maxwell on Statutes, 400 and 401) it is no fair cause of complaint on the part of any litigant that the disposition of his cause should be regulated by rules of procedure so conceived. And when one considers the general inconvenience and confusion which must attend a system under which at one and the same time causes of the same class are regulated by different sets of procedure, the necessity becomes immediately apparent of the canon that such enactments are retrospective in the sense that they apply to all future proceedings irrespective of the time when the rights asserted in such proceedings arose, unless, to refer to Lord Blackburn's judgment in Gardiner v. Lucas[11] there is some good reason to the contrary.\nThese considerations are not fully applicable to the present question. The argument from inconvenience has relatively little or no weight; on the other hand it seems to be a reasonable presumption that the legislature in reducing the period from 60 days to 30 was acting upon the view that the shorter period would be sufficient and that the reduction would entail no serious risk of injustice; and that the legislature intended the amendment to be retrospective in its operation, may not unfairly be advanced as a proper deduction from this premise. As against that it may be said that there is a wide difference between proceedings which take place under the general system of remedial law before a court of general jurisdiction and a proceeding which merely consists of the steps that a grantor is obliged to take under the provisions of a private instrument or under the provisions of a statute, limited in its application to a particular type of instrument for the purpose of enabling him to exercise a power reserved to him to put an end to the estate or interest created by his grant. The circumstance that the grantor is the Government and that the official whose duty it is to exercise the discretion vested in the Government (although he is to exercise that discretion, it must be admitted, on grounds in relation to which he must be assumed to be personally indifferent) suggests an analogy to proceedings in a court of justice which I must say I think is deceptive. On the whole, although the point is a very debatable one, I think this legislation falls on the other side of the line and must for the purpose of determining the question before us, be treated as legislation affecting substantive rights and not as an enactment relating to procedure.\nI have discussed the questions presented upon the assumption that the appellant's rights as licensee rest upon the provisions of the statute. It was argued that the reciprocal rights of the Crown and the licensee rest upon contract, the terms of the contract being those expressed in the receipt dated the 3rd November, 1896, which is in evidence. We have not before us the regulations under which this receipt is issued and I have heard no good reason for holding that the statutory rights of the appellant\u2014and by that I mean, of course, the rights arising from the enactments of the statute considered in themselves\u2014are to suffer any reduction or impairment or qualification by force of the terms of a departmental receipt. If the relation is to be described as that of a contract, the provisions relating to cancellation are, in my judgment, elements of that contract and indeed I am not sure, even upon the Attorney General's hypothesis, that the avis appended to the receipt in which article 1283 of the Revised Statutes of 1888 is brought to the notice of the licensee, would not be sufficient in itself to produce this effect.\nThe Attorney General places some emphasis upon the last sentence of the receipt which is in these words :\nCette vente est aussi sujette aux licences de coupe de bois actuellement en force, et l'acqu\u00e9reur sera oblig\u00e9 de se conformer aux lois et r\u00e8glements concernant les terres publiques, les bois et for\u00eats, les mines et p\u00eacheries dans cette province;\nand the argument derived from this sentence is based upon the contrast between the use in the second limb of the sentence, without qualification, of the phrase \"lois et r\u00e8glements concernant les terres publiques &c.\" and the qualification appended in the first limb to the phrase \"licences de coupe de bois\" which are limited explicitly to those \"actuellement en force\" and the contention is that the employment of the phrase \"lois et r\u00e8glements\" without qualification indicates an intention to embrace within the scope of this term of the receipt amendments made during the currency of the licence. It seems sufficient to say that this argument proves too much. It is not argued that the terms of the licence prescribing the duties of the licensee, for example, in relation to residence or to clearing are intended to be subject to such legislative change, which would be the necessary consequence fo adopting the construction contended for. There is another ground upon which I think the appeal should succeed. Both in the Revised Statutes of 1888, which the appellant says governed the proceedings, and in the Revised Statutes of 1909, which the respondent invokes, there is explicit provision for the presentation by the licensee of his reasons against any proposed cancellation. This provision imports, I think, what would probably be otherwise implied, that a cancellation parte inaudita has no validity under the statute. And I think it is established that the appellant, although he did everything it was incumbent on him to do for the purpose of bringing his representations to the attention of the Commissioner, was in effect denied this statutory right. There is no question of intentional misconduct; least of all on part of the deputy commissioner, the late Mr. Tach\u00e9. For some unexplained reason, the statement of the case as presented to Mr. Tach\u00e9 for adjudication by the officials of the department represented that the licensee was not opposing cancellation. I am quite unable, with great respect, to follow the process by which the effect of the formal official document is sought to be displaced by reference to the vague impressions of departmental officials. There is nothing before us, in my opinion, outweighing or counterbalancing the inference properly arising from the documents themselves.\nThe facts in evidence, Mr. Lanct\u00f4t in his very able argument urged, leave no room for doubt that Mr. Tach\u00e9 in fact at the time of the adjudication was fully acquainted with all the circumstances pertinent to the inquiry with which he was charged. I think that with one qualification Mr. Lanct\u00f4t made his point good\u2014but that qualification is fatal to the argument. I cannot infer in face of the formal statement that Mr. Tach\u00e9 had before his mind the fact that the locatee was opposing cancellation or that he had before him the representations which the locatee desired the commissioner to consider in passing upon his case. Needless to say, speculation as to what the deputy commissioner might have done in any event is idle. One term of the condition to which the appellant's rights were subject was that before cancellation he should have an opportunity to present to the commissioner the considerations by which he desired to induce the government to withhold its hand and to state these reasons in his own way. That right was denied him. Qui statuit aliquid parte inaudita altera aequum licet statuerit aequum non fuit.\nAnglin J. (dissenting)\u2014I am of the opinion that the cancellation of the location ticket of the appellant should be declared null and void substantially on the ground on which Pelletier and Martin JJ. dissented from the opinion of the majority of the Court of King's Bench.\nIn providing by article 1579 (R.S.Q. 1909) that the owner or occupant may, during the thirty days required by article 1578 to elapse between notice and cancellation, \"set forth his reasons against such cancellation,\" the legislature impliedly prescribes consideration of such reasons, if furnished, by the officer empowered to order cancellation as a condition precedent to his exercising that right. The appellant made an affidavit setting forth his reasons for opposing the cancellation of his location ticket and it was duly received by the department within thirty days of the posting of the notice. Nevertheless the officer in charge of the file reported, inter alia, that no opposition had been made; and upon that report, as appears by his certificate subjoined to it, the Deputy Minister ordered cancellation. I am not prepared to accept Mr. Gr\u00e9nier's explanations and impressions as sufficiently dependable to controvert the statements made in that official document. I think it is conclusively established for the purposes of this case that Marcoux's \"reasons against cancellation\" were not presented to, or considered by, Mr. Tach\u00e9. There was therefore not only failure to observe the implied condition of jurisdiction imposed by the statute, but a grave disregard of a fundamental canon of natural justice\u2014audi alteram partem.\nAssuming, but without so deciding, that the notice given as prescribed by Arts. 1577-8 of the Revision of 1909 was sufficient and that the deputy minister was empowered by Art. 1527 to order the cancellation, I would allow the plaintiff's appeal on the ground above stated.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans cette cause si l'annulation par le d\u00e9partement des Terres de la Couronne d'un billet de location a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et l\u00e9gale.\nLe 3 novembre 1896, l'agent local du departement des Terres vendait par billet de location \u00e0 l'appelant Marcoux le lot no. 11 du canton de Nedelec pour une somme nominale, et ce dernier s'obligeait de d\u00e9fricher et de mettre en culture ce lot et de s'y b\u00e2tir une maison.\nVers le m\u00eame temps, le beau-fr\u00e8re de Marcoux, le Dr Bourbonnais, et Marcoux lui-m\u00eame, se portaient acqu\u00e9reurs des dix autres premiers lots du m\u00eame canton.\nLe Docteur Bourbonnais avait projet\u00e9 de faire dans cette r\u00e9gion une exploitation agricole et foresti\u00e8re et \u00e0 cette fin il avait pris avec son beau-fr\u00e8re, sous billets de location, ces onze lots de terre qui \u00e9taient tous bois\u00e9s. Il songea d'abord \u00e0 construire un moulin \u00e0 scie sur les deux premiers lots qui se trouvent sur les bords de la rivi\u00e8re des Quinze, mais ayant constat\u00e9 que ces deux lots \u00e9taient inond\u00e9s la plus grande partie de Tann\u00e9e, il acheta du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral certains lots voisins qui faisaient partie d'une r\u00e9serve indienne et qui aboutaient aux lots du canton de Nedelec. Il construisit alors sa scierie sur ses lots de la r\u00e9serve indienne, y construisit en m\u00eame temps des maisons, granges et d\u00e9pendances et y fit du d\u00e9frichement et de la culture.\nIl n\u00e9gligea, ainsi que Marcoux, de remplir sur les lots du canton de Nedelec les obligations qu'ils avaient contract\u00e9es. A l'exception de la confection d'un foss\u00e9, d'un peu d'abatis et de quelques autres menus travaux, rien n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur les lots de Nedelec.\nLa preuve nous d\u00e9montre, par exemple, qu'aucune partie de ces derniers lots ne fut mise en culture et qu'aucune maison habitable n'y fut construite ainsi que le requ\u00e9raient la loi et le billet de location. On s'est content\u00e9 de payer le prix de vente, qui \u00e9tait un prix nominal, et de repr\u00e9senter pendant des ann\u00e9es et des ann\u00e9es au d\u00e9partement des Terres et au gouvernement que les lots Nedelec avaient pour devanture les lots acquis par le Dr Bourbonnais sur la r\u00e9serve indienne et que les b\u00e2tisses et le d\u00e9frichement faits sur ces derniers lots rencontraient sinon la lettre, du moins l'esprit de la loi.\nLe d\u00e9partement des terres, apr\u00e8s treize ans, soit en 1909, d\u00e9cida d'annuler les billets de location des lots conc\u00e9d\u00e9s dans le canton de Nedelec pour la raison que les conditions d'\u00e9tablissement, de r\u00e9sidence et de culture n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies et les revendit sous billet de location au d\u00e9fendeur L'Heureux. La pr\u00e9sente action, qui est de la nature d'une action p\u00e9titoire dirig\u00e9e contre le nouvel acqu\u00e9reur L'Heureux, a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e par Marcoux pour faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gal cette d\u00e9cision du d\u00e9partement; et il invoque trois principales raisons contre la validit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision: 1\u00b0 l'insuffisance de l'avis; 2\u00b0 l'incomp\u00e9tence du sous-ministre de prononcer la r\u00e9solution; 3\u00b0 les fausses repr\u00e9sentations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au sous-ministre et sa n\u00e9gligence de consid\u00e9rer les objections de Marcoux.\nInsuffisance de l'avis.\nQuand le billet de location a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, la loi exigeait qu'un avis de soixante jours f\u00fbt donn\u00e9 avant que le ministre p\u00fbt annuler un billet de location. Plus tard, cette loi fut modifi\u00e9e et la l\u00e9gislature d\u00e9cida qu'un d\u00e9lai de trente jours serait suffisant. Le d\u00e9partement a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sous la nouvelle loi et n'a pas donn\u00e9 les soixante jours d'avis. La question qui se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 ce sujet est de savoir si la loi nouvelle a un effet r\u00e9troactif.\nEn principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les lois n'ont pas d'effet r\u00e9troactif. Lorsqu'une loi nouvelle vient remplacer une autre relative au m\u00eame objet, la loi ancienne r\u00e9git seule les actes juridiques qui se sont d\u00e9finitivement accomplis sous son empire sans que la loi nouvelle puisse leur porter aucune atteinte. Mais il arrive qu'un acte juridique accompli sous l'empire de l'ancienne loi puisse produire des cons\u00e9quences sous l'empire de la nouvelle loi. Il s'agit de savoir alors quelle est la loi qui doit r\u00e9gir ces cons\u00e9quences.\nContre le droit acquis, la loi ne peut rien faire, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne s'en soit exprim\u00e9e formellement; mais l'int\u00e9r\u00eat social exige que la l\u00e9gislation la plus r\u00e9cente ait son effet sur les rapports juridiques n\u00e9s avant son existence. Par droits acquis, il faut entendre les facult\u00e9s l\u00e9gales r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement exerc\u00e9es. Si ces facult\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es, elles deviennent expectatives et sont soumises \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation nouvelle.\nDans le cas actuel, le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9dict\u00e9 que le gouvernement ou le d\u00e9partement des terres peut r\u00e9voquer un billet de location, si le colon ne remplit pas ses conditions d'\u00e9tablissement, et elle indique la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre. Ce n'est pas l'exercice de la facult\u00e9 du vendeur qui peut demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat faute de paiement du prix, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 1537 du Code Civil, car l'article 1285 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888 d\u00e9clare formellement que le droit de r\u00e9solution ne sera pas soumis aux dispositions de cet article du code civil. Ce droit de r\u00e9solution participe du droit public; et les dispositions des articles 1283 et suivants des dits statuts refondus d\u00e9terminent les conditions dans lesquelles ce droit de r\u00e9solution doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 et la proc\u00e9dure qui doit \u00eatre suivie.\nCette disposition relative au d\u00e9lai est soit une mati\u00e8re de prescription, soit une mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure.\nLa loi ancienne r\u00e9git toutes les prescriptions d\u00e9j\u00e0 accomplies; mais la loi nouvelle r\u00e9git toutes les prescriptions qui \u00e9taient en cours lors de la nouvelle loi ou qui ont commenc\u00e9 sous l'empire de la nouvelle loi. Or, le d\u00e9lai de soixante jours invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelant comme repr\u00e9sentant la limite de son droit a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir sous l'empire de la nouvelle loi. C'est donc cette derni\u00e8re qui doit s'appliquer. Le d\u00e9partement n'\u00e9tait donc pas tenu d'attendre soixante jours pour d\u00e9clarer la vente r\u00e9solue, mais un d\u00e9lai de trente jours \u00e9tait suffisant. Or la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue plus de trente jours apr\u00e8s l'affichage de l'avis. Si c'est une question de proc\u00e9dure, il est de principe que toutes les lois de proc\u00e9dure sont imm\u00e9diatement applicables.\nDans un cas comme dans l'autre la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant est mal fond\u00e9e.\nComp\u00e9tence du sous-ministre.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend en outre que la r\u00e9solution est nulle parce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par le sous-ministre et non par le ministre lui-m\u00eame.\nJe vois que le demandeur-appelant lui-m\u00eame, dans sa d\u00e9claration, reconna\u00eet que le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'annuler les ventes en question. Mais en supposant que le gouvernement ou le ministre n'ait pas rendu la d\u00e9cision, la loi reconna\u00eet formellement dans l'article 1244 S.R.P.Q. 1888, que le sous-ministre a la m\u00eame autorit\u00e9 sur les mati\u00e8res de cette nature que le ministre lui-m\u00eame, de sorte qu'il peut lui-m\u00eame signer toute r\u00e9solution d'un billet de location. Ce n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que ce pouvoir soit conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi au sous-ministre, quand on voit dans le cas actuel que le billet de location a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par un simple agent local des terres et qu'il pouvait \u00eatre alors valablement annul\u00e9 par son officier sup\u00e9rieur, le sous-ministre.\nD\u00e9cision erron\u00e9e et absence d'audition.\nEn troisi\u00e8me lieu, l'appelant Marcoux dit que la d\u00e9cision est nulle parce que le d\u00e9partement n'a pas validement exerc\u00e9 ses pouvoirs d'annulation, qu'il a ignor\u00e9 ou faussement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les faits et qu'il n'a pas fourni aux parties l'occasion d'\u00eatre valablement entendues. J'avais eu d'abord, lors de l'audition des plaidoiries, quelques doutes \u00e0 ce sujet; mais une \u00e9tude compl\u00e8te de la preuve et des documents produits me d\u00e9montre que ce troisi\u00e8me point est \u00e9galement mal fond\u00e9.\nIl est admis par le demandeur Marcoux qu'il n'a pas rempli les conditions d'\u00e9tablissement et de culture qui lui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es par son contrat et par la loi. Mais il ajoute que le rapport du surintendant Grenier, au bas duquel le sous-ministre a prononc\u00e9 la sentence d'annulation, contenait deux erreurs, savoir que Marcoux n'avait pas pay\u00e9 son prix de vente et qu'il ne s'opposait pas \u00e0 l'annulation.\nIl est bien vrai que cet officier Grenier, par une n\u00e9gligence un peu inexplicable, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cela dans son rapport au sous-ministre. Mais il ne faut pas attacher plus d'importance qu'il n'en faut \u00e0 l'erreur ou \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence d'un subalterne Ce que nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer est de savoir si le sous-ministre avait des raisons justifiables pour annuler ce billet de location. Quant \u00e0 cela, il ne peut pas y avoir de doute. Ce lot avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour un prix nominal, soit environ $25.00. L'intention \u00e9vidente du gouvernement en vendant ce lot \u00e9tait de le faire d\u00e9fricher et mettre en culture. Le prix de vente n'y \u00e9tait pour rien. Il s'agit pour le gouvernement de mettre en rapport ces nombreuses terres bois\u00e9es qui pourraient donner une production agricole constituant l'une des plus grandes richesses nationales.\nLe lot en question en cette cause aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9frich\u00e9 depuis longtemps et Marcoux aurait d\u00fb aller y r\u00e9sider; mais il n'avait rien fait de cela. Sept ans apr\u00e8s qu'il e\u00fbt eu la concession, l'agent local du d\u00e9partement a fait rapport que les conditions d'\u00e9tablissement sur ce lot, ainsi que sur les autres conc\u00e9d\u00e9s au Dr Bourbonnais et \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies. Le docteur Bourbonnais s'est alors adress\u00e9 au ministre du temps qui a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de temporiser et de ne pas annuler la vente. La m\u00eame question \u00e9tait reprise de temps \u00e0 autre, surtout \u00e0 chaque changement de ministre, et le Dr Bourbonnais revenait \u00e0 la charge en implorant ses bonnes gr\u00e2ces et en all\u00e9guant que ces lots du canton de Nedelec ne formaient qu'une seule exploitation avec les lots de la r\u00e9serve indienne; et que l'exploitation agricole de ces derniers se faisait rapidement et profitait aux lots du canton Nedelec.\nOn voit donc que cette situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 constamment d\u00e9battue pendant des ann\u00e9es et des ann\u00e9es entre le d\u00e9partement et les concessionnaires. De nombreuses correspondances \u00e9taient \u00e9chang\u00e9es sur ce sujet. Mais en 1909 la question \u00e9tait devenue plus br\u00fblante. Les autorit\u00e9s civiles et religieuses et les agents de colonisation protest\u00e8rent contre le fait que le Dr Bourbonnais et Marcoux ne faisaient pas de d\u00e9frichement sur leurs lots de Nedelec. Et alors le ministre fut oblig\u00e9 de prendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive. Il eut d'abord \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les demandes qui \u00e9taient faites au sujet des lots 7-8-9 et 10 du m\u00eame canton et il d\u00e9cida formellement, \u00e9videmment apr\u00e8s consultation avec ses coll\u00e8gues du gouvernement, que les billets de location \u00e9mis pour ces lots devaient \u00eatre annul\u00e9s.\nVers le m\u00eame temps, des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9taient commenc\u00e9es pour faire l'annulation de la vente des autres lots et notamment du lot en question en cette cause-ci; mais quant \u00e0 ces derniers lots, la question devenait \u00e0 proprement parler une mati\u00e8re de routine, car la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure du gouvernement et du d\u00e9partement portait que ces ventes au Dr Bourbonnais et \u00e0 Marcoux devaient \u00eatre annul\u00e9s. Les avis requis furent donn\u00e9s. Le Dr Bourbonnais et Marcoux produisirent leurs objections; et enfin le sous-ministre, le 7 juin, pronon\u00e7ait l'annulation.\nLe document qu'il a sign\u00e9 \u00e9tait imprim\u00e9 et \u00e9tait dans les termes suivants :\nJe, soussign\u00e9, en vertu des pouvoirs \u00e0 moi conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi, r\u00e9voque et annule les ventes susmentionn\u00e9es.\nEt au-dessus de cette d\u00e9cision du sous-ministre se trouvait un rapport de l'assistant-surintendant Grenier o\u00f9 il donnait les num\u00e9ros des lots dont la vente devait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e. Ce rapport imprim\u00e9 mentionnait le d\u00e9faut d'accomplissement des conditions, le d\u00e9faut de paiement et l'absence d'opposition comme raisons pour l'annulation.\nIl avait \u00e9videmment oubli\u00e9 de retrancher dans cet imprim\u00e9 les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au d\u00e9faut de paiement et aux oppositions du colon. L'appelant Marcoux pr\u00e9tend que le sous-ministre a prononc\u00e9 l'annulation sur ce rapport erron\u00e9.\nJe suis bien convaincu, au contraire, que le sous-ministre, qui est maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et qui n'a pas pu \u00eatre entendu comme t\u00e9moin, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en pleine connaissance de cause. Il n'\u00e9tait pas sans savoir que depuis dix ans pr\u00e8s Marcoux, soit par lui-m\u00eame, soit par son beau-fr\u00e8re, \u00e9tait en instances aupr\u00e8s du d\u00e9partement pour le convaincre que les conditions d'\u00e9tablissement \u00e9taient remplies, sinon \u00e0 la lettre du moins dans l'esprit de la loi. Il devait savoir \u00e9galement que ces lots avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. D'ailleurs le prix nominal auquel ces lots avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus ne peut avoir aucun effet. Ce qu'il y avait de plus important \u00e9tait la r\u00e9sidence sur ces lots et leur d\u00e9frichement. Le sous-ministre savait \u00e9galement les objections que Marcoux faisait contre l'annulation. Depuis sept ans ces objections avaient eu \u00e0 \u00eatre examin\u00e9es et consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par le d\u00e9partement.\nJe ne crois donc pas que les cours peuvent intervenir pour casser la d\u00e9cision faite par le d\u00e9partement. Ce serait substituer notre discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 celle que le tribunal constitu\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature pouvait seul exercer.\nPour toutes ces raisons l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.[12]\nSolicitors for the appellant: Atwater & Bond.\nSolicitors for the respondent L'Heureux: Portier & Major.\nSolicitor for the intervenant: Charles Lanct\u00f4t.\n[1] [1890] 19 Can.

Bulmer v. Dufresne (Cassels Digest 2nd ed. 873) followed.\nAs good faith is required for the ten years prescription under the Civil Code, that prescription cannot be invoked against a substitution duly registered, such registration being sufficient to constitute any third party, who might subsequently purchase from the institute, a holder in bad faith. Meloche v. Simpson (29 Can. S.C.R. 375) followed.\nThe substitution created by the donation in this case provides for a substitution of two degrees of consanguinity.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 31 K.B. 287) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in Review, which had reversed the judgment of the trial court, and dismissing the appellant's intervention.\nOn the 25th of October, 1819, Jacques Rochon and his wife made a donation inter vivos to their son, Pierre Rochon, of two land properties. The deed contained the following substitution:\nA condition en outre que les dites terres et d\u00e9pendances d'icelle ainsi que le bois susdit seront et demeureront substitu\u00e9s, comme les dits donateurs les substituent par les presentes: 1. Au profit des enfants et descendants du dit donataire, soit d'un premier mariage, soit d'un second, ou d'autres mariages subs\u00e9quents, et ce, par \u00e9gale portion sans pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence des enfants du premier mariage \u00e0 ceux d'autres mariages subs\u00e9quents, et au profit de leurs descendants dans tous les degr\u00e9s. Et si le dit donataire vient \u00e0 mourir sans enfants, ou si ses enfants, qui auraient recueilli la dite substitution au premier degr\u00e9, venaient \u00e0 mourir sans enfants et qu'il n'y e\u00fbt aucun autre descendant du dit donataire, la dite substitution aura lieu au profit de Marie-Louise Rochon, fille des dits donateurs, soeur du dit donataire, etc., ou si elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, au profit de ses enfants ou descendants dans tous les degr\u00e9s, et si le dit donataire et sa dite soeur venaient \u00e0 mourir sans aucun enfant ni descendant, la dite substitution aurait lieu au profit des parents les plus proches des dits donateurs, et habiles \u00e0 leur succeder suivant la loi.\nJacques Rochon died on the 5th of December, 1819, and his wife, on the 1st of November, 1846. The deed of donation was never \"insinu\u00e9\" nor \"publi\u00e9;\" but it had been registered on the 6th of July, 1880. The donatee, Pierre Rochon, died on the 20th of September, 1891, leaving six children. One of his daughters, Flavie Rochon, sold her rights to a brother, Denis Rochon; the latter, with his other brothers and sisters, sold the property to F\u00e9lix Rochon, who then transferred his rights to the appellant; and the appellant sold the property to the defendant. The respondents are the children and grand-children of Dame Flavie Rochon; they claim that the substitution was providing for a substitution of two degrees; that their mother was only \"grev\u00e9e\" and not \"appel\u00e9e\" and that she had not the right to sell her part of the estate; and the respondents, claiming the rights of \"appel\u00e9s\" to the substitution, brought the present action in order to interrupt the prescription of thirty years against their rights. The appellant intervened in the action and contested the action in the place of the defendant, towards whom the appellant was guarantor. The trial court held in favour of the appellant that the substitution was one of one degree; but the Court of Review reversed this judgment, holding that it was one of two degrees. In the Court of King's Bench, the appellant raised a new question: that the substitution was void, because it has not been \"publi\u00e9e et insinu\u00e9e\" within six months from the date of the death of the donators, as required by the Ordonnance de Moulins. And before the Supreme Court of Canada, the appellant, by consent, raised another plea, claiming the benefit of the prescription of ten years provided by the Civil Code.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and W. A. Handfield K.C. for the appellant.\nChs. Champoux for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons assigned in the court below.\nAnd the doctrine laid down in the case of Meloche v. Simpson[2], answers the plea of prescription suggested by the late Mr. Justice Pelletier and allowed here by consent. Duff J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed. The determination of the point in dispute is governed by two decisions of this court, Meloche v. Simpson[3], and Bulmer v. Dufresne[4] the effect of which appears from the judgment of Taschereau J. (who dissented).\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons assigned in the Court of Review and the Court of King's Bench I have no doubt that the donation in question in this action provided for a substitution of two degrees.\nThe Court of King's Bench having allowed the appellant to raise the contention that this substitution became null because it was not recorded (insinu\u00e9e) as prescribed by the Ordonnance de Moulins (Art. 57) within six months from the date of the deed which created it, although no such plea is included in his defence, he cannot be denied that right here. We are therefore again confronted with the question raised, but not decided, in Leroux v. Mcintosh[5], whether, although not recorded as required by that ordonnance, a substitution subsequently registered under article 941 C.C. is or is not good as against a person whose interest was acquired after it had been so registered.\nIt appears to have been authoritatively determined in Bulmer v. Dufresne4, by the Court of Queen's Bench and by this court, to quote 'the head-note of that report,\nthat even before the registry laws in Lower Canada, the want of publication et insinuation of a will creating a substitution within six months after the death of the testator did not invalidate the substitution. The note of this decision in our digests (Cassels, 2 ed., p. 873; Coutlee, p. 1380) would appear to be incomplete. Although diligent search has been made by the court reporters for the original opinions delivered in this court they have not been found. The only report of them available is that of the dissenting opinion delivered by Taschereau J. (1), which he concludes by saying: \"I am, however, alone on this point,\" i.e., in holding that the nullity arising from default of publication and recording within the prescribed six months was absolute. The reputation of the Dorion series is so well established that the authenticity of the head-note above quoted should, I think, be accepted. We may add to this that in Roy v. Pineau[6], Chief Justice Dorion says at p. 155:\u2014\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la Cour Supr\u00eame a aussi tenu dans la cause de Bulmer v. Dufresne[7] qu'une substitution, quoiqu'enregistr\u00e9e apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9lais de l'ordonnance, \u00e9tait valable. Ceux des juges qui composaient cette majorit\u00e9 n'ont pas encore publi\u00e9 leur d\u00e9cision, mais ils n'ont pu confirmer le jugement de cette cour, qu'en maintenant que la substitution, quoique non enr\u00e9gistr\u00e9e dans les six mois du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'auteur de la substitution, n'\u00e9tait pas nulle \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ceux qui n'avaient contract\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l'enr\u00e9gistrement du testament, puisqu'ils ont jug\u00e9 que les appelants Bulmer et autres n'avaient pas pu acheter du grev\u00e9 ce que, \u00e0 raison de l'enr\u00e9gistrement de la substitution, ils savaient ou devaient savoir que le grev\u00e9 n'avait pas le droit de vendre.\nOn the authority therefore of the decision of this court in Bulmer v. Dufresne6 the title created by the substitution in question here must prevail over rights which depend upon instruments executed after its registration in July, 1880.\nThe judgment of Chief Justice Dorion in Bulmer v. Dufresne6, confirmed by the majority of this court, was based on Art. 941 C.C. In that case the will of the testatrix, who died in 1834, was published and recorded in the Court of Queen's Bench nine months after her death. Art. 941 C.C., which is not indicated as new law (Cod. Rep. vol. 5, pp. 192-3) and was intended as an embodiment of the effect of the statute, 18 Vic., c. 101, was treated as an application of the law in regard to judicial publication and recording existing prior to that statute to the registration system which it substituted for such publication and recording. Indeed the perusal of the statute (18 Vic., c 101) makes it reasonably clear that its purpose in substituting registration for the former judicial publication was that it should be subject to similar limitations and should entail consequences identical with those attached to the superseded procedure. The concluding words of sec. 2 are as follows:\u2014\nThe delays for registration shall be the same as those established by law for the transcription and the publication in court, and no legal provision having reference to substitutions not specially repealed, shall be affected by this Act, the sole object of which is to substitute the formality of registration in the Registry Offices for transcription and publication in the courts of Acts containing substitutions.\nAlthough it has been determined by authority by which we are bound, Symes v. Cuvillier[8], that the Ordonnance des Donations of 1731 (Art. 58 of the Ordonnance de Moulins deals with donations) as a new law was not in force in Canada because never registered by the Superior Council (p. 157)\u2014(it follows that the Ordonnance des Substitutions of 1747 was in like plight and it is that ordonnance and Pothier's Commentaries upon it that the Codifiers assign as the sources of Art. 941 C.C.\u2014Commissioners' Report, Vol. 5, p. 386,) two Royal Declarations, one of the 17th of November, 1690, and the other of 18th January, 1720 (likewise not registered in Canada) would seem to have been treated in France as merely declaratory of the interpretation which had been put upon Art. 57 of the Ordonnance de Moulins and as such, though unregistered, may be regarded as declaratory of the effect given to that article of the Ordonnance in Canada. The nullity of substitutions not published and recorded within the six months prescribed by the Ordonnance de Moulins had before 1747 been held in France in a long series of arr\u00eats to be not absolute but relative merely, i.e., to obtain, where publication and recording had taken place after the expiry of the prescribed six months, only in favour of persons who had acquired interests prior thereto. Chief Justice Dorion in Roy. v. Pineau[9], discusses this question at length and we have the authority of that great jurist for the statement that it was the law of Canada long prior to the statute of 18 Victoria that a substitution published and recorded after the period prescribed by the Ordonnance de Moulins was effective from the date of such publication and recording as against persons acquiring title subsequently thereto. In the comparatively recent judgment of Martineau J. in Taillefer v. Langevin[10], Bulmer v. Dufresne[11], is cited as well established authority.\nTwo titles are preferred in support of the claim of the intervenant\u2014one a deed from Flavien Rochon of 1865, and the other a deed from Felix Rochon of 1889. The latter cannot prevail against the substitution registered in 1880. The former, as pointed out in the judgments delivered in the Court of King's Bench, purports merely to transfer \"tous les droits et pr\u00e9tentions\" of the grantor under the donation containing the substitution. Those rights were ex facie subject to the rights of the substitutes. Registration of the substitution in 1880 being inconsistent with the intervenant having been a purchaser in good faith in 1889, when he took the conveyance from Felix Rochon, (Meloche v. Simpson[12],) the claim of prescriptive title under Art. 2206 C.C., which he was allowed to prefer by consent, cannot prevail.\nMignault J.\u2014Les intim\u00e9s, appel\u00e9s en vertu d'une substitution non encore ouverte cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1819, ont poursuivi la Compagnie Canadian Northern Montreal Land Company Limited, pour faire interrompre la prescription contre leurs droits \u00e9ventuels, et l'appelant, qui avait vendu les immeubles substitu\u00e9s au nomm\u00e9 Darling, lequel les avait revendus \u00e0 cette compagnie, est intervenu dans l'instance pour d\u00e9fendre, en sa qualit\u00e9 de garant, les droits qu'il avait conc\u00e9d\u00e9s. Il a perdu sa cause dans la cour de r\u00e9vision et la cour d'appel et il en appelle \u00e0 cette cour. Sur le m\u00e9rite de ses pr\u00e9tentions je puis dire que les raisons donn\u00e9es par les honorables juges de la cour d'appel sont si satisfaisantes que je puis me dispenser de motiver longuement mon opinion que l'appel est mal fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nDeux questions surtout ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es devant cette cour:\n1. La substitution que l'appelant attaque n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 insinu\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits par l'ordonnance de Moulins, mais ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e, au bureau d'enregistrement d'Hochelaga et Jacques Cartier, le 6 juillet 1880, ainsi que l'appelant l'admet dans sod intervention, cette substitution est-elle valide? 2. L'appelant ayant amend\u00e9 son intervention devant cette cour, du consentement des intim\u00e9s, aux fins de r\u00e9clamer la prescription de dix ans avec titre et bonne foi, ce nouveau moyen est-il bien fond\u00e9?\nPremi\u00e8re question. Les intim\u00e9s se basent sur l'article 941 C.C. et la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans la cause de Bulmer v. Dufresne[13], pour soutenir que la substitution enregistr\u00e9e en 1880, avant que l'appelant e\u00fbt acquis les droits qu'il invoque par son intervention (d'apr\u00e8s certaines indications au dossier, le titre de l'appelant remonterait \u00e0 1889; ce titre n'est pas produit), lui est opposable nonobstant le d\u00e9faut d'insinuation dans les six mois.\nEn effet, l'article 941 C.C. dit que l'enregistrement des actes portant substitution remplace leur insinuation au greffe des tribunaux et leur publication en justice, formalit\u00e9s qui sont abolies. Et apr\u00e8s avoir fix\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai de six mois pour l'enregistrement, lequel, quand il se fait clans ce d\u00e9lai, op\u00e8re avec r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 au temps de la donation ou \u00e0 celui du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, cet article ajoute que si l'enregistrement a lieu post\u00e9rieurement, il n'a d'effet qu'\u00e0 compter de sa date.\nDans la cause de Bulmer v. Dufresne13, il s'agissait d'une substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par testament. La testatrice est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 30 juillet, 1834, et l'insinuation eut lieu le 15 avril 1835, plus de six mois apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. On ne manqua pas d'invoquer contre cette substitution le d\u00e9lai fatal de l'ordonnance de Moulins, mais la cour d'appel (1) jugea, en 1878, que m\u00eame avant l'ordonnance d'enregistrement (1841) et l'abolition de l'insinuation (1855), le d\u00e9faut de publication et d'insinuation dans les six mois ne rendait pas la substitution non avenue. Ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par cette cour, feu l'honorable juge H. E. Taschereau diff\u00e9rant. La d\u00e9cision de cette cour n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9e dans les rapports de la cour supr\u00eame. Il n'y en a qu'une note dans le digeste de feu M. Cassels, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 873, et cette note ne mentionne pas le point qui nous occupe. Cependant on trouve, \u00e0 la suite du rapport de la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel, l'opinion que feu l'honorable juge H. E. Taschereau avait exprim\u00e9e en cette cour, et, en concluant \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 de la substitution pour le d\u00e9faut d'insinuation dans les six mois, le savant juge ajoutait qu'il \u00e9tait seul de cet avis. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de retrouver dans les archives de cette cour l'opinion des autres juges, mais il est hors de doute que le jugement de la cour d'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par cette cour, et l'opinion de l'honorable juge Taschereau d\u00e9montre qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 sur le point pr\u00e9cis qui nous concerne. Je crois donc que nous pouvons regarder la cause de Bulmer v. Dufresne[14] comme une autorit\u00e9 en faveur des intim\u00e9s.\nEt quand m\u00eame nous n'aurions pas cet arr\u00eat, l'article 941 C.C. fournirait un argument aux intim\u00e9s. En France on avait mitig\u00e9 la rigueur des dispositions de l'ordonnance de Moulins par les d\u00e9clarations royales de 1690 et de 1712 et par l'ordonnance des substitutions de 1747, le syst\u00e8me de cette derni\u00e8re ordonnance (titre 2, art. 28 et 29) \u00e9tant identique \u00e0 celui de l'article 941 C.C. Il est vrai que les d\u00e9clarations de 1690 et 1712, ainsi que l'ordonnance de 1747, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es au greffe du conseil sup\u00e9rieur de Qu\u00e9bec, mais on ne peut se cacher que les codificateurs s'en sont inspir\u00e9s en r\u00e9digeant l'article 941 C.C. En cela ils ne croyaient pas innover, puisqu'ils n'indiquent pas cet article comme \u00e9tant de droit nouveau. Et \u00e0 maints endroits de ce titre des donations entre vifs et testamentaires ils se basent sur l'ordonnance des donations et sur l'ordonnance des substitutions qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es. Si on ne peut aller jusqu'\u00e0 croire que les codificateurs partagaient l'opinion alors assez courante que l'enregistrement des ordonnances royales par le conseil sup\u00e9rieur de Qu\u00e9bec n'\u00e9tait pas une condition essentielle de leur entr\u00e9e en vigueur en la Nouvelle France\u2014et autrefois bien d'esprits et des meilleurs \u00e9taient de cet avis\u2014du moins on peut dire qu'ils regardaient les ordonnances des donations et des substitutions comme \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s souvent d\u00e9claratoires du droit et de la jurisprudence existants. Je dois ajouter que cette question de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement des ordonnances royales a \u00e9t\u00e9, je ne dis pas discut\u00e9e, mais tranch\u00e9e dans l'affirmative par le conseil priv\u00e9, en 1880, dans la cause de Symes v. Cuvillier[15], o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment question de l'ordonnance des donations, et se trouve maintenant d\u00e9finitivement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Cependant, quant au point qui nous occupe, l'opinion assez g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 celle que la cour d'appel a exprim\u00e9 dans la cause de Bulmer v. Dufresne[16].\nCette d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la cour supr\u00eame, je suis d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas lieu de renouveler le d\u00e9bat et je me base sur cet arr\u00eat pour d\u00e9cider que la substitution en question en cette cause est opposable \u00e0 l'appelant.\nDeuxi\u00e8me question. L'appelant r\u00e9clame la prescription de dix ans, pr\u00e9tendant avoir un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la bonne foi. Il a promis de produire ce titre, mais ne l'a pas fait. En supposant cependant que ce titre serait translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, il est \u00e9vident que l'appelant ne peut pas invoquer la bonne foi si lors de son acquisition il connaissait ou \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 conna\u00eetre la substitution. Or cette substitution ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e en 1880 avant son acquisition, cet enregistrement, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette cour dans la cause de Meloche v. Simpson[17], emp\u00eache tout acqu\u00e9reur subs\u00e9quent d'invoquer la prescription de dix ans, car il lui manque la condition essentielle pour cette prescription de la bonne foi.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que cette doctrine rend \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s impossible la prescription de dix ans, car si le droit invoqu\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 il n'est pas opposable aux acqu\u00e9reurs qui ont priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement, et s'il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 avant leur acquisition, ils ne peuvent pr\u00e9tendre avoir acquis de bonne foi. J'ai fait remarquer, dans la cause de Samson v. D\u00e9carie[18] que nous d\u00e9cidons en m\u00eame temps que cette cause, que les lois de l'enregistrement ont profond\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9 les principes du droit civil, et la pr\u00e9sente cause nous en fournit un nouvel exemple. D'ailleurs la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Meloche v. Simpson17 nous lie, et la question se trouve ainsi r\u00e9solue d\u00e9finitivement.\nPour ces raisons je suis d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nBernier J.\u2014Il s'agit de l'appel d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi confirmant le jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision; ce dernier jugement avait infirm\u00e9 celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait maintenu l'intervention et renvoy\u00e9 l'action. La d\u00e9claration du roi du 18 janvier 1712, contient les dispositions suivantes:\n(2) Que les dites publications et enregistrement soient faits dans les six mois \u00e0 compter du jour des actes si les substitutions sont faites par des dispositions entre vifs; et du jour du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, si elles sont faites par des dispositions \u00e0 cause de mort.\nQue les substitutions qui n'auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es ni enregistr\u00e9es dans le dit terme de six mois, ne pourront \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es aux cr\u00e9anciers, ni aux tiers-acqu\u00e9reurs; et que celles qui n'auront \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es et enregistr\u00e9es apr\u00e8s les six mois, ne pourront leur \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es que du jour des dites publication et enregistrement.\nLa loi 18 Victoria, chapitre 101, n'a rien chang\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il y est dit:\nLes d\u00e9lais de l'enregistrement de ces actes resteront les m\u00eames que ceux \u00e9tablis par la loi de la transcription et publication devant les Cours, et nulle disposition l\u00e9gale relative aux substitutions non sp\u00e9cialement abrog\u00e9e ne sera affect\u00e9e par cet acte, dont le seul objet est de substituer la formalit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement dans les bureaux d'hypoth\u00e8ques \u00e0 la transcription et publication devant les cours des actes portant substitution.\nCette loi fut refondue et inscrite, en termes \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identiques, dans les Statuts Refondus du Bas Canada de 1861. Notre Code Civil, aux arts. 939, 941, et 2108, pose les r\u00e8gles qui les \u00e9tablissent.\nCes articles ne sont pas entre crochets dans le code et par cons\u00e9quent ils ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant du droit nouveau. On doit donc en conclure qu'avant le code, la loi ne frappait pas de nullit\u00e9 les substitutions qui n'\u00e9taient pas insinu\u00e9es ou enregistr\u00e9es, mais qu'elle permettait leur insinuation ou leur enregistrement, sauf cependant le droit des tiers qui pourraient avoir enregistr\u00e9 des droits dans l'intervalle.\nLe savant procureur de l'appelant objecte que les d\u00e9clarations de 1690 et de 1712, de m\u00eame que l'ordonnance des substitutions de 1747, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es au Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de Qu\u00e9bec; que, vu ce d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement, ces d\u00e9clarations et ordonnances n'ont pas la force de loi dans notre province; partant, c'est l'ordonnance de Moulins qu'il faut suivre jusqu'en 1855; et il ajoute que les Lords du Conseil Priv\u00e9 ont exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement des ordonnances fran\u00e7aises avait emp\u00each\u00e9 leur mise en force dans le Bas Canada (Symes v. Cuvillier[19]).\nSans vouloir entrer dans la discussion sur la question d'enregistrement des ordonnances fran\u00e7aises subs\u00e9quentes \u00e0 l'\u00e9dit de cr\u00e9ation du Conseil Souverain, je dois dire cependant que les d\u00e9clarations du roi de France sus-cit\u00e9es ont toujours, dans mon opinion, \u00e9t\u00e9 la loi qui a gouvern\u00e9 la mati\u00e8re; nos codificateurs l'ont ainsi compris.\nL'ordonnance de Moulins (1566) devait s'appliquer aux termes de l'art. 58, non seulement au royaume de France, mais aussi dans les colonies fran\u00e7aises. Les d\u00e9clarations subs\u00e9quentes du roi, modifiant cette ordonnance, s'appliquaient dans la m\u00eame \u00e9tendue.\nExprimant mon opinion personnelle du reste, je dois dire que je ne crois pas que ces ordonnances, d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, devaient \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9es au Conseil Souverain pour avoir force et effet dans notre pays.\nSi la substitution dont il est question en cette cause n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 insinu\u00e9e, elle a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e le 6 juillet 1880, et cet enregistrement doit produire son effet \u00e0 compter de sa date. Or quels sont les tiers dont les droits auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s avant cette date?\nL'intervenant a vendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des terrains substitu\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1912; son acte de vente est produit; cependant, l'intervenant n'a pas produit son acte d'achat. Aucun des actes ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 cette mutation de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit. Il est vrai qu'il a produit des actes de d\u00e9claration et de ratification pass\u00e9s devant notaires, entre lui et Dame Flavie Rochon le 22 juin 1911; ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e9num\u00e8rent certains contrats pass\u00e9s entre les appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution en 1865, en 1880, en 1889, en 1868, en 1881 et en 1889. On ignore le contenu de ces actes; dans la liste qui en est donn\u00e9e, on voit seulement que les appel\u00e9s c\u00e8dent tout simplement les droits et pr\u00e9tentions qu'ils pouvaient avoir dans les immeubles substitu\u00e9s; or, la transmission de ces droits, ne pouvait comporter l'ali\u00e9nation du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux immeubles, puisque la substitution n'\u00e9tait pas encore ouverte, et que les appel\u00e9s \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s eux-m\u00eames de rendre ces biens.\nDu reste ces d\u00e9clarations faites devant notaires n'ont aucune force probante.\n3. La prescription d\u00e9cennale avec titre et bonne foi, invoqu\u00e9e par l'appelant en cette cause, ne saurait \u00eatre \u00e9galement maintenue. L'acte entre vifs contenant la substitution a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 en 1880, et partant l'appelant ne peut invoquer sa bonne foi. Quant \u00e0 son titre, il ne lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9, comme je viens de le dire, que les droits et les pr\u00e9tentions que ses vendeurs ont pu lui accorder, et les titres qu'il pourrait invoquer ne sont m\u00eame pas produits au dossier.\nJe suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel et de maintenir le jugement avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Handfield & Handfield.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Charles Champoux.\n[1] Q.

Such highway, when constructed, would have connected with other roads already existing in the adjacent municipalities.\nHeld, Duff and Bernier JJ. dissenting, that such proc\u00e8s-verbal was ultra vires of the appellant corporation.\nHeld, also, Duff and Bernier JJ. dissenting, that the words \"road to be made\" in article 451 of the new municipal code should receive the same interpretation as that given by a well-established jurisprudence to the same words contained in article 762 of the precedent municipal code; and that these words mean a road already established by the local authority, although not yet constructed, and do not include \"a road which previously did not exist in any way.\" Bothwell v. Corporation of West Wickham (6 Q.L.R. 45) followed. Judgment of the court of King's Bench (Q.R. 31 K.B. 475) affirmed, Duff and Bernier JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's 'Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reserving the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.*\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL. St.-Laurent K.C. and A. Perrault K.C. for the appellant.\u2014According to articles 758, 759 and 762 of the precedent municipal code, the county council had power to declare the road a county road, even if it was situated within the limits of a local municipality and even if the local municipality has not already dealt with it. The substantial changes made by the new code make now that power clear; articles 447, 448, 451 M.C.\nGirouard for the respondent.\u2014The County Corporation had not the power to declare a new road to be opened within the limits of a local municipality to be a county road. Corporation du Comt\u00e9 de Nicolet v. Corporation du village de Villers[2]; The words \"road to be made\" in article 451 P.M.C. have been defined as a road which although not made has already been legally established. Bothwell v. Corporation of West Wickham[3].; Brunet v. Corporation de Comt\u00e9 de Beauharnois.[4]\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the mises en cause.\nL. St.-Laurent K.C. and A. Perrault K.C. for the appellant\nGirouard for the respondent Idington J.\u2014Any jurisdiction we have to interfere herein must rest upon that part of subsection (b) of section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" falling within the words herein as follows:\u2014\nor to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\nWhen the notice to quash made herein was dismissed the fact that there had been expropriations made in virtue of the proceedings appellant had taken was pointed to as within said subsection.\nUpon due consideration of all that has developed in argument herein I fail to find anything of that kind, or approximately so, as part of the subject matter of the appeal.\nThe mere surmise that ultimately some such questions may possibly arise, turning upon the question of whether or not that which has been done by the appellant is or is not ultra vires, cannot give us jurisdiction to overrule the decisions of the courts below acting within the jurisdiction given by the legislature in way of a supervising power over municipal assertions of authority such as appellant pretended to exercise and is in question herein by virtue of the powers given it in the Municipal Code.\nI am therefore by reason of such question of possible want of jurisdiction all the more inclined to abide by the reasoning of the majority of the Court of King's Bench which presents cogent reasons against such an extreme and unusual exercise of authority as appellant has pretended to exercise and seeks herein to have maintained.\nThe primary idea of a county road is one running through more than one local municipality. If the appellant had seen fit to construct the road in question, at its own expense, and then desired to abandon such a road once constructed to the local municipality and thus cast the burden of its maintenance upon the local municipality, I could conceive of its action being somewhat more in accord with the spirit, as well as the literal language of the rather confusing legislation bearing upon the question than it seems to be.\nI am loathe to accept the conclusion that the legislature, in light of the jurisprudence that preceded its latest enactment, really designed to give the appellant such a curious power as is pretended to have been given it.\nIf it had intended thereby to assign the counties the power of directing a local municipality to open and construct in a single municipality a road confined within same and to maintain same, it should have done so by a clear expression of such purpose and swept away all other old conflicting and embarrassing provisions inconsistent therewith.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting)\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice of Quebec in his opinion as to the effect of Art. 447 of the Municipal Code. I only add that the reasons given by the Chief Justice establish in a manner entirely satisfactory to my mind that the construction adopted by him is the only construction which avoids the alternative of doing violence to the object of the legislature as disclosed by an examination of the provisions as a whole That being so I find no difficulty in reading the words \"under the control of a local corporation\" as equivalent to belonging to a class of roads under the control of a local corporation. In this view all the difficulty arising from the verbal structure of the clause in question disappears. The only remaining point is the question whether the course of decision in Quebec has been such as to establish the law in the sense contended for by the respondent.\nI shall first consider the effect of the decisions relied upon. They begin with the decision of the Court of Review in Bothwell v. West Wickham[5]. The Court of Review in that case considered the meaning of section 758 of the old code which, with certain modifications, is now section 447 of the existing Municipal Code. The decision was given in 1880. The question arose on an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court of Arthabaska which had ordered a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue condemning the township of West Wickham to open and complete a certain road within a specified time under a penalty of $1,000 for default. The road in question was one situated entirely within the local limits of the township and by force of Art. 755 of the existing code it fell within the category \"local road\". The county council in January 1877 declared the road to be a county road and ordered that it should be commenced and finished on two severally named dates. In the following September and prior to the date of commencement provided for by the order of the previous January the county council professed to declare the road to be a local work. The Court of Review reversed the order of the primary court on various grounds, among others that the order of the county council was inoperative for want of the notice and publication required by law; that in any case the Superior Court had exceeded its powers in the imposition of the penalty; that the proc\u00e8s verbal was too vague to enforce by mandamus and finally that the county council had no authority under the powers conferred by Arts. 758 and 759 effectively to declare a non-existent local road a county road for the purpose of getting jurisdiction under these articles.\nIt will be observed that the real question for consideration before the Court of Review as regards the construction of Art. 758 and strictly the only question arising under that article was the question whether or not the county council had authority by force of it to order the township municipality to open and construct a local road which had not previously been established. As regards that question the language of the article was explicit; no authority was given by the article to require the local municipality to incur the expense of opening or constructing any road. Assuming the county council had power to declare a non-existent road a county road and thereby to acquire jurisdiction to establish it as a lawful highway, it is quite plain that the article gave no authority to the county council to place upon the local municipality the burden of opening and constructing the road. It is true that Art. 762 must apply to roads to be made as well as to roads already made. I entertain no doubt myself as to the effect of this provision in its relation to the power under 758 to declare a local road a county road. The authority, I think, was plainly given. It is equally clear, I think, that as regards such road the power of the county council did not include the authority to direct that the local municipality should assume the whole or any part of the cost of constructing or opening it but that the authority to impose a financial burden upon the local municipality in respect of such roads extended only to the cost of maintenance and reparation. The judgment of the court no doubt does rest in part upon its view of the proper construction of articles 758 and 762, but the practical point decided was the one just mentioned, the point that, assuming authority to open the road vested in the county council, the cost of construction must be borne by the council and not by the local municipality.\nIn order of date, the next case relied upon is Gigu\u00e8re v. Beauce[6]. The judgment of Mr. Justice Carroll which is the only judgment appearing in the reports points out that the decision of the Court of Review in Bothwell's case[7] had no relevancy to the question then before the Court of King's Bench. As to the judgment delivered in Nicolet v. de Villers[8], I am unable to discover there either any opinion or judgment which has any relevancy.\nThe civil law recognizes the effect of a series of decisions although the doctrine of precedent as known to the common law has strictly no place in it. Examining the decisions bearing upon the point before us, I am not able to discover anything like such a continuity of adjudication upon the precise point we have to pass upon, as would be necessary to establish a law independently of the meaning of the words of the statute themselves. There is no doubt the circumstance which must be taken into consideration that the statute was enacted without very serious change in its language after the first of these decisions was delivered; but the rule of statutory construction applied by the English courts that where a superior court has given a meaning to a set of words used by the legislature and the legislature has reproduced these words, prima facie it is taken to have adopted the meaning thus given to them is a rule which at all events in the imperative form in which it is applied in common law jurisdictions cannot be said to be binding upon courts administering the law of Quebec. One very obvious reason for this is that a decision by a superior court under the Quebec system is not an \"authority\" in the sense in which common lawyers use the term; it is important and weighty evidence as to what the law is, but no more. The tribunal which pronounced the decision may with perfect propriety decline to follow it. The presumption therefore that the legislature in re-enacting a statutory provision which has already been construed intends thereby to stereotype the meaning which has been ascribed by a single decision to the enactment, if there be such a presumption at all, must be one of exceedingly little force. There is another reason and it is this. In this country (I have fully developed this point in a judgment delivered in Schmid v Miller[9] which was afterwards approved by the Privy Council) it has long been recognized that such a presumption does violence to the fact and consequently as early as 1891 an enactment was passed by the Dominion Parliament applying to all Dominion statutes and this enactment has since been reproduced in most of the provinces in which such a rule could have been supposed to have sway negativing the existence of the rule and directing tribunals called upon to construe statutes to construe them according to their real meaning and without regard to any such supposed presumption. This legislation, as I say, was passed as is well known in recognition of the fact that the presumption which, no doubt, in England has a sound foundation in the practice of Parliament with regard to the drafting and preparation of statutes, was in this country a mere artificial rule resulting frequently, where it was applied, in the frustration of the legislative intention.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014This is an action brought under the supervisory power conferred on the Superior Court by Art. 50 C.P.C., to quash and set aside a proc\u00e8sverbal and its homologation by the council of the appellant corporation and subsequent proceedings for the opening and construction as a county road of a contemplated highway situated wholly within the limits of the local municipality of St. Norbert. The facts out of which the litigation arises are detailed in the judgments delivered in the Superior Court and the Court of King's Bench[10] and in the opinions prepared by my learned brothers. A number of minor matters dealt with in the judgments below were but slightly pressed in this court and would not seem to call for further discussion.\nHaving regard to the nature of the jurisdiction invoked by the plaintiffs, the contest is virtually limited to the questions whether the impugned proc\u00e8s-verval and its homologation were ultra vires of the county council, and, if not, whether there is such gross and palpable injustice in the distribution made of the cost of the proposed works as would warrant interference on the ground of oppression.\nCounsel for the appellant in supporting the jurisdiction of the county council contended (a) that the road in question forms part of a highway which will run through two or more local municipalities and is therefore ex natura a county road; (b) that under Art. 451 of the Municipal Code of 1916 a county council is empowered to establish as a county road a highway to be wholly situate within a local municipality, although no action towards creating it or determining its situs has yet been taken by the proper authority of such local municipality.\n(a) The appellant's case on this branch is rested on an alleged declaration by it, made under the authority of the first paragraph of Art. 447 M. C., that a highway, already constructed by the local authority in the adjoining municipality of Chester North, with which the projected road in St. Norbert would connect, thus providing a through road to the provincial highway leading from Victoriaville to Arthabaska, should become a county road. Without pausing to examine in detail the proceedings of the county council relied upon as containing or implying such a declaration in regard to the road in Chester North, I shall content myself with again stating, as I did during the argument, that I fail to find in them anything of the kind. The power conferred by Art. 447 M.C. is so extraordinary that it is not too much to expect that its exercise should be explicit. Not only is there no explicit declaration by the county council that the road in Chester North \"shall in future be a county road\" but, if that would suffice, there is nothing to warrant an inference that the county council ever meant to assume responsibility for its control, maintenance and repair, which such a declaration would involve.\n(b) If the question as to the construction of Art. 451 M. C. were res integra, it may be that I would have accepted the view clearly and forcibly presented by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec in his dissenting opinion. But it was determined forty-one years ago by a strong court (Meredith C. J. Stuart J. and Caron J.) in Bothwell v. West Wickham[11] in a carefully considered judgment that the words \"road to be made\" (chemin \u00e0 faire) in Art. 762 of the former municipal code meant a road already established by the local authority, although not yet constructed, and that they did not include \"a road which previously did not exist in any way\". That judgment was approved in Gigu\u00e8re v. Corporation du Comt\u00e9 de Beauce[12] and was followed in Brunet v. Beauharnois[13]. The legislature in re-enacting the former Art. 762 M.C. in 1916 as Art. 451 of the new municipal code practically in ipsissimis verbis (the only change is the addition of the words \"bridge or water course\" twice after the word \"road\") may be taken to have intended that it should receive the well established construction thus put upon it. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee said in a Quebec case, Casgrain v. Atlantic and North West Ry. Co.[14]:\nTheir Lordships cannot assume that the Dominion legislature, when they adopted the clause verbatim in the year 1888, were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must on the contrary be assumed that they understood that s. 12 of the Canadian Act must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation. In these circumstances their Lordships, even if they had entertained doubts as to the meaning of s. 12 of the Act of 1888 would have declined to disturb the construction of its language which had been judicially affirmed.\nThe section there in question dealt with the power of a municipality to sanction the closing of a public street. It had been construed in two decisions rendered in Upper Canada in 1857. The principle underlying this judgment is recognized in the French authorities. Thus we find Baudry-Lacantinirie in the first volume of his Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, Par. No. 261, saying\nlorsque le l\u00e9gislateur reproduit une r\u00e8gie d\u00e9j\u00e0 formul\u00e9e par la loi, il est probable qu'il lui conserve le sens qu'elle avait.\nSee too Fuzier Herman, Rep. vbo. Lois et D\u00e9crets, No. 375. I refrain from citing other well known English authorities to the same effect. They may be found conveniently collected in Maxwell on Statutes, 6 ed. at p. 542, and 27 Hals. L. of E. par. 263. I had occasion to apply this principle of construction the recent case of Arnold v. Dominion Trust Co,[15]\nThere is no provision in the Quebec statutes such as has been introduced in other legislative jurisdictions (v.g. R.S.C. c. 1, sec. 21 (4); R.S.O. c. 1, s. 20), to exclude this well-known rule of statutory construction, based on the presumption that Parliament knows the law, that its re-enactment, especially in a consolidating Act, implies the adoption by the legislature of judicial construction placed upon the language of a statute.\nSince the new municipal code was enacted the Court of King's Bench (Archambault C. J., Lavergne, Cross, Carroll & Pelletier JJ.) in Corporation du comt\u00e9 de Nicolet v. Corporation du village de Villers[16] has put the same construction on Art. 451 of the new code as was formerly given to Art. 762 of the old code.\nMuch reliance was placed by counsel for the appellant on the introduction of the words \"construction and opening\" into par. 3 of Art. 447 of the new code, which replaced former Art. 758, as warranting, if not requiring, the wider construction put upon the new Art. 451 by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec in the present case. But an examination of Art. 447 itself seems to answer that argument. In the first place the word \"opening\" follows the word \"construction\" indicating that the physical opening or the declaring of the constructed road open for traffic is meant rather than the formal determination to create a road, which of course precedes its construction. Moreover, in the phrase in paragraph 3, \"for the construction, opening, maintenance and repair of such road\", the words \"such road\" clearly refer to the road mentioned in paragraph 1, and that should (but for its extension by Art. 451) be understood to mean a road having actual physical existence as distinguished from the \"road to be made\" dealt with by art. 451. Otherwise Art. 451 would have no office\u2014a consequence always avoided, if possible, in construing a statute. The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford[17].\nThe words \"construction and opening\" were required in Art. 447 (3) to provide for the case of a road not yet made but determined on by the local authority, which the county council was held to have had authority under s. 762 of the old code to declare a county road. The county council could formerly determine how the cost of maintaining and repairing such a road should be borne. It can now make a like provision for the cost of its \"construction and opening\"\u2014which was formerly casus omissus. The purpose of this change is therefore sufficiently met and reasonable effect is given to it without imputing to the legislature the very improbable intent of thus indirectly interfering with the construction of former Art. 762 when re-enacting it without material change as Art. 451.\nMr. Justice Greenshields has in his judgment made a useful comparative analysis of the relevant provisions of the new and the old codes. On the ground therefore that the construction of the words \"road to be made\" (chemin \u00e0 faire) in Art. 451 M.C. has been long established in the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec and that the legislature far from suggesting any intention that that construction should be departed from in the future has rather indicated its purpose to adopt and confirm it I am of the opinion that the judgment of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench should be upheld.\nMignault J.\u2014La principale question que soul\u00e8ve ce proc\u00e8s est de savoir si, en vertu de l'article 447 du nouveau code municipal, la corporation de comt\u00e9 peut d\u00e9clarer chemin de comt\u00e9 et en ordonner l'ouverture, un chemin qui n'existe pas encore, mais qui, quand il sera ouvert et construit, se trouvera situ\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement dans le territoire d'une municipalit\u00e9 locale, c'est-\u00e0-dire, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 St-Norbert. Tel que projet\u00e9, le chemin en question se relierait \u00e0 d'autres chemins ouverts ou \u00e0 \u00eatre ouverts dans les municipalit\u00e9s voisines, formant ainsi une art\u00e8re d'une grande importance pour le comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska. Et c'est la corporation de ce comt\u00e9 qui a ordonn\u00e9 l'ouverture et la construction de ce chemin.\nLa cour d'appel a d\u00e9ni\u00e9 ce pouvoir \u00e0 la corporation de comt\u00e9 et celle-ci en appelle \u00e0 cette cour. La majorit\u00e9 des honorables juges de la cour d'appel (l'honorable juge en chef diff\u00e9rant) se basent sur la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui a pour point de d\u00e9part la d\u00e9cision unanime de la cour de revision \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, en 1880, dans la cause de Bothwell v. Corporation of West Wickham[18] o\u00f9 si\u00e9geaient les juges Meredith, juge en chef, Stuart et Caron. Dans cette cause, il s'agissait de l'interpr\u00e9tation des articles 758 et 762 de l'ancien code municipal, qui correspondent aux articles 447 et 451 du nouveau code, et le juge en chef Meredith, parlant pour le tribunal, a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l'expression \"chemin \u00e0 faire\" \"road to be made\" dans l'article 762 comme signifiant un chemin qui, bien qu'il n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente, et le savant juge en chef ajouta:\u2014\nWe do not think that a county council could establish a local road, which previously did not exist in any way, in order immediately afterwards to convert the local road, so established, into a county road.\nCette d\u00e9cision a fait jurisprudence. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e bien fond\u00e9e par la cour d'appel dans la cause de Gigu\u00e8re v. La corporation du comt\u00e9 de Beauce[19] et dans la cause de la Corporation du comt\u00e9 de Nicolet v. La corporation du village de Villers[20], la m\u00eame cour, sans la mentionner, a jug\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens. Enfin il y a une d\u00e9cision du juge Mercier dans la cause de Brunei v. Corporation du comt\u00e9 de Beauharnois[21], o\u00f9 l'honorable juge accepte formellement l'autorit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la cour de revision dans Bothwell v. Corporation of West Wickham[22].\nConvient-il maintenant de renverser cette jurisprudence?\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que la r\u00e9daction des nouveaux articles 447 et 451 diff\u00e8re de celle des anciens articles 758 et 762 de l'ancien code. Les nouveaux articles s'appliquent non seulement aux chemins, mais aux ponts et cours d'eau, mais ce changement est sans importance, et l'appelante ne se pr\u00e9vaut que du fait que, dans le dernier paragraphe de l'article 447 on a ajout\u00e9 les mots \"construction et ouverture\" avant les mots \"entretien et r\u00e9paration\"qui seuls se trouvaient dans l'ancien article 758. Je reproduis ce paragraphe tel qu'il se lit dans l'ancien et le nouveau code:\nAncien code, art. 758: Le conseil de comt\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un chemin local est un chemin de comt\u00e9, peut, si les circonstances l'exigent, d\u00e9terminer par proc\u00e8s-verbal quelles corporations seront responsables de l'entretien et des r\u00e9parations du chemin et de la construction et des r\u00e9parations des ponts, et d\u00e9clarer dans ce proc\u00e8s-verbal quelle sera la part contributoire de chaque corporation.\nNouveau code, art. 447: La corporation de comt\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un chemin, un pont ou un cours d'eau local est un chemin, un pont ou un cours d'eau de comt\u00e9, peut, si les circonstances l'exigent, d\u00e9terminer par r\u00e8glement ou par proc\u00e8s-verbal quelles corporations sont responsables de la construction, de l'ouverture, de l'entretien et des r\u00e9parations de tel chemin, pont ou cours d'eau, et d\u00e9clarer dans ce r\u00e8glement ou proc\u00e0s-verbal quelle est la part contributoire de chaque corporation.\nSi on lit attentivement le premier paragraphe de l'article 447, ou de l'article 758, ancien code, on voit qu'il n'est question que de chemins existants, puisqu'on parle de chemins sous la direction d'une corporation locale. Le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 447 envisage ce qui suit la d\u00e9claration faite en vertu du premier paragraphe, et \u00e0!la diff\u00e9rence de l'ancien article 758, mentionne, outre l'entretien et la r\u00e9paration du chemin, sa construction et son ouverture. A premi\u00e8re vue, cela para\u00eet d\u00e9passer la port\u00e9e du premier paragraphe, mais comme il s'agit de la responsabilit\u00e9 du co\u00fbt des travaux de chemin, il n'est pas impossible de concilier les deux paragraphes en disant que si une corporation locale s'est born\u00e9e \u00e0 ordonner l'ouverture d'un chemin chez elle, et qui partant se trouve sous sa direction, la corporation de comt\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce chemin local un chemin de comt\u00e9, peut d\u00e9terminer par r\u00e8glement ou par proc\u00e8s-verbal quelle corporation sera responsable du co\u00fbt de la construction et de l'ouverture, de m\u00eame que de l'entretien et de la r\u00e9paration, de ce chemin. Ainsi entendus, il para\u00eet facile de concilier les paragraphes un et trois de l'article 447.\nEnvisageons maintenant l'article 451 dont le texte ne diff\u00e8re gu\u00e8re de celui de l'ancien article 762, le nouvel article s'appliquant aux ponts et cours d'eau comme aux chemins. Cet article dit en substance que les attributions conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par l'article 447 \u00e0 la corporation de comt\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es-par elle relativement \u00e0 un chemin, pont ou cours d'eau \u00e0 faire, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que pour les chemins, ponts ou cours d'eau d\u00e9j\u00e0 faits.\nCes expressions \"chemin \u00e0 faire\" \"road to be made\", \"chemins d\u00e9j\u00e0 faits\" \"roads already made\", m\u00e9ritent de retenir l'attention. Un chemin \u00e0 faire n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement un chemin dont l'ouverture n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e. Un proc\u00e8s-verbal, supposons-le, d\u00e9cr\u00e8te l'ouverture d'un nouveau chemin local l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n'y en avait aucun. D\u00e9sormais on peut dire que ce chemin existe l\u00e9galement et est sous la direction de la corporation locale, mais il est encore \u00e0 faire, les op\u00e9rations qui donneront effet \u00e0 l'ordonnance d'ouverture \u00e9tant l'acquisition de l'assiette et la construction mat\u00e9rielle de ce chemin. On peut et on doit donc distinguer entre ordonner l'ouverture d'un chemin et faire le chemin dont l'ouverture a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e.\nMaintenant puisque le chemin local que la corporation de comt\u00e9 d\u00e9clare un chemin de comt\u00e9 est \"un chemin sous la direction d'une corporation locale\" (parag. 1er de l'art. 447), ce chemin peut tr\u00e8s bien \u00eatre un chemin \u00e0 faire, c'est-\u00e0-dire un chemin dont l'ouverture seulement a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e. Il y a donc harmonie parfaite entre l'article 447, paragraphe 1er, et l'article 451, et aucune r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation n'exige de donner \u00e0 ce dernier article un sens qui le mettrait en contradiction avec le premier, par exemple en entendant par \"chemin \u00e0 faire\" un chemin dont l'ouverture n'a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e, et partant un chemin qui n'est sous la direction d'aucune corporation. Au contraire, toutes les r\u00e8gles de l'interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gale commandent d'harmoniser, si cela se peut, toutes les dispositions d'une m\u00eame loi, et c'est ce qu'on doit s'efforcer de faire pour le code municipale\nJe pr\u00e9vois bien qu'on pourra dire que voulant harmoniser les articles 447 et 451, je rends ce dernier article \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s inutile, car je comprends virtuellement sa disposition dans le premier paragraphe de l'article 447 en tant qu'il parle de chemins \u00e0 faire. Je puis r\u00e9pondre que le but de l'article 451 est d'\u00e9carter un doute quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des articles 447 et 448, et qu'en acceptant cette interpr\u00e9tation extensive on ne rend pas inutile l'article 451 qui l'a consacr\u00e9e, mais on ne fait que r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur qui a formellement exig\u00e9 que l'article 447 re\u00e7oive cette intrepr\u00e9tation.\nJe ne suis donc pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 dire que la cause de Bothwell v. Corporation of West Wickham[23] a \u00e9t\u00e9 mal jug\u00e9e. Mais alors que j'aurais des doutes sur ce point, il me semble qu'il est mieux que cette cour accepte, quand elle peut le faire raisonnablement, la jurisprudence des diff\u00e9rentes provinces lorsqu'il s'agit de droit municipal Les tribunaux de chaque province, par leur situation dans les divers centres de la population, sont plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de se rendre compte de la port\u00e9e des lois adopt\u00e9es pour la gouverne des municipalit\u00e9s, surtout des municipalit\u00e9s rurales. Et, pour ma part, je crois qu'il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de respecter une jurisprudence comme celle sur laquelle la cour d'appel s'est bas\u00e9e, que de jeter la perturbation dans les affaires municipales en renversant cette jurisprudence et en donnant ainsi une nouvelle orientation au gouvernement des villages et des comt\u00e9s. Il faudrait, pour en agir autrement, un texte bien formel, et je ne trouve pas ce texte dans le nouveau code municipal.\nIl est possible que l'opposition d'une petite municipalit\u00e9 paralyse dans l'esp\u00e8ce les efforts de la corporation du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska pour assurer le bien-\u00eatre de ses contribuables et pourvoir \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de voies de communication commodes entre eux. Et il peut \u00eatre d'autant plus n\u00e9cessaire d'augmenter les pouvoirs des grandes unit\u00e9s comme les corporations de comt\u00e9 que celles-ci, depuis le nouveau code municipal n'ont plus une jurisdiction d'appel contre les d\u00e9cisions des corporations locales. S'il en est ainsi, c'est au l\u00e9gislateur d'y voir, car les tribunaux ne peuvent que se conformer \u00e0 la loi.\nJe suis donc d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens. Je ne donnerais pas de frais \u00e0 la corporation de St-Norbert, qui, bien que le chemin en question se trouve sur son territoire, n'a pas contest\u00e9 l'action de l'intim\u00e9e, mais s'est content\u00e9e de surveiller le proc\u00e8s.\nBernier J. (dissenting).\u2014Il s'agit d'une action prise par la corporation locale de Chester-Est contre le corporation du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska, pour faire d\u00e9clarer nul, ill\u00e9gal et ultra vires, un proc\u00e8s-verbal fait par le surintendant sp\u00e9cial de cette derni\u00e8re corporation, en vertu d'une r\u00e9solution du Conseil de comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska, d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant chemin de comt\u00e9 un chemin situ\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement dans la municipalit\u00e9 de St-Norbert, dans le comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 l'action; la Cour \"du Banc du Roi, si\u00e9geant en appel, a renvers\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, le juge en chef, l'Honorable M. G. Lamothe, \u00e9tant dissident. C'est de ce dernier jugement que la corporation du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska en appelle.\nIl importe de raconter les circonstances de cette cause pour expliquer Faction du conseil du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska.\nLe 13 d\u00e9cembre 1916, la requ\u00eate suivante, sign\u00e9e par des contribuables de la corporation de Ste-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Chester-Est, de Chester-Nord, et de St-Norbert (trois municipalit\u00e9s situ\u00e9es dans le comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska), fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au conseil du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska:\nREQUETE DEMANDANT LE CHEMIN\nA Monsieur le pr\u00e9fet et autres membres du Conseil de Comt\u00e9\nd'Arthabaska.\nMessieurs,\nLa requ\u00eate des soussign\u00e9s expose respectueusement ce qui suit:\n1.\u2014Qu'un chemin public court actuellement de Ste-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Chester jusqu'\u00e0 la ligne de division entre Chester-Nord et St-Norbert;\n2.\u2014Que par proc\u00e8s-verbal de Mtre B.

Tels avis furent donn\u00e9s.\nLe 13 juin 1917, le conseil de comt\u00e9 passa effectivement une r\u00e9solution \u00e0 l'effet qu'il d\u00e9clarait que le chemin projet\u00e9, ainsi que les ponts et ponceaux qui y seraient construits, \u00e0 partir de la ligne de division entre la municipalit\u00e9 de Chester-Nord et la municipalit\u00e9 de St-Norbert, en gagnant vers le Nord-Ouest jusqu'au grand chemin provincial, traversant des terrains connus et d\u00e9sign\u00e9s au cadastre officiel de la paroisse de St-Norbert sous les num\u00e9ros 250, 251, 253, 255, 256, 258, 259, 260 et 262, seraient \u00e0 l'avenir un chemin et des ponts de comt\u00e9, sous la jurisdiction de la corporation d'Arthabaska. Le 30 juin 1917 avis public fut donn\u00e9 de la passation de cette r\u00e9solution.\nLe 15 ao\u00fbt 1917, J. N. Poirier, Notaire Public, nomm\u00e9 surintendant sp\u00e9cial par le conseil de comt\u00e9 aux fins de faire rapport au sujet de la r\u00e9solution susdite, dressa un proc\u00e8s-verbal au sujet du chemin en question ; entr'autres dispositions, il contient les suivantes:\n1\u00b0. Un chemin sera ouvert, fait et entretenu, depuis un point situ\u00e9 dans la ligne de division, entre les municipalit\u00e9s de St-Norberi et de Chester-Nord \u00e0 environ 200 pieds du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est de la Rivi\u00e8re Gosselin, vis-\u00e0-vis le chemin d\u00e9j\u00e0 ouvert dans le cinqui\u00e8me rang de Chester-Nord; jusqu'au chemin provincial \u00e0 un point situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 300 pieds du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest du Pont Rouge, sur la rivi\u00e8re Gosselin, apr\u00e8s avoir travers\u00e9 les lots num\u00e9ros 1, 2, 3 et partie du lot num\u00e9ro 4, du septi\u00e8me rang du canton d'Arthabaska, dans la paroisse de St-Norbert, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 ce chemin a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9 sur les lieux, par Bennett Feeney, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, il y a environ 2 ans, et moi-m\u00eame l'automne dernier, (1916).\"\n2\u00b0. Ce chemin, depuis un point de d\u00e9part, vis-\u00e0-vis le chemin ouvert dans le cinqui\u00e8me rang de Chester-Nord, dont il doit \u00eatre la continuation jusqu'au chemin provincial, traversera en ligne droite, vers le Nord, (suit la description des lots que le chemin doit traverser).\n12\u00b0. Tous les travaux du chemin ordonn\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s-verbal seront faits et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par la corporation du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska, \u00e0 l'entreprise, par soumission et contrat adjug\u00e9 et pass\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles \u00e9dict\u00e9es au titre 20, art. 624 et suivants du Code Municipal, mais aux frais, d\u00e9pens et charges des corporations de la paroisse de St-Norbert et de Chester-Est; chacune de ces deux corporations devant contribuer au co\u00fbt d'ouverture, de confection et d'entretien du chemin, foss\u00e9s, cl\u00f4tures, barri\u00e8res, ponts, cul\u00e9es et abords, proportionnellement \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation, tel que port\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation en force dans les municipalit\u00e9s, quand les paiements en seront dus et exigibles.\nLa corporation du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska devra faire elle-m\u00eame la r\u00e9partition, perception et paiement du co\u00fbt de ces travaux.\n13\u00b0. La municipalit\u00e9 de Chester-Nord est exempte de contribuer au co\u00fbt des travaux du chemin ordonn\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s-verbal, parce qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 ouvert et est tenu de faire et entretenir, par et en vertu d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal, sur son territoire, un chemin avec lequel le chemin pr\u00e9sentement verbalis\u00e9 doit former qu'une seule et m\u00eame voie, dont partie dans Chester-Nord et partie dans St-Norbert.\nLe 23 ao\u00fbt 1917, avis public fut donn\u00e9 que ce proc\u00e8s-verbal serait pris en consid\u00e9ration et homologu\u00e9 avec ou sans amendements, ou rejet\u00e9 par le conseil du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska, le 12 septembre 1917. Le 10 septembre 1917, un certain nombre de contribuables de Chester-Est pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent au conseil de Chester-Est une requ\u00eate au sujet du proc\u00e8s-verbal susdit, pour demander \u00e0 ce conseil de faire amender le proc\u00e8s-verbal en question, de mani\u00e8re que le chemin projet\u00e9 soit un chemin de comt\u00e9 \u00e0 la charge du comt\u00e9 pour l'ouverture et entretien \u00e0 toujours, ou \u00e0 la charge des requ\u00e9rants \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du 13 d\u00e9cembre 1916, ou bien que le chemin soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 chemin local \u00e0 la charge de St-Norbert. Le conseil de Chester-Est passa une r\u00e9solution appuyant cette requ\u00eate.\nA sa s\u00e9ance du 12 septembre 1917, le conseil de comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska homologua le proc\u00e8s-verbal Poirier; les maires de Chester-Est, de Chester-Nord et de St-Norbert assistaient \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance, et ils vot\u00e8rent pour l'homologation du rapport; ils avaient du reste \u00e9galement vot\u00e9 en faveur de la r\u00e9solution du conseil de comt\u00e9 pass\u00e9e le 13 juin 1917, d\u00e9clarant le chemin un chemin de comt\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s cette homologation du proc\u00e8s-verbal, le conseil de comt\u00e9 proc\u00e9da \u00e0 faire les expropriations n\u00e9cessaires pour la construction du chemin, et elle paya \u00e0 cet effet diverses sommes se montant \u00e0 tout pr\u00e8s de $3,000.\nCe n'est que le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1919, que la corporation de Chester-Est prit une action contre la corporation du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska pour faire annuler le proc\u00e8s-verbal en question; dans les conclusions de l'action, on ne demande pas l'annulation de la r\u00e9solution du conseil de comt\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que le chemin serait un chemin de comt\u00e9; on se contente de demander l'annulation du proc\u00e8s-verbal. Les deux corporations locales de Chester-Nord et de St-Norbert ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en cause; mais la corporation de St-Norbert n'a pas comparu, et celle de Chester-Nord a comparu par son procureur, mais elle n'a pas plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 Taction.\nLes deux principaux points qu'il y a \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans cette cause, sont ceux de savoir 1\u00b0 si le proc\u00e8s-verbal Poirier et son homologation par le conseil de comt\u00e9, \u00e9taient ultra vires des pouvoirs du conseil de comt\u00e9; et 2\u00b0 si le chemin en question \u00e9tait d'utilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 plusieurs municipalit\u00e9s dans le comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 justifier le conseil de comt\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer chemin de comt\u00e9 le chemin projet\u00e9 en question.\nIl s'agit de l'interpr\u00e9tation de certains articles du nouveau Code Municipal et entr'autres des articles 444, 445, 447, 449, 451, 453 et 574.\nEn vertu de l'article 445 C. M. le chemin local est celui qui est situ\u00e9 tout entier dans une municipalit\u00e9 locale; en vertu de l'art. 446, ce chemin est sous la direction, et en vertu de l'article 453, il est sous la responsabilit\u00e9, de ce conseil.\nCependant, en vertu de l'article 447, le conseil de comt\u00e9 a le droit de s'emparer pour ainsi dire de ce chemin local; il a le droit de le d\u00e9clarer chemin de comt\u00e9; il a le droit de le placer sous sa propre direction et sa propre responsabilit\u00e9, ou sous la direction et la responsabilit\u00e9 de plusieurs autres municipalit\u00e9s locales dans le comt\u00e9.\nJusqu'ici, le code municipal a entendu parler et l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer au sujet d'un chemin local ouvert et construit, c'est-\u00e0-dire existant\nMais les pouvoirs du conseil de comt\u00e9 sont bien plus \u00e9tendus. En vertu de l'article 451, il est dit que le conseil de comt\u00e9 a tous ces m\u00eames pouvoirs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un chemin local \u00e0 faire; par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un chemin qui n'est pas encore ouvert, pas encore existant, pas encore construit, c'est-\u00e0-dire qui est inexistant.\nL'article 451 se lit en effet comme suit:\n451. Les attributions conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par les arts. 447 et 448 \u00e0 la corporation de comt\u00e9 et au bureau des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9galement exerc\u00e9s par eux relativement \u00e0 un chemin, pont ou coure d'eau \u00e0 faire de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que pour les chemins, ponts ou cours d'eau d\u00e9j\u00e0 faits.\nIl semblerait que la simple lecture de ce dernier article ne doive pas laisser le moindre doute dans l'esprit; il n'est pas ambigu; il est clair et pr\u00e9cis.\nCependant, en vertu de certaines d\u00e9cisions, particuli\u00e8rement dans la cause de Bothwell et La corporation de West Wickham[24] et dans la cause de La corporation de Nicolet v. La corporation du village de Villers[25] il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9, sinon d\u00e9cid\u00e9, que lorsqu'il s'agit de l'application de cet article 451, il faut faire les distinctions suivantes: 1\u00b0 ou bien le chemin local \u00e0 faire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9, ou cr\u00e9\u00e9, par l'autorit\u00e9 du conseil local, ou bien 2\u00b0 il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 et cr\u00e9\u00e9; dans le premier cas, le conseil de comt\u00e9 peut d\u00e9clarer le chemin projet\u00e9, chemin de comt\u00e9; dans le second cas, il ne le peut pas.\nPourquoi cette distinction arbitraire, alors que l'article 451 lui-m\u00eame n'en fait pas?\nOn r\u00e9pond en citant l'art. 454 et l'art 446, en vertu desquels le conseil local a seul juridiction sur les chemins situ\u00e9s en entier dans le territoire de sa municipalit\u00e9 locale; que jusqu'\u00e0 ce que tels chemins soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 chemins de comt\u00e9 en vertu des arts. 447 ou 448, ils sont des chemins locaux. On ajoute qu'en cons\u00e9quence de ces articles la disposition de l'art. 451 au sujet des chemins \u00e0 faire doit s'entendre d'un chemin qui est au moins d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 et trac\u00e9, ouvert en un mot, par le conseil local.\nEn d'autres termes, le chemin local doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9, ouvert et trac\u00e9, pour qu'un conseil de comt\u00e9 puisse ensuite avoir le pouvoir de le d\u00e9clarer chemin de comt\u00e9, et d'en ordonner la construction.\nLa raison apport\u00e9e pour faire la distinction que l'article 451 ne fait pas, est qu'il r\u00e9pugnerait aux principes de l'autonomie municipale de permettre \u00e0 un conseil de comt\u00e9 de se substituer \u00e0 un conseil local dans l'exercice des pouvoirs de ce dernier, et de construire des chemins sur son territoire en dehors ou contre la volont\u00e9 du conseil local.\nA cet argument de violation de l'autonomie du conseil local, on peut r\u00e9pondre qu'il y a autant, sinon plus, de violation de cette autonomie, dans le pouvoir d'un conseil de comt\u00e9 de s'emparer d'un chemin local tout fait, que de s'emparer du droit d'y ouvrir un nouveau chemin; dans les deux cas, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu apporter une exception \u00e0 la juridiction d'un conseil local; la m\u00eame raison d'utilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale existe dans les deux cas.\nIl faut bien se rappeler qu'un conseil de comt\u00e9 est compos\u00e9 des maires de tous les conseils locaux du comt\u00e9; qu'il est quelquefois rev\u00eatu d'une sorte de contr\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur les municipalit\u00e9s locales, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du comt\u00e9; que ceci \u00e9tait surtout bien \u00e9vident \u00e0 venir jusqu'au nouveau code en force depuis 1916, alors qu'il existait un appel au conseil de comt\u00e9 de toutes les r\u00e9solutions ou d\u00e9cisions des conseils locaux. Si un conseil de comt\u00e9 estime qu'une voie traversant diff\u00e9rentes municipalit\u00e9s devrait \u00eatre construite dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du comt\u00e9, que telle voie serait \u00e0 l'avantage de plusieurs municipalit\u00e9s, diminuerait les difficultes des routes existantes, ne devrait-il pas avoir le pouvoir de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter l'ouverture et la construction de la voie nouvelle? N'est-ce pas l\u00e0 la raison d'\u00eatre de l'article 451?\nEt alors malgr\u00e9 l'utilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale reconnue par le conseil de comt\u00e9 de la voie nouvelle ou projet\u00e9e, pourrait-il \u00eatre permis \u00e0 un conseil local de faire obstacle \u00e0 tout le projet, en refusant de faire sa part du chemin dans son territoire, emp\u00eachant ainsi l'ouverture m\u00eame du chemin?\nR\u00e9pondre dans l'affirmative serait, il me semble, aller \u00e0 l'encontre de l'esprit du code municipal.\nL'article 451 \u00e9tait, d'apr\u00e8s moi, suffisament clair pour justifier l'opinion qu'il n'y a pas lieu de faire de distinction entre les chemins \u00e0 faire, d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9s par l'autorit\u00e9 locale, et les chemins \u00e0 faire, non encore d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9s par cette m\u00eame autorit\u00e9.\nMais il y a plus: le nouveau code municipal a amend\u00e9 l'art. 447, alin\u00e9a 3, auquel r\u00e9f\u00e8re l'art. 451. Il semble que pour enlever tout doute sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'art. 451, il a introduit, dans l'art. 447 alin\u00e9a 3, deux mots qui compl\u00e8tent le sens et l'interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9j\u00e0 clairs et pr\u00e9cis de l'art. 441. En effet l'alin\u00e9a 3 de l'art. 447 se lit aujourd'hui comme suit:\nLa corporation de comt\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un chemin, un pont ou un cours d'eau local, est un chemin, un pont ou un cours d'eau de comt\u00e9, peut, si les circonstances l'exigent, d\u00e9terminer par r\u00e8glement ou par proc\u00e8s-verbal quelles corporations sont responsables de la construction, de l'ouverture, de l'entretien et r\u00e9parations de tels chemins, ponts ou cours d'eau, et d\u00e9clarer dans ce r\u00e8glement ou proc\u00e8s-verbal quelle est la part contributive de chaque corporation. (arts. 758, 885, 885a et 878 combin\u00e9s et amend\u00e9s). De son c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'article 451 dit que le conseil de comt\u00e9 peut exercer tous les pouvoirs mentionn\u00e9s dans cet alin\u00e9a, et qui se rapportent \u00e0 un chemin d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait, alors qu'il s'agit d'un chemin \u00e0 faire.\nAvant le nouveau code, le conseil de comt\u00e9 n'avait donc, du moins apparemment, de contr\u00f4le que sur les frais d'entretien et de r\u00e9paration d'un chemin \u00e0 faire; aujourd'hui il a, en plus, le contr\u00f4le sur l'ouverture et la construction du chemin.\nIl semble qu'il r\u00e9pugne de croire que ces mots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s sans un but sp\u00e9cial.\nExaminons ce que veut dire le mot ouverture d'un chemin.\nL'ouverture d'un chemin comprend deux parties bien distinctes: la partie que j'appellerais d\u00e9cr\u00e9tive ou cr\u00e9atrice du chemin,\u2014et la second partie, la partie mat\u00e9rielle. La premi\u00e8re appartient \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 municipale; alin\u00e9a seconde n'est qu'ex\u00e9cutive.\nD\u00e8s qu'un conseil municipal a pass\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement ou a homologu\u00e9 un proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant l'ouverture d'un chemin, ce chemin est l\u00e9galement ouvert; il y a plus: par la description qui en est faite dans le r\u00e8glement ou le proc\u00e8s-verbal, par la d\u00e9signation des lots cadastraux qu'il doit traverser, il est tout trac\u00e9. L'assiette du chemin existe l\u00e9galement. Le conseil est d\u00e8s lors bien renseign\u00e9 sur le co\u00fbt du chemin projet\u00e9, et il peut imm\u00e9diatement en r\u00e9partir les frais sur les municipalit\u00e9s qui vont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du chemin. C'est ce qu'\u00e9dicte le nouvel article 447, alin\u00e9a 3.\nCette premi\u00e8re partie de l'ouverture d'un chemin est donc la plus importante puisque la seconde, la partie mat\u00e9rielle, n'est que la partie ex\u00e9cutive de l'ordonnance municipale. La confection d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal entra\u00eene des frais. Le surintendant appoint\u00e9 pour l'ouverture du chemin fait la visite des lieux, il convoque les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, il donne des avis, il dresse son rapport, etc.\nOr, le conseil peut r\u00e9partir ces frais, tout comme il peut r\u00e9partir les frais d'ex\u00e9cution de l'ordonnance municipale, c'est-\u00e0-dire les frais de construction. C'est encore ce que dit le nouvel article 451.\nAinsi donc, en vertu du nouveau code, le conseil de comt\u00e9 a un contr\u00f4le sur l'ouverture et la construction d'un chemin \u00e0 faire, comme il avait, avant le nouveau code, le contr\u00f4le et la juridiction seulement sur l'entretien et la r\u00e9paration d'un chemin fait ou d'un chemin \u00e0 faire.\nAutrement, que voudraient dire les mots ouverture et construction, et les frais de cette ouverture et construction, que le nouveau code a ins\u00e9r\u00e9s, dans l'art. 447? D'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation bien connues, on ne peut supposer que ces mots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis pour ne rien dire, ou pour ne rien ajouter \u00e0 la disposition.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que le proc\u00e8s-verbal Poirier, et la r\u00e9solution du conseil de comt\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant le chemin projet\u00e9 comme chemin de comt\u00e9, n'\u00e9taient pas ultra vires des pouvoirs du conseil de comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska.\nSur la question de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du chemin projet\u00e9 pour les municipalit\u00e9s de Chester-Est, de Chester-Nord et de St-Norbert, je crois qu'il ne peut y avoir de doute.\nLa voie nouvelle doit traverser, ou traverse, ces trois municipalit\u00e9s; elle aboutit au chemin provincial qui conduit \u00e0 des centres tr\u00e8s importants; d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Dumont, directeur de la voirie pour le gouvernement provincial, corrobor\u00e9 dans les parties essentielles par d'autres t\u00e9moignages, le chemin sera une grande am\u00e9lioration sur le chemin existant dans St-Norbert; dans ce dernier chemin, il y a des \u00e9l\u00e9vations de terrains qui rendent le voyage en voiture extr\u00eamement difficile, diverses c\u00f4tes tr\u00e8s longues, etc.\nJe ne trouve aucune injustice \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 oppression et pouvant autoriser une cour de justice \u00e0 mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les ordonnances municipales du conseil de comt\u00e9 sur ce point. Du reste, comme on l'a vu, un grand nombre de citoyens de ces trois municipalit\u00e9s ont demand\u00e9 l'\u00e9tablissement de cette voie nouvelle; et, s'il y a eu opposition, il appartenait au conseil de comt\u00e9, o\u00f9 si\u00e9geaient les repr\u00e9sentants officiels de ces municipalit\u00e9s, de juger du bien-fond\u00e9 des raisons de part et d'autre. Il n'y a pas heu d'intervenir sur ce point.\nJe suis donc d'opinion de maintenir l'appel devant cette cour, de casser le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en Appel, et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perrault & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Girouard, Lavergne & Girouard.\nSolicitors for the mises-en-cause: Alleyn Taschereau.\n[1] Q.R. 31 K.B. 475.\n* Note:\u2014The judgment of this court on a motion to quash for Want of jurisdiction is reported in vol. 62, p. 101.\n[2] [1918] Q.R. 27 K.B. 289.\n[3] [1880] 6 Q.L.R. 45.\n[4] [1911] 18 R. de J. 141.\n[5] 6 Q.L.R. 45.\n[6] [1910] Q.R. 19 K.B. 353\n[7] 6 Q.L.R. 45.\n[8] Q.R. 27 K.B. 289.\n[9] 46 Can.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1921: October 27, 28; November 21.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault, JJ. and Bernier J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nInsurance\u2014Fidelity bond\u2014Untrue representations\u2014Evasive and misleading\u2014materiality\u2014Affirmative or promissory warranties\u2014Arts. 2485, 2486, 2487, 2490 CC.\nThe company appellant issued a policy guaranteeing the company respondent against loss, up to $3,000 through the dishonesty of Mr. Shortt, respondent's agent at Halifax, whose duties were, inter alia, to collect premiums due in that city and vicinity to deposit them in a bank and to remit same monthly to the respondent. The policy contained the usual agreement by the insured whereby the truth of its answers to questions by the insurer was made the basis of the contract. As to the respondent's supervision over the handling of the moneys collected by Shortt a certain number of questions were put to and answered by the respondent at the time of the application for the bond. To a question as to the inspection and checking of the bank book, the answer was : \"We do not inspect the bank account.\" To a question as to how often Shortt's cash accounts were balanced and checked, the answer was : \"monthly accounts.\" To a question as to any cash balance due then, the answer was: \"only for receipts that are in his hands for collection\". To the question: \"How often does an audit take place\", the answer was: \"He remits monthly\". To another question as to time of the last audit, the answer was : \"His last remittance was received a few days ago\". And to a last question: \"Were all things found in order?\"; the answer was: \"Yes.\" At the time the insurance was effected, a sum of over $2,000 was owed by Short to respondent, which the latter alleged was not to its knowledge. There had never been any audit of Shortt's accounts on behalf of the respondent during his employment. Held, Duff and Bernier JJ. dissenting, that the respondent's answers, even if literally true, were evasive, misleading and framed in a way to give the impression that Shortt's accounts were audited monthly; and thus they did not \"represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shows the nature and extent of the risk\" within the terms of art. 2485 C.C.\nPer Duff and Bernier JJ. (dissenting):\u2014The representations were not shown to be substantially untrue and it has not been established that there had been any material concealment or that the affirmative warranties had not been fulfilled.\nPer Duff, J.\u2014The respondent's declaration, as to the truth of his answers being the parts of the contract, is restricted in its application to representations and to warranties which are not promissory.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action:\u2014\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are very fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. and Vipond K.C. for the appellant. The respondent's answers were untrue representations. They were also misleading and the statements made by the respondent would rightly induce the appellant to think that Shortt's accounts were checked and audited monthly, when they were not.\nLafleur K.C. and Phelan K.C. for the respondent. The appellant is liable under the guarantee policy, as the statements made by the respondent were substantially true so far as they were within the knowledge of the respondent.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. and Vipond K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Phelan K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by respondent upon a fidelity guarantee, dated the 2nd April 1914, given it by the appellant, which recited the employment by the respondent, as agent at Halifax, N.S., of one Alfred Shortt, and its having delivered to appellant a proposal and declaration in writing stating (inter alia) the rules and conditions of the employment and the precautions observed by the employer in the management of, and the checks imposed upon, the employed, and which proposal the said employer has agreed shall be the basis of the contract (in question) and be considered as incorporated therein, and for the payment of $15.00 as the premium for such guarantee for twelve calendar months from the first day of April, 1914, and then proceeds as follows:\u2014\nNow it is hereby agreed, that if at any time during the continuance of this agreement the employer shall sustain any loss, caused by the forgery, the embezzlement or fraud of the employed in connection with the employment hereinbefore mentioned which shall be committed after the above date, during his uninterrupted continuance in the said employment within the meaning of this agreement and the conditions hereto, which shall be discovered during the continuance of this agreement, and within three months after the death, dismissal or retirement of the employed or within three months after this agreement ceasing to exist, whichever of these events shall first happen then the company shall, subject to the conditions indorsed, make good and reimburse such loss to the employer to the extent of three thousand dollars but not further, after such loss, and the cause, nature and extent thereof shall have been proved to the satisfaction of the directors, and such reasonable verification of the statements in the above mentioned proposal as they shall require, and such information as is required hereby or by the conditions hereto shall have been furnished.\nProvided always, that this agreement and the guarantee hereby effected shall be subject to the several conditions hereupon indorsed which are to be deemed to be conditions precedent to any liability on the part of the company under this agreement.\nThe said Shortt had been for forty years in the said service when he died on the 26th October, 1916.\nIn the year 1910 it had been arranged between the respondent and him that an account should be opened in the Bank of Montreal at Halifax, in the name of respondent, and that moneys coming to the hands of Shortt in the course of his business as such agent and which it was entitled to after deducting his commission, medical fees, and some rent; and that he should have no power over moneys so deposited save by issuing from time to time cheques to respondent for such moneys.\nIt had also been arranged long before the said guarantee was given that on the first of each month the respondent whose head office was in Montreal, should send Shortt a list of premiums due by those insured by it through his agency along with notices to be given each of the parties so owing and receipts for him to deliver to the respective parties so concerned upon payment of the premium due.\nIt was understood, however, that each party so insured had thirty days grace in which to pay his or her premium.\nThat might extend the time for remittance that much beyond the due date and hence extend the time for the agent Shortt reporting to the head office, and sending therewith the cheque on the local agency of the Bank of Montreal.\nIt was stated by counsel for the respondent on the argument before us that the list of accounts so transmitted by it to Shortt should be returned to the head office as soon as possible after the expiration of that month and thirty days' grace and shew thereon what were paid and return the receipts sent him for premiums but which had not been paid.\nIt is necessary to observe the foregoing facts as to the course of business in order to appreciate the full significance of the answers made by the respondent and the exact measure of the risk the appellant had to run and how it came about that it could undertake same for so small a premium. The proposal and declaration referred to in the above stated recital seems to have consisted of an application made to appellant by Shortt and brought to the respondent's notice by the following letter:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., Mar. 31, 1914.\nSir:\u2014\nMr. Alfred Shortt of Halifax, N.S., having applied to this Company for a guarantee in your favour of $3,000.00, I have to request that you will be good enough to reply as fully as possible to the annexed questions, as your answers and the declaration appended will form the basis of the contract between you and the Company.\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nF. H. Russell,\nManager and Attorney\nTo the Standard Life Assurance Co.,\nMontreal, Que.\nThe response thereto consists of answers to nearly thirty questions, one or two not having been directly answered.\nOf these I think the following may be considered herein:\u2014\n10. With respect to the duties of the applicant, please reply as fully as possible to the following questions:\u2014\nA. In what capacity or office will the applicant be engaged and where? Agent for Halifax.\nB. In what way will moneys pass through his hands? Collections and new business.\nC. What is the largest sum which he will have in his hands at any one time, and for how long? Say $5,000. He remits monthly.\nD. Is he allowed to pay out of the cash in his hands any amounts on your accounts? If so state nature and extent. A. Yes, commission, doctors' fees, etc.\nE. How often will you require him to render an account of cash received and pay the same to you? Monthly.\nF. Are moneys to be paid into the bank by applicant? If so, how often will the bank book be inspected and checked? We do not inspect the bank account.\nG. How often will you balance his cash accounts, and how will you check their accuracy? Please explain fully. A. Monthly accounts. H. Will the balance on his hands, if any, be counted and paid over or how dealt with? Monthly accounts.\n11. Is there any cash balance at present due to you from him? If so give particulars. A. Only for receipts that are in his hands for collection.\n13. Have you a separate banking account into which all moneys are paid by the applicant on your behalf when received? Yes, in Bank of Montreal.\n14. Are cheques countersigned? If so, by whom? No.\n15. How often does an audit take place? He remits monthly.\n16. When were applicant's accounts last audited, and by whom? His last remittance was received a few days ago.\n17. Were all things found in order? Yes.\n21. Has any person holding the same or similar situation as that to be held by the applicant been detected in any defalcations? If so, please state particulars? No.\nOf these for our present purpose I think question 11 and the answer thereto is all that need be considered.\nThe others are instructive and illuminative of what is really meant thereby.\nAnd in light thereof and the evidence the answer is untrue.\nIt is apparently found by several of the learned judges in the Court of King's Bench that over two thousand dollars of old debt was then due and that for moneys which could not fall within the words\n(11) only for receipts that are in his hands for collection.\nThe said learned judges, however, take a different view from what I do as to the legal result thereof.\nI have read the evidence of all the witnesses in an effort to see if this statement of fact in the answers so made could be verified.\nI fail to find any such statement can be supported and I am led to suspect, though I do not herein rest thereupon, that the facts were even worse against the respondent. And what I do find is quite inconsistent with the answers to questions E. G. and H. of question 10. With great respect I cannot agree with the reasoning of the learned judges below who seem to think these assurances of monthly rendering of accounts and requiring payment thereof ineffective and hence of no consequence herein.\nI think when the answer to question 11 is considered in light thereof and of the proven facts as existent at the time when the answer was made that such an answer is fatal to the claim of the respondent.\nAgain the answers to questions 16 and 17 should never have been made.\nNo use applying needlessly harsh adjectives but when, if ever, the slightest attention is paid to the facts disclosed by the system which I have outlined above, relative to the sending out of accounts and receiving them in return such an answer, as implying that all things were found in order, is quite unjustifiable.\nAnd so far as I hold it so its erroneous statement falls within the latter part of the third condition indorsed on the guarantee, which is as follows\n3. every renewal premium which shall be paid and accepted in respect of this agreement shall be so paid and accepted with the distinct understanding that on the faith that no alteration has taken place in the facts contained in the proposal or statement hereinbefore mentioned, and that nothing is known to the employer calculated to affect the risk of the company under the Guarantee hereby given. If the proposal referred to in the within agreement or any statements therein contained or referred to is or are untrue in any respect, or if there be any material fact affecting the nature of the risk whether in relation to the occupation of the employed or otherwise, omitted therefrom, or if there be any misrepresentation, suppression or untrue averment at the time of payment of the first or any renewal premium or in connection with or in support of any claim, then the within agreement shall be absolutely void, and all premiums paid in respect thereof shall be forfeited to the company,\nand renders the agreement sued on void. How could any one compare the lists of moneys to be collected monthly with the actual facts disclosed in many monthly returns, much less the then last, and find all things in order?\nThere is much confusion in the evidence in the case and otherwise which prevents me from dealing as effectively as I had wished with the point made by appellant's counsel as to the amount paid into the bank in the months of August, September and October of 1916, being the months for which recovery herein is sought.\nIt is attempted to be answered by an argument of counsel for the respondent that though there was money enough deposited by Shortt during that period to cover all the defaults for the months claimed, yet that had been rightfully applied to cover old deficiencies.\nI cannot satisfactorily trace the evidence relied thereon in support of the argument. Nor can I accept the argument as satisfactory for it lands respondent, if correct, hopelessly, I fear, on another horn of the dilemma presented to it here as it often is at every angle of this case.\nThat deficiency, so far as I can see, was part of an extended chain of fact loaded with more monthly defaults than the respondent can explain away and yet maintain its assurance to the appellant in anwering question 11.\nIt seems clear that the unfortunate deceased was by circumstances driven to resort to the expediency of extending the time for making his final returns and thus get more room for hiding his shortages when due attention to the facts thus disclosed and a stern hand guiding respondent might have saved both him and it. It is not herein at all a question of what any particular officer acting on respondent's behalf thought or believed.\nAs I understand the law it is what the actual facts were and which the respondent was bound to know before representing otherwise any view of the facts.\nThe contract is expressly based by mutual consent upon the facts as ultimately found and represented and I take it abolutely binding respondent to abide thereby no matter how honestly mistaken its officers may have been.\nBy no means do I mean to suggest that he was wilfully false, or, on the other hand, that he was quite excusable.\nThere is another ground taken and that is the basis of the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Dorion in the court below resting upon the answers given by the respondent in the following terms when asked the question put shortly after the renewal for 1915, as follows:\u2014\nThe letter dated 25th May, 1915, of the request is as follows:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014\nWe beg to enclose herewith the customary annual audit statement in connection with the accounts of Mr. A. Shortt, your agent at Halifax, N.S., and in connection with his bond for 13,000. We shall be glad if your will kindly sign same and return to this office.\nYours faithfully,\nand signed by appellant's manager, is answered by the following:\u2014\nThis is to certify that the books and accounts of Mr. Alfred Shortt, were examined by us from time to time in the regular course of business and we found them correct in every respect, all monies or property in his control or custody being accounted for, with proper securities and funds on hand to balance his accounts, and he is not now in default. He has performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner and no change has occurred in the terms or conditions of his employment as specified by us when the bond was executed.\nDated at Montreal, this 27th day of May, 1915.\nD. M, McGOUN,\nManager for Canada.\naccompanied by a letter of same date, as follows:\u2014\nWe have your letter of the 25th instant, enclosing audit statement in connection with accounts of Mr. A. Shortt, our Agent at Halifax. We return herewith form duly completed.\nAnd the following year a like certificate was given on the like request though not so complete yet objectionable.\nEach was untrue in fact tending to deceive the appellant's auditor and hence quite unjustifiable.\nIt is said these were not asked before renewals, for the respective years in question.\nI may point out that the original declaration on the application for the guarantee contained the following at its close:\u2014\nI declare that the above statements are true, and I agree that these statements and any further statements referring to this guarantee signed by me shall be taken as the basis of the contract between me and the above named company.\nI think these certificates were further statements such as contemplated and it mattered not whether made in relation to renewals or not though quite likely they were.\nThe respondent had, by the express terms of the guarantee, the right to cancel it at any time and had a perfect right to ask such a question and be guided by the answer, or refusal to answer.\nAnd that answer should have been honest as neither of these were or are excusable in law however otherwise possibly so in a degree. The answers brought into operation and effect the terms of the conditions already quoted and rendered the policy void.\nMoreover alternatively these are cogent evidence in the way of debarring the respondent from applying moneys paid in by the deceased in the months for which claim is made from applying same to cover up early defalcations.\nThe insurance is only against forgery, fraud or embezzlement.\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the respondent's action dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The questions raised by this appeal mainly concern the interpretation and effect of the answers given by the insured in a proposal for insurance. They have given rise to differences of opinion. I concur with the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the representations were not shewn to be substantially untrue and that there was any material concealment or that the affirmative warranties were not fulfilled is not established. It is convenient perhaps to first deal with the point argued by the appellant to the effect that the proposal contained promises as to the course of dealing which constituted essential conditions of the policy. This is a view of the policy which I think cannot be supported. The declaration with which the proposal concludes is in the following words:\u2014\nI declare that the above statements are true, and I agree that these statements and any further statements referring to this guarantee signed by me shall be taken as the basis of the contract between me and the above named company. This declaration is obviously restricted in its application to representations and to warranties which are not promissory. The policy recites that the insured\nhas delivered to the company a proposal and declaration in writing signed by or on behalf of the employer, stating (inter alia) the rules and conditions of the employment, and the precautions observed by the employer in the management of, and the check imposed upon the employed, and which proposal the said employer has agreed shall be the bais of this contract, and be considered as incorporated herein.\nThe fair meaning of this recital is that the proposal is to be incorporated with the policy according to the terms of the proposal itself. In other words, it is only those answers which profess to state matters of fact, (representations and affirmative warranties) which are incorporated in the policy. As against the insured it would be a departure from the long settled rule requiring the provisions of insurance contracts framed by the insurer and expressed in terms capable of more than one construction to be read according to that construction which is the most favourable to the insured. We are therefore concerned on this appeal only with representations of fact and warranties as to fact as distinguished from promissory warranties expressed in the respondent's proposal.\nIs there in fact misrepresentation or concealment in respect of the matters complained of? The argument principally turned upon three alleged cases of misrepresentation or concealment. 1st. The representation \"he remits monthly\" is alleged to be misleading. 2nd. The answers to two questions are said to imply an affirmation that Shortt's accounts had been audited, and 3rd. there is said to be an implied representation that on the occasion of the last remittance his accounts had been investigated and found to be in order. I observe, first, that in construing such a document the answers are not to be read with pedantic strictness; they should be given the meaning which a business man of ordinary intelligence would ascribe to them. So reading these answers I not only find in them no affirmation, express or implied, that the practice was to audit Shortt's accounts but on the contrary answers which most certainly would convey the idea that such was not the practice. So as to the answer concerning the last remittance; that, when read in connection with the preceding answer does not imply that any extraordinary investigation had taken place but only that everything had been found to be in accordance with the usual course of business.\nI am moreover unable to see that any substantial departure from the truth occurs from the statement \"he remits monthly.\" I think that would not be an untruthful or misleading description of the practice by which the monies received for premiums due in any month were sent forward in a single remittance within such delay as might be considered reasonable by the parties having regard to the statutory allowance of days of grace and the contingencies of settlements with dilatory insurers.\nI am unable to agree that the so called renewal certificates affect the rights of the respondent; they were sent forward in each case after the renewals had been effected. There is no allegation in the pleadings and there is no evidence to shew that the appellant company was influenced by these certificates in refraining from exercising its powers of cancellation. And in the absence of either allegation or proof it would be inconsistent with sound principle to proceed upon the assumption that they were so influenced. Anglin J.\u2014Article 2487 of the Civil Code of Quebec reads as follows:\u2014\nMisrepresentation or concealment, either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\nArticle 2485 provides that:\u2014\nThe insured is obliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shews the nature and extent of the risk and which may prevent the undertaking of it or affect the rate of premium.\nBy article 2486 it is declared that:\u2014\nThe insured is not * * * obliged to declare facts covered by warranties, express or implied, except in answer to inquiries made by the insurer.\nThe following recital and indorsed \"condition precedent\" are taken from the policy sued upon:\nWhereas The Standard Life Assurance Company, Montreal, Quebec (hereinafter referred to as \"the employer\") employs or intends to employ as agent at Halifax, N.S., Alfred Shortt, (hereinafter referred to as \"the employed\") and desires to effect a guarantee with The Railway Passengers Assurance Company (hereinafter referred to as \"the company\") and has delivered to the company a proposal and declaration in writing, signed by or on behalf of the employer, stating (inter alia) the rules and conditions of the employment, and the precautions observed by the employer in the management of, and the check imposed upon the employed, and which proposal the said employer has agreed shall be the basis of this contract, and be considered as incorporated herein.\n* * *\n3. Every renewal premium which shall be paid and accepted in respect of this agreement shall be so paid and accepted with the distinct understanding and on the faith that no alteration has taken place in the facts contained in the proposal or statement hereinbefore mentioned, and that nothing is known to the employer calculated to affect the risk of the company under the guarantee hereby given. If the proposal referred to in the within agreement or any statements therein contained or referred to is or are untrue in any respect, or if there be any material fact affecting the nature of the risk, whether in relation to the occupation of the employed or otherwise, omitted therefrom, or if there be any misrepresentation, suppression or untrue averment at the time of the payment of the first or any renewal premium or in connection with or in support of any claim, then the within agreement shall be absolutely void, and all premiums paid in respect thereof shall be forfeited to the company.\nThe proposal or application by the plaintiff for the insurance contains the following questions and answers:\n10. With respect to the duties of the applicant, please reply as fully as possible to the following questions:\nC. What is the largest sum which he will have in his hands at any one time, and for how long? Say $5,000. He remits monthly.\nE. How often will you require him to render an account of cash received and pay the same to you? Monthly.\nG. How often will you balance his cash accounts, and how will you check their accuracy? Please explain fully? Monthly accounts.\nH. Will the balance on his hands if any, be counted and paid over or how dealt with? Monthly accounts.\n11. Is there any cash balance at present due to you from him? If so, give particulars. Only for receipts that are in his hands for collection.\n15. How often does an audit take place? He remits monthly.\n16. When were applicant's accounts last audited, and by whom? His last remittance was received a few days ago.\n17. Were all things found in order? Yes.\nIt concludes as follows:\u2014\nI declare that the above statements are true and I agree that these statements and any further statements referring to this guarantee signed by me shall be taken as the basis of the contract between me and the above named company.\nThe facts were that the agent Shortt, although his accounts as rendered did not disclose it, had stolen upwards of $2,000 collected in premiums at the time the insurance was effected and that this defalcation continued and increased throughout the duration of the policy so that it amounted to more than $5,000 when he died; that there never was any audit of his accounts, or any examination, counting or balancing of his cash on behalf of the plaintiffs; that any thorough audit, any effective balancing of the cash accounts, any real checking of the \"monies in his control or custody\" or of \"the funds on hand to balance his accounts\" would have revealed the embezzlement; and that, although it was twice stated that he remitted monthly, he was habitually permitted to hold moneys collected by him for premiums for periods of 80 and even of 90 days as this extract from the evidence of the plaintiff's accountant, Bowles, shews:\u2014\nQ. Did you ascertain when May, 1916, premiums were remitted? A. They were remitted for the week ending 5th of August.\nBy the Court:\nQ. The June, 2nd of September, and July, the 30th of Sept. A. Yes. By defendant's counsel:\nQ. And April, the 30th June I think you said? A. Yes, the 30th of June.\nQ. And March? A. 29th of May.\nQ. February? A. The week ending 6th of May; they were received in Montreal really on the 1st of May as per our stamp; that is February, 1916, received on the 1st of May, 1916.\nQ. January? A. On the 28th of March.\nQ. December, 1915. A. On the 28th of February.\nQ. November, 1915? A. On the 29th of January.\nIn fact the account rendered immediately prior to the application made for the policy on the first of April, 1914, which was sent in on the 20th of March, covered the premiums received in January leaving the whole of the February premiums and those received during the first 20 days of March unaccounted for. Whatever excuse the statutory provision for 30 days' grace on payment of premiums may have afforded for allowing the agent to retain the premiums collected during January until the 1st of March or even a day or two later, it cannot avail to cover withholding them until the 20th of March. It was also the fact that Shortt was never required when rendering his statements to account for or pay over all monies received by him up to the date of the accounting. Moneys received during the preceding 40 to 60 days were not included. Nevertheless the misleading statement is twice made that \"he remits monthly\". \"All things\" would not have been \"found in order\", a few days before the policy was applied for if any proper audit or investigation, such as the answer to question 17 implied, had in fact taken place. In my opinion the answers to questions 16 and 17 fairly read together, as they must be, were false and misleading; the answers to questions 10 (C) and 10 (E) were calculated to \"diminish the appreciation of the risk\" to be undertaken; on the answers as a whole the facts were not substantially as represented (Art. 2489 C.C.) and the risk which the defendants were induced to undertake was materially different from and greater than the statements in the application would indicate. I cannot find anything in that document which limits the responsibility of the applicants for the truth of the answers made to matters within their own knowledge. On the contrary, there is an express declaration of the truth of the representations and they are made the basis of the contract. Thomson v. Weems[1]. Viewed as warranties (Art. 2491 C.C.) the untruth of the answers in the application, whether taken singly or as a whole, avoids the policy whether known or unknown to the warrantor (Art. 2490 C.C. Joel v. Law Union and Crown Ins. Co.[2]; viewed as misrepresentations or concealments of existing facts it is immaterial whether there was merely error or design to deceive on the part of the applicant (Art. 2487 C.C.); viewed as undertakings in regard to the course of dealing to be pursued by the assured with its agent during the currency of the policy, having been incorporated with it as the basis of the contract their non-fulfilment is equally fatal. Art. 2490 C.C. The case falls within the principle of the decision of this court in Anrprior v. United States Fidelity and Guarantee Ins. Co.[3]. Moreover, in connection with each of the two renewals of the policy a certificate was required from the assured. The two certificates, obtained respectively in 1915 and 1916, read as follows:\u2014\nThis is to certify that the books and accounts of Mr. Alfred Shortt, were examined by us from time to time in the regular course of business and we found them correct in every respect, all monies or property in his control or custody being accounted for, with proper securities and funds on hand to balance his accounts, and he is not now in default.\nHe has performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner and no change has occurred in the terms or conditions of his employment as specified by us when the bond was executed.\nDated at Montreal, this 27th day of May, 1916.\nD. M. McGOUN,\nManager for Canada.\nThis is to certify that the books and accounts of Mr. Alfred Shortt, as rendered by him, were examined by us from time to time in the regular course of business and we found it correct in every respect, all monies or property in his control or custody being accounted for, and he is not now in default.\nHe has performed all his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner and no change has occurred in the terms or conditions of his employment as specified by us when the bond was executed.\nDated at Montreal, this 9th day of May, 1916.\nStandard Life Ass. Co.,\nJ. R. EAKIN,\nSecretary for Canada.\nThe words \"as rendered by him\" in the 1916 certificate were inserted in ink. They obviously refer only to the \"accounts\" of the agent. Books are not \"rendered\". In these certificates we find these three positive statements, (a) that Shortt's books had been examined from time to time by his employers; (b) that all moneys in his control or custody had been accounted for; and in 1915 (c) that he had \"proper securities and funds on hand to balance his accounts\". All three statements were absolutely untrue and one, if not two of them, must have been untrue to the knowledge of the officials of the assured. But I find nothing to restrict the statements made in these certificates to matters within their knowledge, or otherwise to qualify them. Nor, in view of the provision entitling the company to cancel the policy at any time, is it of vital moment that the sending in of those certificates was delayed until after the renewal premiums had actually been paid. The power to cancel was not exercised and the policy was kept on foot on the faith of them\u2014at least that must be assumed as against the insured. On this ground, as well as for substantial misrepresentations and concealments of fact in the original proposal of a nature to diminish the insurer's appreciation of the risk, the policy sued upon was in my opinion avoided. Indeed if some of the answers to the questions which are expressly incorporated in and made the basis of the policy should be regarded as merely evasions there is good authority for holding that the insurance was thereby avoided. Fitzrandolph v. The Mutual Relief Society of N.S.[4]. Moens v. Heyworth[5].\nInsurance companies should undoubtedly be held to strict compliance with their obligations and defences on their part lacking in merit and substance should be discouraged. On the other hand the fact that the contract of insurance is uberrim\u0153 fidei (Brownlie v. Campbell[6], must never be lost sight of and an insured cannot be permitted to recover on a policy which he has obtained by making particular statements in regard to material matters which are only half truths\u2014often more misleading than actual falsehoods\u2014 London Assurance Co. v. Mansel[7]\u2014or by putting in an application which, taken as a whole, is palpably calculated to create a false impression as to the nature and extent of the risk to be undertaken by the insurer.\nI would for these reasons, with respect, allow this appeal and direct judgment dismissing this action with costs throughout.\nMignault J.\u2014The question here is whether the appellant is liable, under a guarantee policy issued by it in favour of the respondent, to make good a defalcation committed by one Alfred Shortt who was the agent of the respondent at Halifax. On the latter's death it was discovered, the respondent alleges, that he was short in his accounts to the extent of $5,197.90, and the respondent sued to recover the full amount of the policy, $3,000.00. It succeeded in the Superior Court for the entire amount of its demand, but, in the Court of King's Bench, the judgment was reduced by the sum of $584.36 which the respondent owed to Shortt's estate on a life insurance policy which was payable to his executors. The respondent acquiesced in this reduction, and the appellant claims that the conditions of the policy were violated and that the action should have been dismissed.\nThe policy was issued in Montreal in 1914, and was twice renewed.\nAs it is usual in such cases, the truth of the answers of the insured to questions made on behalf of the insurer in the application for insurance, and of any further statements of the insured referring to the guarantee, is made the basis of the contract.\nThe questions and answers contained in the application for insurance and which are material to this inquiry are the following:\u2014 10. C. What is the largest sum which he will have in his hands at any one time, and for how long? Say $5,000. He remits monthy.\n10 E. How often will you require him to render an account of cash received and pay the same to you? Monthly.\n10 F. Are moneys to be paid into the bank by the applicant? If so, how often will the bank book be inspected and checked? We do not inspect the bank account.\n10 G. How often will you balance his cash accounts, and how will you check their accuracy? Please explain fully? Monthly accounts.\n10. H. Will the balance in his hands, if any, be counted and paid over or how dealt with? Monthly accounts.\n11. Is there any cash balance at present due to you from him? If so give particulars.\u2014Only for receipts that are in his hands for collection.\n13. Have you a separate banking account into which all moneys are paid by the applicant on your behalf when received? Yes, in Bank of Montreal.\n15. How often does an audit take place? He remits monthly.\n16. When were applicant's accounts last audited, and by whom? His last remittance was received a few days ago.\n17. Were all things found in order? Yes.\nThe evidence clearly shews that some years before the policy Shortt had been guilty of a defalcation for a considerable amount, but, by reason of an inefficient system of control by the respondent, he succeeded in concealing it, and his defalcation, at the date of the policy, amounted to approximately $2,000.00. At his death the shortage had reached the figure of $5,197.90.\nI have quoted the principal questions and answers contained in the application for insurance. As to these answers Mr. Justice Martin, in the Court of King's Bench, remarks:\u2014\nIt will be observed from these answers that respondent persistently avoided making any direct answers as to any audit or checking the accuracy of Shortt's accounts. What they said amounts to this: we do not inspect the bank account: we do not make any audit: we do not balance his cash account or check their accuracy: we require him to render monthly accounts and pay over cash received monthly.\nWhile the wisdom of accepting such incomplete answers and issuing a policy thereon may be doubted I think there was a full and fair disclosure of all facts showing the nature and extent of the risk and showing entire absence of any audit, inspection of the bank account or checking the accuracy of Shortt's monthly statements. With deference, I am of opinion that it is not enough to say that the appellant issued the policy on incomplete answers. If I am right in thinking that these answers were evasive and misleading, they certainly do not amount to a full disclosure of all facts showing the nature and extent of the risk.\nAnd indeed, while it is true that the respondent stated that it did not inspect the bank account, some of these answers were framed in a way to give the impression that Shortt's cash accounts would be monthly balanced and their accuracy checked. To reply \"monthly accounts\" in answer to questions inquiring how the cash accounts would be balanced and checked, and the balance in Shortt's hands would be dealt with; to say \"he remits monthly\" when the point was \"how often does an audit take place\" and \"his last remittance was received a few days ago\" in reply to an inquiry \"when were applicant's accounts last audited and by whom\"; and to answer \"yes\" to the question whether all things were found in order ; is in effect to assure the appellant that a monthly balancing, checking and auditing of Shortt's accounts would take place and that, at the last audit made, everything was found in order. The respondent says that the evasive and misleading answers it made were; literally true. If so their truth was a species of half truth really quite as deceptive as a false answer. The whole truth was that Shortt's accounts were not balanced, checked and audited monthly for otherwise the defalcation could not have escaped detection.\nThis is shewn by the cross-examination of Mr. Bowles, the accountant whose duty it was to check Shortt's returns. The system was to send to Shortt the renewal receipts for the coming month, which the insured could pay within thirty days from maturity, and for which Shortt had to account. Mr. Bowles states that, in 1896, the January premiums received by Shortt were remitted on the 28th of March, the February premiums on the 1st of May, the March premiums on the 29th of May, the April premiums on the 30th of June. This was, as admitted by Mr. Bowles, one month late, and the lax system prevailed during the preceding year, the length of the delay in remitting being somewhat less.\nIn my opinion the answers made by the respondent inplied a promise that Shortt's accounts would be balanced, checked and audited monthly, and this promise was not fulfilled when he was allowed to remain in arrears from month to month, thus permitting him to conceal or cover up up his defalcation.\nIn Arnprior v. United States Fidelity and Guarantee Cl.[8] the insured in answer to the question: \"What means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct? \"replied: \"auditors examine rolls and his vouchers from treasurer yearly\". The rolls were never examined during the continuance of the policy and it was held that this was an untrue representation that avoided the contract. This case seems to me clearly applicable here.\nThe contract of insurance is one where the utmost good faith and sincerity must be observed by the insured. This is well stated by Fuzier-Herman, vo. Assurance, nos. 588 and 589:\u2014\n588. L'assurance \u00e9tant un contrat de bonne foi et la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 en \u00e9tant une condition n\u00e9cessaire, l'assur\u00e9 doit faire \u00e0 l'assureur, au moment de la formation du contrat, des d\u00e9clarations exactes et compl\u00e8tes sur ce que ce dernier a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 savoir, l'\u00e9clairer sur l'objet de l'assurance et sur les risques. 589. Toutes les polices subordonnent l'existence du contrat \u00e0 la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'exactitude des d\u00e9clarations. C'est \u00e0 juste titre: l'assureur doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre \u00e9clair\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e v\u00e9ritable de son engagement, sur l'\u00e9tendue du risque qui lui est propos\u00e9; sinon, il n'y a plus accord de volont\u00e9s sur la chose promise, le consentement n'existe pas et, par suite, le contrat est vici\u00e9 dans son principe.\nThe civil Code of the Province of Quebec has adopted these principles in their utmost strictness:\n2485. The insured is obliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shews the nature and extent of the risk, and which may prevent the undertaking of it or affect the rate of premium.\n2487. Misrepresentation or concealment either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\n2490. Warranties and conditions are a part of the contract and must be true if affirmative, and if promissory most be complied with; otherwise the contract may be annulled notwithstanding the good faith of the insured.\nMeasured by this test, the respondent cannot cercertainly contend that its replies represented to the assurer\nfully and fairly every fact which shews the nature and extent of the risk.\nIts answers were calculated to mislead, perhaps not deliberately, but none the less effectively. And it should not now be heard to defend these answers by saying that they were true as far as they went, or that they were incomplete and the appellant having chosen to issue the policy cannot complain of their incompleteness. It would seem to me contrary to the principles I have stated to allow the respondent, notwithstanding its misrepresentation, or failure to fully and fairly represent such material facts as the checking and auditing of Shortt's accounts, to recover on the policy a loss brought about by its own loose method of dealing with its agent. The policy in question was twice renewed and after each renewal the respondent furnished the appellant with a certificate that Shortt's books and accounts had been examined by it from time to time in the regular course of business and were found correct in every respect. The evidence shows that this statement was not true, no such examination having been made, otherwise it is inconceivable that the defalcation would not have been discovered. The respondent claims that the appellant did not rely on these statements in renewing the policy, for they were subsequent to each renewal, but, being false, they deceived the appellant as to a material fact and induced it to maintain a policy which it could have cancelled. Moreover, if the answers to the questions in the original application amount to a representation that Shortt's books and accounts would be balanced, checked and audited monthly, and I think they do, this representation and the promise it implies has not been fulfilled. I am therefore of opinion that the respondent cannot recover on the policy.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action dismissed with costs throughout.\nBernier J. (dissenting).\u2014Les parties en cause sont toutes deux des compagnies d'assurance.\nL'intim\u00e9e a obtenu de l'appelante le 1er avril 1914, une police de garantie sur la fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 de son employ\u00e9 Alfred Shortt, au montant de $3,000; l'appelante s'est engag\u00e9e dans la police \u00e0 garantir l'intim\u00e9e contre toute fraude, ou malversation criminelle, de son employ\u00e9.\nA la mort de ce dernier, vers le 25 octobre, 1916, il fut constat\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en d\u00e9ficit d'une somme d'au-del\u00e0 de $5,000.00 envers l'intim\u00e9e. Sur refus de l'appelante de rembourser l'intim\u00e9e, celle-ci poursuivit l'appelante pour le montant de sa police, savoir $3,000.00. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action; la Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 le jugement, tout en le r\u00e9duisant cependant \u00e0 la somme de $2,415.64, sans frais de part ni d'autre en Cour du Banc du Roi mais avec les frais de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure contre l'appelante.\nParmi ses moyens de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'action, l'appelante all\u00e8gue fausse repr\u00e9sentation et reticence coupable, de la part de l'intim\u00e9e; elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement la fausset\u00e9 des garanties affirmatives et la non-ex\u00e9cution des garanties promissoires, contenues dans les r\u00e9ponses de l'intim\u00e9e, r\u00e9ponses incorpor\u00e9es dans la police ou en faisant partie par une \u00e9nonciation \u00e0 cet effet.\nCe premier moyen a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9? Je suis d'opinion qu'il ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9.\nLes r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 l'interrogatoire \u00e9crit de l'appelante et qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 naturellement l'\u00e9mission de la police, ne sont pas toutes compl\u00e8tes; cependant elles ne sont pas vagues, et on ne peut y d\u00e9couvrir de traces de reticences, pas plus, du reste, que de fausses repr\u00e9sentations.\nAinsi \u00e0 la question 10 F, voici la r\u00e9ponse:\nQ. Are moneys to be paid into the bank by the applicant? If so, how often will the bank book be inspected and checked? R. We do not inspect the bank account.\nCette r\u00e9ponse n'est pas compl\u00e8te. Elle laisse entendre cependant que son employ\u00e9 d\u00e9pose les argents \u00e0 la banque, et en effet, il le dit en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la 13\u00e8me question.\nMais la r\u00e9ponse devient importante, quand il s'agit de faire une revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'enqu\u00eate, pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu inex\u00e9cution des garanties promissoires de la police. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question 10 G n'est pas plus compl\u00e8te, car la question d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente 10 F devait recevoir la m\u00eame r\u00e9ponse, si l'appelante voulait bien se contenter de la premi\u00e8re.\nM\u00eame chose pour la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question H.\nQuestion 11:\nIs there any cash balance at present due to you from him? If so, give particulars. Only for receipts that are in his hands for collection.\nCette r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9galement son importance au point de vue de la garantie affirmative.\nMais que veut-elle dire de plus que ceci: il n'est pas \u00e0 ma connaissance personnelle que mon employ\u00e9 me doive autre chose que les argents repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les re\u00e7us de prime que je lui ai transmis, re\u00e7us qu'il devra remettre aux assur\u00e9s lorsqu'il sera, par ces derniers, pay\u00e9 de leurs primes de renouvellement?\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend qu'au moment o\u00f9 cette r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e, Shortt \u00e9tait d\u00e9ja d\u00e9falcataire vis-\u00e0-vis de l'intim\u00e9e. La chose est possible. S'il l'\u00e9tait, ce n'\u00e9tait certainement pas \u00e0 la connaissance de l'intim\u00e9e qui avait cet homme \u00e0 son service depuis quarante ans, et dont la r\u00e9putation \u00e9tait excellente.\nIl n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 appliquer ici aucune r\u00e8gle de garantie implicite, \u00e0 l'effet que, si Shortt \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce moment d\u00e9falcataire hors la connaissance de l'intim\u00e9e, la r\u00e9ponse de cette derni\u00e8re serait une garantie fausse, et partant pourrait faire annuler la pouce.\nQuestion 15:\nHow often does an audit take place? He remits monthly.\nLa r\u00e9ponse, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, est vraie, mais elle n'est pas \"ad rem\". Cependant, l'intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question 10 F; \"We do not inspect the bank account\".\nSi l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu'elle n'examine pas le compte de banque de son employ\u00e9, on comprend qu'elle n'audite pas ses comptes.\nQuestion 16:\nWhen were applicant's accounts last audited and by whom? His last remittance was received a few days ago.\nCette derni\u00e8re question, d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, devait recevoir une r\u00e9ponse dans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente r\u00e9ponse.\nElle n'est pas compl\u00e8te; mais on voit bien que l'intim\u00e9e ne faisait aucune audition des comptes qu'elle avait avec son employ\u00e9, et qu'elle n'entendait pas non plus en faire.\nL'appelante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se contenter de ces r\u00e9ponses; elle a \u00e9mis sa police.\nPeut-elle aujourd'hui s'en plaindre? Je ne le crois pas.\nL'enqu\u00eate n'a pas rev\u00e9l\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e e\u00fbt cach\u00e9 quoi que ce soit des agissements de son employ\u00e9, rien dont la connaissance par l'appelante l'aurait emp\u00each\u00e9e d'assumer le risque, ou qui aurait pu influer sur le taux de la prime.\nPourquoi ne pas avoir requis l'intim\u00e9e de faire \u00e0 l'avenir des auditions des livres ou des comptes de son employ\u00e9? Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 remplir \u00e0 l'avenir certaines pr\u00e9cautions que visiblement, par la formule de l'interrogatoire \u00e9crit et imprim\u00e9, elle avait l'habitude d'exiger de ses assur\u00e9s?\nElle e\u00fbt alors pos\u00e9 des garanties promissoires, dont le d\u00e9faut d'accomplissement e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 une cause d'annulation de la police. Les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e ont form\u00e9 la base du contrat d'assurance entre les parties. La clause suivante accompagnait les r\u00e9ponses, \u00e0 l'effet que telles r\u00e9ponses \u00e9taient vraies et qu'elles serviraient de base au contrat:\nI declare that the above statements are true and I agree that these statements and any further statements referring to this guaranty signed by me shall be taken as the basis of the contract between me and the above named company.\nApr\u00e8s l'\u00e9mission de la police, savoir le 21 mai 1915, l'appelante transmit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e pour que celle-ci le sign\u00e2t un blanc de certificat au sujet de son employ\u00e9; le m\u00eame envoi fut fait l'ann\u00e9e suivante, mais apr\u00e8s le renouvellement de la police d'assurance, savoir, le 9 mai 1916.\nCes blancs sont des formules imprim\u00e9es.\nCes certificats sur la conduite ou les agissements de Shortt ne sont pas autres choses que des d\u00e9clarations au sens de l'article 2485 du code. Elles ne viennent rien ajouter aux clauses et conditions de la police, ni aux r\u00e9ponses de l'intim\u00e9e qui ont fait la base du contrat.\nIl semble que c'est l'habitude chez l'appelante de faire signer ces documents \u00e0 ses assur\u00e9s; mais, venant apr\u00e8s que le contrat d'assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu parfait, ils ne peuvent gu\u00e8re avoir d'influence sur ce contrat; je leur appliquerais ce principe des assurances sur le feu (Art. 2570 C.C.) et des assurances sur la vie (Art. 2585 C.C.)\nLes d\u00e9clarations qui ne sont pas ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la police ou qui n'en font pas partie ne sont pas re\u00e7ues pour en affecter le sens ou les effets.\nPartant, ces certificats ne peuvent \u00eatre re\u00e7us pour affecter le sens de ce qui a fait la base du contrat, savoir, les r\u00e9ponses de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'interrogatoire de l'appelante.\nSur les autres points de d\u00e9fense de l'appelante, je ne puis non plus concourir en sa faveur. Ainsi, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que lors de l'\u00e9mission de la police d'assurance, son employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait en d\u00e9ficit; que ce fait non seulement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, mais elle aurait affirm\u00e9 le contraire.\nD'abord est-il bien prouv\u00e9 que Shortt \u00e9tait en d\u00e9ficit dans ses comptes avec l'intim\u00e9e, en 1914? La chose est probable; cependant, on peut douter que la preuve soit formelle sur ce point, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e la mani\u00e8re de Shortt de faire ses rapports mensuels \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il y eut des retards chez les assur\u00e9s \u00e0 lui payer leurs primes d'assurance, et la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il e\u00fbt des sommes d'argents qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans d'autres banques.\nL'intim\u00e9e n'avait qu'\u00e0 garantir sa connaissance personnelle des faits de Shortt, au moment o\u00f9 elle faisait son application. J'ai donn\u00e9 plus haut mon opinion sur ce point.\nL'appelante a soutenu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas prouv\u00e9 que le d\u00e9ficit, au sujet duquel l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame le montant de la police, \u00e9tait pour les primes des mois de l'ann\u00e9e sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dans son action.\nDans mon opinion, et apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 beaucoup d'attention \u00e0 ce moyen, cette pr\u00e9tention ne peut \u00eatre maintenue.\nQuant au dernier moyen soulev\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir, que tel d\u00e9ficit ne constituait pas une fraude pr\u00e9vue dans la police et pour laquelle l'appelante \u00e9tait responsable, je suis absolument de l'opinion contraire.\nJe suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vipond & Vipond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fleet, Falconer, Phelan & Bovey.\n[1] 9 App. Cas. 671.\n[2] [1908] 2 K.B. 863 at pp. 885-6.\n[3] 51 Can.

C.C.\nThe pipes, poles, wires and transformers included in an electric lighting system erected in, and on, the public streets of a municipality are immovables. (B\u00e9lair v. Ste. Rose, 63 Can. S.C.R. 526 and Montreal L.H. & P. Cons. v. City of Westmount, [1926] S.C.R. 515, foll.); and the registration upon them of a memorial (bordereau) to preserve a vendor\u2019s lien is not illegal nor void.\nThey do not cease to be immovables because these pipes, poles, wires and transformers have been sold separately from the generators in and on the property of the vendor for the purpose of being connected with other generators belonging to the buyer.\nThe express stipulation of a vendor\u2019s privilege on some of the equipment and machinery sold does not result in the exclusion of the other things sold from the purview of the privilege prescribed by the code.\u2014 A vendor\u2019s lien is created by law (Arts. 1983, 2009, 2014 C.C.) and it is not essential to reserve it in the conveyance. The vendor can waive it, but his intention to do so must expressly appear from the deed of sale.\nA vendor\u2019s lien resulting from the sale of an electric lighting plant can be registered by indicating in the memorial (bordereau) the cadastral numbers of the lots upon which the poles, etc., are erected, although the land itself is not hypothecated or cannot be hypothecated, as for instance in this case where these lots are public streets.\u2014Nothing in the Civil Code definition of a lien (Art. 1983 C.C.) or of a hypothec (Art. 2016 C.C.) is opposed to its affecting only a structure independently from the soil on which it stands; and it does not matter that the soil is municipal land and, as such, inalienable.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Letellier J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nLouis St. Laurent K.C., for the appellant.\nFerdinand Roy K.C., for the respondent. Under a by-law adopted by the municipal council of Mont-Joli on the 7th December, 1908, the Foundry and Machine Company obtained the exclusive right to install and operate lighting systems in the municipality. On the 26th April, 1915, the liquidator of that company then insolvent sold the plant to L. who, on, the 7th October, 1915, sold it to R. for $20,000. In this last conveyance was included a lot of land with the \u201cbuildings thereon, the plant and machinery in the buildings or on the said land***.\u201d The deed also contained the following covenant: \u201cThe equipment and machinery attached to the buildings sold or being situated in such buildings as well as all future improvements thereto shall be subject to a vendor\u2019s lien to guarantee the payment of the balance of the purchase price of the vendor.\u201d R. operated the franchise until the 24th August, 1923, when he sold the entire plant to the appellant company, except machinery, poles, wires and transformers situated on R.\u2019s property; but the deed was not registered until the 25th September, 1923. On the previous day, L. had registered a memorial (bordereau), setting out the conveyance of the electric system from him to R. and declaring that $8,000 of the purchase price was still owing and that this sum was protected at law by a vendor\u2019s lien covering the land as well as all the machinery and equipment and including the poles, wires and transformers in the streets of Mont-Joli. The memorial then proceeded to describe by the lot and plan number each of the streets in which were installed the electric system and requested the registration against them of the vendor\u2019s lien. Upon the respondent\u2019s refusal to discharge this registration, the appellant, instituted the present action for a declaration that the lien was illegal, null and void.\nLouis St. Laurent K.C., for the appellant. The poles, wires and transformers did not become immovable by their nature because of being assembled together in a line for the transmission or distribution of electricity for lighting purposes.\nThese poles, lines and transformers were not permanently attached as a dependency of the electric generator and gasoline engine in R.\u2019s foundry but only temporarily attached thereto. The parties themselves by their agreement treated these poles, lines and transformers as things to which the vendor\u2019s hypothecary lien did not attach.\nThe principal question to be decided is as to whether this transmission line is governed by articles 376 and 377 or by articles 379 and 380 of the Civil Code. If the material entering into a transmission line and the assembling thereof, is apt to make the result a building within the terms of article 376, then the matter may be concluded against the appellant by the decision of this court in B\u00e9lair and The town of Ste. Rose[1]. If, on the other hand, such material, poles, wires and transformers are only apt to become immovable by destination when placed on real property for a permanency or incorporated therewith, then they would not have become such an immovable, because the real property on which they had become incorporated was not owned by the original vendor nor by R., but was owned by the municipal corporation. (La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. Waterous Engine Works Company).[2]\nFerdinand Roy K.C., for the respondent. The deed of sale by L. to R. has created explicitly or at least implicitly a vendor\u2019s lien on the electric distribution line. (Arts. 2009 (8) and 2014 C.C.).\nThe electric lighting plant, composed of a series of poles planted in the ground, supporting wires which bind them together as a whole, with transformers and other accessories, is an immovable and subject to the constitution of a mortgage.\nThe registration of the vendor\u2019s lien as made by the respondent is regular and legal.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin, C.J. C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret J.J.) was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Ce litige a trait au \u201cr\u00e9seau d\u2019installation pour distribuer la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique au village de Mont-Joli\u201d. Pour l\u2019intelligence de la cause, il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire d\u2019abord l\u2019historique des contrats dont ce r\u00e9seau a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit en vertu d\u2019un r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9, par le conseil municipal de Mont-Joli le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1908. Par l\u00e0, la Compagnie de Fonderie et Machineries, Limit\u00e9e, obtenait\nles droits exclusifs d\u2019installer et d\u2019exploiter des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9clairage dans le village de Mont-Joli.\nCe r\u00e8glement accordait \u201cle droit de passer et de faire des travaux dans la municipalit\u00e9\u201d; il octroyait m\u00eame (mais sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cet octroi il peut y avoir lieu \u00e0 des r\u00e9serves)\nles m\u00eames droits que la municipalit\u00e9 pour l\u2019obtention des terrains ou pouvoirs d\u2019eau n\u00e9cessaires au syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage projet\u00e9.\nLa municipalit\u00e9, cependant, conservait l\u2019option \u201cdans dix ans ou avant\u201d d\u2019acheter les syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9clairage en donnant au propri\u00e9taire\nune somme qui, mise \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 5%, donnera\u2019 autant que les syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9clairage en b\u00e9n\u00e9fice net.\nCe r\u00e8glement venait \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une r\u00e9solution en date du 5 octobre 1908 par laquelle la Compagnie de Fonderie et Machineries, Limit\u00e9e, avait \u00e9t\u00e9\nautoris\u00e9e \u00e0 poser des poteaux et fils dans les rues du village pour l\u2019installation de la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique, sauf dans les endroits o\u00f9 il est impossible de poser ces poteaux, et pourvu que ces travaux soient faits sous la surveillance du conseil municipal.\nLe 28 avril 1915, Joseph Dub\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 de liquidateur d\u00fbment nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie de Fonderie et Machineries, Limit\u00e9e, et autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet en vertu d\u2019une ordonnance de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Rimouski, a vendu ce r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 M. Arthur C. Landry.\nLe r\u00e8glement et l\u2019acte de vente dont il s\u2019agit sont invoqu\u00e9s et produits \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son plaidoyer par l\u2019Immeuble Landry, Limit\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelante, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, se contente de dire qu\u2019ils \u201cparlent par eux-m\u00eames et doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s suivant \u201cleur teneur\u201d. Mais elle n\u2019en attaque nullement la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 et elle ne prend nulle part de conclusions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Elle aurait d\u2019ailleurs mauvaise gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 le faire puisque c\u2019est, en somme, de ces deux documents qu\u2019elle tire elle-m\u00eame son propre titre.\nIl convient d\u2019ajouter tout de suite que la corporation du village de Mont-Joli n\u2019est nullement intervenue dans l\u2019action et que la validit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement municipal et de la cession du liquidateur n\u2019est donc en aucune fa\u00e7on soulev\u00e9e dans la cause.\nLe 7 octobre 1915, Arthur C. Landry a vendu le r\u00e9seau de distribution de lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique, avec garantie de droit, \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, pour le prix de $20,000.\nIl vendait en m\u00eame temps un terrain situ\u00e9 au village de Mont-Joli avec les\nb\u00e2tisses dessus construites, l\u2019outillage et machineries situ\u00e9s en les dites b\u00e2tisses ou sur le dit terrain * * * et l\u2019embranchement du chemin de fer Intercolonial courant sur le terrain.\nL\u2019acte contenait, en outre, la stipulation suivante:\nL\u2019outillage et machineries attach\u00e9s aux b\u00e2tisses vendues ou \u00e9tant situ\u00e9s dans telles b\u00e2tisses ainsi que toutes les am\u00e9liorations qui pourront \u00eatre faites dans le futur demeureront sp\u00e9cialement hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s par privil\u00e8ge de vendeur \u00e0 la garantie du paiement de la balance du prix de cette vente en faveur du vendeur.\nA la date de cette vente, le r\u00e8glement du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1908 ainsi que la r\u00e9solution qui l\u2019avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e9taient toujours en vigueur; et le droit de M. Landry d\u2019occuper les rues du village pour son r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique n\u2019est pas mis en doute.\nRouleau, Limit\u00e9e, ayant ainsi succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Landry, continua sans aucune contestation d\u2019occuper les rues de Mont-Joli avec les poteaux et les fils de son installation \u00e9lectrique et de fournir l\u2019\u00e9clairage au village et \u00e0 ses habitants jusqu\u2019au 24 ao\u00fbt 1923.\nPar acte qui porte la date du 24 ao\u00fbt 1923 mais qui ne fut enregistr\u00e9 que le 25 septembre 1923, Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, vendit \u00e0 l\u2019appelante\nle r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de dans le village de Mont-Joli et dont elle se sert actuellement pour \u00e9clairer le dit village et ses habitants, comprenant les poteaux, fils, services, transformateurs, compteurs et tous autres appareils et accessoires faisant partie du dit r\u00e9seau, lesquels se trouvent actuellement, partie dans les rues du dit village de Mont-Joli, et partie dans les magasins, r\u00e9sidences priv\u00e9es et autres \u00e9difices du m\u00eame endroit, et partie sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Rouleau, Lt\u00e9e, except\u00e9 toutefois les machines servant \u00e0 la production de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, ainsi que le poteau principal situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques pieds de l\u2019usine \u00e9lectrique, le transformateur fix\u00e9 \u00e8 ce poteau, et les fils reliant le dit transformateur au g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur se trouvant actuellement dans et sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e.\nToutefois, quant aux autres poteaux et fils se trouvant sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, la partie de la seconde part (l\u2019appelante) les enl\u00e8vera \u00e0 demande de la partie de la premi\u00e8re part (Rouleau Limit\u00e9e), apr\u00e8s avis de soixante jours. L\u2019acte d\u00e9clare que Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, vend \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019appelante\nmais sans d\u2019autres garanties que celles de ses faits et promesses, son \u2022 commerce d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique sous toutes ses formes dans le village de Mont-Joli et sa client\u00e8le en rapport avec le dit commerce, ainsi que tous les droits et privil\u00e8ges et franchises qu\u2019elle peut avoir \u00e0 cette fin de la corporation du village de Mont-Joli, sp\u00e9cialement ceux d\u00e9crits dans un r\u00e8glement de la corporation du dit village pass\u00e9 et adopt\u00e9 en date du 7 octobre 1915.\nCependant, le 24 septembre 1923 (et, par cons\u00e9quent, la veille du jour o\u00f9 l\u2019appelante faisait enregistrer le contrat que lui avait consenti Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e) l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019Immeuble Landry, Limit\u00e9e, cessionnaire de la succession de feu Arthur C. Landry, enregistrait un bordereau, dat\u00e9 du 22 septembre 1923, qui relatait l\u2019acte de vente du r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique du 7 octobre 1915 par Arthur C. Landry \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, et qui d\u00e9clarait qu\u2019il restait encore d\u00fb sur le prix de vente une somme de $8,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis le 1er septembre 1923 et que cette somme \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e en vertu de la loi par un privil\u00e8ge de bailleur de fonds qui affectait le terrain d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte de vente, ainsi que toutes les machineries, outillage et r\u00e9seau de distribution d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique se composant des poteaux, fils, transformateurs, liens et accessoires situ\u00e9s en les rues du village de Mont-Joli. Le bordereau proc\u00e9dait ensuite \u00e0 d\u00e9crire par les num\u00e9ros du cadastre officiel chacune des rues dans lesquelles \u00e9taient install\u00e9s les poteaux, fils, transformateurs, liens et accessoires du r\u00e9seau de distribution d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique et requ\u00e9rait sur iceux l\u2019enregistrement du privil\u00e8ge de vendeur r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019acte de vente consenti le 7 octobre 1915 par M. Arthur C. Landry \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e.\nD\u00e8s que l\u2019appelante s\u2019aper\u00e7ut de l\u2019enregistrement de ce bordereau, elle requit (le 6 octobre 1923) l\u2019Immeuble Landry, Limit\u00e9e, d\u2019avoir \u00e0 le faire radier sans d\u00e9lai; puis, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne se conformait pas \u00e0 cette mise en demeure, la pr\u00e9sente action fut institu\u00e9e concluant \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9claration contenue dans le bordereau f\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9e irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, ill\u00e9gale, nulle et de nul effet et que la cour en ordonn\u00e2t la radiation du bureau d\u2019enregistrement.\nCe sont l\u00e0 les faits. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi (sauf le dissentiment de l\u2019honorable juge Flynn) ont d\u00e9bout\u00e9 l\u2019appelante des fins de son action. Il y a eu, \u00e0 l\u2019audition devant cette cour, un incident au sujet d\u2019une question qui ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant les autres cours et \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019argumentation contenue dans les factums des parties ne faisait m\u00eame pas allusion.\nLe 7 octobre 1915 (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le jour o\u00f9 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, acqu\u00e9rait le r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique d\u2019Arthur C. Landry) le conseil municipal du village de Mont-Joli aurait adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit et qui n\u2019est pas au dossier, par lequel il aurait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, une exemption de taxes municipales g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ou sp\u00e9ciales entre autres\npour son syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique pour une p\u00e9riode de vingt ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 1915\net un droit exclusif de\npassage et d\u2019usage des rues et places publiques de la municipalit\u00e9 pour y installer son syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 l\u2019usage des habitants de la municipalit\u00e9.\nLe 19 ao\u00fbt 1920, Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, \u00e9crivait \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 raison du co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 du charbon et de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, le taux d\u2019\u00e9clairage aux termes du contrat qu\u2019il avait avec la municipalit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre hauss\u00e9. Par une r\u00e9solution en date du 2 novembre 1920, le conseil municipal s\u2019est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pr\u00eat \u00e0 accorder cette augmentation si Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, s\u2019engageait \u00e0 fournir continuellement un courant de 110 volts. Cette condition ne fut pas accept\u00e9e, et Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, continua \u00e0 fournir l\u2019\u00e9clairage jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de sa vente \u00e0 The Lower St. Lawrence Power Company (l\u2019appelante actuelle).\nLa corporation du village de Mont-Joli aurait alors saisi la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec d\u2019une requ\u00eate par laquelle elle demandait \u00e0 cette commission d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 The Lower St. Lawrence Power Company d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le contrat qui serait intervenu entre la corporation de Mont-Joli et Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, l\u2019auteur de l\u2019appelante. Le 2 mai 1924, la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9mit une ordonnance au sujet de cette requ\u00eate. Une copie de cette ordonnance est au dossier, bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas bien facile de comprendre comment elle peut s\u2019y trouver. C\u2019est de cette copie que nous avons tir\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit des faits que nous venons de relater quant \u00e0 l\u2019incident soulev\u00e9 ici. Or, cette ordonnance constaterait que, par son r\u00e8glement du 7 octobre 1915, la municipalit\u00e9 du village de Mont-Joli aurait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, une franchise de plus de dix ann\u00e9es pour l\u2019exploitation de son syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et que, contrairement \u00e0 la loi (S.R.Q. 5917 et suiv.), ce r\u00e8glement n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 l\u2019approbation des \u00e9lecteurs municipaux dans les trois mois de sa passation par le conseil. Il serait donc frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 et il n\u2019aurait jamais eu ni force ni effet. D\u2019o\u00f9 la Commission des Services Publics d\u00e9duit qu\u2019il ne saurait \u00eatre r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de ce r\u00e8glement un contrat valide; et, en cons\u00e9quence, elle a refus\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019appelante actuelle, successeur de Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un contrat qu\u2019elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme inexistant.\nL\u2019appelante a profit\u00e9 de cette ordonnance pour soulever devant cette cour la pr\u00e9tention que le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage dont elle est actuellement propri\u00e9taire est donc install\u00e9 sans droit dans les rues du village de Mont-Joli. Elle a ainsi invoqu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tendue irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de sa propre situation. Il r\u00e9sulterait de l\u2019ordonnnace de la Commission que son occupation des rues de Mont-Joli est pr\u00e9caire; par suite, d\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, le r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique n\u2019aurait donc pas le caract\u00e8re immobilier.\nNous anticipons sur l\u2019un des points de droit qui se soul\u00e8vent dans cette cause; mais nous pensons qu\u2019il faut d\u00e8s l\u2019abord \u00e9lucider ce point invoqu\u00e9 devant nous pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans cette cause. Nous ne croyons pas que l\u2019appelante puisse s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir. Dans notre opinion, la copie de l\u2019ordonnance de la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec est irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au dossier. Cette ordonnance ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019Immeuble Landry, Limit\u00e9e, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie aux proc\u00e9dures devant la Commission.\nEn plus, la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sence dans les rues de Mont-Joli des poteaux, fils, transformateurs et accessoires du r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique n\u2019est pas en discussion dans cette cause. Cette question n\u2019est pas pos\u00e9e, soit dans les plaidoiries \u00e9crites, soit dans le litige entre les parties. Ce r\u00e8glement du 7 octobre 1915 n\u2019est pas m\u00eame mentionn\u00e9. La production au dossier de l\u2019ordonnance de la commission n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et ne peut pas se justifier. Pour les fins de la cause qui est devant nous, il suffit de savoir que M. Arthur C. Landry (aux droits de qui a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019Immeuble Landry, Limit\u00e9e), lorsqu\u2019il a consenti \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, l\u2019acte de vente du 7 octobre 1915, avait le droit, pour le r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique qu\u2019il vendait, d\u2019occuper les rues de Mont-Joli. Cela n\u2019est pas mis en doute. Mais la r\u00e9solution du 5 octobre et le r\u00e8glement du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1908 en font foi. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de cette vente qu\u2019il faut se placer pour discuter la question qui se soul\u00e8ve en cette cause de savoir si le r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique avait alors un caract\u00e8re mobilier ou immobilier et si le privil\u00e8ge de vendeur de Landry affectait un meuble ou un immeuble. Depuis lors, le syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectrique est demeur\u00e9 dans les rues de Mont-Joli; il y est encore; il fournit encore l\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e0 Mont-Joli; et nous ne savons m\u00eame pas, vu qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas au dossier, si le r\u00e8glement du 7 d\u00e9cembre 1915 avait pour but d\u2019abroger celui de 1908 ou s\u2019il se contentait d\u2019accorder \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, un suppl\u00e9ment de pouvoirs et d\u2019avantages. Nous consid\u00e9rons donc que nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 tenir compte, pour les fins de notre d\u00e9cision, de l\u2019ordonnance de la Commision des Services Publics en date du 2 mai 1924.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se pr\u00e9sente est celle de savoir si Arthur C. Landry, par suite de la vente qu\u2019il a consentie le 7 octobre 1915 \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, a acquis sur le r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique un privil\u00e8ge pour toute balance qui lui restait due sur le prix. Pour pr\u00e9tendre le contraire, l\u2019appelante s\u2019appuie d\u2019abord sur la dissidence de l\u2019honorable juge Flynn en Cour du Banc du Roi.\nOn se rappelle que l\u2019acte de vente contient une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale par laquelle\nl\u2019outillage et machineries attach\u00e9s aux b\u00e2tisses vendues ou \u00e9tant situ\u00e9s dans telles b\u00e2tisses ainsi que toutes les am\u00e9liorations qui pourront \u00eatre faites dans le futur demeureront sp\u00e9cialement hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s par privil\u00e8ge de vendeur \u00e0 la garantie du paiement de la balance du prix de cette vente en faveur du vendeur.\nA cause de cette mention particuli\u00e8re, et par application de la r\u00e8gle Inclusio unius fit exclusio alterius, l\u2019on veut que cette stipulation sp\u00e9ciale d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge sur quelques-unes des choses qui ont fait l\u2019objet de la vente ait pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019exclure le privil\u00e8ge du vendeur sur les autres.\nNous ne le croyons pas. Le privil\u00e8ge du vendeur r\u00e9sulte de la loi (arts. 1983, 2009 et 2014, C.C.). Pour le moment, nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous occuper du caract\u00e8re du droit immobilier c\u00e9d\u00e9 par le contrat.\nLe privil\u00e8ge prend naissance toutes les fois qu\u2019il y a vente d\u2019un immeuble, sans distinguer s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un immeuble par nature ou d\u2019un droit immobilier, vente d\u2019un usufruit ou d\u2019une action immobilis\u00e9e de la Banque de France, constitution d\u2019une servitude, cession de la mitoyennet\u00e9 d\u2019un mur de s\u00e9paration. (Colin & Capitant, 3e \u00e9d. vol. 2, p. 841).\nIl n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de le stipuler dans l\u2019acte de vente. Sans doute, le vendeur peut y renoncer; mais on ne peut d\u00e9duire cette intention du seul fait de l\u2019absence de stipulation ou de la mention sp\u00e9ciale de quelques-uns des objets vendus. Il aurait fallu une d\u00e9claration expresse pour que le privil\u00e8ge du vendeur f\u00fbt exclu.\nIl suffit d\u2019ailleurs de bien examiner la clause sp\u00e9ciale du privil\u00e8ge. Elle ne parle que de l\u2019outillage et des machineries attach\u00e9s aux b\u00e2tisses vendues. Elle n\u2019inclut m\u00eame pas le terrain sur lequel ces b\u00e2tisses sont situ\u00e9es, ni d\u2019ailleurs ces b\u00e2tisses elles-m\u00eames. Personne ne songerait \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre cependant que les parties, par la mention sp\u00e9ciale de l\u2019outillage et des machineries, ont voulu exclure le terrain et les b\u00e2tisses du privil\u00e8ge du vendeur. Il para\u00eet clair que leur stipulation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour \u00e9carter le doute si l\u2019outillage et les machineries attach\u00e9s aux b\u00e2tisses vendues seraient affect\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge du vendeur et l\u2019on a fait une disposition sp\u00e9ciale pour ce cas particulier, sans que pour cela le privil\u00e8ge soit restreint aux seuls cas ainsi exprim\u00e9s. Il y a lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1021 du code civil.\nIl est donc r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de la vente du r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique un privil\u00e8ge en faveur de Landry et le contrat ne comporte pas de renonciation implicite \u00e0 ce privil\u00e8ge. Encore moins en contient-il l\u2019exclusion.\nMais \u2014 c\u2019est la seconde question et c\u2019est la plus importante de la cause \u2014 est-ce un privil\u00e8ge sur un meuble ou un privil\u00e8ge sur un immeuble?\nLa r\u00e9ponse est n\u00e9cessaire pour la solution de cette cause, puisque le r\u00e9seau a depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelante qui l\u2019a pay\u00e9 comptant et en a pris possession (art. 199 C.C.); et \u00e9galement parce que, si le r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique est un meuble, l\u2019enregistrement du bordereau qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour conserver son privil\u00e8ge est irr\u00e9gulier et inefficace. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique \u00e9tait un immeuble, et nous nous rangeons de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nNous devons, tout d\u2019abord, r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 un arr\u00eat de cette cour qui pr\u00e9sente avec la cause actuelle certains points d\u2019analogie. C\u2019est celui de B\u00e9lair v. La Ville de Sainte-Rose[3]. Par un statut du Bas-Canada de 1830, un nomm\u00e9 James Porteous, dont B\u00e9lair \u00e9tait le cessionnaire, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par la Couronne \u00e0 \u00e9riger un pont de p\u00e9age qui traversait la rivi\u00e8re entre la ville de Sainte-Rose et la paroisse de Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. La Couronne s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir ce pont au bout de cinquante ans en en payant la valeur. La ville prit une action pour recouvrer des taxes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es sur une partie du pont.\nIl y fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le pont, dans ces circonstances, devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un immeuble au sens de l\u2019article 5730 de la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. L\u2019honorable juge Anglin, maintenant juge-en-chef de cette cour, \u00e9tudie, dans ses notes, la port\u00e9e du mot \u201cimmeubles\u201d dans le titre \u201cDe la distinction des biens\u201d, au code civil, et constate que le mot \u201cb\u00e2timents\u201d de l\u2019article 376 C.C. y est employ\u00e9 dans le sens de \u201cstructures\u201d; puis, s\u2019appuyant sur Demolombe (vol. 9, n\u00b0 128), Aubry & Rau (vol. 2, n\u00b0 164) et Hue (vol 4, n\u00b0 9), il ajoute qu\u2019il importe peu que les \u201cconstructions\u201d, pourvu qu\u2019elles soient incorpor\u00e9es au sol, aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9es par le propri\u00e9taire du sol ou par un tiers.\nBien que l\u2019on ne trouve pas, dans les opinions \u00e9crites par les autres juges, de mention expresse de ces deux propositions, il est \u00e9vident que la cour devait n\u00e9cessairement les accepter pour en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le pont en question \u00e9tait un immeuble imposable.\nEn vertu du code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tous les biens, tant corporels qu\u2019incorporels, sont meubles ou immeubles (art. 374 C.C). Les fonds de terre et les b\u00e2timents sont immeubles par leur nature (art. 376 C.C.). Les commentateurs sont d\u2019accord pour dire que l\u2019expression \u201cb\u00e2timents\u201d ne doit pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 son sens \u00e9tymologique, mais qu\u2019il faut l\u2019employer par analogie \u00e0 toute esp\u00e8ce de \u201cconstruction\u201d.\nPlaniol (Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire \u2014 6e \u00e9d., vol. 1, n\u00b0 2207) r\u00e9sume bien l\u2019opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en disant qu\u2019il faut comprendre non-seulement les b\u00e2timents proprement dits, tels que les maisons d\u2019habitation, magasins, ateliers, hangars, granges, etc., mais aussi les travaux d\u2019art de toute esp\u00e8ce, tels que ponts, puits, fours, digues, barrages, tunnels, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut d\u00e9finir ici les \u00e9difices: tout assemblage de mat\u00e9riaux consolid\u00e9s \u00e0 demeure, soit \u00e0 la surface du sol, soit \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur.\nCette d\u00e9finition peut comprendre le r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique vendu par Landry \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, compos\u00e9 de piliers ou poteaux enfonc\u00e9s dans le sol, reli\u00e9s par des fils, auxquels sont attach\u00e9s des transformateurs, liens et autres accessoires situ\u00e9s dans les rues publiques, et qui s\u2019identifient et ne forment qu\u2019un seul tout, constituant une construction consolid\u00e9e \u00e0 demeure et faisant corps avec le sol. (Laurent, vol. V, n08 408, 409 et 411).\nIl pr\u00e9sente par l\u00e0 tous les caract\u00e8res d\u2019un immeuble par nature.\nLa question vient pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, car elle ne se posait pas dans The Town of Westmount v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[4] Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 simplement de d\u00e9cider si la charte de Westmount, qui autorisait la taxation de \u201ctout terrain, lot de ville ou portion de lot\u201d pouvait permettre \u00e0 cette ville d\u2019imposer, sous ces d\u00e9nominations, une taxe sur le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9nergie et d\u2019\u00e9clairage au gaz et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie et d\u00e9crit au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u201cgas mains and equipment, poles, transformers, wires, etc.\u201d\u2014 Il y fut jug\u00e9 dans la n\u00e9gative; et c\u2019est l\u00e0 tout ce que comporte ce jugement. Aussi est-ce \u00e0 tort qu\u2019on l\u2019a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment dans l\u2019arr\u00eat re Village de Pierreville v. Bell Telephone Co.[5] qui, pour cette raison, ne saurait entrer ici en ligne de compte.\nAu contraire, les quelques allusions \u00e0 la question qui nous occupe maintenant faites par Sir Charles Fitzpatrick (p. 367) et par les juges Idington (p. 371) et Anglin (p. 384), au cours des notes qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9crites, indiquent plut\u00f4t qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que le r\u00e9seau de distribution de la Montreal Light, Heat & Power Company \u00e9tait un immeuble; mais ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas alors appel\u00e9s \u00e0 en d\u00e9cider.\nIl faut \u00e9galement \u00e9laguer l\u2019arr\u00eat dans la cause de La Municipalit\u00e9 Scolaire de Sainte-Cun\u00e9gonde v. The Montreal Water & Power Company[6] o\u00f9 le juge Laurendeau d\u00e9cide que les tuyaux pos\u00e9s sous terre, dans les rues publiques, par une compagnie d\u2019aqueduc, ne sont pas des bien-fonds au sens du paragraphe 16 de l\u2019article 2521 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1909, et n\u2019\u00e9taient pas imposables pour fins scolaires en vertu de la loi telle qu\u2019elle existait alors (8 mars 1912). C\u2019est une question du m\u00eame genre qui est tranch\u00e9e dans la cause de Montreal Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Village de Chambly Bassin.[7]\nDans chacun de ces arr\u00eats, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter un statut sp\u00e9cial et de d\u00e9cider si un r\u00e9seau de distribution d\u2019eau, de gaz ou d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 pouvait \u00eatre classifi\u00e9 dans l\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories de biens que la corporation scolaire ou municipale avait le droit de taxer en vertu des pouvoirs restreints conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le statut qui la r\u00e9gissait. Tel n\u2019est pas ici le point en litige.\nMais le juge Tait en a fait une \u00e9tude tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9e dans la cause de Sherbrooke Gas and Water Co. v. City of Sherbrooke[8], de m\u00eame que le juge White dans une cause de The Bell Telephone Co. v. The Corporation of Ascot[9]. Tous deux ont jug\u00e9 qu\u2019un syst\u00e8me de canalisation (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour l\u2019eau ou pour le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone), comme celui qui a fait l\u2019objet de la vente de Landry \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme immeuble par nature.\nUn instant la jurisprudence du Qu\u00e9bec a paru incliner dans une direction contraire (The Town of Cookshire v. The Canadian Telephone Co.,[10]; The Bell Telephone Co. v. La cit\u00e9 de Hull[11]; mais elle n\u2019a pas tard\u00e9 \u00e0 revenir \u00e0 son point de d\u00e9part et, plus r\u00e9cemment, la premi\u00e8re opinion a pr\u00e9valu dans les jugements tr\u00e8s \u00e9tudi\u00e9s re Cit\u00e9 de Westmount v. Montreal Light, Heat & Power Coy. du juge de Lorimier[12] et de la Cour du Banc du Roi[13] (r\u00e9serve faite pour les compteurs ainsi qu\u2019il est expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour Supr\u00eame rendu \u00e0 la m\u00eame date que le pr\u00e9sent jugement)[14], auxquels sont venus s\u2019adjoindre ceux, non moins fortement raisonn\u00e9s, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans la pr\u00e9sente cause[15]. Les deux principales objections que l\u2019on oppose \u00e0 l\u2019opinion des r\u00e9seaux de ce genre sont des immeubles, celles qui ont pr\u00e9valu dans les arr\u00eats qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la n\u00e9gative et celles que l\u2019on a fait valoir de nouveau au cours de l\u2019argumentation devant cette cour, sont les suivantes:\n1. Ces r\u00e9seaux (poteaux, fils, etc.) ne sont pas immeubles par nature, parce qu\u2019ils ne sont pas fix\u00e9s \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure;\n2. Ils ne sont pas immeubles par destination, parce qu\u2019ils he sont pas incorpor\u00e9s au fonds de terre par le propri\u00e9taire de ce fonds.\nNous croyons que ni l\u2019une, ni l\u2019autre de ces objections ne peut trouver d\u2019appui soit dans la doctrine, soit dans la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise qui est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter des textes \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 ceux du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des commentateurs enseigne qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la construction, pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme immeuble par nature, soit fix\u00e9e au sol \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. Il suffit que l\u2019incorporation ne soit pas purement passag\u00e8re et accidentelle. C\u2019est le fait de rattachement au sol que la loi consid\u00e8re. La condition de rigueur est que \u201cla construction, quelle qu\u2019elle soit, fasse corps avec le sol\u201d; qu\u2019elle y soit \u201ccoh\u00e9rente\u201d, suivant l\u2019expression de Pothier, ou \u201cadh\u00e9rente\u201d, suivant celle de Laurent. C\u2019est toujours la r\u00e8gle: Quod solo ineadificatur, solo cedit. Nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons \u00e0 Laurent, 5e \u00e9d., vol. V, n08 406 \u00e0 411; Pla-niol, 6e \u00e9d., vol. I, n08 2203, 2207 \u00e0 2209; Beaudry-Lacan-tinerie, 3e \u00e9d. Des Biens, n08 25 et 26; Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., vol. II, pp. 6 et 7; Colin et Capitant, 4e \u00e9d., vol. I, p. 680 et 681.\nDe m\u00eame, les b\u00e2timents ou autres ouvrages unis au sol sont immeubles par leur nature, qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 construits par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds ou par un tiers possesseur; et ce, dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 le tiers constructeur se serait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 de les d\u00e9molir lors de la cessation de sa jouissance. Nous ne pouvons faire mieux sur ce point que de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., vol. II, p. 7, et \u00e0 la note 6 qui s\u2019y trouve, ainsi qu\u2019aux auteurs et arr\u00eats qui y sont cit\u00e9s, \u00e0 Laurent, vol. V, n08 412 \u00e0 416, 432; Beaudry-Lacantinerie, des Biens, n\u00b0 27; Planiol, vol. I, n\u00b0 2208; Colin et Capitant, vol. I, p. 681. Il n\u2019y a pas \u00e0 rechercher,\n(dit Domolombe, vol. 9. n\u00b0 104),\npar qui, ni aux frais de qui, ni avec quels mat\u00e9riaux le b\u00e2timent ou le travail quelconque a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; par le propri\u00e9taire lui-m\u00eame du sol, ou par un fermier, un locataire ou un tiers possesseur. Le b\u00e2timent, une fois construit, est immeuble par sa nature, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re absolue et ind\u00e9pendamment de la qualit\u00e9 du constructeur. Sans doute, lorsque le propri\u00e9taire construit sur son terrain avec les mat\u00e9riaux d\u2019autrui, ou lorsqu\u2019un tiers construit sur le terrain d\u2019un autre avec ses propres mat\u00e9riaux, il y a lieu, de part et d\u2019autre, \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement; et nous verrons qu\u2019en effet le code Napol\u00e9on a pr\u00e9vu cette double hypoth\u00e8se. Mais quant \u00e0 la qualification du b\u00e2timent lui-m\u00eame, sous le rapport de sa nature immobili\u00e8re, le principe demeure toujours, et dans tous les cas, le m\u00eame.\nIl convient de compl\u00e9ter par une citation de Beaudry-Lacantinerie (des Biens, n\u00b0 40 in fine):\nL\u2019hypoth\u00e8se se pr\u00e9sente assez souvent en pratique pour les constructions et b\u00e2timents \u00e9lev\u00e9s en vertu d\u2019une permission administrative sur des terrains d\u00e9pendants du domaine public; ces \u00e9difices sont immeubles, tant que l\u2019incorporation subsiste et ils sont immeubles vis-\u00e0-vis du constructeur qui a obtenu l\u2019autorisation voulu (Cass. 10 avril 1867, S. 67.1. 277; D. 67.1.397).\nNous tenions \u00e0 mentionner ce passage qui s\u2019applique particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, o\u00f9 les poteaux et fils sont plac\u00e9s dans les rues de la municipalit\u00e9. Et c\u2019est, en somme, la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle cette cour \u00e9tait elle-m\u00eame arriv\u00e9e dans la cause de B\u00e9lair v. Ville de Sainte-Rose[16].\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence de la Cour de Cassation de France, \u201cc\u2019est le fait actuel qui d\u00e9cide si une chose est\u201d mobili\u00e8re ou immobili\u00e8re\u201d (Dalloz 1861.1.225; 1867.1. 398); et il n\u2019importe pas que le droit en vertu duquel elle se trouve adh\u00e9rente au sol soit r\u00e9soluble.\nLes principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que nous venons d\u2019exposer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s aux \u201ctuyaux de canalisation souterraine, * * * bien \u201cqu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par un possesseur \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9- \u201ccaire au lieu de l\u2019\u00eatre par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds\u201d (Cass., Comp. G\u00e9n. des Eaux, S.P. 1900.1.446), aux \u201cconduites \u201cd\u2019eau plac\u00e9es dans le sol des voies d\u2019une commune par une \u201csoci\u00e9t\u00e9 concessionnaire pour la distribution de l\u2019eau aux \u201chabitants\u201d (Cass. S. 91.1.488, Cie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Octroi de Clichy), aux \u201cconduites destin\u00e9es \u00e0 amener le \u201cgaz au dehors de l\u2019usine et passant sous les voies publi-\u201cques et priv\u00e9es\u201d (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Biens, n\u00b0 135); \u00e9t \u201cil n\u2019est pas douteux qu\u2019il faut assimiler aux \u201ccanalisations d\u2019eau (les seules auxquelles on pouvait pen-\u201cser lors de la codification de nos lois) celles de gaz et celles \u201cd\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\u201d (Planiol, vol. I, n\u00b0 2209; Colin et Capitant, vol. I, p. 681; Ville de Dijon c. Compagnie des Eaux, D. 1902.1.492).\nC\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019une construction \u00e9lev\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9pendance du domaine public, en vertu d\u2019une permission essentiellement temporaire et r\u00e9vocable, a le caract\u00e8re d\u2019immeuble (Dalloz, Dict. de Droit, vo. Biens, no. 3 (et) les tuyaux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la canalisation d\u2019eau et de gaz \u00e9tablis sous les voies publiques sont immeubles par nature (Dalloz\u2014Dict. de Droit, vo. Biens, no. 4).\nLe r\u00e9seau d\u2019installation pour distribuer la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique au village de Mont-Joli vendu par Landry \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, \u00e9tait donc un immeuble lors de cette vente et, vu que son adh\u00e9rence au sol a toujours subsist\u00e9 depuis, il est demeur\u00e9 immeuble jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour. Il n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre immeuble parce que les poteaux, fils, transformateurs et accessoires situ\u00e9s dans les rues de Mont-Joli ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9s des\nmachines servant \u00e0 la production de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 * * * se trouvant * * * dans et sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e,\npour \u00eatre reli\u00e9s aux machines g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique appartenant \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Au point de vue des principes \u00e9tablis plus haut, cette modification n\u2019a pu affecter le caract\u00e8re immobilier du r\u00e9seau. Ce r\u00e9seau, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019opinion la plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, est un immeuble par lui-m\u00eame, en tant que construction adh\u00e9rente au sol, et non pas seulement comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de l\u2019usine g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\nDe plus, cette s\u00e9paration du r\u00e9seau d\u2019avec l\u2019usine, caus\u00e9e par la vente \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, ne donne pas ouverture, comme l\u2019appelante l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu, aux recours pr\u00e9vus par les articles 2054 et 2055 du code civil. Ces recours sont limit\u00e9s au cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur ou le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur \u201cd\u00e9t\u00e9riore\u201d un immeuble grev\u00e9 de privil\u00e8ge ou d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, \u201cdans la vue de \u201cfrauder\u201d le cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire.\nIci, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une vente ordinaire. Le privil\u00e8ge ou l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que ne d\u00e9pouille pas le d\u00e9biteur ou le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur de son droit de propri\u00e9taire. Il peut ali\u00e9ner la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (art. 2053 C.C.), sauf qu\u2019elle reste sujette au privilege ou \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que. Si, comme dans le cas actuel, une partie seulement de l\u2019immeuble est vendue, le privil\u00e8ge reste indivisible et subsiste en entier sur chaque partie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e (arts. 2017, 2058 C.C.). Nous ne voyons pas quelle distinction on peut faire, sous ce rapport, entre le cas actuel et celui de la vente de partie d\u2019une terre hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e.\nMais il se pose une troisi\u00e8me question, et l\u2019on dit: M\u00eame si ce r\u00e9seau est un immeuble, il n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 ni, par cons\u00e9quent, d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 par un privil\u00e8ge immobilier, parce qu\u2019on ne saurait admettre un tel privil\u00e8ge ou une hypoth\u00e8que sur une construction ind\u00e9pendamment du sol, et que, en plus, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le sol est la rue municipale, soit un domaine public inali\u00e9nable.\nCette pr\u00e9tention pourrait s\u2019appuyer sur Laurent (vol. 30, n08 214 et 215). Mais cet auteur d\u00e9clare lui-m\u00eame que son\nopinion est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s isol\u00e9e * * * La jurisprudence est contraire ainsi que la doctrine (Vol. 30, no. 216).\nRien dans la d\u00e9finition donn\u00e9e par le Code du privil\u00e8ge (art. 1983, C.C.) ou de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que (art. 2016, C.C.) ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre n\u2019affecte que la construction, sans affecter le sol sur lequel elle est \u00e9difi\u00e9e.\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, on peut dire que tous les biens immobiliers sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre donn\u00e9s en hypoth\u00e8ques, pourvu qu\u2019ils soient dans le commerce et qu\u2019ils soient saisissables (Planiol, vol. II, n08 2718, 2721; Colin et Capitant, vol. II, p. 887; R\u00e9millard v. Duval[17].\nLes b\u00e2timents sont donc immeubles, (dit Pont, Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques, vol. I, no. 359, p. 352) aussi bien lorsqu\u2019ils sont l\u2019oeuvre du propri\u00e9taire du sol que lorsqu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construits par un autre, et par suite ils sont susceptibles d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que.\n(Voir \u00e9galement le m\u00eame auteur\u2014vol. II, n\u00b0 634.)\nDans les Codes annot\u00e9s de Sirey (3e \u00e9d., 1892), sous l\u2019art. 518 du Code Civil, on trouve la note suivante, qui r\u00e9sume bien la situation:\nNo. 15.\u2014Les constructions \u00e9lev\u00e9es sur un terrain d\u00e9pendant du domaine public, en vertu d\u2019une permission de l\u2019administration, constituent, bien que cette permission soit r\u00e9vocable, des immeubles qui peuvent \u00eatre valablement transmis, hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s et saisis comme tels, sous la condition r\u00e9solutoire de la r\u00e9vocation de la permission. Cass. 10 avril 1867, S. 67.1. 277. P. 67.1.728.\u2014D. 67.1.397.\u2014Sic Pont, Priv. et Hypoth., n. 350.\nCela est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2038 du Code Civil. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que\ndes constructions \u00e9lev\u00e9es par un locataire peuvent \u00eatre frapp\u00e9es d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques du chef du locataire, sous la condition r\u00e9solutoire de la d\u00e9molition \u00e0 la fin du bail.\n(Turge vs Hospices civils de Lyon)[18].\net cet arr\u00eat fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Cassation[19].\nLe propri\u00e9taire des constructions \u00e9difi\u00e9es sur un terrain qui appartient \u00e0 autrui (dit Colin & Capitant, 3e \u00e9d. vol. II, p. 887) par exemple, le locataire jouissant d\u2019un long bail, peut certainement hypoth\u00e9quer les constructions par lui faites (Gand, 29 mai 1895, D.P. 97.2.218). Mais ce droit d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que s\u2019\u00e9teindra avec le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du constituant (Paris, 8 f\u00e9vrier 1892, D.P. 92.2.409, note de M. Planiol). De m\u00eame, une canalisation destin\u00e9e \u00e0 amener les eaux d\u2019un torrent \u00e0 une usine pour produire une force \u00e9lectrique, est un immeuble par nature susceptible d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que (cf. Grenoble, 16 juin 1904, D.P. 1906.2.209, note de M. Planiol).\nEt m\u00eame le locataire d\u2019un terrain faisant partie du domaine communal, et plac\u00e9 hors du commerce par sa destination publique, peut hypoth\u00e9quer la construction qu\u2019il y a \u00e9lev\u00e9e avec l\u2019autorisation de la municipalit\u00e9 (D.P. 1866. 2.94).\nIl suit de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que le privil\u00e8ge immobilier de Arthur C. Landry sur le r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique vendu \u00e0 Rousseau, Limit\u00e9e, pouvait faire valablement l\u2019objet d\u2019un enregistrement et d\u2019un droit de suite (art. 2056, C.C.).\nOr, d\u00e8s que l\u2019on admet que le droit de privil\u00e8ge immobilier existe, la m\u00e9thode de son enregistrement ne saurait pr\u00e9senter de difficult\u00e9 insurmontable.\nQuelques jours seulement apr\u00e8s la vente par Landry \u00e0 Rouleau, Limit\u00e9e, cet acte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 par transcription sur les num\u00e9ros de cadastre officiel du terrain o\u00f9 se trouvait l\u2019usine g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice. Cela d\u00e9j\u00e0 serait complet, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le tribunal de Grenoble (D.P. 1906.2.209) qui, dans le cas d\u2019une source exploit\u00e9e pour fins d\u2019aqueduc, a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il\nsuffit que cette hypoth\u00e8que soit inscrite au bureau des hypoth\u00e8ques de l\u2019arrondissement d\u2019o\u00f9 ressort la source hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e, alors m\u00eame que les canalisations s\u2019\u00e9tendraient sur d\u2019autres arrondissements.\nL\u2019on voit tout de suite l\u2019analogie avec le pr\u00e9sent cas. Mais, apr\u00e8s tout, l\u2019enregistrement a surtout pour but de rendre publics les actes et les droits r\u00e9els (art. 2171, C.C.). En particulier, en ce qui concerne le privil\u00e8ge, l\u2019enregistrement ne le cr\u00e9e pas, non plus qu\u2019il ne le conf\u00e8re; il ne fait que le conserver et lui donner effet (art. 2082, C.C.).\nL\u2019acte de vente ne contenait pas les num\u00e9ros des rues dans lesquelles \u00e9taient pos\u00e9s les poteaux et les fils du r\u00e9seau. A vraiment parler, cet immeuble particulier constitu\u00e9 par le r\u00e9seau n\u2019avait pas et n\u2019a pas de num\u00e9ro de cadastre.\nL\u2019acte de vente et, par suite, le droit de privil\u00e8ge n\u2019en sont pas moins existants et valides car, dans ce cas, la loi n\u2019exige pas, comme elle le fait pour l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que conventionnelle (au sujet de laquelle nous entendons laisser la discussion ouverte),\nque l\u2019acte d\u00e9signe sp\u00e9cialement l\u2019immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 avec mention des tenants et aboutissants, ou du nom sous lequel il est connu ou du lot, de la partie du lot et du rang, ou du num\u00e9ro de l\u2019immeuble sur le plan et le livre de renvoi du bureau d\u2019enregistrement, si tels plan et livre de renvoi existent.\n(art. 2042, C.C); Mullarky v. Montreal Loan and Mortgage Company[20].\nCe privil\u00e8ge n\u2019est pas le produit de la convention des parties. Comme l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale, il \u201cr\u00e9sulte de la loi\u201d (arts. 1983, 2020, C.C.) et la loi n\u2019exige pas, pour qu\u2019il soit \u201cvalable\u201d, la d\u00e9signation sp\u00e9ciale requise par l\u2019art. 2042, C.C.; surtout lorsque, comme dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on ne se plaint pas de l\u2019insuffisance ou de l\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 du bordereau (art. 2139, C.C.).\nM\u00eame si le num\u00e9ro officiel du cadastre ne se trouve pas dans le titre, il peut y \u00eatre suppl\u00e9\u00e9 par le bordereau qui le r\u00e9sume (art. 2144a, C.C.) ou au moyen d\u2019une r\u00e9quisition ou un avis (art. 2168, C.C., in fine). C\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ici. Le droit de privil\u00e8ge existait. Le cr\u00e9ancier l\u2019a fait enregistrer par la m\u00e9thode indiqu\u00e9e par le Code Civil qui s\u2019adaptait le mieux au cas particulier.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis de confirmer les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nIdington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Dorion in the appellate court below and for the reasons assigned by my brother Rinfret, I agree with the latter.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sasseville and Gagnon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drolet and Tardif.\n[1] (1922) 63 Can.
