(1909)\u2014Servitude\u2014Injury caused by independent contractor\u2014 Liability of owner of timber.\nThe privilege of transmitting timber down watercourses in the Province of Quebec given by article 7298 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, is not granted in derogation of the obligation imposed upon those making use of watercourses for such purposes to make reparation for damages resulting therefrom by article 7349(2) of the Revised Statutes of Quebec. The effect of the articles is that persons who avail themselves of the privilege thereby conferred are obliged to compensate riparian owners for all damages which result from the exercise of that right except in regard to such as cannot be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill and those in respect of which the riparian proprietor himself may have contributed, or which have been occasioned by his own fault. Tourville v. Ritchie (21 R.L. 110) referred to.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.; dissenting.\u2014The evidence shewed that the damages complained of were caused by the fault of a bon\u00e2 fide independent contractor and, consequently, the owner of the timber which was being driven down the watercourse in question was not responsible for them. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of Cimon J., at the trial in the Superior Court for the District of Kamouraska, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nT. Chase-Casgrain K.C. and Stein K.C. for the appellant.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and Cannon K.C. for the respondents.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action for damages caused by the negligent driving of logs by the defendants down the River Cabano. The appellant was a mill owner carrying on his business on the river banks, and the damages were sustained by the damming back of the water upon his lands caused by a jam of the logs of the defendants just below appellant\u2019s mills. This damage, it was alleged, was entirely owing to the negligence of respondents who, on the other hand, while denying any liability, contended that appellant\u2019s own negligence was largely responsible for the damages he sustained. The gist of the action is negligence causing or contributing to the damages and, if I was able to hold the defendants liable at all, I would concur in the distribution of the damages in the way and to the amounts respectively proposed by Cross J. in the court of appeal.\nOne main defence set up by the defendants, respondents, was that plaintiff\u2019s own negligence was the cause of the entire damage, but whether this was so or not need not necessarily be determined because the driving of the logs was not carried out or done by the defendants or any of them, but by one Gu\u00e9rette, an experienced driver, with whom a contract for the driving of the logs had been entered into either by the Cabano Log Driving Association, or by its individual members, who were the owners of the logs and the defendants herein. The defendants, respondents, disclaimed having had any right of control or of having actually exercised any control over the work or driving operations of Gu\u00e9rette.\nThe question, therefore, was fairly presented. Was Gu\u00e9rette, in the carrying out of these log driving operations, when the damages occurred, a bon\u00e2 fide independent contractor? After a careful examination of the evidence given at the trial, I have reached the conclusion that he was, and that the defendants neither exercised nor claimed the right to exercise any control over his actions or operations. The contract was entered into with him by Mr. Fraser acting for himself and his co-partners in the Association, they being the owners of the logs and on behalf of the association as such. Whether the association had the corporate capacity to enter into the contract to drive the logs is beside the matter because, if it had not, the contract was made by Fraser with Gu\u00e9rette on behalf of himself and the log owners personally. I do not think, therefore, that these log owners are responsible for the negligence, if there was any, of Gu\u00e9rette in driving the logs.\nI agree with the judgment of the appeal court of Quebec as stated in the opinion of Chief Justice Archambeault on this ground, and do not, therefore, find it necessary to discuss any other grounds on which that judgment was sustainable.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. Idington J.\u2014The respondents and others owned timber intended to be floated down Cabano River and same was driven down said river doing damage to the property of appellant who was the owner of a mill and dam on said stream and property on each side of it at the place in question.\nThe respondents were found liable by the learned trial judge, but the court of appeal reversed this judgment on the ground that the work was done by an independent contractor and that he, as alleged, having same right as any one else by virtue of a section in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, to which I will refer later, was the party liable if any one.\nThe circumstances are very peculiar.\nThese owners of timber to be floated had themselves formed into a corporation known as \u201cThe Cabano Logs Driving Association\u201d with powers for improving the river, but no power to drive logs therein or enter upon such a business.\nOne of the respondents says he bought from the association, for one Gu\u00e9rette, the job of driving said logs at so much per thousand feet.\nIt seems quite clear in law such a contract, being ultra vires the corporation, could give thereby no legal rights to any one.\nGu\u00e9rette, who claims to have become their contractor, could not sue them.\nThat contract cannot, so far as I see, be relied upon as in law a contract independent or otherwise.\nThe consequence seems to be that the respondents, who in fact seem to have managed the whole business, must be looked upon as those who caused the logs to be floated and driven.\nIn law they had a right to have stopped Gu\u00e9rette at any time, for by law he could not in such circumstances set up his alleged contract.\nIt may be that had he under such error done work at the instance of respondents he might have been able to recover some compensation for such work as he might have done, but he certainly could not have relied upon this contract.\nNor could he have sued for damages had he been dismissed from his employment.\nI fail to see how this sort of alleged contract can be set up as an independent contract over which respondents had no control.\nAnd to shield the employer by virtue of an independent contract he must not only shew he by the contract was or became powerless to interfere, but also where there is or may be risk of danger or injury to others as, for example, upon a public highway he must be able to shew that he has by his contract or otherwise taken care to guard against such danger or injury. How can he in such a case rest on an absolutely void contract?\nAgain, it is alleged that under article 7298, either the respondents or Gu\u00e9rette had a perfect right to drive logs down the river in question and neither were responsible for damages unless by way of negligence in the driving and any such negligence as is apparent was that of Gu\u00e9rette and not respondents.\nPassing the question of an employer without contract to shield him, as I have already indicated was the position of respondents, let us see how this legislation came to be in the singular position it is and how it is found in the revised statutes in the somewhat isolated position it is\u2014and what the legal effect thereof is.\nThe construction put by this court on the Code and result in law in the case of Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Light Co.[1] seems to take away any right in such a stream as this, only available at times of freshets for driving timber, save such as a statute may have given.\nIn fact the case has turned in the courts below upon statutory rights parties may have in such case.\nThe history of this legislation may, for practical purposes herein, begin with 20 Vict. ch. 40, sec. 2, of which the first two sub-sections are as follows:\u2014\nII. 1. No person shall enter upon or pass over the land of another, without permission of the owner or his representative, upon pain of incurring a fine of not less than five, nor more than thirty shillings, excepting, however, any person in the discharge of any of the duties imposed by law;\n2. It shall be lawful, nevertheless, to make use of any navigable river or watercourse, and the banks thereof, for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber, and for the passage of all boats, ferries and canoes, subject to the charge of repairing, as soon as possible, all damages resulting from the enjoyment of such right, and all fences, drains or ditches which may have been so damaged.\nThis passed into the Consolidated Statutes of Quebec, (chap. 26,) with an amendment of the first two lines of sub-section 2, to read as follows instead of as-above:\u2014\n2. It shall be lawful, nevertheless, to make use of any navigable or floatable river or watercourse, and the banks thereof, for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber,\notherwise the statute was as first enacted.\nAgain, these sub-sections passed into the Revised Statutes of 1888, as article 5551, slightly varied and improved, but not departing in any essential from the two features of legislative concession of right to pass over property of others and the indemnification for all damages resulting from the exercise of that right so given. The question is now raised whether or not this simple, just and comprehensive state of the law has been entirely changed by section 7298 in the Revised Statutes, 1909, which reads as follows:\u2014\n7298. Subject to the provisions of this sub-section, any person, firm or company may, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, float and transmit timber, rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, and creeks in this province.\nThe history of it seems to be this, that, in the Revised Statutes of 1888, art. 2972, under the caption of \u201cToll-bridges,\u201d were embodied provisions for the protection of these bridges.\nThen, in 1890, these bridges apparently needing further legislative protection, 53 Vict. ch. 37 expressly enacted that sections therein should be added to said section next after sub-section 3 thereof. There were thus added sub-sections (a) and (b) clearly relevant to these bridges and nothing else but their protection.\nThe next session 54 Vict. ch. 25 was passed, whereby sub-section (c) was expressly added to same section 2972, and, as if relating to same law, a number of sub-sections designated (d), (e), etc., follow under different headings.\nOf these, this sub-section (d) reads as follows:\u2014\n2972(d). Subject to the provisions of this law, any person, firm or company is allowed, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, to float and transmit timber, rafts and crafts down all rivers, streams and creeks in this province.\nThis clearly is the section which was intended to be and should have been inserted in the Revised Statutes where it could by relation to the context be given an intelligible meaning.\nAs it read originally, using the words \u201csubject to the provisions of this law,\u201d it was intelligible, either as relative to the whole Act then being passed, or in the larger sense if read as part of the Revised Statutes which were to stand amended by those sections; numbered as if part of the Revised Statutes.\nIt is now made to read as if subject to the section itself, but if we pay heed to the divisions of this revision of the statutes we find \u201csection\u201d is used as a subtitle designating a group of sections.\nI must say this sub-section which has become so important in this case does not seem exactly in proper place where it is put, yet I cannot say it has been clearly misplaced, for it never seemed appropriately placed. Bearing in mind the history I have given of it and that it seemed as if a corrective of what had preceded it in legislative history, but to be read as if in harmony with the rest of the Revised Statutes of 1888, can I say it was intended to repeal the law as expressed in art. 5551 of said Revised Statutes?\nIf not, was it so repugnant to any part thereof as by implication to repeal any part of it? I think not.\nThen, does it confer any new right or is it merely a declaratory enactment to remove doubts in some one\u2019s mind relative to the extent of the operative effect of art. 5551?\nCounsel could not suggest why it was passed.\nInasmuch as art. 7349, of the revision of 1909, appears therein repeating the law of which I outlined the history above from 20 Vict. (1857,) down to then, it clearly was not the intention to repeal the law which with amendments from time to time had remained substantially the same for half a century.\nIndeed, the like legislation had existed from 13 & 14 Vict. ch. 40.\nWhen this puzzling section was put into 54 Vict. ch. 25, that Act began with a distinct heading for its first section to indicate declaratory legislation was deemed necessary.\nIf permitted to surmise I would suggest that this new section was also intended to have been also declaratory to meet some ingenious objection that the law as it stood did not cover the possible case of streams which were mere streams at freshet times and at other times dry, and hence could not fall within the description given in the revision of 1888, and now art. 7349 of the revision of 1909.\nIf that was the case then this stream does not, from what we are told at the bar, fall within the class the new section was intended to cover, for it runs continuously. If this stream then does not fall within the language of art. 7349, of the revision of 1909, I fail to understand what could.\nNo case of the kind I suggest is made by the pleadings or is proven and I assume, therefore, that art. 7349 is what entitled the respondents to claim a statutory servitude over appellant\u2019s property. It was clearly in exercise of that right they had driven these logs and they must compensate for any damages done in this operation of driving.\nIn such case they fall within the law as declared by this court in the case of Dickie v. Campbell[2] in construing an enactment less express than art. 7349 in its provision for indemnification.\nThe statute that case turned upon gave indemnification rather by an implication derived from an exception relative to damages than from an express provision providing therefor. In disposing of that case the court expressly anticipates the case of an independent contract and overrules such a defence. Whether this arose from facts which do not appear in the meagre report I cannot say; yet on the possible facts the judgment deals with it expresses sound law. Nay, more, it surely is absolute justice that when a man acquires the right, as a matter of public expediency, to invade another\u2019s possession he should, when no other compensation is given, at least indemnify that other for the loss or expense he is put to by the exercise of the statutory right.\nIt would probably be impossible to estimate compensation in anticipation of what might happen in such cases and the least that should be done is to see that the man whose property is thus subjected to a servitude by law does not suffer.\nThis principle has been so long adhered to by the legislature and in so many forms that one must be slow in giving an interpretation to an ambiguous sort of legislation that would conflict therewith.\nThe rules laid down in the interpretation clauses introductory to the revision of the statutes clearly indicate that such revision is to be treated, at least prim\u00e2 facie, as declaratory of the law.\nOn the facts, I repeat, we must find, and, except in a very express case pleaded and proven, assume the respondents were acting in the drive they directed under the law as set forth in art. 7349 and, therefore, be held responsible for the consequences of such act.\nI do not think we can rely entirely upon the grounds taken by Mr. Justice Cross; yet I feel there is great force in the facts he refers to shewing the respondents had no such independent contract as clearly put the movements of Gu\u00e9rette out of their control. I see no such clear governing reasons to quarrel with i the findings of fact and assessment of damages made by the learned trial judge as to render it imperative we should here interfere therewith, and, therefore, conclude the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The first question arises upon the appellant\u2019s contention that the damages sustained by him in respect of which he claims compensation were \u201cdamages resulting\u201d from the driving of the logs of the respondents and their associates and that he is entitled, under article 7349(2) of the Revised Statutes; of Quebec, 1909, to reparation for that loss. I will first consider the appellant\u2019s proposition of law that for all \u201cdamages resulting\u201d from the driving of the logs in question the respondents are liable to an action before discussing the question how far the loss for which compensation is claimed falls within that category.\nThe enactments to be examined are articles 7349 and 7298, R.S.Q., 1909; and it will be convenient to quote them in full:\u2014\nII.\u2014Trespass on the Property of others and Damage caused Thereto.\n7349(1). Except in the discharge of any duty imposed by law, no person shall enter upon or pass over the land or beach-land belonging to any other person or corporation, without permission of the owner or his representative, under penalty of a fine of not less than one nor more than six dollars.\n(2) It shall be lawful, nevertheless, to make use of any river or watercourse, lake, pond, ditch, drain or stream, in which or to the maintenance of which one or more persons are interested or bound, and the banks thereof, for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber and for the passage of all boats, ferries and canoes, subject to the charge of repairing, as soon as possible, all damages resulting from the exercise of such right, and all fences, drains or ditches damaged.\n(3) The proprietor, or his representative or servant may arrest without warrant any person in the act of contravening this article, and bring him or cause him to be brought forthwith before a justice of the peace.\n* * * * *\nProtection of Public Interest in Rivers, Streams and Greeks.\n* * * * *\nII. Right of Floating and Transmitting Timber, etc., down Rivers, Streams and Creeks, and of Executing Works for that Purpose.\n7298. Subject to the provisions of this sub-section, any person, firm or company may, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, float and transmit timber, rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and creeks in this province.\nIt is not disputed that if article 7349 stood alone the appellant would be entitled to reparation for all loss that can be described as \u201cdamages resulting\u201d from the driving of the logs in question within the meaning of that article. The contention of the respondents is that the rights and obligations of persons making use of streams for the driving of logs during the \u201cSpring, Summer and Autumn freshets\u201d are stated in article 7298; and that the provisions of article 7349(2) have no application to \u201cdamages resulting\u201d from such operations when carried on during those seasons.\nThe enactment that is now article 7298, (in a form not quite identical with its present form,) became law in 1890; and, at that time, the enactments now reproduced in article 7349 had been in force for many years. The majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench have given effect to the contention of the respondents that, in respect of the matter to which it relates\u2014the use of streams during the seasons mentioned\u2014the later enactment must be taken to have displaced the earlier; and that, no duty to make reparation having been imposed by the governing enactment, the respondents\u2019 responsibility is only such as the law implies, namely, to make good such damages as arose from the negligence of the respondents themselves or of those for whose acts they are answerable according to the general principles of law.\nThe effect of this view of the Act of 1890 put in concrete form is that when the driving is undertaken by a competent independent contractor during any of the seasons mentioned the owner is not, save in very exceptional circumstances, answerable for the consequences of any negligence in the execution of the work.\nWith great respect, I cannot agree that the obligation imposed by article 7349(2) was affected by the later enactment. Before the passing of the last-mentioned Act (now articles 7297-7305) the owners of logs were entitled to make use of the streams of the province for floating them, but the owners of the lands traversed by such streams had a correlative right to be compensated for damages occasioned by such use. I have already said it is not disputed that this obligation to make such compensation (under the law as it was prior to the Act of 1890) rested on all persons availing themselves of the right, whether through independent contractors or otherwise; and, according to the construction we are now considering, this right of compensation, as regards damages caused during the seasons of high-water, was taken away by the Act of 1890. One of the most important principles of interpretation is that which rests upon the presumption that the legislature does not take away vested private rights or impose new servitudes upon private property without compensation. It is not suggested that for the valuable right of which riparian owners are said to have been deprived by the Act of 1890 any compensating benefit was conferred upon them; and the effect of that Act, according to the construction proposed by the respondents, would, of course, be to augment the burden of the servitude declared by the earlier legislation. As the principle just indicated seems to apply to such a case, one is bound, before adopting a construction having that effect, to see that it is quite clear that the proposed construction really gives effect to the intention of the legislature, as shewn by the statute.\nLooking at the provisions of the Act of 1890 as a whole one sees that the main object of the enactment was to sanction the maintenance of booms and other works for facilitating the use of the streams of the province for floating craft and timber and the improvement of the float-ability of such streams and to define in a general way the rights and obligations inter se of the owners of such works, on the one hand, and other persons making use of the streams for the transmission of craft and timber, on the other.\nThe Act was passed in December, 1890. In November of the previous year, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had held, in Tourville v. Ritchie[3], that the plaintiff, the owner of a boom in the River St. Francis, was not entitled to charge the defendant for the use he had made of that boom in floating his logs down the river; but, on the contrary, that the boom was an obstruction and that the plaintiff was liable for all damages occasioned by its presence in the river. The Act of 1890 first declares the public right to use the streams of the province during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets for flotation purposes. The provision quoted textually, (54 Vict. ch. 25,) is as follows:\u2014\n2972(d). Subject to the provisions of this law, any person, firm or company is allowed, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, to float and transmit timber, rafts and crafts down all rivers, streams and creeks in this province.\nIt then proceeds to declare that the maintenance of booms and other works for facilitating the use of streams for such purposes and for improving the float ability of streams is and always has been lawful. Then follows a provision that the owner of any such work shall not be entitled to the exclusive use of it, but that he may acquire, upon application to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the right to charge tolls for the use of it by others. It seems to be clear enough that the subject the legislature is really dealing with is the rights and obligations inter se of persons who are engaged in exercising the public rights mentioned in the statute and not the private rights of riparian owners. One is not surprised to find in a statute dealing with that subject a declaration, on the one hand, of the existing right to use the streams of the province for floating purposes and, on the other, of the existing right to maintain works of the description mentioned for facilitating such use. Looking more particularly at the language of article 7298\u2014the article does not expressly or by necessary implication refer to the right of compensation given by the then existing law.\nThe right of compensation was not a right of action for a wrong; it was strictly a right to be compensated for the injurious consequences following upon the exercise of another right. The declaration in article 7298, therefore, of the existence of the public right does not necessarily involve any negation of the correlative private right. In the absence of any indication that the legislature had such private rights in view I think the weight of argument favours the narrower construction.\nThere is a passage in Lord Selborne\u2019s judgment in East and West India Dock Co. v. Hill[4], at page 23, which seems to me to be directly applicable here:\u2014\nOn principle it is certainly desirable in construing a statute, if it be possible, to avoid extending it to collateral effects and consequences beyond the scope of the general object and policy of the statute itself, and injurious to third parties with whose interests the statute need not, and does not profess to, directly deal.\nSubsequent legislation lends some confirmation to this view of the Act of 1890. That Act was amended, in 1904, by making its provisions applicable to \u201clakes and ponds.\u201d By the same statute the enactments now reproduced as articles 2256 and 7349(2) were similarly amended. If the rights of compensation declared by article 7349(2) and article 2256 were regarded as no longer available during the seasons of high-water, by reason of the provisions of the Act of 1890, it is strange that the language of those enactments was not brought into harmony with that state of the law by appropriate amendments. This consideration receives some additional weight from the fact that these same provisions of the law, without additional amendment indicating that they had in effect been modified by the enactment of the Act of 1890, were reproduced in the Revised Statutes of 1909.\nIn this view of the enactments in question, the law imposes upon persons who avail themselves of the public right the obligation to compensate riparian proprietors at least for all damages which are caused by the exercise of the right and which could be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill except in so far as they may have been contributed to by the fault of the riparian proprietor himself. It is not necessary for the purposes of this case to consider whether the right of the riparian proprietor is any higher. The learned trial judge has appraised the damages upon this principle and the questions involved on this head being questions of fact and the trial judge having heard the witnesses his conclusion ought to be accepted unless it is clearly erroneous. I think there is no sufficient reason for holding that it is.\nBut there is another ground on which I think the appellant is entitled to succeed. I shall assume that the provisions of article 7349(2) do not apply in cases to which article 7298 is applicable and, consequently, that the appellant\u2019s right to compensation, if any, must rest upon some other foundation than the first-mentioned article. I shall assume also, for the purposes of this appeal without expressing any opinion upon the point, that an owner of logs who, during Spring, Summer or Autumn freshets entrusts the driving of his logs to a competent independent contractor without retaining any control over the execution of the contract, and without actually interfering in fact with the execution of it, is not answerable for damages resulting from the contractor\u2019s negligence.\nHaving made these assumptions, I still think the evidence supports the view at which the learned trial judge, as well as Cross and Carroll JJ. in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, arrived\u2014that the drive was not entrusted to an independent contractor and that it was in fact executed under the control of the respondents. It was clearly beyond the powers of the Cabano Association either to undertake the driving of logs or to let contracts for the driving of the logs owned by the members of the association; and the so-called contract, therefore, between the association and Alexander Fraser, which the latter alleges was assigned to Gu\u00e9rette, was a mere nullity and may be entirely put out of view.\nThe facts mentioned by Mr. Justice Cross and by the learned trial judge justify the conclusions, in my opinion, that in fact the understanding at the meeting of the association (at which the so-called letting of the contract to Alexander Fraser took place) was that Donald Fraser & Sons should undertake the drive and that in fact they never relinquished control of it.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Deux questions principales se pr\u00e9sentent dans cette cause ci. La premi\u00e8re est de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un marchand de bois qui en descendant ses billots cause des dommages aux propri\u00e9taires riverains, et nous avons aussi \u00e0 examiner si l\u2019entrepreneur qui a fait la descente du bois dans le cas actuel \u00e9tait le pr\u00eate-nom des d\u00e9fendeurs intim\u00e9s.\nCes derniers sont des concessionnaires de coupes de bois sur les terres de la couronne dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ils coupent leur bois en billots dans le cours de l\u2019hiver et au printemps ils jettent ces billots dans un petit cours d\u2019eau; qui s\u2019appelle la rivi\u00e8re Cabano, pour les descendre \u00e0 leur moulin qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 son embouchure. Ce cours d\u2019eau est du domaine priv\u00e9 et les riverains en sont les propri\u00e9taires. Plusieurs dispositions statutaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es cependant pour autoriser le flottage du bois dans ces cours d\u2019eau priv\u00e9s. Celle qui je crois doit r\u00e9gir le cas actuel se trouve reproduite dans les statuts refondus de 1909 \u00e0 l\u2019article 2256. Elle se lit comme suit:\u2014\nLequel (le porteur l\u2019un permis de coupe) a en tout temps, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son permis, le droit * * * de se servir des rivi\u00e8res ou cours d\u2019eau flottables et des lacs, \u00e9tangs ou autres \u00e9tendues d\u2019eau et de leurs berges, pour transporter toutes sortes de bois * * * \u00e0 condition de r\u00e9parer les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019exercice de ce droit.\nCette disposition de la loi est tr\u00e8s juste et tr\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. Le cours d\u2019eau \u00e9tant propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e le propri\u00e9taire devrait pouvoir en jouir comme bon lui semblerait. Il est incontestable, par exemple, qu\u2019il peut y \u00e9riger des digues pour faire mouvoir un moulin et ce droit lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement reconnu par la l\u00e9gislation de 1854 dont il est fait mention \u00e0 l\u2019article 503 du Code Civil. La l\u00e9gislature voulant favoriser l\u2019exploitation des for\u00eats sur les terres de la couronne a adopt\u00e9 la loi ci-dessus cit\u00e9e et elle a donn\u00e9 le pouvoir aux porteurs de permis de descendre leur bois sur les cours d\u2019eau pourvu qu\u2019ils paient les dommages qu\u2019ils causeraient. Ce privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 aux marchands de bois restreignait n\u00e9cessairement le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du riverain. Par exemple ce dernier, s\u2019il avait \u00e9rig\u00e9 des \u00e9cluses, \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 d\u2019y percer des glissoires pour y faire passer les billots des marchands de bois mais il devait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 si on lui causait des dommages.\nDumont, l\u2019appelant, est un de ces propri\u00e9taires riverains sur le cours d\u2019eau Cabano. Il avait \u00e9rig\u00e9 une \u00e9cluse pour alimenter ses moulins \u00e0 scie et \u00e0 farine et afin de faciliter la descente du bois il avait une glissoire dans son \u00e9cluse. Il est d\u2019usage qu\u2019\u00e0 quelque distance de ces \u00e9cluses ainsi pourvues de glissoires les proprietaires du bois tendent des estacades et dirigent ensuite les billots vers ces glissoires. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et il est prouv\u00e9 que les estacades \u00e9rig\u00e9es pr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e9cluse du demandeur n\u2019\u00e9taient pas attach\u00e9es soigneusement et alors une crue soudaine s\u2019\u00e9tant produite les billots ont bris\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cluse et sont venus s\u2019arr\u00eater un peu plus bas et ont compl\u00e8tement barr\u00e9 le cours de la rivi\u00e8re qui est sorti de son lit, et qui se frayant un passage sur le terrain de Dumont lui a caus\u00e9 de grands dommages. Tout cela aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 si on avait suivi les conseils de Dumont et si on avait, la veille de la nuit o\u00f9 l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit, fait passer les billots dans la glissoire de l\u2019\u00e9cluse. Mais les d\u00e9fendeurs Fraser n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9tendu leurs estacades \u00e0 l\u2019embouchure de la rivi\u00e8re et alors la descente n\u2019a pas pu se faire.\nSi les estacades (booms) audessus de l\u2019\u00e9cluse avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fortement attach\u00e9es l\u2019accident aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9. Mais les d\u00e9fendeurs disent \u201cc\u2019est la faute de l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 qui nous avons confi\u00e9 cette entreprise et nous ne sommes pas responsables de sa n\u00e9gligence.\u201d J\u2019examinerai plus loin cette pr\u00e9tention. Pour le moment je vais examiner la question de savoir si les d\u00e9fendeurs sont responsables qu\u2019il y ait n\u00e9gligence ou non.\nLe propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un cours d\u2019eau priv\u00e9, comme nous venons de le voir, est oblig\u00e9 de subir le flottage des billots des concessionnaires de coupes de bois, mais ces derniers, par contre, sont responsables des dommage qu\u2019ils causent. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il y ait n\u00e9gligence de la part de ces marchands, ils engagent leur responsabilit\u00e9 du moment qu\u2019ils causent des dommages. C\u2019est ce que cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Dickie v. Campbell[5].\nDans une autre cause jug\u00e9e par cette cour, Ward v. Township of Grenville[6], le juge Girouard, \u00e0 la page 526, dit en examinant une disposition statutaire r\u00e9dig\u00e9e dans les m\u00eames termes, que l\u2019article 2256, R.S.Q., 1909:\u2014\nIt lays down the rule that the owner of logs and timber floating on a private river, like the Rouge, is responsible for the damage caused by that passage, whether he is in fault or not, provided, of course, the riparian proprietors are not in fault. It was quite recently, (1902,) applied by the Superior Court, in Sherbrooke (Archibald J.,) confirmed in review by Tait, A.C.J., Loranger and Fortin JJ., in McKelvie v. Miller.\nLa cour de r\u00e9vision, dans une cause du Club de Chasse et de P\u00eache Ouiatchouan v. La Cie. de Pulpe de Ouiatchouan[7], a jug\u00e9 ce qui suit:\u2014\n1. Les fabricants de bois, concessionnaires de coupes de bois, etc., ont le droit de flotter le bois qu\u2019ils fabriquent dans les rivi\u00e8res et cours d\u2019eau de la province, \u00e0 la condition de payer les dommages qu\u2019ils peuvent causer.\n2. Ils ne peuvent se soustraire \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 en faisant faire le flottage de leur bois \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise par des tiers.\nL\u2019Hon. Juge Lemieux, \u00e0 la page 140, dit:\u2014\nComme on le voit, le statut ne conf\u00e8re qu\u2019au porteur d\u2019un permis de coupe de bois le droit de se servir des rivi\u00e8res flottables, en tout temps, pour transporter son bois, sauf \u00e0 payer les dommages, etc.\n* * * Nous consid\u00e9rons que ce privil\u00e8ge * * * est inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la personne et ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 que par un porteur d\u2019un permis de coupe de bois.\nEt s\u2019il en est ainsi, il ne peut \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9 ou transport\u00e9 \u00e0 des tiers.\nAutrement le marchand de bois pourrait toujours se lib\u00e9rer du recours en dommages * * * en donnant des contrats pour la descente de ce bois \u00e0 des personnes insolvables, etc. * * * Et il s\u2019en suivrait que ces contracteurs, au d\u00e9fi de la loi, pourraient * * * faire le flottage ou la descente des billots * * * qui, en s\u2019\u00e9chouant, * * * nuiraient aux riverains, et commettraient des torts consid\u00e9rables, sans aucune crainte de recours en indemnit\u00e9. La loi ne peut pas permettre un semblable \u00e9tat de choses, qui en tra\u00eenerait tant d\u2019injustices.\nCe principe est parfaitement reconnu dans la jurisprudence mais on dit qu\u2019une loi pass\u00e9e en 1890, 54 Vict. ch. 25, a restreint la responsabilit\u00e9 du marchand de bois. Un article de cette l\u00e9gislation de 1890 se lit comme suit:\u2014\nSujet aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, il est permis, lors de la crue des eaux au printemps, en \u00e9t\u00e9 et en automne, \u00e0 toute personne, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et compagnie, de faire flotter et descendre les bois, radeaux et embarcations dans les rivi\u00e8res, criques et cours d\u2019eau dans cette province.\nCette disposition ne doit pas s\u2019appliquer au cas actuel.\nLes defendeurs sont concessionnaires de coupe de bois, leurs droits et leurs obligations sont r\u00e9gis par les lois des terres de la couronne ou ce que j\u2019appellerai notre code forestier. Ainsi, par example, dans une limite \u00e0 bois il se trouve parfois des terrains qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cond\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 des agriculteurs. La loi, \u00e0 l\u2019article 1627, S.R.P.Q., 1909, dit que\nles propri\u00e9taires de limites \u00e0 bois et toute personne ayant du bois \u00e0 flotter, ont le droit, durant l\u2019hiver, de transporter du bois et des provisions en passant sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de personnes qui ont des terres dans ces limites; pourvu qu\u2019ils soient tenus d\u2019indemniser ces propri\u00e9taires pour tous dommages qu\u2019ils pourraient y causer.\nCes dispositions du code forestier lient les porteurs de coupe et ces derniers n\u2019ont pas le droit de s\u2019y soustraire en invoquant la loi commune. C\u2019est une des raisons pour laquelle les d\u00e9fendeurs ne peuvent pas invoquer la loi de 1890.\nD\u2019ailleurs il suffit d\u2019examiner un instant les circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de cette loi de 1890 pour se convaincre qu\u2019elle ne saurait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par les d\u00e9fendeurs.\nD\u00e8s 1857, par l\u2019acte 20 Vict. ch. 40, on permettait de faire usage des rivi\u00e8res et cours d\u2019eau pour le transport du bois mais \u00e0 la charge de r\u00e9parer tous les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019exercice de ce droit.\nEn 1891, lors de la codification du Code Municipal, on y a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 891 que l\u2019on pouvait utiliser les cours d\u2019eau municipaux et leurs rives, mais, encore, avec l\u2019obligation de payer tous les dommages caus\u00e9s.\nLa m\u00eame responsabilit\u00e9 est enonc\u00e9e dans les lois organiques foresti\u00e8res que nous retrouvons dans les statuts refondus de 1888. Cependant, en reproduisant dans ces derniers statuts la loi de 1857 on a eu le soin de retrancher les rivi\u00e8res navigables vu que leur contr\u00f4le l\u00e9gislatif, par l\u2019acte de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Dans une multitude de proc\u00e8s c\u00e9l\u00e8bres de Tourville et Ritchie o\u00f9 l\u2019on soulevait les droits du public dans les rivi\u00e8res navigables, o\u00f9 l\u2019on discutait le droit d\u2019\u00e9riger des booms dans ces rivi\u00e8res et d\u2019exercer des saisies gagerie sur le bois qui y \u00e9tait retenu, il y a eu en d\u00e9finitive des d\u00e9cisions rendues par la cour d\u2019appel, en 1889, qui paraissent bas\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que sur le droit strict. Nous retrouvons quelques uns de ces jugements dans la cause de Tourville v. Ritchie[8].\nEt alors, l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, afin de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019incertitude qui existait, a l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 et a reconnu le droit d\u2019\u00e9riger des estacades dans toutes les rivi\u00e8res, de pratiquer des saisies et de faire flotter le bois. Le but de cette l\u00e9gislation \u00e9tait de faire dispara\u00eetre le doute qui pouvait exister quant \u00e0 l\u2019installation d\u2019estacades sur les rivi\u00e8res navigables et ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00eat\u00e9 comme diminuant la responsabilit\u00e9 de ceux qui pourraient causer du dommage. Cela est tellement \u00e9vident que la vielle loi de 1857 et celle de 1890 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9es, en 1904. par chap. 14, 4 Ed. VII. de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que deux dispositions statutaires couvrent \u00e9galement les lacs et les \u00e9tangs.\nS\u2019il y avait eu intention de la part de la l\u00e9gislature en 1890 d\u2019abolir la l\u00e9gislation ant\u00e9rieure de 1857, et si c\u2019est par oubli comme on le pr\u00e9tend que cette ancienne l\u00e9gislation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abolie, pourquoi alors l\u2019amender en 1904? Dailleurs, dans cette l\u00e9gislation de 1890 on y d\u00e9clare formellement qu\u2019elle n\u2019affecte pas les \u00e9cluses. Donc ces derni\u00e8res continuent \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9gies par la vielle loi de 1857, et comme les dommages en question dans cette cause se rapportent pour grande partie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cluse du demandeur les d\u00e9fendeurs ne peuvent pas se soustraire \u00e0 leur responsabilit\u00e9.\nCes lois de 1857 et de 1890 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduites dans nos statuts revis\u00e9s de 1909. L\u2019une est reproduite au titre des servitudes; c\u2019est la loi de 1890. L\u2019autre se trouve au titre de la responsabilit\u00e9. Il est donc evident aujourd\u2019hui que, ces dispositions statutaires se retrouvant dans nos statuts, nous devons les interpr\u00eater l\u2019une par l\u2019autre. Je suis d\u2019opinion, en resum\u00e9, que le marchand de bois peut descendre ses billots dans les cours d\u2019eau et les rivi\u00e8res, mais que dans le cas de cours d\u2019eau priv\u00e9s ce droit est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de payer les dommages.\nCe point d\u00e9cid\u00e9, l\u2019appelant devrait r\u00e9ussir. Mais je dois ajouter que les intim\u00e9s doivent aussi \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s parce que leur pr\u00e9tendu entrepreneur n\u2019\u00e9tait que leur pr\u00eate-nom et que la descente des billots se faisait virtuellement sous leur contr\u00f4le. Or, en vertu de l\u2019article 1054 du Code Civil, ils se trouvent responsables du dommage qu\u2019ils ont alors caus\u00e9. C\u2019est l\u00e0 principalement une question de fait que de savoir si Gu\u00e9rette avait r\u00e9ellement l\u2019enterprise \u00e0 forfait, et \u00e9tait ind\u00e9pendant des intim\u00e9s. La preuve n\u2019est pas absolument certaine et quelque peu contradictoire. Aussi les six juges qui se sont prononc\u00e9s, en cour sup\u00e9rieure et en cour d\u2019appel, sur ce point sont \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s. Mais, comme le juge instructeur a vu et entendu les t\u00e9moins, il est, je crois, en meilleure position de peser leurs d\u00e9clarations. Il est d\u2019opinion que l\u2019entrepreneur n\u2019\u00e9tait que le pr\u00eate-nom des intim\u00e9s et je crois que nous devons accepter son verdict.\nEn principe l\u2019entrepreneur est responsable \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion du propri\u00e9taire d\u00e8s accidents et dommages survenus au cours du travail; ce dernier, cependant, est responsable lorsqu\u2019il r\u00e9sulte des circonstances de la cause que le contrat est simul\u00e9 et n\u2019a eu d\u2019autre but que de substituer au regard des tiers \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 effective du propri\u00e9taire celle d\u2019un r\u00e9pondant absolument insolvable.

Rep. 552.) Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that a special assessment for a proportionate part of the cost of a public sewer, claimed to be chargeable against the lands of the company was \u201ctaxation\u201d within the meaning of said agreement and the company was exempt from liability therefor.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] in favour of the respondent on a stated case.\nThe case stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was as follows:\u2014\n1. The plaintiff is the City of Halifax, a corporation under the Halifax City Charter.\n2. The Silliker Car Company, hereinafter called the \u201cSilliker Company,\u201d was duly incorporated under the provisions of the \u201cNova Scotia Companies\u2019 Act\u201d on the 4th day of April, A.D. 1907.\n3. Section 4 of chapter 70 of the Acts of 1907, entitled \u201cAn Act to authorize the City of Halifax to assist the Silliker Car Company, Limited,\u201d is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe exemption from taxation of the property of the said company set out in the said Memorandum of Agreement is hereby confirmed.\u201d\n4. The Memorandum of Agreement, referred to in said section 4 of chapter 70 of the Acts of 1907, was printed as a schedule to said Act, and clause I. thereof is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cI. The city will grant the company a total exemption from taxation for ten years on its buildings, plant and stock, and on the land on which its buildings used for manufacturing purposes are situated, or immediately connected with the same, and used exclusively for the purposes of its business, such lands to be practically in one block, but may be divided by a street, and not to exceed twenty acres in all. In addition to these lands the company may hold, for the purposes of its business, and upon the same terms, a lot of land on the water front north of the Intercolonial Round House, Richmond, and not exceeding five acres, provided no tolls or wharfage are charged in connection therewith. At the expiry of the ten years the city agrees that the total yearly value for assessment on such lands, buildings, plant and stock shall, for a further period of ten years, not exceed fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars, the foregoing exemption not to apply to the ordinary water rate for fire protection, nor to the rate for water used by the company, which shall be charged at the minimum rate charged other manufacturing concerns.\u201d 5. The lands formerly owned by the Silliker Company and used exclusively for manufacturing purposes are practically in one block of less than twenty acres in extent and are situate in the northwest suburbs of the City of Halifax, bounded generally on the south by North street, on the west by Windsor street, on the north by Almon street and on the east in part by Clifton street and in part by the rear line of lots fronting on said Clifton street, and were acquired by and conveyed to the Silliker Company on the ninth day of May, A.D. 1907.\n6. The defendant, the Nova Scotia Car Works, Limited, is a body corporate duly incorporated in February, 1911, under the provisions of the said \u201cNova Scotia Companies Act\u201d with the object, among others, of acquiring and undertaking the whole or any part of the business, good will, property, franchises, rights, privileges, assets and liabilities of the said Silliker Company.\n7. The defendant purchased and acquired all the property of every kind, real, personal and mixed, of the Silliker Company and assumed its liabilities, and the real property of the Silliker Company, including the said lands used exclusively for manufacturing purposes, mentioned and described in paragraph five hereof, were on the twenty-fifth day of April, A.D. 1911, conveyed to and the title thereof vested in the defendant.\n8. The said lands since their acquisition by the Silliker Company have always been and still are used continuously and exclusively for manufacturing purposes either by the Silliker Company or the defendant.\n9. In 1911 an Act, chapter 41 of the Acts of that year, was passed, dealing with the exemptions from taxation of the Silliker Company and the defendant. The said Act is to be deemed a part of this case and incorporated therewith.\n10. In the year 1908 the City of Halifax constructed public sewers along North, Windsor and Almon streets, opposite the lands mentioned and described in paragraph five hereof, and in 1910 and 1911 the City of Halifax constructed a public sewer along Clifton street opposite the said lands.\n11. The proportion of the cost of construction of such sewers along North, Windsor and Almon streets claimed by the plaintiff to be chargeable, by and under the provisions of the Halifax City Charter, against said lands mentioned and described in said paragraph five hereof is two thousand and sixty-seven dollars and thirty-four cents ($2,067.34); and the proportion of the cost of construction of such sewer along Clifton street claimed by the plaintiff to be chargeable as aforesaid against the said lands is three hundred and twenty dollars ($320); and making in all the sum of $2,387.34.\n12. The sewers on North, Windsor and Almon streets were completed during the year 1908, and the sewer on Clifton street was completed in 1910, the plans of North, Windsor and Almon streets with the list of owners of each property fronting on said streets were duly prepared and filed by the city engineer of the City of Halifax in his office in accordance with the provisions of section 602 of the Halifax City Charter on the 26th day of March, A.D. 1908, and the plans of said Clifton street together with the list of the owners thereon were duly filed by said city engineer in his office on the 30th day of March, A.D. 1911. 13. The plaintiff claims that the said proportions of the cost of constructing the said sewers constitute a lien on the said lands of the defendant, under and by virtue of the provisions of the Halifax City Charter, and thereby enforceable against the said lands and the defendant company.\n14. The defendant claims that the said lands are exempt from liability from such lien by reason of the said Acts, chapter 70 of 1907 and chapter 41 of 1911.\n15. The question for the court is, does the exemption claimed by the defendant apply in respect to the sewers herein referred to?\n16. If the court is of the opinion that the lien exists in respect to the sewers herein referred to, the plaintiff is to be at liberty to enter judgment against the defendant for the sum of two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven dollars and thirty-four cents ($2,387.34) with costs Such liberty, however, not to affect any other remedy which the plaintiff has or may have for enforcing such lien. If the court answers the said question in the negative, the plaintiff shall pay defendant the costs of this action, and defendant may enter judgment therefor when taxed.\nThis case is stated and agreed upon pursuant to Order 33, Rule 6, of the \u201cNova Scotia Judicature Act.\u201d\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the case so stated was that the assessment for the company\u2019s proportion of the cost of the sewer was not \u201ctaxation\u201d from which the latter was exempt under the agreement. The company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nE. P. Allison for the appellants. The respondent and the court below rely on the American decisions holding that exemption from taxation does not include special assessment. These decisions do not apply to conditions in Canada. They are all based on the constitutional limitation in the 14th amendment and the provision in State constitutions that all taxation must be equal and uniform. See Davidson v. City of New Orleans[2]; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. City of Decatur[3]; Boston Seamen\u2019s Friend Soc. v. City of Boston[4].\nThe decisions in Chicago Great Western Railway Co. v. Kansas City North Western Railroad Co.[5] shews the interpretation to be given to the word \u201ctaxation\u201d in the absence of statutory or constitutional limitations.\nEvery contribution demanded by the State is a tax. Per Strong J. in Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Montreal[6]. And the decision of the court in that case should be decisive of this appeal.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for the respondent cites Armstrong v. Auger[7]; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. City of Decatur3; Boston Asylum, etc. v. Street Commissioners of the City of Boston[8].\nE. P. Allison for the appellants.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014Here is the apparently simple question in this case: Is the appellant, the Nova Scotia Car Co., exempt from liability to contribute to the cost of constructing certain sewers built by the respondent, the Corporation of the City of Halifax, under the provisions of the city charter? For brevity I will refer to the appellant as the company, and to the respondent as the corporation.\nBy a Memorandum of Agreement made with the corporation and confirmed by the legislature, the Silliker Car Company was promised a total exemption from taxation for ten years on its buildings, plant and stock. The company has since (1911) acquired the property, privileges and franchises including the right to exemption from taxation of the Silliker Car Company and, by Act of the legislature (chapter 41 of the Acts of 1911) this agreement is also approved of. The sewers were completed in 1908-1910, and except for the agreement, the liability of the company for its share of the cost of their construction is admitted.\nThe exemption clause reads as follows:\u2014\nThe city will grant the company a total exemption from taxation for ten years on its buildings, plant and stock, and on the land on which its buildings used for manufacturing purposes are situated, or immediately connected with the same, and used exclusively for the purposes of its business, such lands to be practically in one block, but may be divided by a street, and not to exceed twenty acres in all. In addition to these lands the company may hold, for the purposes of its business, and upon the same terms, a lot of land on the water front north of the Intercolonial Round House, Richmond, and not exceeding five acres, provided no tolls or wharfage are charged in connection therewith. At the expiry of the ten years the city agrees that the total yearly value for the assessments on such lands, buildings, plant and stock shall, for a further period of ten years, not exceed fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars, the foregoing exemption not to apply to the ordinary water rate for fire protection, nor to the rate for water used by the company, which shall be charged at the minimum rate charged other manufacturing concerns.\nAfter some general provisions authorizing the construction and maintenance of sewers, the city charter prescribes the liability of owners of property adjoining them. The important section is No. 600, which is in these words:\u2014 (1) Whenever any public sewer is built in any street every owner of any real property on either side of the street, fronting on such sewer in the manner provided in the next succeeding section, shall be liable to pay to the city towards the construction of such sewer, the sum of one dollar and twenty-five cents for each lineal foot of his property so fronting.\n(2) The remainder of the cost of such construction shall be borne by the city.\nSection 605 defines what properties shall be considered as fronting on a sewer and liable to contribute to its cost.\nSections 602 and 603 provide for a filing by the city engineer on the completion of the sewer of a plan of the properties liable, which is made conclusive evidence of\nthe liability of every person named therein in respect to the property of which he is therein stated to be the owner,\nand which amount is constituted a lien. This liability and lien may be\ncollected and enforced in the same manner and with the like remedies as by the charter are provided in respect to the rates and taxes of the city.\nFinally section 605 enacts that the city collector shall retain from the proceeds of the sale of any property for rates and taxes the amount due in respect to such land for the construction of any public sewer or private drain.\nThe language of these sections would appear to differentiate clearly between municipal rates and taxes for which the general body of the ratepayers is liable, and the obligation to contribute to the cost of sewers and private drains imposed by the legislature on those whose property is specially benefited. And there lies, in my opinion, the crux of this case. Can that distinction be successfully made, and if it exists, what is the effect of it on the claim to exemption? The sewer in question was, no doubt, like all sewers in a city, to some extent a public necessity as well as a private advantage to the owners of property fronting on it, and, therefore, the cost was distributed by section 600 of the charter between the general body of ratepayers and those immediately benefited.\nIn so far as the cost of construction bears upon the general body of the taxpayers, because the sewers meet a public necessity, one might say that the company would be exempt; \u2014 it is unnecessary, however, to decide that now, \u2014 but there is no reason to assume that it was the intention, notwithstanding section 362 referred to later, to impose on the general body of ratepayers that portion of the cost which represents the contribution due by the frontagers on the assumption presumably that their property is increased in value by the construction of the sewer to an amount at least equal to the sum they are required to pay.\nI fail to see \u2014 and I say it with all deference \u2014 how it is possible to hold that the liability imposed by the legislature on the adjoining owner to pay $1.25 for each lineal foot of his property which fronts on the sewer can be called a tax within the meaning of that word in the exemption clause. It is, of course, a burden imposed by the legislative power upon property, to raise money for a purpose public in one aspect, but private in so far as it specially benefits the property of those called upon to contribute, and in so far as it effects that private purpose, can it be said to be a tax? The obligation to pay does not arise under a city by-law or ordinance and there is no rating or assessment. To \u201cassess\u201d means to consider and determine the whole amount necessary to be raised by rate (Lord Esher, in Mogg v. Clark[9]). There is not even ratability dependent upon the extent of the benefit derived by the property. If it fronts on the sewer under the terms of section 601, the liability is absolute. In that view, and bearing in mind that taxation is the rule, and exemption the exception, can it be fairly said that, when the agreement authorizing the city to give the company total exemption from taxation for ten years was approved of by the legislature, it was intended that such exemption would include this special contribution to the city towards the construction of the sewer? Such a contention is so inequitable that it must be irresistible to be accepted. Where the legislature exempts any description of property from contributing to the local requirements, it is simply increasing the taxation on the other ratepayers, and such an intention is not to be lightly assumed. The provision in section 362(3) of the city charter that nothing contained in the charter itself shall be construed \u201cto exempt any company, firm or individual from liability for paying any street enlarging, any sidewalk, constructing any sewer, or other betterment\u201d cannot be easily conciliated with any such intention.\nFurther, it must be now considered as established that nothing but an express legislative exemption from rates can authorize that exemption. The exemption must be expressed, none can be implied, and if there be any doubt that interpretation will be adopted which least tends to impose unequal public burthens. (2 M. & G. 134-165; 11 East 675-785.) To repeat myself, I cannot find in the agreement an expressed intention on the part of the corporation to exempt the company from the special contribution imposed by the legislature on all frontagers as well as from the burden of ordinary municipal taxation. It was argued here that the proviso in relation to the fire protection rate and the rate for water used by the company is in the nature of an exemption and excludes all other exceptions or impositions of a similar nature from the exemption. I think the proviso was inserted probably ex majori cautel\u00e2 under the idea that the provisions of the Act might possibly otherwise include the subject-matter of the proviso. As pointed out in respondent\u2019s factum there are, in addition, substantial reasons why the proviso was usefully inserted and full effect can be given to it without stretching it in the extraordinary manner contended for. The water rates of the City of Halifax are made up of two distinct parts. There is first a fire protection rate, imposed upon all real property in the city, occupied or unoccupied, and rated upon the assessed values, and, therefore, in form at least analogous to the general rates and taxes, and is dealt with in the part of the charter dealing with taxation, and it was only a reasonable measure of precaution to provide that these should not be included in the exception. There is also the consumption rate, now based, in the case of manufacturing concerns, entirely on the consumption as shewn by meters. These rates vary in amount, and the second part of the saving clause is really an agreement on the part of the city, in addition to the exemption from taxation, to give the company the benefit of its minimum rates. The exception in the agreement of the ordinary water rate for fire protection and of the rate for water used by the company confirms me in the conviction that the exemption was limited to rates imposed for the general purposes of the city and does not include such charges as are incurred for some special service given for the particular benefit of the individual ratepayer. That exemption from taxation does not include betterment charges, has been definitively decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in two very carefully considered judgments, in both of which it was held that an exemption from taxation is to be taken as an exemption simply from the burden of ordinary taxes, taxes proper, and does not relieve from the obligation to pay special assessments: Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. City of Decatur[10]; Ford v. Delta and Pine Land Go.[11].\nThese cases go much further than it is necessary to go in this case. Here there is neither an ordinary tax nor a special assessment. These decisions are not, it is quite true, authorities in our courts, but as Lord Herschell said, in Gas Float Whitton (No. 2), (1897)[12]:\u2014\nThe opinions and reasoning of the learned judges of courts in the United States have always been regarded with respectful consideration and have often afforded valuable assistance.\nI distinguish this case from Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Montreal[13], upon which so much reliance was placed here. The exemption in that case, as Strong J. said, was made to turn on the single point whether the assessment or charge in respect of a contribution to the drain was or was not \u201ca municipal assessment,\u201d and he held that the Seminary was undoubtedly assessed by the city in respect of the contribution and, therefore, came within the terms of the exemption enactment. In that case the by-law provides that the cost of the sewer is to be borne and paid by the owners of real estate on each side of the street by means of a special assessment to be made and levied upon the owners of real estate, and it was to cover that special assessment that the suit was brought. No reference is made to the point on which this case was decided below, namely, that the assessment was not imposed for the general purposes of the city, but for one particular purpose only, except possibly by Fournier, J., who says, in Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Montreal[14]:\u2014\nLa distinction que fait l\u2019intim\u00e9e entre les taxes ordinaires etannuelles aurait pu \u00eatre soutenable en vertu de l\u00e0 sec. 3 de l\u2019acte 38 Vict.\u2014ou ces expressions paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es dans le but de limiter les effets d\u2019exemptions. Les cotisations sp\u00e9ciales pour fins purement l\u2019ocales pourraient \u00eatre distingu\u00e9es des taxes ordinaires et annuelles, si la question \u00e9tait soulev\u00e9e ici \u00e0 propos d\u2019institutions de charit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es dans la sec. 3, et si elle devait \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e d\u2019apr\u00e8s cette loi. La sec. 26 qui doit servir de r\u00e8gle pour la d\u00e9cision de cette question ne fait aucune distinction quelconque entre les taxes ou sp\u00e9ciales ou g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, elle se sert dans son sens le plus large des mots cotisations municipales, en ajoutant quelque soit l\u2019acte ou charte en vertu duquel elles soient impos\u00e9es. Il me semble qu\u2019il est tout \u00e0 fait impossible de trouver dans ces expressions la possibilit\u00e9 de faire la distinction que l\u2019intim\u00e9e essaie de faire pr\u00e9valoir. Les termes employ\u00e9s sont d\u2019une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 si complete et si absolue qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas \u00e0 se m\u00e9prendre sur leur signification \u2014 \u201ctoutes cotisations municipales\u201d \u2014 comprends toutes cotisations municipales quelqu\u2019en soient la nature.\nThat judgment is not an authority on the point raised here.\nIt is worth mention that the Chief Justice, who was with the majority in Wylie v. City of Montreal[15], dissented in this case.\nAs to the effect of the remarks of the Privy Council on refusing leave to appeal, I trust I may be permitted to call attention to the following points:\u2014\nThe court was evidently speaking only with reference to the Quebec statutes and their Lordships did not even refer to the provisions of the Montreal charter which they expressly state had not been laid before them. Consequently they were apparently under the impression that the sewer charges were rates in the same way as the yearly rates and taxes, and were described as rates or taxes, and that the only distinction between them and the ordinary taxes was that the former were local in application and the latter general. A case such as the present was apparently not in their minds, and the English system of municipal taxation is so different from that which prevails in the United States and Canada that such a case as this would not naturally present itself to them. Further, the reasons given in refusing leave to appeal are not equivalent to a judgment on the main question but only reasons why it was not so abundantly clear that the judgment below was so wrong as to induce the court to allow a further appeal. This is particularly clear from the last paragraph of the judgment in which their Lordships expressly leave open, and almost invite, a direct appeal on the question involved, which they would hardly have done if they had intended their remarks to indicate a definite opinion. Since the Montreal case this question has been much discussed in the United States. It is most probable that the Privy Council would not to-day wish its observations made on refusing leave to appeal to be viewed as a direct disagreement with the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States reaffirmed on further consideration and concurred in by the practically unanimous judgment of the State courts, especially on a matter with which the American courts have such ample experience, and the English none. Idington J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the interpretation of a sentence in a contract between the parties concerned, which reads as follows:\u2014\n1. The city will grant the company a total exemption from taxation for ten years on its buildings, plant and stock, and on the land on which its buildings used for manufacturing purposes are situated, or immediately connected with the same, and used exclusively for the purposes of its business, such lands to be practically in one block, but may be divided by a street, and not to exceed twenty acres in all.\nThis was confirmed by the legislature enacting thus:\u2014\n4. The exemption from taxation of the property of the said company set out in the Memorandum of Agreement is hereby confirmed.\nA tax is attempted to be imposed notwithstanding this comprehensive language upon appellant and its lands thus exempted to enforce a contribution in aid of the construction of a sewer.\nIt is attempted to be supported by references to a line of American authorities which cannot bind us. These authorities are the result partly of a development of constitutional limitations relative to taxation and partly of other causes unnecessary to dwell upon, and hence possess no weight here.\nThen, again, it is urged that the contract must be limited by the use of the word \u201ctaxation\u201d in the respondent\u2019s charter.\nEven if the charter is to be taken as a guide I see no justification therein for the perversion of such express language as quoted above. Besides it would be slightly inconvenient for the people in the rest of Canada, where similar contracts are very numerous, to have a declaration of this court that such plain ordinary language in a contract for exemption from taxation is to be read in light of what the respondent\u2019s charter contains or any other charter might contain.\nIf the respondent had desired such or any other limitation it should have expressed it in the contract. Indeed, it has expressly made exception therein relative to water rates for fire protection and rates for water used by the company and shewn thereby what limitations it desired to have inserted.\nThe former like levies for sewer construction is by respondent\u2019s charter made a local rate affecting properties within a certain distance from water-pipe lines, and the latter though in truth supposed to be for a service and thus probably distinguishable from the ordinary notion of a tax is yet made collectable as if a tax or rate.\nSo carefully was the contract framed in these regards that one would have supposed anything else having the like semblance to taxation should, if desired, have been provided against.\nThe language used is plain and so clear and comprehensive and given by the statute such effect that it thereby overrides anything in the city charter, which ingenuity might suggest as in conflict with the right appellant asserts.\nThe charter itself has express provision that specific exemptions made therein are not to extend to taxes of this kind.\nAnd if the aldermen, when they came to frame a contract with strangers, knew the terms of the charter so well as counsel seeks to persuade us they must have known them, I submit, they would have followed the example in that instrument and put a like provision in this contract; if in truth such was their purpose, which I gravely doubt. It is more probable that sewers were not expected by these staid gentlemen to come into fashion for ten years in the district chosen for the factory site in question.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and judgment be entered accordingly pursuant to the terms of the stated case.\nDuff J.\u2014By an agreement entered into between the appellant company and the respondent corporation it was provided that the company should enjoy \u201ca total exemption from taxation\u201d in respect of certain lands, for a specified period, and it was further stipulated that this exemption was \u201cnot to apply to the ordinary water rate for fire protection nor to the rate for water used by the company,\u201d and this agreement was confirmed by an Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia. In the year 1908 the corporation constructed a public sewer along Clifton street opposite the lands which were the subject of the agreement. By section 600 of the charter of the corporation it is provided that\nwhenever a public sewer is constructed in any street in the city owners of real property fronting on such sewer are liable to pay to the corporation towards such construction the sum of $1.26 for each foot of such property.\nBy another provision of the charter the payment of this sum is made a charge upon such property. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has held that this impost is not a tax within the contemplation of the agreement and consequently that the \u201ctotal exemption from taxation\u201d provided for thereby does not relieve the appellant company from liability to pay it, and the corporation appeals. With great respect I am unable to agree with the opinion of the court below. The ground upon which the judgment appears to proceed is this: The payment exacted by section 600 of the corporation\u2019s charter is, it is said, in the nature of a contribution for services done by the corporation in constructing a work which constitutes an improvement or betterment in respect of the property charged with the payment; and this sort of contribution, it is said, is not within the purview of the agreement. I do not think there is any principle upon which the plain language of the agreement can be thus restricted. It was not, I think, seriously argued that the contribution required by section 600 is not a \u201ctax\u201d within the ordinary meaning of the word. On that point at all events it appears to me that the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong in Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Suljnce v. City of Montr\u00e9al[16], and the reasoning of Lord Watson published in the same volume at page 409 are conclusive. As Lord Watson says, powers to execute such works as sewers\nare entrusted to municipal bodies, presumably in the interest of the public, and not for the interest of private owners, although the latter may be benefited by their exercise. Prim\u00e2 facie, their Lordships see no reason to suppose that rates levied for improvement of that kind are not municipal taxes.\nThe fact that the sum levied upon each proprietor is fixed according to the length of the frontage of his property instead of varying with the assessed value of it can make no possible difference; nor can it matter in the least that the payment is required and the amount of it fixed by a specific provision of the corporation charter instead of being left to the discretion of the governing body of the municipality.\nThere are, moreover, two circumstances which appear to me to lend very substantial support to the view that the phrase \u201ctotal exemption from taxation\u201d is not in this agreement used in the restricted sense contended for by the corporation:\u2014\n1. The stipulation that the exemption is not to apply to the ordinary water-rate for fire protection nor to the rate for water used by the company clearly indicates, in my opinion, that sums levied as special rates for services which municipalities ordinarily perform were not regarded as necessarily excluded from the exemption the agreement has provided for. This principle of construction has been acted upon frequently in agreements relating to taxes; see Haslett v. Sharman[17], at page 439.\n2. In the charter of the corporation itself sections 335, 341, 362-3 indicate that a statutory exemption from taxation was regarded by the legislature as prima facie extending to such contributions.\nCounsel for the respondent rested largely upon certain decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The decisions of that court are, of course, entitled to the highest respect; but I think we should be going altogether too far if we should accept them as necessarily conclusive upon the meaning of a not uncommon English phrase used in a contract made in this country and especially when they are in conflict with opinions expressed by the Privy Council and by this court as to the normal effect of such words.\nAnglin J.\u2014The matter for determination in this action is the proper interpretation of an exemption clause in an agreement between a municipal corporation and an industrial company. The question is whether a sewer rate of $1.25 per foot frontage imposed on the appellant company, under the authority of section 600 of the charter of the City of Halifax, is taxation, within the meaning of that word as used in the provision of the agreement whereby the city assured to the Silliker Company (whose rights and privileges are now vested in and enjoyed by the appellant, 2 Geo. V. (N.S.), ch. 41) \u2014 a total exemption from taxation for ten years on its buildings, plant and stock and on the land on which its buildings used for manufacturing purposes are situate.\nThe rate in question is what is generally known as a local improvement or betterment rate. In considering whether such a rate should be included in a \u201ctotal exemption from taxation,\u201d we are not embarrassed by the difficulty which affects many of the American courts in dealing with similar questions, namely, that, because of a constitutional provision that taxation must be uniform and equal and levied in proportion to the value of the property taxed, local improvement rates, especially when imposed as a fixed charge per foot of frontage on the improvement, are not deemed to be covered by the word \u201ctaxation\u201d unless the context makes such a construction of it practically inevitable. For that reason most of the American cases in which it has been held that local improvement rates do not fall within a general exemption from taxation were so decided. The American courts have, however, recognized a difference between exemptions provided for in what are called general tax Acts and those granted by special agreements, or by private Acts of the legislature, such as we are now dealing with. The constitutional difficulty is not deemed so formidable in this latter class of cases.\nAs put by Mr. Justice Brewer, in delivering the judgment of the United States Supreme Court, in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. City of Decatur[18], at page 203:\u2014\nIt is said that it is within the competency of the legislature, having full control over the matter of general taxation and special assessment, to exempt any particular property from the burden of both, and that it is not the province of the courts, when such entire exemption has been made, to attempt to limit or qualify it upon their own ideas of natural justice. * * * This is undoubtedly true. So we turn to the language employed in granting this exemption to see what the legislature intended.\nI find nothing in the agreement (which was confirmed by 7 Edw. VII. (N.S.), ch. 70, sec. 4), to restrict the application of the word taxation. On the contrary the express exception from the exemption of \u201cthe ordinary water rate for fire protection\u201d and of \u201cthe rate for water used by the company\u201d rather indicates that the word \u201ctaxation\u201d is employed in its most extended meaning \u2014 a meaning wide enough to include even a rate imposed as a payment for water actually consumed by the company. The word \u201ctotal\u201d by which the exemption is qualified implies an intention to relieve from every charge in the nature of a tax, however imposed. There is, in my opinion, no substantial distinction between this case and Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice de Montr\u00e9al v. The City of Montreal[19], where it was held that an exemption\nfrom municipal and school assessments whatever may be the Act in virtue of which such assessments are imposed and notwithstanding all dispositions to the contrary.\nincluded exemption from a local improvement rate levied for sewer construction. The same view as to the effect of a general exemption from taxation was taken by the Court of Common Pleas of Upper Canada in Haynes v. Copeland (1868)[20]. The reasoning of the learned judge who decided this case does not, however, impress me as convincing.\nThe argument of Wells J., in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Harvard College v. Aldermen of Boston[21], at pages 482- 486, answers the contention that the rate here in question should not be deemed \u201ctaxation\u201d within the meaning of that word in the exempting provision of the agreement because it is a special or local rate and is levied according to the frontage of the land abutting on the improvement and not according to its value. In French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co.[22], at pages 343-4, the following passage from Mr. Dillon\u2019s work on Municipal Corporations is quoted by the court with approval:\u2014\nThe courts are very generally agreed that the authority to require the property specially benefited to bear the expense of local improvements is a branch of the taxing power or included within it. * * * Whether the expense of making such improvements shall be paid out of the general treasury or be assessed upon the abutting or other property specially benefited, and, if in the latter mode, whether the assessment shall be upon all property found to be benefited or alone upon the abutters, according to frontage or according to the area of their lots, is, according to the present weight of authority, considered to be a question of legislative expediency.\nIt is true that local improvement rates are declared by section 603 of the charter of the City of Halifax \u201cto constitute a lien upon the land\u201d benefited and that they are for some purposes to be regarded as incumbrances rather than as taxes. But, as is pointed out in the Ontario case cited by counsel for the respondent, which is one of a series of decisions where local improvement rates were so treated, they are, nevertheless, \u201ccharges in the nature of taxes.\u201d Armstrong v. Auger[23], at page 101.\nWith great respect for the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, I am of the opinion that the imposition in question is taxation from which, under the terms of the agreement invoked by the appellants, they are entitled to be exempted. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and below.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E. P.

The policies provided for a return of premiums \u201cfor every thirty days of unexpired time if this policy be cancelled.\u201d Before any of the premium notes matured the policyholders were notified that the company had been put into liquidation at the instance of the Insurance Commissioner, the notice stating that the legal effect was \u201cto cancel all outstanding policies.\u201d In an action by the receiver in the company\u2019s name to enforce payment on the notes:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed against (46 N.S. Rep. 7) that the decision of the case must be governed by the law of Massachusetts; that the holder of a policy in a mutual company being both insurer and insured the notes sued on were assets for distribution among the creditors; and the receiver was, therefore, entitled to recover the full amount.\nHeld, also, that a cancellation resulting from the action of the State was not a cancellation within the meaning of the above clause providing for return of premium. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiff company was incorporated in 1853 by the legislature of Massachusetts for the purpose of carrying on marine insurance \u201con the mutual principle\u201d subject to the laws of the State then existing, and all subsequent laws in force relating to such insurance companies.\nThe company successfully carried on business for many years; but on the nineteenth day of March, 1908, at the instance of the insurance commissioner under the Massachusetts statute (chapter 76, Acts of 1907) its affairs were placed in the hands of a receiver and its officers and agents were enjoined from further proceeding with the business of the company. This proceeding cancelled all policies.\nIn the late fall of 1907 and the early part of 1908, the respondent Pickles had insured a number of vessels in the company and had given his notes for the premiums aggregating thirty-five hundred and fifteen dollars and ninety-two cents ($3,515.92).\nThere were many similar transactions of the company both in Massachusetts and the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and the question arose after the receiver\u2019s appointment as to his right to collect in full the outstanding premium notes, and as to the right of policy holders who had paid their premiums in cash or who had paid premium notes maturing before the date of receivership to recover back pro rat\u00e2 returns in the State of Massachusetts. A number of actions were brought at the instance of the receivership and the result of the litigation is reported in the case of Hill v. Baker[2].\nSubsequently actions were brought in Nova Scotia in the name of the company at the instance of the receiver of which the Pickles and Smith cases (now on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada) are two which have been tried, and another case not under appeal was also tried and abides the result of these appeals.\nThe following defences were raised in Nova Scotia:\n(1) That the company when it entered into the insurance contracts, held itself out as solvent, whereas it was insolvent to the knowledge of its officers, and was fraudulently carrying on business, and that, therefore, it could not recover on the premium notes or on any contracts.\n(2) That there was no consideration for the notes.\n(3) That the makers were liable only for the proportion of the premium accruing pro rat\u00e2 from the date of the note up to the date of the receivership.\n(4) That the contracts of the company, including the premium notes, were illegal and void because the company had not kept up as required by the Massachusetts statute a deposit of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), which had to be subscribed before the company could commence to do business and which it was required to maintain.\nThe actions were tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Meagher, who gave judgment in favour of the company. Defences one and four were then principally relied upon, although the others were argued and are dealt with briefly by the learned judge. On the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia defences (1) and (2) were not pressed, and the findings and judgment of the trial judge on those defences are not now in question. The defendant urged, however, defences (3) and (4), and especially that by reason of a provision in the Pickles policy as follows: \u201cThe consideration for this insurance is hereby fixed at the rate of 9\u00bc per cent. To return \u2014\u2014 per cent. for every thirty days of unexpired time if this policy be cancelled,\u201d and in the Smith policy the same except that the \u2014\u2014 for return was filled in with a specified percentage, 75 per cent., the defendant could only be held for payment pro rat\u00e2 of premium up to date of the receivership, the contention being that the appointment of the receiver was a cancellation of the policy contemplated by the foregoing excerpt.\nThe appeal was heard by Justices Graham, Russell and Drysdale. Mr. Justice Russell delivered the judgment of the court (Graham J. concurring) affirming the right of the plaintiff company to recover the full amount of the notes, while Mr. Justice Drysdale dissented, acceding to the contention of the defendant just mentioned.\nHellish K.C. for the appellants. Hill v. Baker[3] and similar American cases deal with insurance policies which do not contain the return premium clause. Consequently, they have no application to this case.\nThe permanent fund required by the Massachusetts statute to protect policy holders was not kept up. The issue of the policies to Pickles and Smith was, on that account, unauthorized and even prohibited and the policies were void. Reliance Mutual Ins. Co. v. Sawyer[4]. The learned counsel referred also to Fayette Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Fuller[5], and Adam-son v. Newcastle Steam-Ship Freight Ins. Assoc.[6].\nRogers K.C. for the respondents. The cancellation mentioned in the policy must be by act of the company. The Commonwealth v. Massachusetts Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[7], per Morton J.; Hill v. Baker[8], and cases therein cited. Lion Mutual Marine Ins. Assoc. v. Tucker[9].\nHellish K.C. for the appellants\nRogers K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Russell in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in this case, adopting and applying the principle of the decision of Hill v. Baker8, with which reasons I entirely concur, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants gave their respective promissory notes by way of payments of premiums for insurances effected by the policies issued by respondent which was a mutual insurance company incorporated under and by virtue of Massachusetts statutes.\nRespondent failed to comply with said statute and during currency of these policies in question was put in liquidation by direction of the court upon the application of the authorities having supervision of such institutions.\nThese actions are brought to recover the amounts respectively unpaid by the insured.\nThe appellants each acknowledge liability for the proportionate amount earned up to the order of liquidation, but claim that beyond that no liability exists because of a clause written in each policy. This clause fixes the premium and provides for a partial \u201creturn\u201d thereof, as it is expressed, to be made on cancellation. The cancellation of the policy here in question is alleged to result by operation of law from the order for liquidation.\nThe frame of the said clause is as follows:\u2014\nThe consideration for this insurance is hereby fixed at per cent. To return per cent. for every thirty days of unexpired time if this policy be cancelled.\nIn the Pickles policy the fixed rate intended by this clause is written in with figures \u201c9\u00bc,\u201d but the rate to be returned is left blank, and in the Smith policy there is written in for fixed rate \u201c10\u201d and in the blank for return \u201c75.\u201d\nIt is conceded the insurance ceased with the suspension of the company.\nThe question raised in each case must be dependent upon the position occupied by the insured in his relation to the company. If we could treat these notes as ordinary promissory notes then something might be said in answer to the claim thereupon on the ground of a partial failure of consideration.\nThe term used is \u201cto return,\u201d and hence partial failure of consideration as usually understood relative to promissory notes is not capable of application, but even so, if no others interested than the parties hereto an equitable plea might conceivably be so framed, to avoid circuity of action, as to afford a complete answer to that part of the premium note never earned or possible now of being earned.\nThat is not, however, the actual position, for these notes are part of the security other policy holders are entitled by the law governing all concerned to look to for compensation of their losses which had been incurred before the liquidation proceedings.\nWhat right has any one giving such a promissory note for such purpose to withdraw from what he had undertaken to meet or assist up to the limit of his promise in meeting?\nBy the law constituting the company each person insured became a member of the company and entitled during the currency of his policy to take a part in its management.\nHe became at once insurer and insured. He has no more right to escape from this position than a partner with limited liability in any other venture where the fundamental principle is that what he has given or promised shall stand good for losses though he may when all losses and liabilities are satisfied be entitled to rank upon any fund left for distribution when these are satisfied.\nThen legal effect may be given the right expressed in the above clause to \u201ca return.\u201d\nFor these considerations I do not think the cancellation referred to in the clause covers the kind of cancellation resulting from the failure of the insured.\nAs to the other ground of defence that the violation of the law which led to suspension was such a fraud in itself apart from actual misrepresentation of the condition of things (of which there is no evidence) it seems to me hardly arguable.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBut lest there be ultimately a fund such as I have indicated upon which appellants may become entitled to rank, the judgment herein should not operate as an estoppel in answer to any such claim and if desired should be amended so as to avoid any such consequence by declaring it to be without prejudice to any such possible right.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent company was incorporated in 1853 by the Legislature of Massachusetts for the purpose of carrying on marine insurance \u201con the mutual principle.\u201d On the 18th of March, 1908 (the assets of the company appearing to be insufficient to meet its liabilities) the company and its affairs were placed in the hands of a receiver at the instance of the insurance commissioner of Massachusetts pursuant to certain statutory provisions (chapter 576, Acts of 1907), and its officers and agents were restrained by the same order from continuing the business of the company. In the years 1907 and 1908 each of the respondents, Pickles and Smith, insured a number of vessels in the company, and the actions out of which these appeals arise were brought by the receiver in the name of the company upon the premium notes given under these contracts of insurance. In the Nova Scotia courts judgment was given against the appellants. In this court the defence relied upon rests upon a clause found in both sets of policies in terms which in the view I take of the case may be treated as identical. In the policies issued to the appellant Pickles the clause is as follows:\u2014\nThe consideration for this insurance is hereby fixed at the rate of 9\u00bc per cent. To return per cent. for every thirty days of unexpired time if this policy be cancelled.\nIn the policy issued to the appellant Smith the blank in the second sentence is filled in, 75% being specified. The contention is that the proceedings already referred to in the Massachusetts courts constitute a cancellation of each of these policies within the meaning of this clause, and further, that the appellants are entitled to a deduction from the amount of the premium note in each case of the sum returnable by the company under the clause. In the view I take of the case it does not appear to be necessary to decide the question whether or not the order of the Massachusetts court appointing a receiver and restraining the company from further continuing its business (which admittedly had the effect of making legally impossible any payments under any of these policies in respect of losses occurring thereafter) constitutes a cancellation of the policies within the meaning of this clause. The conclusion to which I have come is this: Assuming the appellant\u2019s construction to be on this point correct, and assuming further that in the events which have happened a right to recover a proportionate part of the premium has become vested in the appellants, this right is one which they can only assert as creditors of the company in the insolvency proceedings in Massachusetts and that in the actions with which we are concerned on these appeals they are liable for the full amount of their premium notes.\nThe appellants by accepting these policies became, by the by-laws of the company of which they had notice in the policies, members of the corporation. By virtue of the contract of insurance the insured stands in a two-fold relation to the company and the other policy holders. To the extent of his own policy he is insured; to the extent of his own premium note he is an insurer in the sense that he is a holder of unpaid capital in respect of which he is entitled to share in the profits of the company, and to the extent of that capital he is liable to contribute to the discharge of the obligations of the company. That this, according to the settled law of Massachusetts, is the position of the appellants is put beyond dispute by the decision of the Supreme Court of that State in Hill v. Baker[10], and the cases therein referred to; and it is, of course, indisputable that the appellants being members of the respondent corporation their relations, as members of the corporation, to the corporation itself as well as to other members of the corporation as such, are governed by the laws of Massachusetts. By the law of that State\nthe premiums paid or absolutely agreed to be paid by the members for their policies constitute a fund for the payment of losses; and the principle is the same whether the payment is in cash or by note, so long as the policy is issued upon the mutual principle to one who by accepting the insurance becomes a member of the insurance company: Hill v. Baker10, page 308.\nThe appellants\u2019 premium notes forming part of a fund for the payment of losses, the effect of the proceedings in insolvency on general principles would be that the company being insolvent would hold this fund in trust for a distribution among its creditors, according to the order and priority ordained by the lex fori concursus: Galbraith v. Grimshaw[11], at page 512; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China v. Henderson[12], at page 513. And this appears, from the authorities referred to, to be the law of Massachusetts; see also May on Insurance (4 ed.), 1900, sec. 596.\nThe receiver is, therefore, entitled to have the premiums which the appellants have agreed to pay applied in liquidation of the company\u2019s obligations generally; and these premiums, although recovered in the name of the company, are affected by a trust for that purpose. Assuming then that the appellants have a just claim to recover a proportionate part of each premium from the company under the clauses relied upon that claim in the circumstances can only be recognized as a right to rank pro rat\u00e2 upon the assets available for the purpose of liquidating it together with other claims of equal rank, and it is a claim which must be presented and passed upon in the insolvency proceedings.\nAnglin J.\u2014The insurance policies in question should, in my opinion, be construed according to the law of the State of Massachusetts. According to that law, as proved in this case, I agree that there was not a cancellation of these policies within the meaning of the clauses in them providing for a rebate or return of premium on cancellation. For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Russell I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

He also stated the number of trees, old and new, in the orchard then on it. S., then in British Columbia, was shewn the advertisement and, after some correspondence in which B. reiterated the statements therein, came to Ontario and spent some time in inspecting the farm, which he finally purchased on B.\u2019s terms and entered into possession. Shortly after he leased the orchard for ten years, and within a day or two discovered that the farm contained over forty acres less than, and the contents of the orchard were only half of, what had been represented; also that the farm was not in the condition stated, but badly overrun with noxious weeds.\nHe, therefore, procured the cancellation of the lease of the orchard and brought action to have the sale rescinded.\nHeld, that the lease of the orchard was not, under the circumstances, an affirmance of the contract for sale which would disentitle S. to rescission; that if it were an affirmance as to the orchard the subsequent discovery of the other misrepresentations would entitle him to a decree. Campbell v. Fleming (1 A. & E. 40) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of this case are stated in the head-note. The defendant as to the shortage in acreage claimed that a parcel of thirty acres or more had been excepted from the sale as being separated from the rest of the farm and being of very little value, but he offered to convey it to the plaintiff. He also claimed that his other representations were substantially true.\nAnglin K.C. for the appellants. The respondent cannot succeed unless he proves actual fraud; Bell v. Macklin[1]; Seddon v. North Eastern Salt Co.[2]; Angelor v. Jay[3]; and this he has not done.\nThe respondent made his irrevocable election when he leased the orchard and no discovery of further facts restores his right to rescind. Campbell v. Fleming[4]; Law v. Law[5], at pages 158, 159; Frye v. Milligan[6].\nMcKay K.C. for the respondent referred to Wall v. Cockerell[7]; La Banque Jacques-Cartier v. La Banque d\u2019Epargne[8].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. To what my brother Davies says I wish merely to add this. The plaintiff complains in his demand for rescission of three distinct false and fraudulent misrepresentations not in any way connected and each calculated according to the evidence to operate on his mind as an independent inducing cause. The trial judge found in his favour on all three grounds and in the Court of Appeal it is expressly held \u201cthat the learned judge\u2019s conclusions are entirely justified\u201d by the evidence. Therein lies the distinction between this case and Campbell v. Fleming[9] so much relied on by the appellant. In that case, the contract was induced by a single representation of the vendor and the purchaser, with the knowledge of its falsity, affirmed the contract. He cannot escape if since the affirmation he discovers another particular in which the same representation departed from the truth. (Halsbury, No. 1767.)\nIt was argued here that the respondent had in some way elected to affirm the transaction, but there is no evidence to support any act of election after he became aware of the facts. The lease of the orchard is relied upon as evincing an intention to affirm or as a dealing with the land which precludes the respondent from seeking rescission. That lease has been cancelled and is now deposited in court, so there is no obstacle in the way of restoring the premises to the appellant free from any obligation arising out of the lease. Further assuming that the respondent elected to affirm with a knowledge of the facts concerning the orchard that was not the only discrepancy and the plaintiff was not debarred from relief on the other grounds if sufficient to justify rescission because he elected to affirm the contract with knowledge as to the orchard and as found by the trial judge in ignorance of the truth with respect to the other causes of rescission. The presumption of an intention to affirm does not arise out of an act done without knowledge of all the facts (Banque Jacques-Cartier v. Banque d\u2019Epargne[10], at page 118). The plaintiff may have been willing to hold to his bargain notwithstanding the misrepresentation as to the orchard, but if to that were added the deficiency in the number of acres and the presence of the noxious weeds he might take a different view of his position, and this action is the best evidence of his change of mind.\nDAVIES J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument on this appeal I was quite satisfied that the findings of fact of the trial judge, based as they were upon ample evidence and subsequently confirmed by the Court of Appeal, should not be disturbed by us.\nThe three matters upon which the trial judge found there had been fraudulent misrepresentations made which had induced the plaintiff (respondent) to purchase the appellants\u2019 farm and stock and which in his opinion justified rescission of the contract, related (1), to the quantity of land in the farm; (2) to the condition of the soil of the farm; (3) to the number of apple trees in the orchard.\nMr. Anglin strongly contended that as the true facts with respect to the condition of the farm and the number of trees in the orchard were known to the plaintiff at any rate on or about the 13th June, 1911, when he executed a lease of the orchard for ten years, he had, by that solemn act made his election, affirmed the contract, and could not afterwards revoke his election.\nIn support of his contention he relied mainly upon the case of Campbell v. Fleming, in 18349. He submitted that assuming the representations with regard to the condition of the farm and size of the orchard to have been fraudulently made and to have induced the respondent to enter into the contract, he had, never- theless, after he had gained a true knowledge of the facts relating to the fraud practised upon him, elected to confirm by granting the orchard lease, and could not afterwards, on discovering a further misrepresentation with regard to the acreage, revoke his election.\nIn the report of the case of Campbell v. Fleming[11], so strongly relied upon by Mr. Anglin, it is stated that \u201cafter the purchase of the shares\u201d (which the defendant in that case was seeking to repudiate)\nwas concluded, he discovered that the statements in the advertisement and many of the representations made to him in the course of the negotiation were fraudulent and that the whole scheme was a deception.\nThe decision of the case is based upon these facts, that the representations made to him were fraudulent and that to his knowledge \u201cthe whole scheme was a deception\u201d With this knowledge\nhe formed a new company by consolidating the shares originally purchased by him with some other property and he sold the shares in the new company thereby realizing a considerable sum of money.\nHaving thus elected to confirm what he knew to have been a fraudulent transaction, he afterwards discovered another material fraudulent misrepresentation as having been made to him, and it was held that this discovery, though only made by him after he had made his election, did not entitle him to revoke the election he had made on the ground, as put by Patterson J., that it was merely a \u201cnew incident in the fraud.\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d he said,\ncan only be considered as strengthening the evidence of the original fraud and it cannot revive the right of repudiation which has been once waived.\nNow in the case before us, I do not think the facts brought to the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge from time to time as he began cultivating the land in the spring, as to the dirty condition of the soil and the presence of large quantities of noxious weeds, would of themselves be sufficient to satisfy plaintiff that the sale of the farm to him was a fraud and a deception.\nThe evidence was of a character, no doubt, to raise grave and serious doubts in his mind as to whether he had not been deceived in the transaction, but nothing more. Then as to the lease of the orchard. It was the day after that lease was signed that he first learned from the lessees\u2019 expert of the shortage in the number of the apple trees. Even that important fact only caused him still more seriously to deliberate and consider his situation. It did not give him positive assurance that he had been the victim of a fraud.\nWhen, however, the shortage in his acreage of some 46 acres was shewn to him in the month of June \u201chis eyes were finally opened.\u201d This, he says, \u201cwas the climax.\u201d And he, within a very reasonable time afterwards, took steps to have the lease he had given cancelled and to express his election to rescind the contract for the purchase of the farm and stock.\nConsidering, as I have done, all the facts and circumstances, I am of opinion that the judgment below was right, that the principle of the decision in Campbell v. Fleming11 is not applicable to the facts of this case, that the plaintiff exercised his right of election to rescind in due time after he had found out that he had been the victim of a fraud, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014It is to be regretted that one bearing a christian name which stands almost synonymous with fidelity to truth, should in trying to sell his farm have so far forgotten himself as to describe it in terms so flagrantly false as the evidence proves. He makes these misrepresentations not only by the advertisement he put forth for all the world to read, but also by affirming in the letter he wrote to one inquiring on behalf of respondent as a possible purchaser that the advertisement was a fair description and by reiterating some of details therein.\nThe learned trial judge\u2019s findings of fact upheld by the Court of Appeal maintain the falsity of many of the material statements in these documents. And the falsity thereof invented for the purpose of inducing a purchaser to rely thereon, was clearly so fraudulent as entitled respondent on discovery thereof to a rescission of the contract unless and until he had clearly condoned the fraud.\nNot content with that, after leading respondent, living in British Columbia, to believe he was buying a three hundred acre farm, to conclude a bargain therefor subject to inspection, and to come all the way thence to Ontario to inspect it, he contrived to get him to suppose he was carrying out that bargain when he signed an agreement, which on its face specified no definite acreage, but in fact only covered about two hundred and fifty-five acres.\nHe has a shuffling story to tell about thirty or forty acres he had across the road from his farm to which he pretends such reference was made on the respondent\u2019s inspection as to justify this abstraction of that quantity of land from the bargain without any allowance therefor by way of reduction from the price. When this latter feature of his explanation is pressed on him by the learned trial judge, he says he calculated when giving him the canning factory he was giving him a good bargain.\nHe seemed to forget this canning factory was part of the very property he had advertised as in \u201cA-1\u201d state and going with the three hundred acres. And he seeks to cheapen this thirty or forty acres as comparatively worthless. Either it was part of the three hundred acres or it was not.\nIf it was part and so comparatively worthless, then the farm did not measure up to the standard in the description. And if it was not part then he never had intended selling more than two hundred and fifty-five acres, yet induced the respondent to buy that under the belief he had fraudulently induced, that it was three hundred acres.\nBesides the attempt now made in appeal to induce us to accept these excuses and infer a mutual agreement by which respondent was to abandon this thirty or forty acres or forego in some way getting what he expected, and thus reverse the findings of fact below, we are asked as a matter of law to say that the respondent had by a lease made in May of the orchard then discovered for the first time to contain only about half the apple trees represented, he had elected to abide by his bargain and overlook all this fraud or these frauds.\nThe respondent had not then discovered that in truth he had only got two hundred and fifty five acres when thinking he was getting three hundred acres.\nNor had the season so advanced as to disclose to him the fine crops of weeds he might reap. Neither the case of Campbell v. Fleming[12], relied upon to uphold this contention relative to election, nor any other case deserving to be called authority, binds us to hold in face of such facts that a purchaser so induced to rely upon such fraudulent representations and contrivance of which he knew not the falsity is to be defeated in his right to rescission by calling such an incident as this lease under such circumstances an election to adopt the contract.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIf there is any chance of too wide a meaning being attached to the word \u201cdamages\u201d in the third paragraph of the formal judgment of the trial judge, it can be amended though I do not deem it objectionable if used in the sense it ought to be.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defence upon which the appeal is based is that the respondent after knowledge of the fraud practised upon him elected not to disaffirm the sale. The act relied upon as shewing such election was the granting of a lease of the orchard for a period of seven years. I shall assume that what the respondent did in the matter of the orchard was inconsistent with an intention to disaffirm and that if the respondent had at the time he did it a knowledge of the fraud of which he had been the victim it would be sufficient evidence of an election in the sense contended for. I think the appellant has not shewn that the respondent had such knowledge. It is clear on principle that where an election is implied from conduct one essential element in the circumstances upon which the inference rests must be this. It must be shewn that at the time of the acts relied upon as evidencing the election the person to whom the election is imputed had a knowledge of such facts as would entitle him to impeach the transaction. In the case before us it must be shewn that Stocks was aware that the representations of the respondent were fraudulent representations\u2014that is to say, that they had been made with such a knowledge of their falsity or with such reckless indifference upon the subject of their truth or falsity as to form a sufficient basis for an action of deceit.\nAt the time of the execution of the lease of the orchard Stocks knew that the number of apple trees had been grossly overstated by the appellant, and he knew also that the farm was much affected by noxious weeds. He may have had his suspicions as to Boulter\u2019s entire honesty; but it is quite clear that the possibility of shortages in acreage had not then occurred to him and he had no suspicion that the whole transaction had been on Boulter\u2019s part the swindle it ultimately proved to be. It would probably seem to him to be most unlikely that the misrepresentations as to the number of apple trees\u2014so easy to expose\u2014had been made deliberately and as to the prevalence of noxious weeds that is a matter respecting which he may well have thought some exaggeration was to be expected. I think the evidence is quite consistent with the view that his discoveries in regard to these two matters did not bring home to his mind a conviction that a fraud had been practised upon him such as would entitle him to impeach the sale. In weighing Stocks\u2019s evidence upon this point the course of the action must be considered. The contention now advanced was not set up in the pleadings and the cross-examination in so far as it was directed to the conduct of Stocks, which is now relied upon seemed rather to aim at shewing that charges of fraud upon which the action was founded were the result of an afterthought. Stocks was not asked squarely at the trial to meet the objection that he had with a knowledge of his rights elected against the disaffirmance of the sale.\nThe appellants cite Campbell v. Fleming[13]. Some of the expressions attributed to the learned judges who decided that case may appear to draw the line more strictly against persons complaining of fraud than Courts of Equity have done in similar cases (compare, for example, the judgment of Lord Redesdale in Murray v. Palmer[14]); but it is quite clear that the plaintiff in Campbell v. Fleming13 had before doing what was set up as constituting an election discovered, as the report says, that the whole transaction \u201cwas a deception,\u201d With full knowledge of his right to repudiate on that ground be had dealt with the shares as his own. The case is, therefore, clearly distinguishable from the present; and the judgments when fairly interpreted by the light of the facts do not, I think, enunciate any principle at variance with the views above expressed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion to dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Aylesworth, Wright, Moss & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Johnson, McKay, Dodds & Grant.\n[1] 15 Can.

L.R. 267) which reversed the decision at the hearing (23 Ont. L.R. 598).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] which reversed the order at the hearing[3] for a writ of mandamus ordering the judge holding the scrutiny to inquire how rejected ballots had been marked, but refusing a prohibition against an inquiry as to qualification of voters.\nThe municipal corporation of West Lorne passed a by-law to prohibit the sale of liquor by retail in the village. A vote having been taken on such by-law an application was made to the County Court judge for a scrutiny, in holding which he proposed to inquire into the right of certain persons on the voters\u2019 list to cast their ballots. Application was then made to Mr. Justice Middleton for a writ of prohibition against this proceeding. He granted the writ to prohibit the judge from certifying the result of his scrutiny to the municipal council until he had ascertained how the ballots he had rejected were marked. On appeal to a Divisional Court the above order was set aside and a writ issued prohibiting the judge from certifying to the council that the by-law had not been approved by three-fifths of the electors. On further appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the last-mentioned judgment and as a result the County Court judge was left at liberty to certify that the by-law had not been appealed. An appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRaney K.C. for the appellant. The weight of authority in Ontario is against the jurisdiction claimed by the County Court judge.

St. Clair Leitch for the respondent. As to the power of the County Court judge to inquire into the qualification of electors, see the Saltfleet Case[10], per Boyd C. and Mabee and Magee JJ.\nAs to the disposition of rejected ballots the learned counsel cited In re Armour and Township of Onondaga[11], per Riddell J.; In re Duncan and Town of Midland[12], followed in In re Prangley and Town of Strathroy[13], per Sutherland J.; The Renfrew Case8, at page 87, and the opinions of the majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal in the present case.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The broad question to be decided on this appeal is: What is the nature and extent of the county judge\u2019s powers under the ballot scrutiny sections (367-372) of the \u201cOntario Municipal Act\u201d (statutes of 1903, ch. 19)? In my view it will in addition be necessary to consider: How far in the case of a tenant the voters\u2019 list is conclusive not only as to his qualification when it is certified, but also as to his right to vote at the time of the election; and the powers of the judge to inquire into the way any of the votes were cast. The decisions in the provincial courts are numerous and have not been consistent.\nThose sections (367-372) in substance provide that, upon reasonable grounds, the county judge may direct a \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers\u201d (369) and, upon their inspection, and the hearing of such evidence as he may deem necessary, he shall in a summary manner determine \u201cwhether the majority of the votes given is for or against the by-law and forthwith certify the result to the council\u201d (371). With respect of all matters arising upon the scrutiny, the judge possesses the like powers and authority as are possessed by him upon a trial of the validity of the election of a member of a municipal council (372).\nThe ultimate object of the proceedings authorized by those sections is, in the concluding words of section 371, to enable the judge \u201cto determine in a summary manner whether the majority of the votes given is for or against the by-law and to forthwith certify the result to council,\u201d and to that end he is required not only to \u201cinspect the ballot papers\u201d for the purpose of counting the votes recorded on those ballot papers as in the case of a recount, but he is in addition \u201cto hear such evidence as he may deem necessary\u201d to enable him to give his certificate to the council. It would not be necessary to hear evidence if his duty was merely to recount the good ballots in the box, but he is directed to ascertain and report whether the will of the majority of those qualified to speak,\u2014i.e., the electors (sec. 338)\u2014as signified by their ballots, is for or against the by-law, and for that purpose it may be necessary to hear evidence on matters connected with the right to vote, although external to the ballot which is merely the paper record of the fact that a person voted. Section 372 vests the judge with the like powers and authority as to all matters arising upon the scrutiny as are possessed by him upon a trial of the validity of the election of a member of a municipal council. These are powers which one would not expect to find given to a judge to enable him to recount the ballot papers. This further observation is suggested by the use of the word scrutiny in this section. A scrutiny is an entirely distinct proceeding from a recount; it is an inquiry into the validity of the votes.\nThe object of a scrutiny is to ascertain who has had the majority of the legal votes,\nHalsbury, vol. 12, page 454, No. 883, and that being the accepted meaning of the word in England, from which country our whole system of elections by ballot is very largely borrowed, it is binding upon us.\nThe difficulty, however, arises out of the use of the expression \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers\u201d in section 369, and of the words \u201cinspection of the ballot papers\u201d in section 371. It is argued that the legislature must have intended when it used the word \u201cscrutiny\u201d and \u201cinspection\u201d in collocation with \u201cballot papers\u201d to give those words a restricted meaning and to limit the duty and power of the judge to a mere inspection of the ballot papers with respect to their physical aspect. This construction, I respectfully submit, defeats the object of the \u201cscrutiny\u201d or the \u201cinspection.\u201d How, as I said before, could the judge comply with the terms of the statute and certify to the council whether the majority of the legal votes given and not of the ballots cast is for or against the by-law, if he cannot go beyond the ballot papers? It is the assent of the electors of the municipality that gives effect to the by-law (338\u2014sec. 141 \u201cLiquor License Act\u201d), and the elector is the person entitled for the time being to vote in respect of the by-law. Sec. 2, sub-sec. 5. Throughout the several Acts we have to consider \u201cvotes\u201d and \u201cballot papers\u201d are frequently used as convertible terms, as, for instance, in section 189, which provides for the recount. There the judge is directed to count \u201call the votes or ballots returned,\u201d and in some places the electors are said to have marked their \u201cvotes\u201d and in others their \u201cballot papers.\u201d The judge it is also said recounts \u201cthe votes\u201d on proof that the returning officer improperly counted the \u201cballot papers.\u201d Referring to the sections of the Act grouped under the caption of \u201cThe Poll,\u201d it will be found, one may fairly say, that the ballot papers are generally described as votes when they are deposited in the box. All those who have a voice at the polls are called voters; they express their choice by the means of the ballot papers which when used and deposited in the box are called votes. (Secs. 350, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 361.) The deputy returning officer at the close of the poll is not required, for instance, by section 361 to count and state in writing the number of ballots given, but the number of votes, and what the council desires to know is the will of the majority of the voters. This further observation occurs to me assuming that the words used in section 369 were \u201cscrutiny of the votes\u201d instead of \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers,\u201d what difference would there be in the nature of the duty imposed on the judge? He could only ascertain the majority of the legal votes by the aid of the ballots which are the only record; there are no votes to scrutinize or inspect except those recorded on the ballot papers, so that ultimately the use of these words would lead to the same result. I am fortified in the conclusion at which I have arrived by an examination of the history of the legislation which is exhaustively and lucidly set forth by Magee J., in the Saltfleet Case[14], and in Idington J.\u2019s notes in this case. I have not, of course, overlooked the judgment of this court in Chapman v. Rand[15], but I distinguish for the reasons given by Magee J., in the Saltfleet Case14.\nThe next question has reference to the qualification of leaseholders entitled to vote. In other words: How is their right to vote determined? I have much difficulty in reaching a conclusion on this point. As a general rule the voters\u2019 list is conclusive as to the right to vote, but par. 2 of sec. 24, of the \u201cVoters\u2019 List Act,\u201d read with sec. 86 of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act,\u201d makes an exception in that continuous residence in the municipality up to the time the poll is held is made a condition of the exercise of that right by a tenant. This fair construction of the language of that section is confirmed by reference to section 357 of the Act, which provides for the form of oath the leaseholder must take if required. That form may, I think, be fairly taken as the construction put by the legislature upon section 24. Those only are qualified to vote who can take that oath, and one of the qualifications required is residence within the municipality for one month next before the vote.\nFinally, I am of opinion that the judge has not got the right to inquire into the way any of the votes were cast. If the number of votes improperly cast is found to be greater than the majority in favour of the by-law and it is not possible to ascertain, without violating the secrecy of the ballot as admitted by all the judges, except Middleton J., whether or not those illegal votes constitute that majority, how can the judge report that the by-law was adopted or defeated by the required three-fifths of the legal votes cast? The result is, I admit, most unsatisfactory, in as much as it enables one who has no right to vote to cast his ballot against the by-law as pointed out by Mr. Justice Middleton. But if that incongruous result follows on the application of settled legal principles to the construction of the statute, the remedy is with the legislature that has attempted to apply a procedure devised for the contestation of municipal elections to a case in which the question at issue is whether or not the requisite majority of the legal votes is for or against a by-law. As the learned Chief Justice in appeal very properly observes, this case vividly illustrates the dangers attendant upon legislation by reference.\nI would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The questions arising on this appeal relate to the ambit or extent of the jurisdiction of the County Court judge under the provisions of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act of 1903,\u201d of Ontario, sections 369 to 372, when holding a scrutiny on the result of the voting of the electors of a municipality on a by-law submitted for their approval.\nIn the case before us, the pith of the dispute lies in the answer to be given to the question whether or not the County Court judge, when holding such scrutiny, has any, and if any, what power to go behind the voters\u2019 list, and examine into, and determine the legality of any vote cast except upon grounds apparent ex facie of the ballot papers. There has been much judicial difference of opinion on the question and the judgment of the appeal court now before us, Meredith J.A. dissenting, upholds the contention that on such a scrutiny as the County Court judge is authorized to hold he is empowered to enter into a general scrutiny of the votes polled, and is not limited to a scrutiny of the ballot papers only.\nAfter a careful examination and comparison of the different statutes which create, control and determine the County Court judge\u2019s jurisdiction, I have reached the conclusion that the sections in question of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act,\u201d 1903, 369 to 372, confer only a limited jurisdiction upon the County Court judge, expressly confined to a \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers,\u201d and which does not entitle him to inquire into the validity of any vote cast except upon grounds apparent ex facie of the ballot papers.\nThis is the opinion of Meredith J.A., and one of his grounds for dissenting in the appeal, and has the support of a great many of the learned judges in Ontario before whom the question has from time to time arisen.\nThe legislature has used language in section 369 which to my mind indicates a clear intention of limiting the powers of the County Court judge to a \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers\u201d only, and precludes an inquiry into the right of a voter upon the voters\u2019 list to vote. The judge was not to hold a general scrutiny, or a scrutiny of the \u201cvotes polled,\u201d and thus enter upon a vast field of inquiry. He was simply to enter into a \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers\u201d and determine the result in a summary way. Without reading other words into the section than those used by the legislature, I cannot see how I can put any wider construction upon the County Court judge\u2019s powers than the limited one I have mentioned. I do not think I have any such right to read any other words into the section enlarging the meaning of the words used, or in a case where plain and simple language has been used, speculate as to whether some larger or hidden meaning had not been intended to be expressed. My view is that the legislature knew just what kind of an inquiry it was authorizing and used appropriate language to express its will.\nIt is argued that this view of the jurisdiction of the County Court judge creates simply a \u201crecount\u201d and that if a recount only was intended to be granted, the well known word \u201crecount\u201d would have been used.\nI agree with Chief Justice Meredith\u2019s view of the meaning of the sections in question on this point as expressed by him in In re Orangeville Local Option By-law[16]:\u2014\nThe inquiry is, in my opinion, limited to a scrutiny of the ballot papers, and differs only from a recount in that the judge is not limited to dealing with the ballot papers ex facie, but may take evidence in the same way as may be done upon a trial of the validity of the election of a member of a municipal council (sec. 372), for the purpose of determining whether any ballot paper ought or ought not to be counted, this power being in terms limited to taking evidence as to all matters arising upon the scrutiny.\nIt was suggested that section 372 in enacting that \u201cthe judge should, on the scrutiny possess the like powers and authority as to all matters arising upon the scrutiny as are possessed by him upon the trial of the validity of the election of a member of a municipal council,\u201d shewed that a wider power than a \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers\u201d alone must have been intended to be conferred.\nIt is obvious, however, that this section is not intended to enlarge the jurisdiction conferred on the judge by section 369, but simply to invest him with all necessary powers effectively to exercise a jurisdiction already conferred and defined. It would appear to me reasonably clear that if a voter duty entered upon the voters\u2019 lists tenders himself at the polls as a voter and claims the right to vote he may be required to take the oath prescribed by law with regard to the qualification he claims to vote under, whether as a tenant, a freeholder, or otherwise. This oath embraces the statement that he is a British subject, and if he claims as a tenant, the further statement of residence in the municipality for one month before the election. If he takes the oath, he does so at his peril, and his vote is entered. If he declines to take it, his vote is, of course, refused to be taken. The question whether or not he is or was such resident is frequently one of much doubt and difficulty. But it seems to me clear that none of the questions of nationality, age, tenancy, or residence, which go to make up his qualifications to be put on the voters\u2019 list, are open for discussion or inquiry on \u201cthe scrutiny of the ballot papers\u201d which the County Court judge is authorized to hold.\nSuch questions of fact are under the \u201cOntario Voters\u2019 List Act,\u201d Ontario Stats. 1907, ch. 7, to be tried and determined before the voters\u2019 list is finally settled, and the only exceptions are those mentioned in section 24 of the Act. In re Port Arthur and Rainy River Provincial Election[17].\nThese exceptions, however, excluding the first, namely, \u201cpersons found guilty of corrupt practices at or in respect of the election in question on such scrutiny or since the list was certified by the judge,\u201d are expressly confined to persons who by reason of want of residence are \u201cunder the provisions of the \u2018Ontario Election Act,\u2019 dis-entitled to vote,\u201d or who under sections 4 to 7 of that Act are disqualified and incompetent to vote, and are not applicable to municipal elections. It is not contended that in this case any one of the four persons whose votes were disallowed by the County Court judge became disentitled to vote under the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d or were disqualified persons under that Act. I adopt the construction placed upon the language of this section by Chief Justice Meredith in In re Orangeville Local Option By-law[18], and am of opinion that it is applicable only to voting under the Ontario election law.\nThen with regard to the first exception, persons \u201cguilty of corrupt practices in respect of the election in question,\u201d it is perhaps sufficient to say that none of the votes attacked in this case were attacked on that ground.\nBut even if it were otherwise and votes had been attacked on the ground that the voters had been guilty of corrupt practices, I am utterly unable to see how, in the face of the statutory provisions guaranteeing the secrecy of the ballot, and the limited character of the scrutiny provided for, any vote could be inquired into and struck off. The \u201cGeneral Elections Act\u201d contains provisions enabling such votes to be dealt with on a general scrutiny, but it has not been suggested that any similar legislation exists with respect to municipal elections, and until that is done the provisions with regard to the secrecy of the ballot preclude any striking off of the votes of persons, even if they may be found guilty of corrupt practices, for the obvious reason that how the corrupt voter voted is unknown and cannot be inquired into. To give effect to exception one of section 24, therefore, on such a scrutiny as that now before us, further legislation would probably be necessary. As I have said, however, that question does not arise here, except indirectly.\nThe judge is, by section 369 of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d authorized to enter upon a \u201cscrutiny of the ballot papers.\u201d By section 371 he is directed, upon inspecting the ballot papers and hearing such evidence as he may deem necessary, to \u201cdetermine in a summary manner whether the majority of the votes given is for or against the by-law.\u201d His determination must be reached by the validity or invalidity of these papers and not by going behind them and entering upon an inquiry whether any of the persons on the voters\u2019 list who voted by depositing these ballot papers were entitled to vote or not. It is the \u201cvotes\u201d polled as evidenced by the ballot papers that he is to determine upon.\nIf he had the right to inquire beyond the ballot papers, then to do so effectively he must have the right to inquire how the parties voted. But section 200 prohibits any such inquiry. The secrecy of the ballot is made a matter of public policy by the statute, and cannot be waived. No inquiry, therefore, being permissible as to whether any voter voted for or against the by\u2011law, how is it possible for the county judge to determine, except from the legal and allowed ballot papers themselves, whether the majority of votes given was so given for or against the by-law? I do not think it is possible, and the plan adopted by the County Court judge in this case of deducting the disallowed votes from the total of those cast in favour of the by-law is to my mind an arbitrary, unjust and totally indefensible plan. It was suggested, but not decided, by Garrow J.A., that in some cases perhaps evidence more or less reliable might be got as to the habits and associations of the voter which might raise a presumption as to which way he had probably voted.\nI cannot assent to any such process of mere speculation or presumption.\nNo other judge has, I think, adopted the suggestion, and the very necessity which the extreme construction of the County Court judge\u2019s powers on the scrutiny compelled the learned judge to resort to, shews how unreasonable such a construction is.\nAnd still, if this extreme construction of the Act is held to be correct, while the public policy of maintaining the secrecy of the ballot is maintained in order to make such a construction workable or effective, resort must either be had to the suggestion put forward by Garrow J., and which I think absolutely indefensible, or to the conclusion reached by Middleton J., that it was competent for the judge to examine into the voters\u2019 qualifications to vote, and when he had determined adversely to that right then the secrecy which, as a matter of public policy had been placed upon the ballot, was withdrawn and the voter could be compelled to state how he had voted. I cannot find that this construction of the clauses of the Act relating to secrecy of the ballot reached by Middleton J. has received any other judicial support. I cannot concur with it, though I admit it is the logical result of accepting the enlarged construction of the County Court judge\u2019s powers on the scrutiny. The 89th section, which provides that\nno person shall be entitled to vote at any election unless he is one of the persons named or intended to be named in the proper list of voters, and no question of qualification shall be raised at any election except to ascertain whether the person tendering his vote is the person intended to be designated in the list of voters,\nand the sections 198 to 200 providing for the secrecy of the ballot, all convince me that no such conclusion is permissible. Section 200 reads:\u2014\nNo person who has voted in any election shall in any legal proceeding to question the election or return, be required to state for whom he voted.\nThis language is, to my mind, conclusive. It is not confined to those who may on a subsequent scrutiny inquiry be held to have been \u201clegally qualified voters\u201d only, but expressly applies to any person who votes, and that includes all persons named or intended to be named in the lists of voters.\nI have dwelt at some length upon these two rival suggestions of the learned Justices Garrow and Middleton, because I think on their enlarged construction of the scrutiny clause one or other is essential to the practical working out of the scrutiny, but as I have shewn, I do not agree with either suggestion.\nThat of Justice Garrow is avowedly only a partial solution of the difficulty the larger construction of the judge\u2019s powers on the scrutiny involves, and is one which I venture to say will not be adopted. That of Justice Middleton is, as I have attempted to shew, at direct variance with the language and policy of the statute.\nIf neither of these suggestions can be adopted, then I venture to think that the construction of the Act which alone is workable under existing legislation should be adopted. In my humble judgment that construction is clear and is confined to a scrutiny of the ballot papers only, and does not extend to an inquiry into the right of a duly registered voter to vote. Such a construction involves no insuperable difficulties; it assumes that the legislature well knew what it was doing when it used the language it did, and it gives effect to clear and unambiguous language without reading into the section words which are not there.\nAs the ballot paper itself is the only legal means which the County Court judge possesses to determine how the voter who deposited it intended to vote, so it is this paper alone, which if found bad or invalid, must determine from which vote, for or against the by-law, it should be deducted. The \u201cvotes\u201d he is to determine upon in a summary manner are those and those only evidenced by ballot papers found to be good ex facie.\nSumming up shortly my reasons for holding that the special jurisdiction conferred on the County Court judge by the 369th section of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act, 1903,\u201d is confined to a scrutiny of the ballot papers only; they are, first, that such a construction follows the literal words of the section relating to such scrutiny, carries out their intent and expressed object, is workable, does not contravene any of the other provisions of the statute, and is supported by a very large, if not a preponderating, judicial opinion in Ontario.\nThat the larger construction contended for is not justified by the language of the section and is unworkable, unless either by violating the public policy of the statute with regard to the secrecy of the ballot, or by resorting to the expedient of taking evidence as to the habits and associations of the voter so as to raise a presumption as to which way he probably voted, neither of which alternatives is permissible.\nThat with respect to the three exceptions to the conclusive character of the certified voters\u2019 list stated in section 24 of the \u201cVoters\u2019 Lists Act,\u201d 1907, exception one referring to persons guilty of corrupt prac- tices has nothing to do with any of the votes challenged on this scrutiny, and if it had, requires further legislation to make it effective in municipal scrutinies, while exceptions 2 and 3 relate exclusively to voting under the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d and to votes disqualified under that Act.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the Divisional Court, Exchequer Division.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014If any one desires truly to interpret a statute which is, or was when enacted, a marked innovation in existent law, he should observe the rules in Heydon\u2019s Case(1), which are quite as good to-day as three hundred years ago.\nThe first and chief question raised herein is in truth the meaning of section 369 of the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1903.\u201d\nTo comprehend properly the purpose and meaning of this section we must look at the group of sections in which we find it under the caption of scrutiny, and inquire whence they came and why they were brought into existence. They are substantially, and indeed almost literally, the same as those appearing in 39 Vict. ch. 35, entitled:\u2014\nAn Act to provide for voting by ballot on municipal by-laws requiring the assent of the ratepayers,\nand numbered therein sections 21, 22, 23 and 25, and have remained ever since as part of the \u201cMunicipal Acts.\u201d\nOther sections of the same Act appear in other parts of the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1903,\u201d relevant to the said elections.\nThis \u201cBallot Act\u201d was passed two years after vot- ing by ballot had been enacted as the method of election to the municipal councils. This latter Act had specially excepted from its operation the taking of votes of electors with respect to by\u2011laws requiring the assent of electors.\nWhy was it necessary in passing the enabling Act to provide this group of sections now in question?\nTo understand this we may profitably advert briefly to the history of legislation relative to the quashing of municipal by-laws.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in 1854, in In re C\u0153sar and Township of Cartwright[19], having apparently in earlier cases suggested the court might have a common law power over such by-laws, concluded it had none but such as given by statute.\nThe first statutory power in this regard was contained in 12 Vict. c. 81, s. 155. The language of that statutory provision pointed at illegality in the by-law as the ground upon which the courts might quash, and that was for some time held to mean an illegality on the face of the by-law.\nIt was interpreted later in such a way as to enable ratepayers to shew illegality in a variety of ways not appearing on the face of the alleged by-law; such, for example, as if a by-law required the assent of the ratepayers and yet no such vote had been taken. This was later expanded to cover the case of illegal voting or any improper taking of the vote.\nIn other words \u201cillegality\u201d seemed to be taken as synonymous with ultra vires in the widest sense of the term.\nIt is to be noted that the exercise of the power to quash had always been held, and especially so in these cases of irregularity, as in the discretion of the courts.\nAnd in Coe and Township of Pickering[20], Chief Justice Draper had questioned whether a scrutiny of the vote had ever been intended as part of the duty of the courts on a motion to quash. He pointed out that they could not sit beyond term, and within these limited periods such a proceeding seemed impracticable. That state of things continued till terms were in the old sense abolished by the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d of 1881.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, in the case of Erwin v. Township of Townsend[21] seemed to imply that illegal votes might become a proper subject of inquiry on a motion to quash.\nIndeed, the jurisdiction to quash had been the subject of so much doubt and difficulty that as late as 1885 Chief Justice Wilson, in the case of Fenton v. County of Simcoe[22] found it necessary to review the authorities in order to shew his duty to entertain what was analogous to a scrutiny.\nPreceding, yet almost concurrently with, the ballot, there had come other reforms reaching many indirect modes of bribery or corrupting the electorate in ways that had not been always considered bribery, and also acts of intimidation.\nIn accord with legislation in this regard relative to elections to the legislature, the Act of 1872, for the prevention of corrupt practices at municipal elections, 35 Vict. ch. 36, was passed, and in that was given for the first time the express statutory power to make such causes the basis of a motion to quash a by-law. The grounds open on a motion to quash were still limited, if this statute was to be taken as the guide measuring the powers the courts were given. Such a motion might not reach the cases of personation, for example. Besides, motions to quash had never been at that time very summary; and as I have said had been looked upon as dependent upon discretion.\nAnd after all this was an unsatisfactory way of reaching and remedying the evils likely to arise from any such or other misconduct, as an election for obtaining the assent of the electors to a by-law was apt to give rise to.\nIndeed, there was even with this amendment no adequate machinery then in the power of the courts for effectively reaching such cases, and all others as might be involved in and be reached by a proper scrutiny of the vote, and hence for all these reasons a better remedy for growing evils was urgently needed.\nSo when the legislature, which had paused for two years after introducing the ballot at municipal elections, decided to apply the same method of taking votes for by-law elections, it enacted above named 39 Vict. ch. 35, containing a code, as it were, consisting of twenty-eight sections relevant to the subject.\nThe County Court judges had always been, concurrently with the Superior Court judges, the duly constituted tribunals for trying and deciding cases of controverted municipal elections and so continue. There can hardly be a doubt, therefore, respecting their supposed fitness for the duties of trying any question arising on the trial of a contested election relevant to the submission of a by-law to the electors.\nThey had become accustomed to applying the laws bearing on such elections and been fully intrusted in that regard with enforcing the stringent provisions relevant thereto, and to which I have adverted; so far as bearing upon the council elections.\nI, therefore, see no reason to doubt that when the legislature enacted this new law it intended to confer on these judges to the fullest extent any and every power any tribunal might need to decide such controversies as might arise in the conduct of such an election as voting upon a by-law; at least just as extensively as they had been given power to thoroughly try and decide other municipal elections involving the same sort of questions.\nThe history and peculiar frame of the legislation indicates that much.\nSection 21 of the Act was substantially that which is now section 369 of the Act before us. It was as follows:\u2014\n21. If within two weeks after the clerk of the council which proposed the by-law has declared the result of the voting, any elector applies upon petition to the the County Judge, after giving such notice of the application and to such persons as the judge may direct, and shews by affidavit to the judge reasonable grounds for entering into a scrutiny of the ballot papers, and the petitioner enters into a recognizance before the judge in the sum of one hundred dollars, with two sureties (to be allowed as sufficient by the judge upon affidavit of justification) in the sum of fifty dollars each conditioned to prosecute the petition with effect, and to pay the party against whom the same is brought any costs which may be adjudged to him against the petitioner, the judge may appoint a day and place within the municipality for entering into the scrutiny.\nLet us turn to section 128 of the Act respecting municipal institutions as in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, and section 132 (its successor) in the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d of 1873, and compare this section which I quote with those for initiating the trial of a controverted municipal election and we see where it was got. Let us then turn to the subsequent sections in the original Act and in the Act as it stands, and we find the judge is empowered not only to inspect the ballot papers, but also to take evidence and hear the parties\nand in a summary manner determine whether the majority of the votes given is for or against the by-law and shall certify the result to the council.\nAnd it remains so in the Act before us.\nThen section 372 of the Act now in question is as follows:\u2014\nThe judge shall, on the scrutiny, possess the like powers and authority, as to all matters arising upon the scrutiny, as are possessed by him upon a trial of the validity of the election of a member of a municipal council; and in all cases costs shall be in the discretion of the judge, as in the case of applications to quash a by-law, or he may apportion the costs as to him seems just.\nThis is substantially the same as section 25 in the original Act.\nWhat can a scrutiny in such a connection mean if it does not mean the full trying out of all that can be legally tried on an election petition relative to the rights of parties to vote; and incidentally thereto in some cases, the loss or forfeiture of a vote by reason of some act which the law prohibits from being given, and surely by implication from being counted as a vote?\nEvery intelligent man of the time when this group of sections first became law had, by reason of the occurrence of a great many cases of scrutiny, come to have a pretty accurate idea of what it meant. It is necessary to understand that commonly received apprehension of the term when the Act was passed, if one would read these sections aright.\nIt had, prior to its use in this Act in 1876, a well defined meaning derived from its use in Parliamentary trials of election petitions. It had been used in the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d of Ontario, passed three years previously, and stands yet in that Act.\nIt seems amusing in light of legal history to hear an argument addressed to the court that this scrutiny must mean no more than a recount.\nA change in habit of thought does in time change the meanings of words and shades thereof. And I am now convinced from this case that a use of words changes the mode of men\u2019s thoughts.\nBut for all that I must insist upon it that a scrutiny of ballots did not, according to the notion that prevailed in 1876, and in this connection, mean the same thing as a recount. In proof thereof we have the fact that the legislature which first enacted these sections now under consideration, had during the same session in which they were enacted made the first legislative provision in Ontario for a recount of ballots; and I may, by the way, add that in doing so it used the words \u201cvotes\u201d and \u201cballots\u201d as if interchangeable terms.\nNay, more, though for or in respect of elections to the legislature it had provided a recount by a judge, it did not provide any such thing for municipal elections till six years later than the Act we are considering, when it did so by the Act of 4.6 Vict. ch. 18, sec. 162.\nMoreover, the Act of 1874, 38 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 19, sub-sec. 4, had provided for the clerk of the municipality a<s returning officer in case of dispute, breaking open the ballot packages and deciding any dispute that had arisen as to the count of ballots.\nFramed as the whole scheme of this group of sections is in outline upon the plan and with the identical powers that had long been in use for trying controverted municipal elections, can there be any doubt of its purpose? How can it be said in face of such a course of legislation amid which these sections were first enacted, that this scrutiny before a county judge was intended for or meant merely a recount? Or how can it be said that when the law was changed and power was given to have a recount by the county judge in ordinary municipal elections and the provisions for a scrutiny left standing unrepealed and in force, that they were to be reduced, in effective operation, to something less than originally intended and to be treated as a mere recount? And if these considerations do not dispose of such a contention how can it be maintained in face of section 322, sub-sections 3 and 4 (in the same Act as introduced the recount in municipal elections) which provided specially as to bonus by-laws requiring a two-fifths of the total available vote, as follows:\u2014\n(3) In case of dispute as to result of the vote, the judge shall have the same powers for determining the question as he has in any case of a scrutiny of the votes. 45 V. c. 23, s. 17.\n(4) The petition to the judge may be by any elector, or by the council; and the proceedings for obtaining the judge\u2019s decision shall be the same, as nearly as may be, as in the case of a scrutiny. 43 V. c. 27, s. 16(2)?\nThat section stands now section 366a of the present Act.\nSuch is the history of the law so far as I can find and verify it.\nThe decision we are asked to come to would gravely affect the rights of electors to have a true report made of the result not only of this sort of election relative to the liquor law, but also as to all the elections by which the Act provides for obtaining the assent of the electors to any by-law involving their money and property and especially as to the bonus by-laws which respectively require a certain specified proportion of the total votes entitled to be cast in such regard.\nWhen electors suppose that the law provides a protection in requiring that a certain percentage of the total available vote must be had, they do not turn out with the same zeal as in other cases and hence often the doors are thrown open to personation and the analogous fraud of voting when a man, though on the list, has in truth no vote.\nThis view presented by appellant, if adopted, would render all this and much more of an undesirable kind of consequence not only possible, but without the summary and reasonable remedy the scrutiny gives, drive the ratepayer to a locking of the stable after the horse has been stolen, as moving to quash the by-law would often mean.\nI do not think an Act which has stood as a shield for an honest vote and protection against fraud in by-law elections for so very long, ought to be frittered away merely because the supporters of this by-law neglected (if their pretensions be founded on fact) the obvious duty of tendering the oath to those voting where they had no right to vote.\nComing to the last question involved in the appellant\u2019s contention, it seems a remarkable one. The voters\u2019 list is the foundation of the vote taken, and but for the \u201cVoters\u2019 List Act\u201d containing section 24, no trouble could arise in the way of carrying out this scrutiny.\nThe following is the section in question:\u2014\n24. The certified list shall, upon a scrutiny, under the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d or the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d be final and conclusive evidence that all persons named therein, and no others, were qualified to vote at any election at which such list was, or was the proper list to be used, except (1) Persons guilty of corrupt practices at or in respect of the election in question on such scrutiny, or since the list was certified by the judge;\n(2) Persons who, subsequently to the list being certified are not or have not been resident either within the municipality to which the list relates, or within the electoral district for which the election is held, and who by reason thereof are, under the provisions of the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d disentitled to vote;\n(3) Persons who, under sections 4 to 7 of the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d are disqualified and incompetent to vote.\nAppellant argues that the exception in sub-section 2 forms no part of the law governing this election and has nothing to do with the matter.\nThe first part of the section is set up against scrutiny, but its limitations expressed in the exceptions are to be excluded. Needless to answer that, I imagine.\nBut we are asked, despite recent amendment in 1907, to read sub-section 2 so as to make the last member of the sentence govern the whole and say it can only refer to Ontario elections and thus render nugatory and nonsensical the first part referring to a municipality. I do not think that mode of interpretation commends itself or falls within either the latter part of the rule in Heydon\u2019s Case[23] above referred to or the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d in force here.\nI am also unable to read the language of this subsection 2 as it is said it has been read elsewhere.\nI am unable to so read that as to treat the non-resident at the time of voting as entitled to vote. If tendered the proper oath he could not take it. But his vote cannot be effectively counted, and if in the result the learned trial judge is thus disabled from reporting the by-law has been carried, he must say so.\nIt is, therefore, unnecessary to determine here anything relative to the first class of exceptions. But to support the argument of appellant excluding its opera- tion I suppose we must assume that the voting when and where a man knows he has no right to vote should not be held a corrupt, but a pious practice: Willes J. in the case of Cooper v. Slade[24], at page 773, and Baron Martin in the Bradford Election Case[25], at page 31, to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe judge cannot do the impossible thing in such a case as this. However ingenious the method adopted of counting the votes cast so as to produce a total vote and then deduct the total bad votes from the numbers reported as supporting the by-law and thus present a less than three-fifths majority, I do not agree therein, save as illustrative of possible results if voters could be sworn as to how they had voted.\nIf the law prohibits his swearing the alleged voters and forcing them to tell how they voted, as I think it does by section 200 of the Act, then there is no alternative left him but to consider, as in any other election trial, whether or not he can say there has been a valid election shewing the by-law carried.\nIf, as here, the result is that he cannot thus determine, he must say so and thus end the matter.\nThere might in many such cases be such a preponderance of votes cast in favour of the by\u2011law as to overcome any such result being necessary.\nEach case must in its result depend on these considerations according to the facts developed.\nIn this case the result is the by-law cannot be reported as carried.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal. The grounds upon which this conclusion is based are suffi- ciently stated in the judgment of Garrow J. with which I entirely agree.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014In 1876 the ballot paper was introduced in elections on municipal by-laws in the Province of Ontario (39 Vict. ch. 35). The law provided that the ballot should have a number printed on the back and should have attached a counterfoil with the number printed on the face. That numbering of the ballot made it similar to the one then used in England. At the same time it was provided that a scrutiny of the ballot papers could take place. That provision as to the scrutiny is now reproduced in section 369, chapter 19 of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act\u201d of 1903, under the heading \u201cScrutiny,\u201d and reads as follows:\u2014\nIf within two weeks after the clerk of the council which proposed the by-law has declared the result of the voting, any elector applies upon petition to the county judge * * * and shews by affidavit to the judge reasonable grounds for entering into a scrutiny of the ballot papers * * * the judge may appoint a day and place within the municipality for entering into the scrutiny.\nThe legislative and municipal elections are held on lists prepared according to the provisions of an Act known as the \u201cVoters\u2019 List Act,\u201d though the qualification of the elector in those elections are different. Thus we find in the \u201cElection Act for the Legislative Assembly,\u201d that the judges are not competent to vote (sec. 4, the \u201cOntario Election Act\u201d). However, in any municipal election those judges could vote. Their names are put on the list.\nThe \u201cVoters\u2019 List Act\u201d which is now contained in chapter 4 of the statutes of 1907, declares in its section 24 what is the effect of those lists upon a scrutiny as follows:\u2014 24. The certified list shall upon a scrutiny, under the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d or the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d be final and conclusive evidence that all persons named therein, and no others, were qualified to vote at any election at which such list was, or was the proper list to be used, except\n(1) Persons guilty of corrupt practices at or in respect of the election in question on such scrutiny, or since the list was certified by the judge;\n(2) Persons who, subsequently to the list being certified are not or have not been resident either within the municipality to which the list relates, or within the electoral district for which the election is held, and who by reason thereof are, under the provisions of the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d disentitled to vote;\n(3) Persons who, under sections 4 to 7 of the \u201cOntario Election Act,\u201d are disqualified and incompetent to vote. R.S.O. 1897, c. 7, s. 24.\nIn the last few years the \u201cBallot Act\u201d was amended and the numbering of the ballot on its back has disappeared as a result of the amendment.\nA scrutiny has taken place in this case in a municipal by-law election. The County Court judge has proceeded to inquire as to the residential qualifications of a certain number of voters. Four of them were found to have the same residential qualification as that which they had when the lists were made. And the judge, although not able to ascertain now for whom those people had voted, because their ballots were not numbered as formerly, proceeded, nevertheless, to deduct their votes from the number given in favour of the by-law. As a result of that subtraction he found that the by-law had not the necessary majority and declared it had not carried.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed that decision of the County Court judge.\nI may say that I am not able to concur in that view. I am of the opinion that the County Court judge had no authority first to inquire upon a scrutiny in a municipal election as to the residential quali- fication of electors and secondly that even admitting that he could make such inquiry, the law does not give him the power to deduct those votes from the votes given in favour of the by\u2011law.\nThe scrutiny is well known in Great Britain. It is a procedure on the trial of an election petition by which the petitioner claiming the seat must put himself in a majority by adding sufficient votes to his own poll or by striking off a sufficient number from the respondent; then the respondent begins and adopts the same course until he is in a majority and so the scrutiny is continued until the particulars are exhausted. And in order to ascertain for whom a person whose name should be struck off has voted, the court refers to the register used in the election, finds the name of the voter, then refers to the counterfoils and finds the ballot paper used by that disqualified voter and having in that way discovered for whom he has voted, deducts his vote from the number given in favour of his candidate.\nFraser in his work on Parliamentary Elections, 2nd ed., p. 26, says:\u2014\nThe object of the numbering of the ballot paper is to make it possible to ascertain in the event of a scrutiny how votes have been given.\nIn Ontario the law, as I have already said, provided at first for a numbered ballot in municipal elections. When a scrutiny would take place and a corrupt vote would be found they could then refer to the poll book, the counterfoils and the ballot papers and strike off that vote.\nThere is no doubt that under section 24 of the \u201cOntario Voters\u2019 List Act\u201d they could also in a provincial election strike off the votes of persons who were declared unqualified by sections 4 to 7 of the \u201cElection Act,\u201d or who had ceased to be residential voters since the making of the lists, but when they abolished the marked ballot they unfortunately forgot to amend the provisions of their Act as to the scrutiny, and did not provide any machinery by which it could be detected for whom the unqualified voter had given his vote. It would have been easy in order to render the scrutiny effective to authorize such an inquiry. On the contrary it is declared in the law that nobody may disclose, and the elector cannot be forced to state, for whom he voted.\nNow, as to whether the judge could inquire as to the residential qualification of voters who were in the same position as when the list was made, I find that the section 24, though referring in its first part to a scrutiny in municipal and provincial elections, applies in its two last sub-sections to legislative elections only. Corrupt practices might, under sub-section 1, be inquired into in municipal elections, but no power seems to me to have been given to make the same inquiry as to voters disqualified on account of change of residence or for some other reason. That is the view which has been enunciated by several judges of the Ontario courts and in which I concur. See Saltfleet Case[26]; Campbellford Case[27]; Durham Case[28]; Orangeville Case[29]; Renfrew Case[30].\nNow, suppose that the inquiry could be made as to the change of residence of a voter, could the inquiry cover or relate to a case where the voter is to-day in the same position as he was when the list was made? One cardinal principle is that the lists are final and conclusive. They are made with a great deal of care under the control of the municipal authorities and of the courts. Very frequently in the making of the lists the municipal authorities and the courts have to decide whether a man is residing in one municipality or in another. The residence is a question of fact which it is sometimes difficult to determine. In the case of a man whose residence has not changed since the making of the lists is it legal that the qualification of that man could be determined on the scrutiny? I think not. I think that the list is final and conclusive in such a case.\nNow, coming to the second question as to what the judge is going to do with the votes which he finds have been illegally given.\nFormerly when the ballot was marked it would have been easy to find out for whom this person had voted, and his vote could have been struck off. But by the law passed a few years ago, the ballot was changed and is not numbered any more. It is the same as in our federal law. Could it be claimed for one moment under the federal law when a scrutiny takes place, that a member could not be declared elected because some person had voted who had no right to vote? Suppose that a member should be elected by a majority of one, a scrutiny takes place and it is found that two electors were not qualified to vote, should it be declared by the judge who holds this scrutiny that the member should not be returned because he is not sure whether he has the majority or not, there being no means of ascertaining for whom those unqualified men have voted? Certainly not. That is, however, what has been done in this case. Where was the authority of the judge to declare that the four or five alleged illegal votes should be deducted from the number of those who have voted for the by-law? That is a conclusion not authorized by the law, and it is also a very unjust and unfair one, because those unqualified electors may have voted against the by-law so their votes would be counted twice against the by-law. For my part, I am strongly of the view that the judge acted without authority and that those votes should not be deducted from those given for the by-law. To justify his acting in that way the judge would have required express statutory authority, and I fail to find in the statutes any such powers vested in the judge who holds a scrutiny.\nFor those reasons the appeal should be maintained and the judge should declare that there was a sufficient majority of votes in favour of the by-law.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mills, Raney, Lucas & Hales.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Leitch & Green.\n[1] 26 Ont.

They sold their goods in the United States and Canada for many years, and they became well-known as \u201cBucyrus\u201d manufactures.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the-Exchequer Court (14 Ex. c.r. 35), that the company was entitled to register the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d in Canada as a trade-mark for use in connection with such manufactures.\nA Canadian company for some years manufactured and sold \u201cBucyrus\u201d goods as agent for the makers thereof and built up a good business for the same in Canada. When their agency terminated they sold similar goods of their own manufacture under the name of \u201cCanadian Bucyrus,\u201d which they registered as their trade-mark for such goods.\nHeld, affirming the judgment below, that such trade-mark should be expunged from the register.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the respondents. Two questions arose on this appeal. First, whether or not the respondents were entitled to register as a trade-mark the geographical term \u201cBucyrus,\u201d which for many years had been applied to the goods they manufactured and under which name said goods had become widely known in the United States and Canada; secondly, whether or not the appellants, manufacturing similar goods in Canada, could register the words \u201cCanadian Bucyrus\u201d as their trade-mark. By the judgment of the Exchequer Court the first question was answered in the affirmative and the second in the negative.\nJ. K. Kerr K.C. and J. A. Paterson K.C. for the appellants. We are entitled to use a trade name similar to that of the respondents so long as we take effective steps to prevent the public from being deceived as we have done. See Grand Hotel Co. of Caledonia Springs v. Wilson[2]; Orr Living & Co. v. Johnston & Co.[3]; Singer Machine Manufacturers v. Wilson[4]; Pabst Brewing Co. v. Ekers[5].\nThe word \u201cBucyrus\u201d is a geographical as well as an historical term and cannot be registered as a trademark. In re Salt & Co.[6]; Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co.[7].\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondents referred to Partlo v. Todd[8], at page 199; Richards v. Butcher[9]; Leather Cloth Go. v.

McCarthy K.C. for the respondents The Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment rendered on an application made by the respondents to the judge of the Exchequer Court, to expunge from the register, the words \u201cCanadian Bucyrus,\u201d registered by the appellants as their trade-mark. That application was made necessary by reason of the refusal to register the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d as the trademark of the respondents and the validity or propriety of that refusal falls also to be considered on this appeal.\nTwo questions therefore arise: (a) Should the appellants\u2019 trade-mark be removed from the register? (b) Is the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d registrable as a trademark under the circumstances? The facts as to which there is practically no dispute, stated in their chronological order, lead irresistibly, in my opinion, to the conclusion that the first question must be answered affirmatively. There may be some doubt as to whether the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d can be registered as a valid trademark; but on that question also I agree with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court.\nThe petitioners, now respondents, are an American corporation engaged, since 1879, in the manufacture and sale in the United States and Canada, and other parts of the world, of particular types of wrecking cranes, pile drivers, shovels and other railway appliances, and during the greater part of that period they adopted the name \u201cBucyrus\u201d to distinguish their manufactured products.\nThose railway appliances speedily became known under the name of \u201cBucyrus\u201d and the business of the company grew rapidly, their machinery obtaining a wide celebrity. It was sold invariably and solely under the name of \u201cBucyrus.\u201d All the machinery so sold had been prominently marked with the word \u201cBucyrus,\u201d printed on a name-plate. The respondents began to sell their machinery in Canada, and on the first of October, 1904, they entered into an agreement with the appellants by which the latter were appointed sole and exclusive agents to make, manufacture and sell iii Canada, the railway appliances described in the agreement as \u201cBucyrus\u201d specialties. It was expressly stipulated that all such specialties manufactured under that contract should be\ncharacterized and distinguished under the name \u201cBucyrus,\u201d that this name shall appear prominently on the complete machines, and that the method and system of marking adopted by the Bucyrvs Company on its own apparatus in the United States shall be followed as closely as practicable.\nThis contract remained in force until 1909 when, in the month of November of that, year, it was cancelled by the appellants, who continued thereafter, as they had done before, to sell steam shovels, cranes, etc., with the name \u201cBucyrus\u201d upon them. As the appellants say in their factum, by judicious advertising and adopting energetic business methods they established a large and prosperous business for the sale of products manufactured under that agreement. And in these circumstances they, in the month of February, 1911, obtained permission to register as their trade-mark the words \u201cCanadian Bucyrus,\u201d to be applied to steam shovels, wrecking cranes and other railway appliances of their own manufacture. On or about the 7th July, 1911, the respondents also applied to register the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d as their trade-mark, to be applied to their specialties, which are the same as those manufactured by the appellants and that application was refused because of the prior registration obtained by the appellants. Hence this application to expunge from the register the trade-mark \u201cCanadian Bucyrus\u201d and to register the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d as the trade-mark of the respondents.\nThe respondents claimed and proved that in Canada, as elsewhere, the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d had become (and was at the date of their agreement with the appellants) specially and exclusively distinctive of the railway specialties manufactured by them, and that it had always distinguished such specialties from those of all other makers whatsoever and that the use of the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d conveyed to the minds both of the trade and the public in Canada and elsewhere, that the specialties to which it was applied had been manufactured by the respondents, or by the appellants under their license and by no other company, firm or person. On the evidence it appears to me conclusively established that the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d has a particular signification and indicates the origin or manufacture of the thing to which it is attached. From the very first the word has been used to distinguish the machinery manufactured by the respondents from the machinery of other persons; it has been on the name-plate attached to the machinery sold by them under the designation of \u201cBucyrus\u201d railway specialties. I am consequently of opinion that the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d is a good trade-mark (section 5) and registrable as such.\nTo the objection that a geographical name is not a good trade-mark I reply by referring to: Rey v. Lecouturier[12], page 268; The Karlsbad Case[13], page 162.\nThat the respondents\u2019 goods had been upon the market for many years and were known under the name of \u201cBucyrus\u201d specialties is not an objection (see National Starch Go. Application[14]).\nTo refuse to expunge from the register the trademark \u201cCanadian Bucyrus\u201d would be to encourage unfair dealing. The object of a trade-mark is not to distinguish particular goods, but to distinguish the goods of a particular trader. It is reasonably clear by the terms of the contract between the parties that the \u201cBucyrus\u201d specialties meant to the ordinary public, machinery used in the construction of railways, made by a particular firm or company and that the respondents guarded themselves carefully against the contingency which has arisen. The appellants argue here that in their advertisements they are careful to say that the goods they sell are manufactured by them in Canada, but this is not a case of passing off. The question here is: Have the appellants the right to register as their trade-mark the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d either alone or in combination with the word \u201cCanadian\u201d? The principle which, in my opinion, ought to govern in the case of an application of this kind is to prevent the use by two companies of names so nearly resembling one another as to be calculated to deceive. In my opinion, the use of the word \u201cCanadian Bucyrus\u201d is calculated to cause confusion. This is evident from the mere comparison of the two names. There is also abundant evidence that confusion would result from the use of both names. The word \u201cBucyrus,\u201d as I have already said, had long before this application been adopted by the respondents to distinguish the goods of their manufacture and by that name they were identified and known to the public. The appellants contend that they have under license from the respondents contributed to make a market for these goods in Canada. In that argument I find a complete answer to their case because it involves the admission that the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d was to the public at the time of their application, a distinctive word and meant the goods of a particular maker of whose good name and reputation they seek to get the benefit.\nFor all these reasons I would confirm with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cassels in the Exchequer Court.\nIdington J.\u2014When the contract of agency between the parties concerned herein was put an end to, the Canada Foundry Company had no higher right than any one else to register as its trade-mark, one embodying the name of the Bucyrus Company.\nSuch a trade-mark was within the meaning of section 11, sub-section (c) of the \u201cTrade-Mark and Designs Act,\u201d calculated to deceive or mislead the public and hence properly expunged by the judgment appealed from.\nThe respondent company seems clearly to have used the mark the judgment gives it a right to register.\nThe fact that \u201cBucyrus\u201d is the name of a town in Ohio, does not of absolute necessity in law prevent its registration.\nThe use of a geographical or other name might in some circumstances be good ground for refusing registration of a trade-mark containing such name. But the facts in this case disclose no such state of circumstances as to preclude either its use or the registration of the trade-mark containing it.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The evidence establishes that the use of \u201cCanadian Bucyrus\u201d as descriptive of steam shovels, railway wrecking cranes or pile drivers manufactured by the appellants would be calculated to work a deception on the public. I think that is prima facie sufficient ground for cancelling the registration. As to the respondents\u2019 right to have the term \u201cBucyrus\u201d registered as their trade-mark there are only two points to consider.\n1st. It is contended that the word \u201cBucyrus\u201d being a geographical name is incapable of being registered as a trade-mark. That objection is met by the evidence, which shews that it has acquired a secondary signification as designating steam shovels, railway wrecking cranes and pile drivers manufactured by (or from the designs and plans in current use by) the respondents or their predecessors.\n2nd. The agreement of 1904 unquestionably gave the appellants a license to use the term \u201cBucyrus\u201d as descriptive of objects manufactured by them under the provisions of the agreement; but the respondents did not by virtue of this license lose their exclusive property in the name \u201cBucyrus\u201d as descriptive of articles of the kinds mentioned for these reasons: (a) The appellants acquired the right to use the term \u201cBucyrus\u201d as descriptive of such articles as the agent of the respondents only and on the termination of the agency the license came to an end except it may be as regards articles already produced or in process of manufacture at the time the agreement was cancelled. (b) Under the agreement the appellants became entitled to the use of all the plans, designs and engineering data of the respondents relating to the manufacture of the articles governed by the agreement as well as the fullest inspection of and information relating to the respondents\u2019 processes of manufacture and the respondents became bound to furnish the appellants with advice as to all improvements and changes in type or style; the intention of the agreement obviously being that the articles manufactured and sold by the appellants should from time to time conform in all substantial respects to those which the respondents were then producing. It cannot be successfully argued that the effect of such an agreement was to make the term \u201cBucyrus,\u201d as applied for trade purposes to articles of the kinds in question, a term publici juris; because the license was a license to the respondents\u2019 agents and it was a license to use the mark only in respect of articles which in the only relevant sense were intended to be in substance the respondents\u2019 own productions.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cassels in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kerr, Davidson, Paterson & McFarland.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCarthy, Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n[1] 14 Ex C.R. 35.\n[2] 2 Ont.

(Anglin J. expressing no opinion on the point).\u2014The beneficial ownership of the beds of navigable non-tidal waters within the \u201cRailway Belt\u201d in British Columbia, which were vested in the Crown, in the right of that province, at the time of the transfer of the \u201cRailway Belt lands\u201d to the Dominion of Canada, passed to the Dominion in virtue of the transfer. REFERENCE by the Governor-General in Council of questions for hearing and consideration as to the powers of the Legislature of British Columbia to authorize the Government of that province to grant exclusive rights to fish as therein mentioned.\nThe questions referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to the authority of section 60 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d are as follows:\u2014\n\u201c1. Is it competent to the Legislature of British Columbia to authorize the Government of the province to grant by way of lease, license or otherwise the exclusive right to fish in any or what part or parts of the waters within the \u201cRailway Belt,\u201d\n(\u0430) as to such waters as are tidal, and\n(b) as to such waters as although not tidal are in fact navigable?\n\u201c2. Is it competent to the Legislature of British Columbia to authorize the Government of the province to grant by way of lease, license or otherwise the exclusive right, or any right, to fish below low-water mark in or in any or what part or parts of the open sea within a marine league of the coast of the province?\n\u201c3. Is there any and what difference between the open sea within a marine league of the coast of British Columbia and the gulfs, bays, channels, arms of the sea and estuaries of the rivers within the province, or lying between the province and the United States of America, so far as concerns the authority of the Legislature of British Columbia to authorize the Government of the province to grant by way of lease, license or otherwise the exclusive right, or any right, to fish below low-water mark in the said waters or any of them?\u201d\nAt the hearing of the arguments presented in respect of the issues raised upon the reference:\u2014\nHon. A. W. Atwater K.C. and Newcombe K.C. (Deputy-Minister of Justice), appeared for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nLafleur K.C. and H. A. Maclean K.C. for the Attorney-General for British Columbia.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., E. Bayly K.C. and Chris. C. Robinson, for the Attorneys-General for Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba.\nS. B. Woods K.C. for the Attorneys-General for Saskatchewan and Alberta.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. agreed with Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The respective jurisdictions of the Dominion and the province relative to the questions of fisheries and fishing rights were determined by the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. The Attorney-General for Ontario et al.[1]. The result of that decision was to leave the property therein as such (save possibly in the merest technical sense) in the province subject to and entirely dependent upon the legislative regulations and restrictions of the Dominion Parliament.\nThere can be no doubt that the right to fish in the sea and all its arms on the coast of British Columbia has been a public right enjoyable by everybody, and must so remain until the Dominion Parliament signifies otherwise, as, for example, by declaring that it will be for the good of the whole of Canada that a several or exclusive right of fishing may be granted.\nThere may be a question whether or not the province could grant an exclusive license anticipating and conditional upon and subject to the legislative regulations to be provided by Parliament. This would be practically of little use, even if technically it could fall within the terms of the judgment referred to.\nAfter having given that possibly arguable right of the province the best consideration I can, it seems to me that it must be taken to be the will of Parliament that, until it has otherwise declared, the common law giving such rights as the public now possess is the regulation to be observed, and that is inconsistent with the grant of an exclusive license.\nIf the province should try to revoke this right of the people, it must do so through its legislature. Such legislation would be ultra vires and in any event if need be the veto power of the Dominion could prevent it.\nWhat has been urged relative to the province having exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d as a ground for interference by the local legislature independently of Parliament, seems to me misplaced.\nThere is prima facie no more of property or civil right involved in the question than in the right to navigate these same waters. There may be civil rights arise out of the operation of navigating, but the right to navigate is held subject to regulation by Parliament. When there has been well and truly granted a license to fish in said waters, within and conformable with the legislative regulations adopted by Parliament, then there will arise a civil right in the licensee which will fall in all its incidents of assignment and succession within the power of the province over property and civil rights. This exercise of power granting such a civil right is the foundation of such incidental rights and is itself an exercise of the power the province has over property and civil rights. It may be also made so long as consistent with the Parliamentary regulations, subject to terms and conditions giving rise to other incidental civil rights.\nThe recognition of the power of the province over all these properties and civil rights so developed, furnishes no argument for limiting the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament given by section 91, subsection 12, of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d over \u201cSea Coast and Inland Fisheries.\u201d\nIf the contention of the province were to prevail it might result in one man or corporation acquiring the monopoly for all time over a food supply of fish which the rest of the people of Canada, as well as of British Columbia, have a right to enjoy. Such a result is properly admitted as a possible logical consequence of the contention set up, but is plausibly met by the argument that there is no power but may be abused.\nBut I cannot overlook the comprehensive language of the exclusive power given Parliament over \u201cSea Coast and Inland Fisheries\u201d and coupled therewith the predominant feature of our whole scheme of confederation, which is that to those who are to be directly affected by the exercise of any power is entrusted the power of due and proper rectification of any misuse of such power.\nThis power of granting exclusive licenses to fish in the waters of British Columbia so touches the welfare of the whole people of Canada, not only in relation to their food, but also in the widest areas of national life, in so many and diverse ways, that a book might be written thereon. I think the people who may be affected by its operation must be declared virtual masters, through their Parliament, of the situation.\nThe illustration given by Lord Herschell as to Parliament having the right to prescribe the times of the year during which fishing is to be allowed, or the instruments which may be employed for the purpose, has been pressed, not exactly as the limit, but as if expressive of the entire nature of its power. I do not think it is more than an illustration. I by no means read it as indicating the whole nature of the power. For I think the exclusive nature of the legislative power over the subject-matter named, is as wide as it possibly can be and relates to everything that Parliament may deem fit to deal with in regard thereto. The incidental property or civil rights in the province which may be found therein, of course, cannot be touched by Parliament. And I have no doubt once these limits of their respective powers are accurately apprehended, the trust, so timely expressed by Lord Herschell, that the good sense of the legislatures concerned will overcome any apparent inconvenience, will be realized.\nEven if the right to fish in non-tidal but navigable waters may differ from those other rights, all seem so classed together by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d that I think the right of the province in either ease must be treated for all practical purposes as resting on the one common basis of the regulations of Parliament.\nThe nature of the property which the Dominion may have relative to the granting of licenses to fish in the waters within the \u201crailway belt\u201d is not directly raised by these questions submitted for determination herein. It can only be incidentally considered here relative to the questions put by way of an answer to the claim of the province. In the view just expressed it seems hardly necessary to consider it. There is, however, not the same clear common law right of the public to fish in these non-tidal navigable waters as in the others in question herein. Hence, notwithstanding the opinion I have just expressed, I see there may be another point of view worthy of notice. The \u201cSettlement Act,\u201d chapter 14 of the British Columbia Statutes of 1884, seems to transfer such a title in the soil as to preclude the province from granting any license to fish in non-tidal navigable waters existent on lands covered by said grant.\nThere is, in my opinion, no foundation in law for the claim that fish therein ever were jura regalia such as the precious metals. I would, therefore, answer each of the questions in the negative.\nI understand from counsel that though taking the form of \u201cReference under the \u2018Supreme Court Act,\u2019\u201c this submission is in fact pursuant to the consent of the Province of British Columbia and the Dominion as a means of determining their respective rights in the premises.\nIt is conceivable that British Columbia before the Union or after that event, and before the later \u201cSettlement Act\u201d I have referred to, may have made grants inconsistent with the operative effect to be given the respective results of the legislation dealt with in accordance with what I have said. In either such case the Act of Union or later Act cannot interfere. Duff J\u2014It will be convenient first to consider question 2.\nThe colony of British Columbia was established in 1858. By an ordinance promulgated by Governor Douglas, on the 19th of November of that year, the laws of England, criminal and civil, as they existed on that date were declared to be in force in the colony \u201cso far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable,\u201d and by an ordinance, promulgated in 1867, after the union of the old colony of British Columbia with Vancouver Island, the ordinance of 1858 was made applicable to the whole of the new colony of British Columbia thereby constituted.\nIt is not suggested that from the first establishment of the colony of British Columbia down to the time when the United Colony entered the Canadian Union any enactment was passed by any law-making authority affecting the public rights of fishing in tidal waters in any way material to the present question. At the date of the Union the law governing these rights may be taken for our present purpose to have been the law of England \u201cso far as the same was not from local circumstances inapplicable.\u201d\nThe soil, of navigable, tidal rivers,\u2019 like the Shannon, so far as the tide flows and reflows, is prim\u00e2 facie in the Crown, and the right of fishery prim\u00e2 facie in the public. But for Magna Charta, the Crown could, by its prerogative, exclude the public from such prim\u00e2 facie right and grant the exclusive right of fishery to a private individual, either together with or distinct from the soil. And the great charter left untouched all fisheries which were made several, to the exclusion of the public, by Act of the Crown not later than the reign of Henry II.\nThis statement of the law, contained in the opinion of the judges given by Mr. Justice Willes, in 1863, in response to a question put by the House of Lords in Malcomson v. O\u2019Dea[2], at page 618, was expressly approved by the House, and is, of course, a final pronouncement as to the state of the law in England respecting public rights of fishing in tidal wa;ters on the 19th November, 1858. I can think of no good reason why the rule enunciated in this passage should be supposed to be inapplicable to the circumstances of British Columbia, and I think it must be held to have been in force throughout British Columbia in 1871, when the provisions of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d became applicable to the province. That statute vested in the Dominion Parliament the exclusive authority to make laws relating to the \u201cSea Coast and Inland Fisheries,\u201d and in Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario[3], at page 716, one consequence of this was held by the Privy Council to be that\nall restrictions or limitations by which public rights of fishing are sought to be limited or controlled can be the subject of Dominion legislation only.\nIt follows that question 2 in so far as it refers to a supposed exclusive right to be created by the province in tidal waters ought to be answered in the negative.\nThe question as framed goes further; but no suggestion was made in the argument as to the character of any possible non-exclusive rights of fishing grantable by the province in tidal waters and, as I do not understand what point is intended to be raised by the reference to such possible rights, I must ask to be permitted to treat the question as confined to exclusive rights.\nI may further add that I have treated the question as relating only to rights of fishing as commonly understood, that is to say, rights to take fish (not being royal fish as to which our opinion is not desired) that as fer\u0153 natur\u0153 are, where the fishery is public, the property of nobody until caught.\nTreating question 3 as also confined to exclusive rights of fishing in the sense already indicated that question must for the same reasons be answered in the negative. It is not necessary to consider the very important question whether the bed of the open sea within the three-mile limit is or is not vested in the Crown in right of the province.\nFor the same reason also the first branch of the first question must be answered in the negative. The public right being subject to the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament it is immaterial whether the beds of tidal waters passed or did not pass to the Dominion under the transfer of the \u201cRailway Belt.\u201d\nThe second branch of the first question raises a different point. I think it should be answered in the negative for these reasons.\n1st. The beds of non-tidal, navigable waters within the \u201cRailway Belt,\u201d in my opinion, passed to the Dominion by the transfer effected by the \u201cSettlement Act.\u201d In that Act, 47 Vict. ch. 14, sec. 2, the lands transferred are thus described:\u2014\nThe public lands along the line of railway * * * to a width of 20 miles on each side of the line.\nIt is argued that the beds of non-tidal navigable waters within the boundaries indicated by this language did not pass to the Dominion for two reasons:\u2014\n(a) It is said that the rights of the Crown to such beds, at the date of the Union with Canada as well as the date of the \u201cSettlement Act,\u201d rested upon prerogative title; and that according to the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Watson in the Precious Metals Case[4] the term \u201cpublic lands\u201d in the description above quoted must be taken not to comprise any land held under such title. It cannot be doubted that expressions can be quoted from the judgment of Lord Watson, which taken by themselves might appear to lend some support to this view of that decision. At page 303, for example, he says:\u2014\nIt, therefore, appears to their Lordships that a conveyance by the province of public lands which is in substance an assignment of its right to appropriate the territorial revenues arising from such lands does not imply any transfer of its interest in revenues arising from the prerogative rights of the Crown.\nIt is unnecesary to decide whether passages such as this justify the construction the province seeks to place upon the judgment as a whole; for it is clear, I think, that the beds of non-tidal waters whether navigable or not, do not, according to the law of British Columbia, belong to the Crown jure prerogativ\u0153. That such is the law of England is indisputable. Bristow v. Cormican[5], and Johnston v. O\u2019Neill[6], at page 557. Mr. Lafleur referred to certain expressions in books of authority which designate non-tidal rivers subject to a common right of passage as \u201croyal rivers\u201d and sought to draw the inference that the beds of such rivers are held under prerogative title. The significance of such expressions is fully explained by Lord Hale in the second chapter of \u201cDe Jure Maris\u201d (Moore, Foreshore, p. 374). They signify nothing more than the expression \u201cKing\u2019s Highway\u201d as applied to a highway on land. See also the judgment of Bowen L.J., in Blount v. Layard[7].\nIt seems to be argued, however, that, in this matter of the nature of the title by which the beds of such waters are held, the law of England is from local circumstances inapplicable to British Columbia and that in that province the beds of navigable non-tidal waters are (like the beds of tidal waters) the property of the Crown in right of prerogative.\nI cannot understand why it should be supposed to be more in consonance with the circumstances of British Columbia that the beds of non-tidal navigable waters vested in the Crown should be deemed to be held under prerogative title than that such beds should be held under the same title as the Crown lands in the province generally. In the argument counsel dwelt upon the great size of the lakes and rivers. The rivers of Vancouver Island are diminutive when compared with the Shannon, and there is certainly no lake as large as Lough Neagh. On the mainland there are lakes perhaps twice as large as Lough Neagh and rivers, much longer than the Shannon; but what conceivable inconvenience could the community suffer by reason of the beds of those waters being held by the Crown under the same title as other Crown lands? From the very beginning full authority to deal with Crown lands of every description was vested in the local legislative authority. The first local law-making authority was that conferred upon Governor Douglas, who was appointed on the 2nd September, 1858, and, under the authority of an order-in-council passed pursuant to 22 Vict. ch. 49, was invested with power to make laws for the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d of the colony; and it was in exercise of this power that the ordinance of 19th November, 1858, already referred to, providing for the introduction of the law of England was passed. All Crown lands and mines in the colony whether held under prerogative title or not came under the legislative jurisdiction of the Governor and from that time forward they became the subject of legislative provision as occasion arose.\nOne is at a loss to surmise what possible practical importance could attach to the point whether beds of non-tidal waters which were the property of the Crown and were subject to the local legislative authority were to be regarded in the eye of the law as held according to one description of title or according to another. I do not think there is any ground for holding that in this matter the rule of the common law did not come into force simpliciter.\n(b) The other ground upon which the province contends that these beds did not pass to the Dominion is this. It is said that in British Columbia the Crown\u2019s title to the beds of non-tidal waters which are capable of navigation in fact are, like its title to the beds of tidal waters, burdened with a public easement of navigation; and it is said to be a rule of construction applicable to grants by the Crown to a subject that lands held by a title burdened with such a public servitude do not pass except by express words or by necessary implication. This rule of construction, it is argued, ought to be applied to the \u201cSettlement Act.\u201d The object of the transfer being, it is contended, to enable the Dominion to recoup the cost of construction of the railway, by selling the land to settlers, a presumption arises, it is said, that only such rights were intended to pass to the Dominion as in the ordinary course would be granted to settlers. It does not appear to me to be necessary for the purpose of dealing with this argument to express any opinion upon the very important question of how far and upon what principle public rights of navigation are recognized by the law of British Columbia as existing in non-tidal waters capable of being navigated. Certain rivers and lakes in that province, which from the first settlement of it have been used as public highways are, one cannot doubt, subject to a public easement of passage. Such rights can in the case of such waters be maintained upon grounds which involve no straining of the principles of English law.\nThere are, on the other hand, lakes and streams capable, no doubt, of navigation whose economic value for the community is primarily due to their availability or potential availability for purposes of irrigation, of mining and of industry generally. From the first settlement of the country the necessity of making provision for the application of the waters of lakes and streams to these purposes was recognized; and a system of \u201cwater records\u201d which, while not entirely displacing riparian rights, recognizes the paramount right of the province to control the use of such waters, and under which riparian owners and others may, upon application to the public authorities, acquire the right to divert such waters from their natural beds for such purposes has for years been a settled feature of the law of the province and has always been regarded as essential in the interests of provincial industry. On the other hand these waters are often so situated that while they are capable of navigation, in fact, the practical interest of the community in them as possible ways for public travel or transport could only be infinitesimal.\nIt is not necessary, I repeat, in my view of the question before us to say whether the law of England was so modified on its introduction into British Columbia as to give rise to a public right of navigation over every such inland navigable water. Nor do I think it necessary to decide how far the rules of English law relating to the rights of riparian proprietors in respect of the beds of such waters are applicable to British Columbia, nor whether by the law of that province there is any rule of construction applicable to grants from the Crown according to which the beds of non-tidal navigable waters only pass by express words or by necessary implication. Assuming such rights of navigation to exist in all such waters, and assuming the rule of construction in the case of a grant to a subject to be that which is contended for, still it seems to me that the conclusion which the province asks us to draw cannot be supported.\nThe area transferred by the \u201cSettlement Act\u201d is an area about 500 miles long and 40 miles wide. It stretches from the eastern boundary of the province to the Gulf of Georgia, and is very varied in its physical character. At the time of the \u201cSettlement Act\u201d it included a good deal of timber land and a good deal of land known to be fit for agriculture. The waters navigable and non-navigable within the area must have been regarded by everybody who thought about the matter as likely to prove a most important factor in connection with the settlement and development of it. Why should anybody be supposed to have contemplated that as between the Dominion and the province the control of the water system should be divorced from the ownership of the \u201cBelt\u201d as a whole? As regards non-navigable waters nobody suggests such a thing. As regards waters navigable in fact, assuming they were subject, as is argued, to public rights of navigation and fishing, then it must be remembered that this area was to be dealt with by public officials under the control of the Dominion Parliament and that the Dominion Parliament is the supreme conservancy authority in respect of navigation and fishing. Whatever considerations might be urged in the case of a grant by the Crown to a subject in support of a presumed intention to exclude the beds of navigable waters because of the existence of such public rights I can think of no reason why such a presumption should be applied to this transfer. Moreover, it could hardly have escaped the notice of both parties that the retention by the province of the beds of non-tidal navigable as distinguished from non-navigable waters was bound to lead in numberless cases to much uncertainty of title, and for that reason alone I think we may assume that such retention was not contemplated.\n2nd. The beds of the waters in question having passed to the Dominion the right of fishing would pass also as a profit of the soil, unless according to the law of British Columbia the right of fishing in non-tidal, navigable waters is not a profit of the soil; and having passed to the Dominion that right could not be granted away again by the province.\nI am not sure that I have grasped the argument of the province at this point, but whether the right of fishing in these waters is or is not vested in the Dominion as a profit of the soil it seems to me to be impossible to answer this question in the affirmative.\nIt cannot be argued, and I do not suppose counsel intended to argue, that (the beds at the time of the transfer being vested in the Crown in proprietary right) the right of fishing was held by the Crown in right of prerogative. The argument addressed to us was that in these waters there is a public right or privilege of fishing over which in some way the province is entitled to exercise control. I do not think it is necessary to decide whether the law of British Columbia at the date of the Union recognized any public right of fishing in these waters. There can be no doubt that the law of England recognizes no necessary connection between the public right of navigation and the public right of fishing; and, indeed, the great weight of authority is in favour of the view that a right of the character last mentioned cannot exist in non-tidal waters under the common law. Whether on its introduction into British Columbia the law of England underwent such a modification as to require us to hold that in every body of water in that province which is capable of navigation (the bed of which is vested in the Crown) a right or privilege of fishing belongs to the public and if there be such a right or privilege in non-tidal waters what is the nature of it are questions involving points of far-reaching importance which ought only to be passed upon after hearing argument in the interest of those private owners who might be affected by the decision and who were not represented on the hearing of this reference. It is unnecessary, as I have said, to pass upon those questions. Such a public right or privilege if it exist in non-tidal waters may be either (a) an absolute right, only capable of limitation or restriction by legislative authority, such as the public right of fishing in tidal waters or (b) a privilege in the nature of a mere tacit license revocable at the will of the Crown or the Crown\u2019s grantee as owner. Strong C.J., in his opinion in the Fisheries Case[8], at pages 526, 527, 528, and 531, expresses the view that there is a public privilege in such waters and appears to think it is of the last-mentioned character. Such a privilege would, of course, leave untouched the Crown\u2019s proprietorship of the fishery as incidental to the ownership of the solum. As regards the waters in question this proprietorship would pass to the Dominion by the transfer and with it the power of revocation theretofore vested in the province as owner. If, on the other hand, there is a public right of fishing of the first mentioned character it is, as we have seen, subject to the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament.\nThis question then should be answered in the negative because the beneficial ownership of the beds of navigable non-tidal waters within the \u201cRailway Belt\u201d that were vested in the Crown at the date of the transfer passed to the Dominion; and with the ownership of the beds the fisheries passed also as ordinary profits of the soil unless at the date of the union the title of the Crown was burdened with a public right of fishing that was only capable of being restricted or limited through the exercise of legislative authority. If such a public right did exist in respect of the fishings in the waters in question then by the operation of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d as construed in the Fisheries Case[9], the Dominion Parliament became solely invested with legislative authority to limit or restrict that right.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the reasons assigned by my brother Duff for answering in the negative the second and third questions, restricted as indicated by him, and that part of the first question which relates to tidal waters. But I prefer to state in my own way the grounds on which I base a negative answer to the second branch of the first question which concerns waters navigable in fact but not tidal.\nIt was much debated at bar whether under the provincial statutory grant the Dominion Government did or did not acquire proprietary rights in the beds of these waters. While I adhere to the view which I expressed in Keewatin Power Co. v. Town of Kenora[10], as to the inapplicability to the great stretches of fresh water in this country, which are navigable in fact, of the rule of the English common law, which treats as navigable only such waters as are tidal, in the view that I take it is not necessary here to determine that important point.\nIf the English common law test of navigability applies in British Columbia without any modification, all non-tidal waters must be deemed non-navigable in law, and a grant similar in its terms to that before us, if made by letters patent to a private person, would carry the subjacent soil of such waters whether in fact navigable or non-navigable. The statutory grant to the Dominion will not receive a narrower construction. In this view the province has by its grant parted with the proprietary interest upon which its right to* grant fishing leases or licenses must be rested. It has transferred that proprietary interest to the Dominion; and whatever jurisdiction the legislature of British Columbia may possess enabling it to derogate from provincial Crown grants to private persons, it has no legislative power to derogate from the effect of its statutory grant to the Dominion of the \u201cRail- way Belt\u201d lands, which, as public lands, are under the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament until disposed of to settlers. Burrard Power Co., Ltd. v. The King[11].\nOn the other hand if, in British Columbia, waters in fact navigable though non-tidal should be deemed navigable in law, and publici juris in the same sense as tidal waters, there would, in my opinion, exist in them the same public right of piscary which exists in tidal waters; and the provincial legislature is not competent to authorize any grant which would interfere with the fullest exercise of that public right. It follows that in either view the legislature of British Columbia cannot authorize grants of exclusive rights to fish in these waters.\nI cannot accept the contention pressed on behalf of British Columbia that the interest of a province in the ordinary fisheries in provincial waters which should be deemed navigable in law is a jus regale of the same nature as its right to the precious metals which were held not to be partes soli, and were on that account excluded from the operation of the grant of the \u201cRailway Belt Lands\u201d[12].\nA public fishery will not pass by a Crown grant of the solum of the water in which it exists, or indeed of the fishery itself in express terms, not because such a fishery is not pars soli, but because the solum itself, vested by law in the Crown, is subject to a trust to preserve the public rights of navigation and of fishing, which the competent legislature alone can extinguish. But the precious metals do pass under a Crown grant which contains language apt to convey them. Legislative action is not requisite.\nOn the other hand any fishery vested in the Crown in waters of which it owns the solum, other than a public common of piscary existing by law, with which a province is not competent to interfere, is held not by prerogative, but by proprietary title.

Where these formalities have not been observed there can be no valid seizure. Brook v. Booker (41 Can. S.C.R. 331), referred to.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014Extraordinary powers, conferred by statute, authorizing interference with private property must be exercised in such a manner that the rights of the owners may not be disregarded. Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King (40 Can S.C.R. 281), and Riopelle v. City of Montreal (44 Can. S.C.R. 579), referred to.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies and Idington J J.\u2014The authority conferred upon health officers by the \u201cQuebec Public Health Act\u201d respecting the condemnation, seizure and disposal of food, as being deleterious to the public health, is not final and conclusive in its effect, but it is to be exercised subject to the superintending power, orders and control of the Superior Court and the judges thereof. Per Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The protection afforded by the Quebec \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d to an executive officer of a local board of health cannot be invoked when the officer has apparently not acted under its provisions, but has condemned food, not as the result of his own independent judgment upon its quality, but in carrying out instructions given him by municipal officials purporting to act under other statutory provisions.\nIn the result the finding of the trial judge that the food in question was fit for human consumption (Q.R. 39 S.C. 520), being supported by evidence, was not disturbed, and the effect of the judgment appealed from (1 D.L.R. 160) was affirmed with a variation of the order making absolute the injunction against the defendant interfering therewith.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming, with some variation, the judgment of Weir J., at the trial in the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], in favour of the respondents.\nThe respondents, plaintiffs, commenced the present action by a petition for an interim injunction to restrain the appellant, defendant, from interference with a quantity of frozen canned eggs, the property of the respondents, which the municipal health officials were about to destroy, after an alleged condemnation of the eggs as deleterious to the public health and unfit for human food and an alleged seizure thereof by some of said officials. The petition also asked that the appellant should be summoned before the Superior Court, at Montreal, to shew cause why the injunction should not be declared absolute, and also that their right to recover damages sustained in consequence of the action of the municipal officials with regard to the eggs might be expressly reserved for consideration and adjudication in such other suit or action as they might be advised to institute in that respect. An interim injunction issued and the respondent\u2019s petition was contested by the appellant. The principal grounds of the contestation were that the eggs in question were unfit for human food, of a nature generally detrimental to the public health, and that they had been duly condemned, after inspection and analysis by the provincial and municipal health authorities, under the provisions of the \u201cQuebec Public Health Act,\u201d K.S.Q., 1909, arts. 3867 et seq., and duly placed under seizure and ordered by them to be disposed of in the manner necessary to prevent them being sold or delivered for consumption as human food.\nAt the trial, Weir J. found that the proceedings taken by the municipal health officials in regard to the eggs were illegal and irregular; that the alleged seizure was invalid and should be set aside, and that the eggs were the property of the respondents and both wholesome and suitable for human food. It was, therefore, ordered, that the Gould Cold Storage Company, the mis-en-cause, in whose warehouse the eggs were stored, should deliver them up to the respondents and that the injunction should be made absolute against the defendant corporation interfering with the eggs in so far as might relate to acts or proceedings theretofore taken or conditions theretofore existing with respect to such eggs. On an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, this judgment was affirmed on the ground that the alleged seizure was illegal and ineffective, and the injunction was declared absolute against interference with the eggs by the defendant \u201cotherwise than by due process of law.\u201d\nUpon the 25th March, 1912, pursuant to notice, a motion was made on behalf of the respondent to quash the appeal on the grounds that there was no pecuniary amount in controversy, as shewn by the pleadings, which involved a sum or value of $2,000 as provided by the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d; that the appeal had not, been entered within sixty days from the date of the decision appealed from, as provided by the Act; and that, as there was lis pendens in regard to another appeal from the same judgment taken de plano to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, there was no jurisdiction in any of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench to extend the time for appealing to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIt was shewn that, upon the delivery of the judgment now appealed from, the defendant had given security, in the court below, for an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and obtained the approval thereof by a judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench; that, within the sixty days limited for appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, the defendant had filed in the office of the Court of King\u2019s Bench a notice that the proceedings on the proposed appeal to the Privy Council had been discontinued, and, within the time so limited, had obtained an order from a judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench extending the time and approving security filed for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. In these circumstances it was contended that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and that no such appeal could lie.\nMr. S. L. Dale-Harris, on behalf of the respondents, contended that it did not appear from the record that there was a pecuniary amount of the value of $2,000 in issue on the controversy involved on the present appeal; that there was lis pendens in regard to the proceedings instituted for an appeal to the Privy Council, and that, therefore, the judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench had erred in acting upon the d\u00e9sistement filed in that court, that, in the circumstances, no appeal could lie to the Supreme Court of Canada, and that it was not now competent to the latter court to entertain the present appeal.\nHon. A. W. Atwater K.C., on behalf of the appellant, shewed cause to the motion. He contended that the injunction, made absolute by the judgment appealed from, was merely an incident in a cause, matter or proceeding for the recovery of goods which were shewn, in the record, to be valued at about $100,000, and that the usual practice of the courts in the Province of Quebec had been followed in regard to the abandonment of the proposed appeal to the Privy Council. He consequently argued that the effect of the filing of the d\u00e9sistement was to restore jurisdiction in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and that the order made by the judge of that court approving the security filed for the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been validly made.\nIt was then suggested by the court that the appellant should now be allowed to give the notice of the withdrawal of the appeal to the Privy Council, under P.C. Rule 32, and this was done accordingly. In reply to the notice the registrar of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council intimated that, as nothing had been received in his office indicating that such an appeal was pending, it could not properly be considered as a case requiring a notice to be given in accordance with that rule.\nThe court, having been informed of these circumstances, reserved judgment upon the motion to quash the appeal and, on the 1st of April, 1912, there being an equal division of opinion in regard to jurisdiction among the judges, the motion stood dismissed, without costs.*\nThe questions argued on the merits of the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nHon, A. W. Atwater K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nS. L. Dale-Harris for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014It appeared to me at the argument that this appeal was without merit and that impression has developed into a conviction by a careful examination of the very voluminous record. It is difficult, on the evidence, to say whether the moving spirit in all the proceedings which led to this action\u2014 Doctor Lachapelle \u2014 acted as \u201cPresident of the Provincial Board of Health,\u201d or as one of the Board of Commissioners. He is a prominent member of both bodies. But in whatever capacity he acted, it is abundantly clear to me that the objection taken by the appellant to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court cannot prevail. It is said that the finding of the Board of Health is final and definitive, and this notwithstanding the very wide terms of article 50 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, which, with the exception of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, makes all courts, circuit judges and magistrates, and all other persons and bodies politic and corporate, within the province, subject to the superintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court and of the judges thereof. This article has been time and again construed to mean that the Superior Court is invested with all discretionary power to grant relief against arbitrary and unauthorized acts of public officials or public corporations. See also The Queen v. Local Government Board[3], at p. 321; Hartlepool Electric Tramways Co. v. West Hartlepool Corporations[4].\nOn the facts, I agree in the conclusion reached by the trial judge. The report by Dr. Bernier and Mc-Crady, on the strength of which the commissioners ordered the destruction of the eggs, is not supported by the evidence, the overwhelming effect of which leads one to the conclusion that they were not \u201cunfit to serve as food for men.\u201d Dr. Gr\u00fcner does not say they were unfit, and, in answer to a question put by the court, Dr. Hersey, the city analyst, says that he would not condemn the eggs. Assuming, therefore, that the eggs were offered for sale, a fact not proved, although that is the condition upon which the right of the municipal sanitary authority to interfere depended, I would hold that a case has not been made out justifying such interference. It has been recently said that the finding of a judge in the first instance is not on the same footing as the verdict of a jury, notwithstanding the dictum of Lord Loreburn that the one is scarcely distinguishable from the other. But it must, at least, be admitted that the judge who tries a case like this has advantages, and, in dubio, there is a strong presumption in favour of his judgment; the onus is, in any event, on the party attacking to shew that it is wrong. In this, the appellant has failed.\nOn the question of law: Admitting for the purposes of the appellant\u2019s argument that the inspectors are clothed with very large statutory powers and that they were not bound to proceed with strict form and regularity in all they did, they were certainly bound to proceed according to the substantial rules of justice, and these, in my opinion, they failed entirely to observe. Nearly three months intervened between the so-called seizure by the fish, fruit and vegetable inspector (who does not pretend to have exercised anything like an independent judgment as to their condition, or in fact any judgment whatever) and the trial; and, with the exception of Dr. Hersey, not a single witness is examined by the appellant who can speak with any authority on the subject of the examination of food stuffs.\nThe eggs in question are said to have been seized on the 24th December, and it was not until the 26th January following that the owners were informed that they were free to remove them from the province, the opportunity to have a proper independent examination of their edible quality by a competent official in the interval being denied them, most unjustifiably in my opinion. The corporation appellant is vested under the laws of Quebec with exorbitant powers for the protection of public health and very properly so, but those powers must not be exercised in total disregard of the rights of private individuals. All that I can usefully say on this branch of the case will be found in Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[5]; Riopelle v. City of Montreal[6].\nTo those of us who are familiar with the elaborate provisions of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure for the protection of those whose property has been taken in execution, it seems almost ridiculous to suggest that there was any proceeding here which bears the faintest resemblance to a seizure as that word is understood in that province. On this point I agree with the court of appeal. To seize is to dispossess the party proceeded against, \u201cMettre sous main de justice,\u201d and the law requires at least notice\u2014inventory and a guardian. See Brook v. Booker[7]. Here, beyond a notice to the warehouse keeper, no steps whatever were ever taken to attach the property or to in any way protect or safeguard the rights of the owner.\nIn view of the great importance of the subject, I venture to add this observation: a careful examination of its provisions leads me to the conclusion that in many cases the \u201cQuebec Public Health Act\u201d will be found to be unworkable. Some provision for, amongst other things, the condemnation of articles of food seized by judicial authority such as is to be found in the English Act (\u201cPublic Health Act, 1891\u201d) would be useful. Chapter 133 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, might also be consulted with advantage.\nI can see no useful purpose to be served by changing the form of the order as settled by the court of appeal.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question of fact in controversy between the parties to this action was whether the canned eggs seized and confiscated as being held by the plaintiffs for sale, were or were not unwholesome and unfit for human food.\nA vast mass of scientific and expert testimony on this question was given before the trial judge. Much of it was conflicting. The experts and scientists differed greatly in their opinions and conclusions.\nIn the result, the trial judge found in favour of the plaintiffs that the eggs, when seized, were not unwholesome or unfit for human food or otherwise injurious to health.\nWhile I might not, upon the evidence given, had I tried the case, have reached the same conclusion as the trial judge, I am not able to say that his finding of fact is so clearly erroneous as would justify me in reversing it.\nThis finding goes to the very root of the controversy, and apart from any question as to the legality of the seizure in form or substance, would be sufficient to dispose of this appeal unless the contention of the appellant\u2019s counsel that the bon\u00e2 fide exercise of the discretionary power conferred on the executive officer of a local Board of Health by the Quebec \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d with respect to the seizure and confiscation of food offered for sale and suspected to be impure and unfit for human food, is not subject to be overruled, controlled or interfered with by the courts, but is conclusive in itself.\nI am not able to accept this contention. Article 3913 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909), on which the appellants rely in justification of the seizure and confiscation of the eggs, is as follows:\u2014\nEvery executive officer of the municipal sanitary authority or any other officer appointed by it for that purpose, may inspect all animals, dead or alive, meat, fowl, game, fish, fruit, vegetables, grease, bread, flour, milk or other liquids and food intended for human, consumption and offered for sale, or deposited in a place or transported in a vehicle for the purpose of being afterwards sold or offered for sale, or delivered after being sold; and, if upon inspection such animals, liquids or food appear to be unwholesome, putrid, damaged, or infected with the germs of disease, or otherwise injurious to health, he may seize the same, carry them off, and dispose of them so that they shall not be offered for sale or serve as food for man.\nThe burden of proof that the animals, liquid or food are not intended to be sold, or to be delivered after having been sold, or to serve as food for man, lies upon the owner or person who had possession thereof.\nThe proprietor of the articles, or the person in whose possession they were seized, is further liable to a fine not exceeding fifty dollars.\nI may say that there were two seizures made of these canned eggs, one of the 24th of December, 1910, by Grenier, who was the health officer of the City of Montreal, acting under the by-law of the city, and the other on the 24th January, 1911, by Dr. McCarrey, who was the chief food inspector of the city and an officer entitled to act under art. 3913, R.S.Q., above cited.\nCounsel for the appellants disclaimed, at bar, justifying the seizure made by Grenier on the 24th of December, 1910. They relied entirely upon that made by Dr. McCarrey on 24th of January.\nIn view of the finding of the trial judge that the seized goods were not unwholesome or unfit for human food, and of my inability owing to the conflicting character of the evidence to reverse that finding, the question for me is reduced simply to this: Assuming the seizure to have been bon\u00e2 fide made, is the inspector\u2019s finding, if he did so find, that the eggs were unwholesome and unfit for human food, final and conclusive, or is it subject to review by the courts?\nThe clause empowers the officers to inspect enumerated kinds of food and drink intended for sale and human consumption, and declares that if upon inspection such liquids or foods \u201cappear to be unwholesome,\u201d etc., \u201cor otherwise injurious to health,\u201d the officer may seize and dispose of them \u201cso that they shall not be offered for sale as food for man.\u201d\nNow the position of the appellants was, and I think it a tenable one, that the \u201cinspection\u201d referred to is not necessarily limited to the ocular inspection of the officer. If such a limited construction was placed upon the section it would be almost, if not entirely useless. I think it extends to such an inspection as the conditions of the suspected articles may call for in order to enable a proper conclusion to be reached as to their wholesomeness or otherwise. Such inspection may, in the case of canned or sealed food, require merely an opening of the cans or of reasonable samples, or it may call for a scientific analysis of the contents of the cans or samples and necessitate chemical and bacteriological analyses to enable a conclusion to be reached whether they are unfit for human food.\nIf the former or limited ocular inspection was the only one intended, and the section only covered goods respecting which such an inspection would enable the officer to reach a conclusion, I could appreciate an argument that the conclusion of the inspector might be held to be final and conclusive. But if the contention of the appellant, the City of Montreal, as to the broad meaning of the inspection referred to is accepted, as I accept it, then I am quite unable to appreciate the finality argument. In this latter case the result is to be determined not from the exercise of the senses, of feeling, smell, or sight, knowledge and experience possessed by the inspector, but from the reports of one or more scientific analysts. In such a case, to confer such an arbitrary, uncontrolled power upon the inspector would require the use of clear language expressing that to be the intention of the legislature.\nNo language even implying such an intention is used, and from the fact that the burden of proof with respect to the food not being intended for sale, or its not being intended to serve as food for man, is thrown upon the owner or possessor, I think the intention would have been clearly expressed if it was intended to invest the inspector with uncontrolled arbitrary power of deciding the crucial point of the wholesomeness of the food in cases where it could only be determined after and upon scientific analyses.\nIn the view I take of the case, it is not necessary for me to express any opinion as to the form or substance of the seizure itself. The canned eggs seized were held by the trial judge not to be unwholesome or unfit for human food. I find myself unable to reverse that finding because I cannot say in the face of the conflicting testimony, that it is clearly wrong. The seizure, therefore, cannot be sustained.\nOn a question so vitally important as the health of the inhabitants of a large city like Montreal, I would not hold the officer bon\u00e2 fide exercising his power of preventing the sale of unwholesome food to be a wrongdoer for mere technical defaults of procedure. If substantially and practically he complied with the statutory requirements so that no real injustice was done, I would hold his seizure sufficient, if in the ultimate result the food seized was found to be unfit for human food. I am unable, in matters of this kind, to exalt the rights of the individual over those of the community. I would go a long way to prevent the vender of unwholesome food profiting, through technical defects merely, by his nefarious traffic.\nIn this case, however, the merits are found for the respondents and the trial judge\u2019s findings on them are not reversed by the appeal court which decided the appeal on questions relating to the legality of the seizure irrespective of the quality or character of the eggs. I, therefore, do not find it necessary to express any opinion upon the legality of the seizure.\nI agree to the modification of the injunction proposed by my brother Anglin, and concur in dismissing the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014In any view I can take of this appeal it must turn upon the determination of whether or not the goods in question have been proved unfit for human food within the description given in the statutes appellant relies upon. This question of fact has been fully and fairly tried out, and the pleadings must be held as if conformable to the constitution of such an issue for if not so already are in such case amendable and must be considered as if amended.\nThis is not an action for damages against the officer for his wrongdoing and, therefore, I respectfully submit objections relative to his mode of procedure are misplaced.\nThe appellant certainly had an interest in seeing the law enforced and the respondents by founding their action for an injunction upon the alleged assertion of the appellant\u2019s intention and threats to confiscate the goods in question because unfit for food raises the broad issue of the quality of the goods and nothing else save the right on the part of the respondents to sell the goods for purposes of food. If they are unfit for food then the respondents have no right they can maintain save the property in so much manure, but this latter is not the question.\nIf the goods were in fact unfit for food no court could properly enjoin appellant or its officers from so asserting or threatening to discharge, or discharging, the duties resting upon them in such case by virtue of the statutes in question.\nThe chief of these statutory provisions are first part of article 3913 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, which reads as follows:\u2014\n3913. Every executive officer of the municipal sanitary authority or any other officer appointed by it for that purpose, may inspect all animals, dead or alive, meat, fowl, game, fish, fruit, vegetables, grease, bread, flour, milk or other liquids and food intended for human consumption and offered for sale, or deposited in a place or transported in a vehicle for the purpose of being afterwards sold or offered for sale, or delivered after being sold; and, if upon inspection, such animals, liquids or food appear to be unwholesome, putrid, damaged or infected with the germs of disease, or otherwise injurious to health, he may seize the same, carry them off, and dispose of them so that, they shall not be offered for sale or serve as food for man.\nAnd the appellant\u2019s charter, 62 Vict. eh. 68, art. 300, sec. 40, as follows, enabling by-laws to be passed by it.\n40. To provide for and regulate the inspection of meats, poultry, fish, game, butter, cheese, lard, eggs, vegetables, flour, meal, milk, dairy products, fruit and other food products; to provide for the seizure, confiscation and summary destruction of any such products as are unsound, spoiled or unwholesome; to prohibit the bringing into the city and the having or keeping such unsound, spoiled or unwholesome products, and to define the duties, powers and attributions of the inspectors appointed for that purpose.\nThe amendment to this last by section 122 of 4 Edw. VII. eh. 49, art. 7, though important, does not help much here.\nIn my view I need not trouble with the question of the validity of the appellant\u2019s by-laws and will assume for the present that they extend as far as these statutes enable by-laws relative to the officers and matters in question to be passed.\nI cannot assent to the appellant\u2019s contention that the decision or acts of its officers or of any other officer resting upon either of these statutes is to be held as binding and\nfinal unless it can be shewn that they have acted illegally or in a grossly improper manner.\nThe statute, to which I am about to refer and analyze as basis alleged for this contention, is above quoted, article 3913, and, for the sake of clearness in expressing my meaning, I will treat it singly, but nearly all I will say anent same can be applied to the other statute above quoted.\nNow the first thing the article 3913 does is to enable the officers to inspect. I think they are thereby impliedly empowered to exercise such degree of control over the object to be inspected as will enable an efficient discharge of this duty.\nIt may not in some cases be necessary for an officer to lay a hand upon it, but if in other cases it is necessary to enable him to discharge his duty to take possession of the goods and lock them up, till he has been enabled to determine the fact, then he is entitled to do so. In all this the greatest care and sound sense has to be exercised, so that no unnecessary inconvenience or damage be caused either to the goods, or the owner\u2019s profitable handling of them, or to his reputation; in short that due dispatch be had and everything be done in a due and orderly manner.\nI conceive the officer need not rely only upon his own eyes or sense or skill or knowledge or experience, but can call in to his aid others possessing these qualifications or some one or more of them, in order to advise and assist him.\nIf he act unreasonably in any one of these several things I have indicated as within the scope of his power and duty, then he may be amenable to an action of damages at the suit of any one unjustly suffering thereby. In such an action the good faith of the officer and the facts to justify his conduct may constitute a defence.\nThe question of whether or not in fact the goods were in any such case unfit for human food may be found of little consequence; if he can justify by his good faith and the facts which would lead a man reasonably competent for such an office to have reasonably done, under the like circumstances, as he may be charged with having done.\nAn honest judgment so formed cannot be lightly set aside and may in that sense answer any action brought against the officer.\nNay more, I am disposed to think due weight should be given not only to that judgment of procedure from hour to hour, but also to the ultimate finding of such an officer when he has duly inspected and declared the goods obnoxious to the statute.\nIt may form a prim\u00e2 facie defence in a case in which the owner may have brought an action. He may have to rebut such a finding in taking steps to recover possession of the goods in case the officer has possessed himself of them.\nI am not expressing herein any final opinion in regard to all that which may in many conceivable cases concern the officer. I am only illustrating how far I think this judgment of its officer now set up by appellant as conclusive defence may in an honest case reach, and having due regard to ordinary principles of law protecting officers discharging a duty the law has cast upon them, may justify them personally.\nBut when we are asked to go further and say that on such a prim\u00e2 facie finding of fact by a health officer, no matter how unfounded in fact when appearances have been dispelled and thorough investigation has shewn them absolutely without foundation, an owner can be thus and needlessly despoiled of his goods and his legal rights to the enjoyment thereof and profits in selling same, is a thing that ordinary sense of right revolts at.\nThe language of the statute does not give colour to such a claim.\nI admit that the phrase \u201cif upon inspection such * * * food appears,\u201d etc., might under certain circumstances be read as if intended to convey the meaning the appellant contends for.\nWhen the word \u201cappears\u201d is used conditionally in an Act to confer jurisdiction on a court or judge, no doubt the usual legal consequence of a judgment may follow something so appearing to the eyes of the court or judge, and subject to appeal, the appearance thus made in the eyes of the tribunal may be final and the consequence absolute.\nBut all that is predicated upon the implication that due proof shall have been made. In fact the use of the word there implies what cannot be implied here without attributing to the legislature such a degree of rashness as I will not readily impute.\nWe know that the conditions of fact it had to deal with did not really render it prudent to entrust such an absolute ex parte power to men in the ordinary course of events sure to fill the position designated.\nIf we read the word \u201cappears\u201d as exacting the actual foundation thereof to be the fact and nothing else, we give effect to the purview of the entire Act, do no harm to any one and run no risks of doing so.\nNow what must be our decision on the issue of fact?\nWith the single exception of his intimating to Dr. Gr\u00fcner, who had expressed a doubt on one point, that experts were not in court to doubt, but to tell what they knew, the learned trial judge seems to have conducted the trial with patience and an intelligent understanding of this issue and of the bearing of the evidence and principles involved in its application thereto and has reached the conclusion of fact that the goods were fit for food. Such finding unreversed must stand here unless there can be shewn demonstrable error in the foundation on which it rests or in the mode of thought adopted by the court conducting the investigation. The extreme importance which I attach to seeing just what shade of meaning an expert giving evidence may have in his mind prevents me passing this incident unnoticed.\nWith great respect, I think experts who have conducted an elaborate experiment and are relating the result, are not only entitled to give their own actual deductions therefrom, but also bound to express their doubt if there should happen to be a chance of the general bearing of their evidence being taken as affirming or denying a something respecting which they in fact are in doubt. I do not think this was departed from more than accidentally and, therefore, do not purpose analyzing in detail the evidence adduced on the main issue, but merely to point out in a general way the bearing of what I have said and of the evidence in leading me to come to practically the same result, on this issue of fact, as the learned trial judge.\nI have already intimated that in carrying out either of the statutes in question the inspecting officer responsible for the determination of the result of the inspection, need not be that remarkable man possessed of all the knowledge possible to he had on the subject of health and food, but a reasonably competent man who has the right to inquire from others, and thus aided, become possessed as occasion arises of the knowledge necessary to enable him to reach a satisfactory determination in any particular case brought under his notice.\nIn this case I assume Mr. McCarrey, and not his messenger or assistant Grenier, was as chief food inspector the officer to determine.\nThere were nearly five thousand cans of the material in question. The goods had been put up in three different classes, of egg yolks, of white of egg, and of egg yolks and white of egg. The food inspector had apparently without informing himself as to the nature or classification of this large collection of canned goods got Grenier to bring four cans thereof. Parts of these were given to the city analyst and part to the provincial bacteriologist.\nI am unable to understand how any one could honestly and fairly determine (even if these gentlemen had made reasonably fair reports in respect of what these four cans contained) as the result of such inspection, the quality of the entire goods in question. It might have been worth his while to know something of the history and ownership and classification of the material, but he ignored such things.\nHe might have ascertained from the owners their views and had a selection made that was mutually agreeable. It is said the owners\u2019 names were refused, but I do not observe any persistent effort in this direction.\nAt all events in the absence of any such agreement or more reasonable mode of determining the quality of goods in such a large number of separate cans, I do not think this could be called an inspection such as the Act contemplates.\nBut let us pass that with the remark that it seems rather a striking illustration of the dangerous consequence apt to flow from a judicial holding that the judgment of such an officer under such circumstances must be taken as final. For my part it is utterly worthless in this case as entitled to any weight of the kind which I have above suggested might be given in a proper case to the finding of the officer. I cannot understand how it came about that the city authorities refused (as at one stage they did) the respondents a chance of further examination.\nAs further examination was in fact got later on and selections were made of cans to be subjected thereto as fair tests of the average quality of the goods, this misconduct (shall I call it?) or strange misapprehension of duty is only of value now when we come to estimate the evidence of those liable to be influenced by such a bad example.\nThe case is thus left to us with the evidence adduced on each side in respect of the character of this material as a food. The appellant\u2019s case rests chiefly on the evidence of the city chemical analyst and the provincial bacteriologist and his assistant, and such indirect support as other witnesses give it. The provincial bacteriologist and his assistant made two reports, of which the first was that acted upon in making the seizure, and the later one was relied upon as furnishing for the trial alleged justifying facts.\nThe city chemical analyst cannot say the sample he got was, when it came to his hands, unfit for food. And the result he gives of that and a later investigation is that the utmost he can say is, one might have suspicion of the fitness of those frozen eggs for food.\nThe provincial bacteriologist had as an assistant a young man twenty-five years of age.\nThe evidence of the latter betrays the errors or weaknesses of youth and thus its value in our present inquiry is so impaired as to be an unsafe guide.\nThe first report the bacteriologist and his assistant made, though addressed to the Provincial Board, was so clearly intended to instruct the appellant\u2019s inspector that I think he might, if it had been properly founded, have used it and relied thereupon.\nThis report, however, contains radical error in several particulars. It states \u201ca fresh egg is sterile; it contains no bacteria.\u201d This has been so demonstrated to be erroneous that the provincial bacteriologist has been constrained to admit his error. Creditable as his acknowledgment is, yet the error must detract from the weight one should, but for it, feel inclined to give his later investigations and evidence. And when we find that accuracy of observations of time, temperature and other conditions bearing upon any experiment in attempting to reach a scientific conclusion regarding such subjects as now in hand are of the highest importance, how can we attach importance to experiments made when these elements necessary to success have not been strictly observed?\nAs to due regard therefor the experiments on which the first report was based seem to have been made recklessly, and borne the natural result thereof. The basis of the second report is much improved in this respect, but far from being what one should desire.\nThen the experiment with a guinea pig was so conducted that every one competent to speak thereon has condemned the method.\nWhen we find a sensational and misleading paragraph founded on that experiment is inserted in this first report for the obvious edification of an officer standing sorely in need of assistance founded on scientific observation, how can we safely rely on what he responsible therefor tells the court?\nIt is not in the ordinary sense of the term that I suggest the witness is untrustworthy, for I am far, very far, from supposing he wilfully misstates anything, but he seems not to have been sufficiently imbued with the absolute need of anticipating so far as possible all contingencies and adopting in regard thereto every possible effort to exclude error in the result.\nI am not oblivious of the use that might be properly made of such an experiment, if and when properly conducted.\nThen again in this first report he says he\nfound masses and clots of material some of which appear to be embryos of chickens in an advanced stage of development. At least such material would not be found in an egg fit to be eaten. Egg shells, hair and other foreign material were also found. When we find numerous other experiments made by competent men and there appears in their results not only no verification by them of such a picture save as to egg shells, but also decidedly negative evidence in that regard as to the material in question, can we feel sure this officer has dealt fairly by those concerned?\nAssuming the absolute truth is told regarding this specific result from two samples blended together, are we to suppose this officer did not know that the question to be solved related to thousands of other cans? Or that an accident might produce such a result in one and could not be fairly made to condemn so great a quantity?\nOne should have expected as result of such a single finding an inquiry for more material and a suggestion in the report tending to bring about such an inquiry.\nI observe that the evidence of this provincial bacteriologist adds to the kind of foreign material found, other specimens than those above enumerated.\nAnd again we have in the same report the following:\u2014\nA small part of the eggs from samples A and B were taken and placed in a warm temperature. Putrefaction of a violent nature resulted in about 24 hours, shewing the presence of large numbers of bacteria. Such bacteria were probably introduced at the time of packing, subsequent freezing checking their action.\nThese are not the same samples as the alleged embryo remains were found in.\nWe are not told how warm the temperature was which these samples were subjected to \u2014and what of such a phrase as \u201cabout 24 hours\u201d duration?\nNo one can quarrel with the observation made by counsel for the city on the possible weight to be attached to the evidence of \u201cprofessional\u201d experts; for no one can in the administration of justice overlook the fact that too often such experts lay themselves open to adverse criticism. I may add, however, that the only witness herein who may properly be spoken of as of that class seems to have given his evidence fairly, and I see no reason why honour and truth should not bind such men just as it does the lawyer in court, for in each of these two classes the man disregarding such obligations fails in the end.\nBut when we find men, who are in fact experts, make, as is done in this report, the grave mistake of attaching undue importance to one or more isolated facts, it is not safe to rely too far upon them in same case. The situation they have thereby created tends to prejudice their own minds as well as those of others supporting the cause they have espoused.\nThus outlined is the appellant\u2019s case as I see its strength and weakness.\nOn the other hand men, who seem above reproach, conducted experiments with a degree of accuracy desirable in all such cases, and proved as the result thereof that exposure of the samples which they had got from the goods in question would develop a bad odor or other signs of evil taint, at the end of forty-eight hours, though the product of fresh eggs under similar conditions of exposure would not develop the like odor or taint under sixty hours.\nOthers, again, speak of samples of the material developing, in a warm room, odor or evil taint in some cases at the end of thirty-six hours, and in others at the end of forty hours.\nNo one else than the parties to this report has ventured to vouch for so low a record as twenty-four hours for such like tests to develop such results. The chemical assistant seems willing to indicate as low as \u201caround twenty hours.\u201d I, not they, have used the word \u201ctaint;\u201d I have not tried to improve their language, but merely use a general term to cover the many specific ones used by different witnesses.\nAs these kind of tests by way of taste, smell and appearances and development thereof, seem to be the crucial tests which a number of witnesses qualified to speak would apply, we must ask which set speaking thereto are entitled to credit.\nIt seems to me the evidence of respondent\u2019s witnesses on this point overbears, in every way we can weigh the evidence, that of these two signing said report and speaking as witnesses for appellant.\nDr. Gr\u00fcner does not in this regard help appellant much, for his mind seems to have been turned in another direction. He is asked and answers as follows:\u2014\nQ. You did not make any comparisons as to the time of decomposition in these eggs?\nA. No, sir.\nMr, Vanderleck does not found any evidence he gives in this respect upon any satisfactory data. The surrounding conditions of the material he tested before making any test does not warrant any one in feeling much confidence in the results he got.\nThe bacteriological views which Dr. Gr\u00fcner and Dr. Laberge present, I pass for the present.\nThe result, leaving that phase out of the reckoning is that these frozen eggs seemed to be good when the cans were opened, that the thawing would take some time before the process of decomposition arrested by freezing could begin again to operate, and that in an ordinary room of seventy to seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit, it would require at least thirty-six hours and probably forty-eight hours to so develop the process as to reach the stage when the material might become unfit for food.\nCan we thus say that frozen eggs in such state as found here were, therefore, within any of the terms applied by either of above statutes, unfit for food when seized?\nIt is what they were then and not what they might become that must be the test applied under these statutes to entitle authorities acting thereunder to confiscate and destroy them.\nIt is said that in the ordinary course of housekeeping they might within a less period than thirty-six hours become unfit for food, without the true condition becoming noticed.\nSo may fish, in summer, for example, and many other articles of daily consumption. Doubtless much food goes to waste for want of proper care, and some of it is improperly used, perhaps with detrimental effect. But what has that to do with enforcing the rigorous terms of a law which can only be put in operation when the article has become and is found unwholesome in the hands of those holding it for sale?\nThe proof adduced relative to bacteria raises problems of an entirely different character. And if science has so developed that there are tests based on bacteriology which can be usefully applied to this problem before us, I must say its application in the hands of the witnesses for appellant in this case has not been so made that a satisfactory conclusion can be reached, much less a conclusion that could justify the confiscation of respondents\u2019 property now in question. If I understand aright the argument put forward in support of such a conclusion, it is that though there may be bacteria in the egg, they do not exist in such profusion as found in these goods; that the normal effect of freezing is not only to prevent the multiplication of bacteria, but to destroy a very large percentage of such as did exist originally at the freezing; that on the contention of the respondents these goods were continuously frozen from the time of their first packing till opened in Montreal, and yet that when opened and thawed and then submitted to bacteriological tests, they were found to produce an abnormal number of bacteria as compared with those found either in fresh eggs, or eggs not quite fresh, or of such eggs when submitted to a test of freezing and thawing, and hence of necessity the conclusion must be reached that these frozen eggs are unwholesome and unfit for food.\nHowever plausible this contention may be, it is founded upon such purely theoretical assumptions of fact and ill-conducted experiments that, not only the evidence of those competent to speak on the subject, but also, a profound respect for the methods of the men whose genius and patient investigations founded and developed that branch of science named bacteriology, forbid the acceptance of such conclusion.\nThe mere presence of bacteria in these eggs before being frozen, proves nothing relative to their fitness or unfitness for food at the time when frozen.\nThe number of bacteria then existent therein must on the evidence have depended on the temperature they have been previously subjected to, and other conditions under which they were handled before being frozen. Of all these conditions we are left in absolute ignorance. The prevalence of bacteria of the same kind in that part of the world where the eggs were produced and handled, as in the City of Montreal, is an assumption of fact without anything in the evidence to found it upon as scientific fact.\nThe evidence herein var\u00edes as to the effect upon bacteria of freezing the material in which they may be found. According to some evidence herein the consequential effect thereof also varies.\nThen, again, variation is found in the resistant power of bacteria not only in those of the same kind, but also by a comparison of the effect of freezing on different kinds.\nThere is apparently also great variation of result according to the degree of cold and duration thereof. I imagine also a serious result in the way of variation might be found produced by sudden and unusual changes of temperature though continued below freezing point.\nThere is no proof of what degree of cold was applied from the time of freezing till the tests made in Montreal; nor of the variations therein; nor of the effect of such variations upon bacteria of any kind, much less a varied assortment; nor of the effect thereon of such long continued freezing as is assumed to have existed; nor of the possible results in case of the freezing having ceased for a few hours, for example, or on more than one occasion.\nThus it seems to me that the assumption of fact, as to freezing being destructive of bacteria, which is the foundation of the argument, vanishes.\nThere are many other conceivable possibilities needless to dwell upon which might have to be reckoned with before accepting as proven the theory that of necessity there must have been a diminution of numbers or of vitality in the bacteria to be found immediately before the samples tested were taken for experimental purposes.\nThen from the moment these samples were taken charge of for such purposes did any single one of those making the tests therewith now relied upon take such precautions, by so anticipating all possible contingencies, as to ensure that there could not be a rapid multiplying of bacteria resulting from even the reduced numbers, if we are to assume the reduction in numbers had taken place as claimed?\nNeither the temperature of the rooms were kept, nor the exact length of time taken in thawing, nor the mode of thawing, nor the surrounding conditions during all that time, are so accurately given as to lay a proper foundation by means of the results reached for any scientific deduction, relative to the quality of this material.\nIt was not, I venture to say, by such methods of observation that the science of bacteriology was founded and has been to the present time developed.\nI need not dwell on details when I find the methods in these regards so unsatisfactory, for without scientific treatment of the subject no scientific knowledge can be furnished us.\nI may remark that Mr. Vanderleck, one of the appellant\u2019s own witnesses, ventured the opinion that though freezing destroyed many bacteria yet they afterwards increased in numbers in the frozen material. If I understand him aright the increase was going on, but such additional crop was of a weakened vitality. The same witness told the learned trial judge that the increase under other conditions might be a doubling every twelve or twenty-four hours. Whether he meant a continuous geometrical progression of this kind was to be expected I know not. The rapidity of possible production manifestly is great. But the degree of heat applied thereto in any event must affect the result, and in absence of knowledge on that vital point, how can any proper estimate be made, or comparison be founded on such data?\nGuesses about room-heat during night and day are poor substitutes for such knowledge.\nAgain as to the kind of bacteria, is it on such a basis worth while estimating the effect of a finding of and comparison of the numbers of bacilli of colon variety, when on the evidence before us it is doubtful whether or not such may not be found in fresh eggs?\nIndeed, the surprising truth seems to be that knowledge on the subject of eggs seems to have been beyond the ordinary range of a great many expert bacteriologists, shocking as such a discovery may be to people dependent on officers of that class for protection.\nWe get back to the practical tests of smell, taste and appearance upon which the weight of evidence seems against appellant.\nWhether or not a food which is liable to become unwholesome within so brief a period after being thawed out, should or should not be sold without being subject to regulation designed to protect the consumer is a something with which we have in a strictly judicial sense no concern; especially as it is beyond the contemplation of the statutes in question.\nIn view of the many suspicions aroused by the inquiry, it may be that further inquiry of a more searching and scientific kind may be desirable and the dangers, if any, guarded against, from such food being improvidently used, but that is for others than we to enter upon. It does not fall within our province.\nIt may be that the injunction is too wide in restraining statements which fall within the province of those having on behalf of the city to deal with such problems. They ought to be allowed the utmost freedom to state the actual facts even if arousing a suspicion. A just and reasonable suspicion may exist relative to all canned or frozen foods and the subject of use thereof may well bear re-examination in order to avert the results of carelessness on the part of the producer or merchant, or rashness begotten of ignorance on the part of the consumer or his servants. All we can say is the defence is not proven.\nThe assumption I have made that the health officer, because filling such office as the by-law designates, falls within the Acts, may be found, if one had the whole by-laws and legal history thereof before him (as I am not sure I have), in fact not legally correct. My assumption, however, cannot affect the result on the main point on which I think it desirable the case should turn and be decided.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the foregoing I have assented to the memo, substituted by my brother Anglin amending formal judgment below.\nAnglin J.\u2014In order to succeed in this appeal the defendant must satisfy us either that its action in attempting to seize and destroy property of the respondents as unfit for human food was justifiable, or that it is not subject to review and control by the courts. It takes both positions. It alleges that the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs were in fact unwholesome and unfit for human food and that their seizure and confiscation was justified under the provisions of the Montreal City Charter and by-laws and also under the Quebec \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d and it maintains that its health officer acted under the latter statute and that it clothes him with a discretionary power of such a nature that its bon\u00e2 fide exercise either may not, or should not be interfered with by the courts.\nWithout so deciding, because that seems to be unnecessary for the determination of this appeal, which may be more satisfactorily disposed of on broader grounds, but assuming in favour of the appellant:\u2014\n1. That there was a seizure of the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs sufficient in substance and in form;\n2. That food such as that here in question, put up in sealed cans and of such a character that its fitness for human consumption can be determined only by expert analysis, falls within the purview of the legislation invoked;\n3. That the objections taken to the inspection by the health authorities, on the grounds that it was made by the testing of samples, that the samples taken were too few, and that the analyses of them were not made by the health officer in person, are ill-founded;\n4. That the discretionary power conferred by the \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d on the executive officer of a local Board of Health cannot, or should not, be controlled or interfered with by the courts, unless attempted to be exercised mal\u00e2 fide; and\n5. That the defendant\u2019s plea was not demurrable because it omitted to allege that the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs \u201cwere held or offered for sale for food,\u201d I am of opinion that this appeal must fail.\nBy art. 300, sec. 40, of its charter (62 Vict. eh. 58), the City of Montreal is authorized:\u2014 To provide for the inspection of meats, poultry, fish, game, butter, cheese, lard, eggs, vegetables, flour, meal, milk, dairy products, fruit and other food products; to provide for the seizure and summary destruction of any such products as are unsound, spoilt or unwholesome; to prohibit the bringing into the city of unsound, spoilt or unwholesome products and to define the duties, powers and attributions of the inspectors appointed for that purpose; and to prevent any animals or meat brought into the city from being sold within its limits for consumption before it has been inspected and stamped in the manner prescribed by the council at the cost of the city.\nBy sec. 122 (4 Edw. VII. ch. 49, art. 7), the municipal corporation is empowered\nin the interests of public health, to prohibit the adulteration of any substances intended for food; to prohibit the sale of any adulterated or unwholesome food and order the confiscation, or the confiscation and destruction thereof, as the case may be; to define what constitutes food for the purpose of this paragraph; what shall be considered an adulteration thereof; to enact that a third offence against any by-law passed in virtue of this paragraph shall render the offender liable to imprisonment not exceeding two months at the discretion of the recorder, in addition to the usual penalty.\nIn the exercise of the authority thus conferred, the city council passed its by-law No. 105, creating a Board of Health. This by-law contains the following clause:\u2014\nSec. 8.\u2014The said Board of Health is hereby empowered to appoint such health officers as may be deemed necessary for superintending or carrying out the orders of the board.\nSec. 17.\u2014:No person shall sell or have in his possession for sale any unwholesome meat, poultry, game, eggs, fish, unripe or decayed fruit or vegetable that might in any way be injurious to health; and any member or officer of the Board of Health is hereby authorized to seize and confiscate all such meat, poultry, game, eggs, fish, fruit or vegetable; the entire cost of removing any of such deleterious articles as may be found in any premises; to be paid by the delinquent in addition to the penalty provided in section 56 of this by-law.\nUnder this legislation the jurisdiction of the Board of Health and its officers to seize and confiscate the articles of food with which it deals depends upon their being \u201cunsound, spoilt or unwholesome.\u201d It is only in respect of food which is in fact unwholesome that the statute confers any authority; it is only for the seizure and confiscation of food which is in fact deleterious to health that the civic by-law provides. In order to justify the action of the local Board of Health and its officers under these provisions, the defendant must prove to the satisfaction of the court that the eggs in question were unwholesome and unfit for food. The burden of doing so is upon it. After exhaustive inquiry the learned trial judge found that that burden had not been discharged\u2014that\nthe preponderance of evidence received in this case demonstrates that the frozen eggs in question were not unwholesome, putrid, damaged, or affected with germs of disease or otherwise injurious to health.\nBecause they dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal on other grounds, the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench found it unnecessary to pass upon this question of fact.\nCareful attention to the evidence during the argument and subsequent study of it with the aid of the supplementary factum furnished by counsel for the appellant have not convinced me that the conclusion of the learned trial judge in regard to the quality of the eggs was erroneous. If the testimony does not clearly establish that when seized the eggs were wholesome and sound, it certainly falls short of what would be necessary to justify an appellate court in deciding that their unsoundness and unwholesomeness had been so clearly demonstrated that the finding of the trial judge should be reversed. In so far, therefore, as the defendant attempted to justify the action of its health authorities under the provisions of its charter and by-law No. 105, it has failed to do so.\nArticle 3913 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d which the defendant also invokes, reads as follows:\u2014\nArt. 3913.\u2014Every executive officer of the municipal sanitary authority or any other officer appointed by it for that purpose, may inspect all animals, dead or alive, meat, fowl, game, fish, fruit, vegetables, grease, bread, flour, milk or other liquids and food intended for human consumption and offered for sale, or deposited in a place or transported in a vehicle for the purpose of being afterwards sold or offered for sale, or delivered after being sold; and, if upon inspection, such animals, liquids or food appear to be unwholesome, putrid, damaged or infected with the germs of disease, or otherwise injurious to health, he may seize the same, carry them off, and dispose of them so that they shall not be offered for sale or serve as food for man.\nIt is contended for the appellant that the discretionary power with which the legislature has by this enactment clothed the executive officer of the municipal sanitary authority, or any officer appointed by it for the purpose, if exercised bon\u00e2 fide, is not subject to curial control; that the method and sufficiency of the inspection is entrusted to the officer\u2019s judgment; and that the courts should interfere only if mala fides is alleged and proved, or if it is shewn that there has not been any real inspection. I assume in the defendant\u2019s favour that this is the correct view of this statute, notwithstanding the arbitrary and drastic character of the power which it confers and the absence from it of any provision for compensation, in case of mistake, to the unfortunate owner who loses his property. But the seizure and confiscation must be the act of the executive or other designated officer himself, as the result of his own adverse judgment upon the character of the condemned food; it must be undertaken and carried out upon his responsibility; it must in fact and reality be an exercise by him of the power entrusted to him. That is the sole safeguard which, upon this interpretation of the statute, the legislature has provided for the protection of the owner whose property is subjected to the risk of summary confiscation. To that protection at least he is entitled; and the burden of shewing that he had the benefit of it rests upon the defendant which has assumed responsibility in this case for all that Dr. McCarrey did.\nA study of the record has satisfied me that, in directing the seizure and destruction of the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs, Dr. McCarrey, \u201cthe executive officer of the municipal sanitary authority,\u201d did not act on his own judgment or responsibility, but merely carried out the instructions of the Board of Control. He consulted that Board at every step in his proceedings. He did nothing except under its immediate direction. In his notices to the storage company, prepared under the direction of the legal advisers of the city by instructions of the Board of Control, he refers to the inspection as having been made \u201cby the sanitary authorities of the City of Montreal,\u201d and he indicates that \u201cfurther action (is to) be taken by the health authorities,\u201d In his testimony he refrains from stating that he acted in any way on his own judgment or responsibility; on the contrary he emphasizes his constant submission to the directions of the Board and the steps taken by it which resulted in his action. Indeed, had it not been that counsel for the plaintiffs in the course of cross-examination put to him an incautious question, we would have been left in ignorance of what Dr. McCarrey\u2019s personal opinion as to the quality of the eggs had been. In its plea the defendant makes no allusion to art, 3913 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act.\u201d It is not suggested that the seizure and condemnation were made under the authority of that provision. The proceedings are there justified under the provisions of the city charter and by-laws. The seizure is spoken of as the act not of the executive officer of the Board, but as that of the city itself. Throughout the defendant accepts responsibility for everything that was done. In my opinion it is not possible on the evidence before us to contend successfully that Dr. McCarrey exercised or intended to exercise the powers conferred on him by art. 3913 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act.\u201d The attempted seizure and confiscation of the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs was undertaken and proceeded with by the order and on the responsibility of the Board of Control acting under the authority of the city charter and by-law. There never was any condemnation of them or direction for their seizure and destruction by Dr. McCarrey as his own act, on his own responsibility, or as the result of his own conviction that they were unwholesome and unfit for food. Assuming that the courts should not review or interfere with the conduct of a competent officer proceeding bon\u00e2 fide under art. 3913 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d the defendant cannot in this case invoke that provision to oust the jurisdiction of the courts to prevent the seizure and destruction of the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs which it has failed to shew were unwholesome or unfit for human food.\nNeither can it uphold the legality of the action of its officers by appealing to the order of the provincial Board of Health, which purports to be made under art. 3875 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act.\u201d That order directs the municipal corporation\nd\u2019appliquer, dans un delai de trente-six heures, l\u2019article 3913 de la dite loi, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire prendre les mesures voulues pour que les dits \u0153ufs ne puissent \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9s \u00e0 la consommation, non seulement dans Montr\u00e9al mais de m\u00eame dans tout la territoire de la province, que le conseil d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne doit \u00e9galement prot\u00e9ger.\nThe power conferred on the provincial Board of Health by sub-section 3 of article 3875 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d is\nin the interests of public health to compel municipal councils to exercise and enforce such of their powers as in the opinion of the Board of Health the urgency of the case demands.\nArticle 3913 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d does not confer any power on municipal councils. It empowers an officer as persona designata to take a certain course of action. The provincial board is not given jurisdiction to order that official to exercise his powers. Moreover, if the provincial board had authority to direct the executive officer of a local board to act under art. 3913 (R.S.Q.), in order to carry out such a direction, there must have been a condemnation of the food by him on his own responsibility and as his own act before it could legally be seized and destroyed under that article. Treating the order, which is addressed to the municipal corporation, notwithstanding the distinct reference in it to art. 3913 (R.S.Q.) of the \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d as a mandate requiring the corporation to act under the provisions of its charter and by-law, which it would be within the power of the provincial board to direct, the appellant again encounters the insuperable difficulty that that power is exercisable only in respect of food which is in fact bad and unfit for use. The burden of establishing the existence of that condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the local Board of Health is upon the defendant and, as already pointed out, it has failed to make the requisite proof. For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe injunction granted by the Superior Court contained the limiting words\nso far as may relate to any acts or proceedings heretofore had or begun or to any condition or conditions heretofore existing in connection with the said goods.\nBy its judgment the court of appeal excised these words from the injunction. This might lead to the conclusion that the court of appeal forbade the municipal authorities to discuss the present condition of the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs or to institute new proceedings for their seizure and condemnation. That cannot, I think, have been intended in view of the facts that the court of appeal maintained the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the grounds that the seizure by the municipal officers had been defective and that the defendant\u2019s plea was technically insufficient, and that there was before it no evidence as to the condition of the eggs when the appeal was heard and disposed of. The evidence bore only upon the condition of the eggs up to the time of the trial \u2014 now some two years ago. We know nothing as to their present condition. In order to make it clear that the injunction does not extend to present or future conditions, or to any future proceedings which may be lawfully instituted, I would restore the limitation placed by the learned trial judge upon its terms. The injunction also restrains\nthe defendant, its officers, agents and servants from making any threats or statements respecting the state of the said merchandise.\nIn connection with any further proceedings which the civic health authorities may be advised to institute it may become necessary for them to discuss the history of the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs and their condition from time to time. Such discussion may also be necessary and proper should the plaintiffs bring an action for damages against the defendant by reason of the proceedings taken by it of which further prosecution has been enjoined. Under these circumstances it would seem to be advisable to omit from the injunction the provision lastly above quoted. I would, therefore, modify the judgment in appeal by substituting for the paragraph in which the injunction is declared permanent, the following:\u2014\nDoth declare the injunction permanent; doth accordingly enjoin and restrain the defendant, its officers, agents and servants from seizing, destroying, taking possession of or in any way interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 eggs under or in pursuance of any acts or proceedings begun or had before the 7th day of April, 1911, or otherwise than by due process of law; doth order that the mise-en-cause do take notice hereof and govern itself accordingly.\nBrodeur J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend dans son factum que la Cour Supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019entendre cette cause parce qu\u2019elle est pendante devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9.\nCette question de jurisdiction avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par motion mais la cour \u00e9tant \u00e9galement partag\u00e9e la motion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e.\nIl appert que l\u2019appelante aurait obtenu de la Cour du Banc du Roi la permission de porter cette cause devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9, et aurait fourni le cautionnement n\u00e9cessaire. Rien cependant n\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour poursuivre cet appel au Conseil Priv\u00e9. La copie du dossier ne fut pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9e ni transmise, la requ\u00eate en appel ne fut pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Conseil Priv\u00e9 et l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019y produisit de comparution.\nL\u2019appelante aurait alors le 4 mars, 1912, fait signifier \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e un d\u00e9sistement de son appel au Conseil Priv\u00e9 et l\u2019aurait produit au greffe de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Elle aurait ensuite fait les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires pour porter son appel devant cette cour.\nJ\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019opinion quand la requ\u00eate en cassation est venu devant nous que le d\u00e9sistement avait mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019appel au Conseil Priv\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, comme le pr\u00e9tendait l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019il f\u00fbt produit au bureau du Conseil Priv\u00e9 vu que le dossier n\u2019y avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis (Practice, Cameron (2 ed.), p. 430). Je vois que le r\u00e9gistraire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\nAgissant sur une suggestion qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite lors des plaidoiries sur la requ\u00eate en cassation l\u2019appelante a transmis au r\u00e9gistraire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 l\u2019avis suivant en date du 12 mars, 1912:\u2014\n17, Victoria Street,\nLondon, S.W.,\n19th April, 1912.\nSir,\u2014\nCity of Montreal v. John Layton & Co., Ltd., and The Gould Cold Storage Company.\nThis is an appeal by the City of Montreal from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side), for the Province of Quebec.\nWe beg to enclose a formal notice addressed by the solicitors for our client, the City of Montreal, to yourself advising that the city has desisted from, and wishes to withdraw, this appeal.\nAccording to our instructions, the city has desisted from the appeal to His Majesty in Council and has taken steps to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. It appears that, notwithstanding the filing of a notice of desistment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and the allowance by that court of the security on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, a motion to quash the appeal in the Supreme Court has been made by the respondents, one of the grounds being that, once security had been given and allowed in an appeal to His Majesty in Council, the appeal cannot be withdrawn except in accordance with the Privy Council Rules.\nWe are instructed to request that you will, under Rule 32, notify the Clerk of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side), by letter of the lodging of the enclosed notice of withdrawal. We trust that the non-arrival of the Record will not be considered to prevent the application of Rule 32.\nWe are, Sir,\nYours obediently,\n(Sgd.) Blake & Redden.\nThe Registrar,\nJudicial Committee of\nThe Privy Council.\nLe r\u00e9gistraire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 a alors envoy\u00e9 la lettre suivante au Greffier de la cour d\u2019appel:\u2014\nPrivy Council Office.\nDowning Street, London, S.W.\n19 April, 1912.\nSir,\u2014\nCity of Montreal v. John Layton & Co., Ltd., and another.\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Messrs. Blake and Redden, the London agents of the appellants, with a copy of the document referred to in that letter. I have informed them that I do not see my way, under the Privy Council Rule 32, to which they refer, to notify you formally that the above appeal has been withdrawn, because the Record not having arrived, I have no official notice that it has been admitted. With a view to assist them, however, I enclose these documents, which will shew you that it is not the intention of the appellants to proceed further with the appeal to His Majesty in Council and I think this will probably attain the object that they have in view.\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nCharles Neish,\nRegistrar of the Privy Council.\nThe Clerk of Appeals,\nCourt of King\u2019s Bench,\nMontreal.\nCette correspondance me confirme dans l\u2019opinion que le d\u00e9sistement d\u2019un appel au Conseil Priv\u00e9 peut \u00eatre produit devant la Cour du Banc du Roi aussi longtemps que le dossier n\u2019est pas transmis en Angleterre. Il ne peut pas y avoir de doute alors que cette cause n\u2019est plus pendante devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9 et que nous avons jurisdiction pour en disposer au m\u00e9rite.\nAu m\u00e9rite je trouve, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 soigneusement la cause, que l\u2019appel ne peut pas \u00eatre maintenu. Je dois ajouter cependant que c\u2019est avec la plus grande h\u00e9sitation que j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 cette conclusion et le fait est que si le juge instructeur qui a eu l\u2019avantage d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moins, de peser les contradictions nombreuses que nous relevons dans la preuve en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre conclusion que celle qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9e cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus conforme \u00e0 mon opinion, mais du moment qu\u2019il trouve que les \u0153ufs en question \u00e9taient propres \u00e0 l\u2019alimentation je ne peux pas facilement renverser son jugement. La l\u00e9gislature a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019officier ex\u00e9cutif de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 sanitaire municipale des pouvoirs bien \u00e9tendus sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 3913 des Status Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec. Il peut apr\u00e8s inspection saisir et confisquer des aliments qui paraissent pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 la sant\u00e9. Il parait avoir une tr\u00e8s grande discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 ce sujet, mais dans le cas actuel l\u2019inspecteur, le Dr. McCarry, n\u2019a pas lui-m\u00eame exerc\u00e9 cette discr\u00e9tion et il n\u2019y a aucun document au dossier \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019il a agi de sa propre autorit\u00e9 et sous les pouvoirs qui lui sont accord\u00e9s par la loi. La cit\u00e9 parait plut\u00f4t avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 suivant les dispositions de son r\u00e8glement municipal. Or pour qu\u2019elle puisse r\u00e9ussir il faut que les aliments saisis soient de fait impropres \u00e0 l\u2019alimentation. Comme je l\u2019ai dit plus haut dans le cas actuel le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que les aliments en question dans cette cause sont propres \u00e0 l\u2019alimentation.\nUn mot maintenant quant \u00e0 l\u2019injonction. Il est \u00e9vident que les termes dans lesquels elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise pourraient donner lieu \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e. Alors afin de faire dispara\u00eetre tout doute \u00e0 ce sujet je concours dans la r\u00e9daction qui est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Anglin.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a donc gain de cause et l\u2019appelante doit \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les frais du pr\u00e9sent appel.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ethier & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondents: S.

The authority in respect of the trial of controverted elections resides absolutely in the Legislature of Alberta, and, in this regard, that legislature has delegated only partial powers to the courts and judges of the province for inquiry and report. By the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139, there is no jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court of Canada to hear such appeals, and the local statute makes such proceedings and the report thereon final within the province. The controversy on this appeal does not concern a cause, matter or proceeding, either at law or in equity, which could fall within the statutory jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of Canada. Moreover, the decision sought to be appealed from was merely in respect of preliminary objections, whereby those preliminary objections were dismissed; these proceedings were interlocutory only and did not put an end to the election petition; consequently, it cannot be deemed a final judgment within the meaning of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Charlevoix Election Case[3]; Glengarry Election Case; Kennedy v. Purcell[4].\nLafleur K.C. and O. M. Biggar contra. The proceedings in question arose in a court of superior juris- diction and the judgment appealed from was rendered by the final court of appeal within the province. There is no restriction placed upon the powers of Parliament in respect to such proceedings by section 101 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" The Alberta statute in respect to controverted elections (secs. 4, 7, 10, 13) provides for the filing of the petition in the court; the proceedings are had in open court (secs. 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28). The whole matter involves a dispute in respect of civil rights submitted to the decision of a court of superior jurisdiction within the province, and the decision is a final judgment within the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Reference is made to McDonald v. Belcher[5]; Baptist v. Baptist[6]; Chevalier v. Cuvillier[7]; Shields v. Peak[8]; Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[9].\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta confirming, on an equal division of opinion, the decision of Mr. Justice Scott dismissing certain preliminary objections taken to a provincial election petition under the \"Alberta Controverted Elections Act.\"\nAt the hearing objections were taken that this court had no jurisdiction to hear this appeal because, first, it is taken from the findings of the Supreme Court of Alberta under the \"Alberta Controverted Elections Act,\" and, secondly, because the decision dismissing the preliminary objections was not a \"final judgment\" within the interpretation placed by this court upon that term as used in section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" We were all of the opinion, at the conclusion of the argument, that the objections were fatal.\nIn order to give us jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions of provincial courts under provincial controverted elections Acts, it seems to me that such Acts must either expressly or by necessary implication contemplate and provide for such appeals and that, in addition, Parliament must have clearly conferred upon us jurisdiction to hear them.\nMr. Lafleur contended that, under the 18th and 21st sections of the \"Controverted Elections Act\" of the Province of Alberta, the decision of the trial judge was a judgment of the court; that section 28 provided for an appeal to \"the Supreme Court sitting in banco from any order or determination of the judge,\" and that the determination of such Supreme Court on such appeal was a \"final judgment\" within the 37th section of chapter 139 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, respecting the Supreme Court of Canada.\nI am not able to accept this contention.\nThe inherent power of the legislature to determine questions relating to the election of its members has been, in part, delegated by the Legislature of Alberta to the judges of the Supreme Court of the province. The judge who tries the election petition is empowered to find whether the candidate petitioned against was \"unduly returned or elected a member of the Legislative Assembly,\" and he is directed within a specified time, \"unless his judgment is appealed,\" to \"report his finding to the clerk of the Executive Council.\" The judge is empowered expressly not only to find that the candidate petitioned against was not duly elected, but that another candidate was entitled to the seat and so to certify, in which case it is provided that such other candidate is entitled to the seat in the place and stead of the respondent\nto the petition.\nThen section 28 provides for an appeal to\nthe Supreme Court en banc from any order or determination of the judge,\nand section 31 provides\nthat the adjudication and finding of such court on such appeal shall be duly certified by the registrar or such other officer to the judge appealed from,\nand\nif the appeal is from any finding or determination of the judge under section 21,\nhe shall, in turn, forward it to the clerk of the Executive Council.\nIt is perfectly clear to me that the delegation of power to the court was one intended by the legislature to be final and not to be subject to further appeal to this court.\nThe conclusions the judge in the first instance and the court in appeal afterwards may reach are variously spoken of as a \"judgment\" and as \"findings\" or \"determinations\" or \"adjudication and finding.\" Provision is expressly made for giving effect to them.\nNo provision whatever is made for any further appeal, and, in my opinion, the appeal to the provincial Supreme Court was and was intended to be a final disposition of the subject-matter delegated by the legislature, so far as the courts of law were concerned.\nI do not think that the finding or disposition made by the Supreme Court on an appeal to it from the trial judge on these election petitions can be said to be \"a final judgment of the highest court of final resort in the province\" within the meaning of section 37 of the Act respecting this court.\nIn any event, the disposition made in this case of the preliminary objections cannot be said to be such a final judgment. It simply dismissed these objections leaving the petition to be proceeded with and heard in the ordinary way.\nThe appeal to this court must be quashed because of want of jurisdiction. Costs of a motion to quash allowed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The provincial legislatures are each entitled to declare how the members of its legislative assembly are to be elected, the validity of their elections are to be tested and determined, in the case of dispute thereabout, and how the proceedings adopted to apply such test and procure such determination are to be had and the consequences of such determination.\nParliament has not the slighest right of its own mere will to interfere.\nIt never was intended by section 101 of the \"British North America Act\" that the appellate court therein contemplated should be given, as against the will of the legislature, any jurisdiction over the subject of elections to the legislative assembly.\nSuch a mode of determining the right to sit in any parliament or legislature (of higher order than a municipal council), as trial by the judges of the ordinary courts of the country had not, when the \"British North America Act\" was passed, either in England or here, ripened into a practical legal conception.\nSuch bodies had always guarded as one of their most precious privileges the right to determine all such questions. When the time came for provincial legislatures to confer the power of doing so, in whole or in part, on the courts and judges, the cry was rather that no such power could be constitutionally exercised, and it was somewhat grudgingly conceded as an improvement on old methods though a great step in modern civilization as developed under constitutional government to effectively help purify public life.\nIt has long been conceded to be part of the inherent power of each legislature to so enact by way of delegating the execution of that power inherent in the legislature, or to speak more accurately, the legislative assembly, to such authority as it might see fit to entrust with the duty of deciding and determining what should be done in the premises.\nUntil the legislature has determined otherwise than it has, the delegation of power cannot be held to have gone so far as an appeal here would involve.\nThe \"Controverted Elections Act\" of Alberta has certainly intended that the Supreme Court of the province should be the ultimate appellate court and its decision end all disputes arising under said Act.\nEverything indicates that when proceedings were taken they should be so conducted as to enable an appeal there before constituting a final result and when once decided there that the proceeding should be ended and that the result reached there is to be treated as final.\nParliament can in no way add to this delegation of power by the legislature or meddle with it or with its results in any way.\nThe legislature might, for example, to put an extreme case, have constituted Parliament itself the sole judge of all such questions or given it power to help in the determination thereof, but it has not.\nUntil it does some such like thing or otherwise permitted the intervention of Parliament, the latter cannot nor can we, its creation, interfere.\nThe appeal must be quashed with costs as of a motion to quash.\nDUFF J.\u2014In my opinion a proceeding under the \"Controverted Elections Act\" of Alberta for questioning the validity of an election is not a \"judicial proceeding\" within the contemplation of section 2, subsection (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139; and the appeal is, consequently, incompetent. There are, I think, other objections equally fatal, but it is unnecessary to refer to them specifically.\nANGLIN J. agreed with Davies J.\nBBODEUR J.\u2014A motion to quash has been made in this case on two grounds: (1) That the judgment appealed from has been rendered in the matter of a provincial controverted election; and (2) that it is not a final judgment.\nThe appellant whose election has been contested has filed preliminary objections that the deposit had not been validly made and that the petitioner was not a qualified elector. The judgment a quo is on these preliminary objections.\nIt is not necessary, in order to dispose of this motion, to decide whether there is an appeal to this court in controverted elections of Alberta. The law states, however, that the judgment from that province has to be final in order to be brought before this court. According to the well settled jurisprudence of this court, a judgment dismissing preliminary objections is not considered final.\nFor that reason I would quash the appeal.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] 22 West.

He twice warned them away, and finally appeared with a loaded gun threatening to shoot. A rush was made towards the verandah where he stood, when he took hold of the barrel of the gun and struck one of the prisoners with the stock. The gun was discharged into his body and there was evidence that the prisoners then maltreated him and his wife. He was taken to a hospital in Halifax where he died shortly after. The trial judge in charging the jury instructed them that the prisoners were doing an unlawful act in trespassing on the property of deceased and that if they were actuated by malice it would be murder, if not it was manslaughter, drawing their attention especially to sections 256 and 259(b) of the Criminal Code. The prisoners were found guilty of murder. On appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a reserved case:\u2014\nHeld, that the above direction to the jury ignored the requirements of the Code formulated in sub-section (d) of section 259, to which the Judge should also have drawn their attention directing them to find whether or not the prisoners knew, or ought to have known, that their acts were likely to cause death, and his failure to do so left his charge open to objection and constituted misdirection for which the prisoners were entitled to a new trial.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, affirming, on a case reserved, by an equal division of opinion, the conviction of the appellants for murder.\nUnder the circumstances set out in the above head-note the appellants were found guilty of the murder of Kenneth Lea at Wolfville, N.S. The prisoner\u2019s counsel then presented to the trial judge thirty-six objections to the charge and verdict and asked him to reserve a case for consideration to the full court, which he refused to do. On application to the full court he was ordered to reserve a case on thirty-two of the objections[1], and after argument on the case so reserved the court was equally divided and the conviction stood. The prisoners then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRoscoe K.C. for the appellants. In a criminal case it is not necessary that evidence should be objected to. Reg. v. Gibson[2]; Rex v. Brooks[3]; Rex v. Farrell[4]. The rule in civil cases does not apply to criminal cases, Reg. v. Th\u00e9riault[5].\nWhen it he facts render it necessary, in order to guide the jury, that a direction on law should be given, want of direction on the point of law is ground for a new trial. Prudential Assurance Co. v. Edmonds[6]; Hawkins v. Snow[7]; Rex v. Blythe[8]. The chief defect in the judge\u2019s charge is the weight attached to the illegal presence of the appellants on the lands of deceased.\nThe term \u201cmalice,\u201d when used, should be defined to the jury. Richardson v. The State[9]. The judge charged that if the jury found that the appellants were actuated by malice and ill-will in going to Lea\u2019s premises, and behaving as they did, even though they did not intend to injure him, the crime was murder. The words and actions of drunken men, as indicative of malice, should be differentiated from those of a sober man. The People v. Rogers[10]; Rex v. Thomas[11].\nFailure to instruct upon the distinction between murder and manslaughter is also the proper subject of reservation. Rex v. Wong On[12]; Rex v. Wallcem[13]. Any point submitted by the judge to the jury should be considered as materially affecting the conviction. The Crown must shew affirmatively that the misdirection did not influence the result. Allen v. The King[14].\nNewcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia discussed the evidence in regard to the res gest\u0153, and referred to 1 Hawk. P.C.

Idington J.\u2014The appellants were convicted of murder as result of a trial by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia and a jury.\nTheir counsel took some thirty-six objections to the learned judge\u2019s charge to the jury, asked for a reserved case thereon and being refused, appealed to the court en banc, which directed the learned Chief Justice to state a case as to thirty-two of the grounds for these objections. The result was that in disposing of his statement of case framed as thus directed the court was equally divided and hence this appeal.\nOf these thirty-four alleged points of law I may say that the great majority of them are in law without foundation. In the result reached by this court it is needless to shew why I have come to such conclusion or to say more about all of them than this: With the one exception I am about to deal with, and a few other instances in which the remarks objected to may have a bearing more or less direct on that one point, it seems to me these points would never have been directed to be stated or upheld if due regard had been had to the curative provisions governing criminal appeals. I have selected that point on which Mr. Justice Drysdale put his finger as containing the pith of all that was objectionable and which I find so well founded as to entitle appellants to a new trial. That objection is No. 28, stated as follows:\u2014\n28. Whether the law applicable to the case was stated sufficiently to enable the jury to determine whether if the defendants were guilty of homicide such homicide was murder, and the facts applicable to such law pointed out.\nI think the first question we must ask ourselves in all criminal appeals where the objections taken are well founded or arguable, is whether or not we can say that in our \u201copinion some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned thereby at the trial.\u201d\nI am not disposed to interpret this statutory duty in any narrow metaphysical sense, for if we did so we might frame a judgment in every case of mistake no matter how trivial so as to demonstrate that there might have been somebody in the jury panel that might have taken another view of the matter if this supposed error had not taken place.\nI think this and every other appellate court acting under our Criminal Code must grasp the matter presented with a strong hand and not allow the trivial error to lead them into the land of speculation founded on some shade of possibility.\nWe must see, however, that the trial has been one of the legal offence charged.\nWe must also, I submit, assume that the jurors have brought to the subject dealt with that close attention to what has taken place in the course of the trial and that strong common sense what would enable them in light thereof to apprehend the language of the learned trial judge in charging them, and in many instances mentally, and automatically as it were, correct the accidental slips of the tongue the most careful judge may chance to make.\nIn this case we have illustrations in many of the objections made of how this should work out. The learned Chief Justice, it appears, used expressions which, isolated, and read without having regard to the evidence and general scope of his charge, might be held to be misdirection, partly of law and partly relative to fact, but which ought not to lead astray or be supposed to have led astray any intelligent jury acting in the spirit which, I submit, should be presumed to have governed them. The general outline of the evidence herein was so clear and simple that properly marshalled there should not have been any misapprehension in this regard of the duties such evidence had cast upon the jury in this case. Simple as the case in this regard is there happened to be two phases of the problem to be solved which were not kept as clearly separated throughout as they might have been, and there is thus the greater difficulty in escaping from the conclusion I have reached, or of applying the curative provision I have referred to.\nBriefly put the facts in outline as presented for the prosecution were that on a Sunday afternoon the appellants, who had been drinking, carried one or more bottles of liquor with them, drank more, and when thus in an intoxicated condition in front of deceased\u2019s premises stopped and trespassed on his lawn. There they used grossly offensive language and though asked by deceased to retire, refused. The deceased and his wife and others who had been on the verandah, withdrew into the house or outbuildings.\nThe appellants remained on the lawn, or on the highway, continuing their unseemly conduct. The deceased after a time loaded his gun and proceeded therewith to the verandah in front of his house. The appellants gave evidence on their own behalf, and it was said by one or more of them that deceased asked them to go away or he would shoot them. They do not pretend that he ever came from his position on the verandah, which was fifty-six feet distant from the highway where they say they then were. The wife of deceased heard a rush of feet on the walk up to the verandah where deceased stood and immediately thereafter an explosion of a gun. It seems tolerably clear that the gun had been used as a club by deceased in resisting the onset of one or all of these appellants, and in the result an explosion of the loaded gun lodged its contents in the upper part of the thigh of deceased, from the ultimate effects of which, I assume for the present, he died, whether necessarily so if not further ill treated, might form another question. A hole was found in the screen front door of the dwelling and a bottle, or remains of one, were, immediately after this, found in the screen front-door of the dwelling and a other facts and especially the possession of a bottle or bottles by appellants, left ground for inference I need not dwell upon.\nThe wife of deceased rushed out and found all three appellants on the verandah or steps therefrom.\nUp to this rush from the highway or lawn, whichever was the place they are supposed to have rushed from, there was not anything which took place that in law could properly be held as provocation so rousing the passions of appellants as to reduce the gravity of the offence, if any, committed by the appellants, or any of them, to manslaughter.\nThe charge, I respectfully submit, rather confuses thought in not restricting this question of manslaughter to be dealt with in treating of the later phase of the case and including there the whole.\nThe evidence warrants the inference that the appellants had unlawfully come to attack the deceased and as the charge puts it that he resisting or anticipating it, struck the foremost of them violently on the head with the butt end of the gun and thereby produced the explosion. But there are other possible inferences as to the exact cause of the explosion quite as much within the range of the consideration of the struggle and its consequences. It may be possible to consider any of these and yet the result of guilt or innocence be open to a jury, Now all the errors, if any, in the learned judge\u2019s charge bearing only upon the evidence or its application so far, I count as nothing that need concern us.\nLet it be assumed for argument\u2019s sake that the attack made or threatened by appellants or any of them was intended to be only an assault, the question arises whether or not the consequence which followed can be made the basis of a charge for murder.\nThe learned Chief Justice charged as follows:\u2014\nAlthough, they could not have contemplated that the gun would be discharged as the result of their action, yet, as in the result it did they would be responsible for it and it would constitute the crime of manslaughter provided there was no malice on their part in doing what they did. On the other hand, if a party while engaged in the commission of a felony kills another it becomes murder and not manslaughter. What is meant by that is this: Suppose these men had come there at night for the purpose of committing burglary and in the course of the commission of that act Mr. Lea had been killed, that would be murder because they then would have been there committing a felony. * * *\nI will next draw your attention to the law bearing upon one of the most important features of the case. There is a common idea, or I have heard it said, that because Mr. Lea held in his own hand the gun the discharge of which inflicted the wound which proximately contributed to his death, the accused are not responsible for that part of the affray. I have heard\u2014and probably you have\u2014that they did not shoot him. It would be a sorry business if that were the law. It would be absurd if such were the law. They are responsible if they caused Mr. Lea to do the act which resulted in the\u2019 discharge of the gun as much as if they seized the gun and discharged it into him. Did they rush at him with the intention of assaulting him and did Mr. Lea then use his gun? If so they are as responsible as if they seized the gun and discharged it into him. \u201cA person may be responsible for the death of another either as-murder or manslaughter, provided it was caused by his unlawful act resulting in corporal injury.\u201d The unlawful act here, as I have pointed out, would be the men assembling in a disorderly way, and trespassing on Mr. Lea\u2019s property and refusing to go away when asked. Now, on the facts I have outlined and bearing in mind the law to be applied, I think this charge misapprehended that law and consequently misdirected the jury.\nThe foundation of the law is in section 252 of the Code defining culpable homicide, and can be properly referred to as aiding any one to understand and interpret the later sections.\nWhen we want to find the definition of the specific offence of murder applied and that applicable to this case, we must look to section 259 of which sub-sections (b) and (d) are as follows:\u2014\n(b) If the offender means to cause to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;\n* * * * *\n(d) If the offender, for any unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be likely to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that his object should be effected without hurting anyone.\nI refer to sub-section (b) because the learned Chief Justice says he read that sub-section to the jury, but he does not seem to have read or at all referred to and explained sub-section (d). With the greatest respect, I must hold this omission was misdirection.\nI do not think as at present advised the evidence in this case warranted much reliance being placed on sub-section (b). I need not elaborate. Let any one consider the facts and read this sub-section and see how ill fitted they are to that sub-section.\nI think sub-section (d) was that to which attention should have been called and its meaning, which is not clear to those ignorant of the history of the law, should have been expounded to the jury in such clear terms that they would understand the ground upon which they ought to have proceeded. If the evidence would not warrant a conviction on this section, then it would be our manifest duty to say so and set the verdict aside on that ground alone.\nI do not, however, so hold, but on the contrary think and hold there was evidence which would warrant the jury in finding thereupon a verdict of murder, resting it on this sub-section (d).\nIt is to that sub-section, I submit, the learned Chief Justice ought to have addressed himself in all he said relative to death resulting from the pursuit of an unlawful object and the bearing thereof on the charge of murder.\nThere are other specific unlawful purposes as in section 260 not appropriate to the peculiar facts in this case.\nHis general remarks as to the pursuit of an unlawful object do not seem to me to exactly fit the case. The unlawful, uncalled for and utterly unjustifiable attack on a man with a loaded gun in his hands was liable to produce a scuffle resulting as this did in the death of some one. The person or persons making the attack must according to their evidence for the defence, have known the gun was likely to be in a loaded condition and liable to explode as it did, and so result. This or something like it was what I conceive was quite competent for the jury to have adopted as a mode of reasoning to found a verdict of murder upon such facts as were presented. I am not to be taken here as doing more than illustrate a possible line of thought and by no means determining the legal result.\nThe learned Chief Justice did refer to a number of analogous cases. But each case in a matter of this kind must stand upon its own bottom. In applying these precedents, or rather as it seems to me this subsection substituted as codification of the law touching such like cases, the measure of its utility and reasonable application in any case must abide the judgment of the jury.\nNo one can in all that branch of the law of homicide anticipate or do more than see that the jury are so fully and accurately instructed that they can intelligently address-themselves to the task set before them by the law in said sub-section (d).\nTheirs is the responsibility when once so instructed. Their understanding of the evidence within the scope of such instructions and application thereof is alone the limit of the practicable operation of the law that must determine the fate of the accused in any such case. In the absence of proper legal instructions in regard thereto there was no legal trial of the real issue of murder. Hence there was no possibility of applying the curative provision I have referred to.\nMuch was said of malice which is aside from the true issue presented here.\nThe doing an unlawful act or rather the pursuing an unlawful object carries with it the implication of malice in all the consequences thereof so far as the sub-section may reach.\nI am by no means to be understood as implying thereby that evidence of hate or ill will external to that so implied or the operation of such other malice upon the mind of one pursuing an unlawful object is to be discarded. The existence of such and the possible influence it may have had on the conduct of one pursuing any unlawful object may be of value in helping those having to reach a conclusion in such a complex case.\nBut I repeat it is not an essential of the evidence which may otherwise and independently thereof point to a conclusion of guilt.\nI purposely omitted above all reference to evidence of the treatment meted out by the accused to the deceased after the explosion of the gun, for it seems to my mind we can by separating the two phases of the case the more clearly reach a proper conception of the law which must govern the case so far as the charge of murder resting upon the explosion of the gun is concerned.\nI am not to be understood, however, as by any means holding that the evidence of such later action is to be discarded as not having any proper place for consideration in connection therewith. It may or may not shed light, but only, as I have suggested regarding evidence of hate or ill will, have a value in enabling a proper estimate to be made of the whole conduct of the parties and of their responsibility in the way of holding they ought to have known regarding the reasonably possible result of their conduct under the circumstances.\nIt is the basis also herein of the other phase of the case relative to the charge of murder and for that should be given separate consideration.\nIf there is any ground for the charge that thereby the death of the wounded man was accelerated this branch of the evidence touches directly upon that and it is in that connection alone that there was ground for referring to provocation resting on the severe wound the blow with the gun had inflicted on one of the assailants.\nI do not see misdirection in what was said in that regard and need not dwell thereupon, but simply say that it would be better understood by distinct and separate treatment in any charge in such a view of the case.\nThe questions relative to manslaughter need not be dwelt upon, but allowed to remain for the future\ntrial and take their proper place in any future charge. I think the appeal must be allowed and a new\ntrial be had.\nDuff J. agreed with Anglin J.\nAnglin J.\u2014In this case I am to deliver the judgment of my brothers Davies, Duff and Brodeur as well as myself.\nWith very great respect for the learned Chief Justice who tried this case, a close study of his charge, which we have read and re-read, has driven us to the conclusion that he misdirected the jury in regard to what, under the circumstances of this case, it was essential that they should find in order to warrant a verdict of murder. He not only failed to bring to their attention at least one inference of fact which it was necessary that they should draw, but his charge, read as a whole, was tantamount to a direction that they might assume that fact\u2014 that they might properly bring in a verdict of murder without passing upon it.\nThe Crown charged the prisoners with murder (a) because they did certain unlawful acts which caused the deceased to do an act that resulted in his inflicting upon himself a gun-shot wound from which he died; and (b) because by their subsequent brutal treatment of him they accelerated his death. Both aspects of the case were presented to the jury. It is impossible to know whether their verdict of murder was based upon both grounds or upon only one of them; and, if upon one only, it is impossible to know upon which. Misdirection as to the essential constituents of the crime of murder upon either aspect of the case would, therefore, amount to such a substantial wrong or miscarriage that it would entitle the defendants to a new trial, although the case had been properly presented upon its other aspect. Having reached the conclusion that there was such misdirection in connection with the degree of responsibility of the defendants for the infliction of the gun-shot wound which caused the death of Mr. Lea on the assumption that his death was not accelerated by what was afterwards done by them, but happened when it did solely as a result of the wound, we deal with the case as if there had been no subsequent ill-treatment of the deceased by the accused.\nBy section 252(2) of the Criminal Code it is provided that,\nHomicide is culpable when it consists of the killing of any person * * * by causing a person by threats or fear of violence or by deception to do an act which causes that person\u2019s death * * *\nThere is no evidence upon which it could be found that the acts of the deceased in \u201cclubbing\u201d his gun and striking Fred Graves over the head with its stock were the result of physical force or compulsion on the part of the defendants. These acts were, physically at all events, the acts of the deceased himself. Upon the evidence they were the immediate cause of his receiving the gun-shot wound from which he died. In order that responsibility for that result should rest upon the defendants so as to make them guilty of culpable homicide under section 252, it was necessary that the jury should find that such acts of the deceased were caused, i.e., induced, \u201cby threats or fear of violence, or by deception.\u201d There was here no suggestion of deception; but there were facts from which a jury might infer, if properly instructed, that the deceased acted through fear of violence on the part of the accused. Yet, although the learned Chief Justice read to the jury other portions of section 252, he entirely omitted to direct their attention to the vital provisions of sub-section 2 above quoted. He neither stated their effect to them, nor, as Mr. Justice Graham points out, did he give them any direction from which they should have gathered that they must find that the \u201cclubbing\u201d of the gun by the deceased and striking Fred Graves upon the head with it were acts induced by fear of violence. That was in itself a serious non-direction, which might amount to such a substantial wrong or miscarriage as would necessitate a new trial. But we do not dwell further upon it because there appear to be even more serious objections to those portions of the charge in which the learned Chief Justice directs the jury as to the facts they must find and the inferences which they must draw in order that what may have been culpable homicide on the part of the accused should amount to the crime of murder.\nWithout determining that the definition contained in sections 259 and 260 of the Criminal Code is exhaustive, under the circumstances of the present case it was, in our opinion, necessary for the Crown to establish and for the jury to find, in order to warrant a verdict of murder, such facts as would constitute that crime under clause (d) of section 259, read with sub-section 2 of section 252. 259. Culpable homicide is murder.\n* * * * *\n(d) If the offender, for an unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be likely to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that his object should be effected without hurting any one.\nFor the purposes of this appeal I assume that under this provision it was not necessary, in order to bring the charge of culpable homicide within it, that the jury should have found that the acts of the defendants were such as they knew or should have known were likely to cause the very acts to be done or the precise situation to arise which in fact resulted in the homicide, or to cause the death of the person who was killed, but that it would suffice if the jury had found that the accused did an act which they knew or should have known would be likely to induce the doing of anything or to bring about any situation likely to cause the death of some person\u2014the person killed or any other person. That construction of section 259(2) is the least favourable to the accused.\nThere was no suggestion that the defendants meant to cause the death of Mr. Lea or to cause him any bodily injury likely to cause his death. The evidence would not support such a finding. Yet the learned Chief Justice read to the jury clause (b) of section 259; but he neither read clause (d) nor stated its effect; nor does his charge contain any equivalent statement of the law. It was assumed that the acts of the accused, which, it was charged, had led to the deceased clubbing his gun and striking Fred Graves with the stock, were done for an unlawful object. But the jury were not instructed that before convicting of murder they must find not merely that the conduct of the accused had in fact led to the doing of that which resulted in death, but also that the accused knew or ought to have known that their acts were likely to cause death\u2014to lead to the deceased so handling or using the gun that some person would probably be killed\u2014 that this was under the circumstances such a natural or probable consequence of their conduct that the defendants should have anticipated it. On the contrary the learned Chief Justice told them distinctly and repeatedly that if in doing what they did the defendants were actuated by spite or ill will towards Mr. Lea they should be found guilty of murder. I quote some of the passages in which this view was impressed on the jury.\nEarly in the charge, after reading section 259 (b) to the jury, the learned judge says:\u2014\nIf a man goes on the property of another as a mere trespasser, and in the course of such trespass commits an assault or anything of that kind upon the owner of the property and death results, although he may have had no malice, if he is there unlawfully, he is guilty of manslaughter. If, on the other hand, he went there with some wicked purpose or with the intention of committing a felony it would be murder. That is the distinction that the law draws between the two offences. The rule that will reduce the crime of killing another from murder to manslaughter is the absence of malice or ill-feeling towards the deceased. If there was no malice or ill-will the crime would be manslaughter. If the evidence satisfies you that the accused, although not intending to kill the deceased, in what they did, were actuated by malice and ill-will in what they did and that his death resulted as a consequence of their unlawful conduct it will be murder and not manslaughter.\nA few lines lower down he says:\u2014\nThey are responsible if they caused Mr. Lea to do the act which resulted in the discharge of the gun, as much as if they seized the gun and discharged it into him.\nA little earlier he had said:\u2014\nAlthough they could not have contemplated that the gun would be discharged as the result of their action, yet, as in the result it did they would be responsible for it and it would constitute the crime of manslaughter provided there was no malice on their part in doing what they did. Further on he says:\u2014\nNow, as I said before, you must judge their motives from their conduct, whether they were actuated by malice, spite and ill will in this inhuman treatment of Mr. Lea. Does the evidence satisfy you that in acting and behaving there as they did they were gratifying an old grudge that they bore towards Mr. Lea. If you find that they were actuated by malice and ill will in going there and behaving as they did, even though they did not intend to injure him, the crime is murder.\nTowards the close of the charge we find the following passage:\u2014\nNow, just a few words in conclusion. I have explained to you as fully as I could, the difference between murder and manslaughter. I have told you that if you believe these men were actuated by ill will or malice towards Mr. Lea and did what has been detailed here, that would be murder, and that all of them should be found guilty. On the other hand, if you think that there was no such ill feeling, that it was a mere fracas, without previous ill feeling, then your verdict should be manslaughter. I have called your attention to the various witnesses who have come here and testified to different expressions of ill will towards Mr. Lea. and you have heard the expressions that they used on this occasion. You must weigh these. If you believe them it is evidence of malice and it is for you to consider them.\nThe jury subsequently returned to court and requested directions on the subject of malice. The notes of the ensuing proceedings are in part as follows:\u2014\nI thought I had defined that fully. \u201cMalice\u201d is where a man has ill-will towards another\u2014any kind of wicked feeling towards his neighbour. If you come to the conclusion that what these men did resulted from hatred or dislike or ill-will that would make it murder. If there is evidence to satisfy you that these men were influenced by spite or ill-will, that with the other facts would constitute murder. But you must not find them guilty of murder unless you are satisfied from the evidence that they had a grudge, or spite, or ill-will against Mr. Lea.\nA juryman asked for further directions as to premeditated murder and malice.\nThe Court: Premeditated murder would be an agreement to commit murder before they went there. There is not the slightest evidence of that. But if the grudge was there and they went there without any premeditated intention, if their acts were induced through ill-feeling that would constitute murder. If you are satisfied that what they did was not done through ill-will that would be manslaughter.\nA Juryman: Then we do not need premeditation; all we need is malice?\nThe Court: All you need is malice.\nA juryman asked for further instructions as to the distinction between murder and manslaughter.\nThe Court: It is enough if they did the acts with malicious intent. If in carrying out the acts that they did after they got there there was malice, that would be malice sufficient to constitute murder.\n* * * * *\nIf after they got there they were carrying out a grudge, if they had it, it constitutes murder.\nA Juryman: If they had malice, it is as bad as if they had premeditation.\nThe Court: Yes.\nA Juryman: Would they have to have that malice at the time he was shot?\nThe Court: Yes, they would have to have the malice at the time. If they had these malicious feelings or this antipathy towards the deceased, it must have existed at the time they did what caused his death, even though they had no intention of doing it before they went there. You must gather the existence or non-existence of malice from what they did at the time. You must take into consideration the threats made beforehand, although I do not know what value you would put on them to shew bad feeling towards Mr. Lea.\nA Juryman: Is it necessary to prove that just before the crime was committed\u2014 a few minutes before\u2014 they bad malice.\nThe Court: What I have told you is that if there was malice you can gather it from the facts of the whole transaction. If you think from the facts proved that they had this ill feeling during the time that they were doing the injuries, then it was malice.\n(The jury then retired.)\nWhen the jury next returned to the court room it was to deliver their verdict of guilty of murder.\nThe vital distinction\u2014 that, while, to sustain a charge of manslaughter, it would suffice that the acts of the accused, whatever their character, should in fact have aroused in the mind of the deceased a fear of violence which induced him to do that which resulted in his death (section 252 (2)), in order that that culpable homicide should amount to murder those acts of the accused must have been such that they knew or should have known that the death of some person would be likely to be caused by them (section 259(d))\u2014was not brought to the attention of the jury. Whether the acts of the accused were of that character it was for the jury to determine; and the inference which they should draw would depend to a great extent upon whether in their opinion the accused knew or ought to have known that the gun in the hands of the deceased was loaded and whether they knew or should have known that their acts would be likely to lead to the deceased making some use of it which would be likely to cause death. Upon neither point can it be said that, under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, a conclusion in favour of the Crown was so necessary that no reasonable man could have found otherwise. Indeed, the learned Chief Justice appears to have gathered the impression from the evidence that the deceased produced his gun not to shoot with it, but merely to frighten the accused. May not they have had the same idea; and, if so, may they not have thought that the gun was not loaded? Again, there is no evidence whether the deceased clubbed the gun before or after the accused are supposed to have rushed at him. If before, may not that act have led them to think that a gun so handled was not loaded? Can it be said that the use of the gun by the deceased in a manner likely to cause death was under the circumstances so clearly a natural or ordinary consequence of the acts done by the prisoners that the jury, acting as reasonable men, could not have found otherwise than that they knew or should have known that the deceased was likely to so use that gun? Upon both these matters of fact it was the function of the jury to determine what inference should be drawn. Upon neither were they given the opportunity of doing so. On the contrary they were directed that if they should \u201ccome to the conclusion that what these men did resulted from hatred or dislike or ill will that would make it murder.\u201d\nIt is not possible to read the charge of the learned Chief Justice without realizing that the jury were instructed that, although in the absence of personal grudge or ill will on their part towards the deceased the acts done by them and the consequences which ensued would have rendered them guilty only of manslaughter, those same acts and consequences, if accompanied by spite or ill will towards the deceased, would make them guilty of murder. The only question really left for the consideration of the jury in determining whether their verdict should be one of murder or of manslaughter was whether in doing what they did the defendants were actuated by ill will to the deceased.\nWith great respect, this involved ignoring the requirement of the Code that the acts of the accused must have been such as they knew or should have known would be likely under the circumstances, to cause death, or an assumption by the learned judge himself of the function of the jury in regard to that vital question of fact, or a direction that the acts of the accused were of such a character that as a matter of law the jury should assume that they knew or should have known that they would be likely to cause death. Under such a direction the jury may have convicted of murder without at all considering whether the conduct of the accused was such that it was probable that it would cause the deceased to act in a manner likely to result in some person being killed. Indeed, they might return such a verdict, although no reasonable man could say that such a result from the acts of the accused should or even might have been reasonably anticipated. That this was a vital misdirection amounting to a substantial wrong or miscarriage in the trial seems only too plain.\nIt is unnecessary to express our views upon any of the numerous other points raised in the stated case.\nIt is abundantly clear that this is not a case in which we should exercise the power conferred by section 1018 of the Criminal Code sub-section (d) to direct that the appellants should be discharged.\nFor the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion, however, that their conviction must be quashed and a new trial had.\nBrodeur J. agreed with Anglin J.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\n[1] 46 N.S.

Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nStatute\u2014Construction\u2014Railway company\u2014Right of way\u2014Combustible materials\u2014R.S.N.S. [1900] c. 91, s. 9.\nChapter 91, section 9, of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, provides that \u201cwhen railways pass through woods the railway company shall clean from off the sides of the roadway the combustible material by careful burning at a safe time or otherwise.\nHeld, that this provision is imperative and obliges the company at all times to keep its right-of-way so clear of combustible material that it will not be a source of danger from fire. Clearing it at certain periods only is not a compliance with such provision.\nDuff J. dissented on the ground that it was not proved that the fire in this case originated on the right-of-way.\nJudgment appealed from (46 N.S. Rep. 20) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was to recover damages for loss of property of the late Frank Schwartz by fire, alleged to have been caused by sparks from an engine of the defendants. The jury found that the fire so originated and started on defendants\u2019 right-of-way; that combustible material on the right-of-way was the cause of the fire and its subsequent spread to the property destroyed; and they assessed the damages at $1,950. The verdict entered for that amount was maintained by the full court below and the defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMellish K.C. for the appellants.\nW. J. O\u2019Hearn for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The only arguable question on this appeal is: Can the finding of the jury as to the place of origin of the fire be supported on the evidence? The court below accepted that finding, and although the evidence is not very satisfactory, I do not think we can say that it so strongly preponderates against the conclusion reached by the jury as to justify us in holding that they did not understand it, or that they wilfully disregarded it. There certainly was an accumulation of brush and dry grass on the track from the previous year in which the fire started almost immediately after the engine passed by. Whether the fire started on the respondent\u2019s property and then spread to the track and came back again to the place of origin, or whether it originated on the right-of-way and then travelled over to the respondent\u2019s property is the point in dispute. There is no doubt that the fire was caused by sparks from the company\u2019s engine and that it spread and caused the damage because of the accumulation of brush and dry grass on the right-of-way, and, in my opinion, it was negligence, in the circumstances of this case, to have allowed that combustible material to remain on the company\u2019s right-of-way from the previous year. The evidence of Dauphin\u00e9e and Fox may not be very conclusive, but they both say that the locomotive set the fire on the right-of-way, and the jurors were entitled to accept or reject that evidence. They did accept it, and I do not feel justified in refusing to give effect to their conclusion concurred in by the court of appeal. I would dismiss with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Two questions were discussed upon the appeal. One was as to the duty of the railway company under the Provincial Statute, B.S.N.S., [1900] ch. 91, sec. 9, \u201cOf the Protection of Woods against Fires,\u201d and the other was whether there was evidence from which the jury could fairly find that the fire which caused the damages complained of started upon the defendant\u2019s right-of-way and was caused by sparks emitted from the company\u2019s engine.\nThe jury found that\nthe fire started on the right-of-way and inside the fence and was caused by sparks carried from the defendant\u2019s engine.\nThey further found that\ninside the right-of-way was an accumulation of dried ferns, grass, bushes and turf.\nAfter reading over the evidence, given I am not prepared to say that there was not evidence from which a jury might fairly find as this jury did.\nThe evidence is, of course, not positive. It would be almost impossible to produce such. But I think it quite sufficient.\nOn the other branch of the case as to the statutory duty of the company, I agree with the court below that such a duty is an absolute and not a qualified one discharged by an annual clearing up as suggested.\nThe section says:\u2014 Where railways pass through woods, the railway company shall clean from off the sides of the roadway the combustible material, by careful burning at a safe time, or otherwise.\nIt is imperative. I cannot read it as meaning that when the company has once obeyed it, then it is absolved from the further duty of keeping the right-of-way clear for some unknown or indefinite time; or that the statute was intended to limit the common law duty of the company. The object of the statute, cleaning from the sides of the railway combustible material, is surely not discharged by doing it once or even by doing it once a year. Such combustible material will accumulate from time to time by the growth of grass, ferns, bushes, etc., and from other causes, and these accumulations must be removed as and when necessary to carry out the evident and plain object of the Act, namely, to prevent fires. I cannot place any other construction upon the company\u2019s duty in this regard than that it is an absolute one and necessary for the protection of the property of persons adjacent to the railway line. Any other construction would, it seems to me, defeat the object and purpose of the Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal seems hardly arguable unless we are to become so astute as to render the statute a subject of mere critical examination regardless of what its obvious purpose was.\nThe ground taken on the facts seems to so conflict with the unanimous opinion of all the judges who have heard the case, that it is not open for us to interfere.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014There is evidence sufficient to support the inference that the fire started from one of the locomotives. Whether it started in the right-of-way or outside the right-of-way is, I think, purely matter of conjecture. The facts proved appear to be equally consistent with both hypotheses, or if the balance incline a little in one direction rather than another it is in so slight a degree as to make it worthless as a foundation for a verdict.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons given by Graham and Russell JJ.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question that we have to decide is as to the construction of section 9 of chapter 91 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia. That section deals with the protection of woods against fires and the section 9 has for its object to prevent railways from setting fire to the adjoining property and reads as follows:\u2014\n9. Where railways pass through woods the railway company shall clean from off the sides of the roadway the combustible material by careful burning lit a safe time or otherwise.\nIn this case it has been found by the jury that there was on the appellants\u2019 right-of-way combustible materials and that the fire that destroyed respondent\u2019s property started from there.\nUnder the common law as it was decided in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rainville[2], a railway company is required to keep its track free from combustible and inflammable substances which are likely to be ignited by sparks from passing engines and to communicate fire to adjacent property.\nThe fact of having combustible material on its right-of-way would, in certain circumstances, constitute negligence on the part of the company and would render it liable. In this case the plaintiffs could have proceeded to recover under the common law and with the evidence that has been adduced would likely have recovered. But the case as it is brought before us rested upon the construction of the statute above quoted.\nThat statute imposes upon a railway company the obligation of keeping the sides of its right-of-way clean of combustible material and to remove or burn it.\nWhen a statute declares that something shall be done the language is considered imperative and the thing must be done, especially when the thing to be done is for the public benefit.\nThere was then an imperative duty on the part of the appellants to clean from their right-of-way all the combustible material that was there for some months, and I would not be disposed to reverse the decision of the courts below.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H. Fulton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. J. O\u2019Hearn.\n[1] 46 n.s. Rep. 20.\n[2] 29 Can. S.C.R. 201 at p. 204.\n"}

The authority of Parliament to pass this section only exists by virtue of its legislative jurisdiction as to railways and its legislation must be essential to the purposes of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nA contractor, qua contractor, is not subject to the legislative authority of Parliament, and nowhere in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is such authority expressly exercised and nowhere impliedly exercised unless it be in this section.\nThe limitation of the right of action in statute must be clear and express, it will never be implied. Maxwell on Statutes (5 ed.), page 463; Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[3]; Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[4], per Fitzpatrick C.J. at page 360.\nThe contractor does not stand in such relation to the company as would extend the latter\u2019s privilege to him by implication. He is not the company\u2019s employee, Kearney v. Oakes[5]; nor their agent or servant.\nThe provision in section 306 as to prescription cannot apply to the Commissioners as no action such as is prescribed could be brought against them. As a consequence it cannot apply to the defendants who only claim through the Commissioners.\nTeed K.C. for the respondents. The Commissioners are obliged to construct the railway through contractors and the latter are merely their instruments and under no greater liability than they themselves would be.\nThe defendants were \u201cpersons authorized to construct a railway\u201d under the interpretation section of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nIn Hendrie v. Onderdonk[6], and Lumsden v. Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission[7], contractors were held entitled to plead the prescription provided for in a similar section of the \u201cOntario Railway Act.\u201d\nF. R. Taylor for the appellant\nTeed K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the plaintiffs as licensees of certain timber limits in the Province of New Brunswick for damages for loss by fire of many trees upon such limits caused by sparks emitted from a railway locomotive engaged in the work of constructing a part of the National Transcontinental Railway. The defendants, in the statement of claim, were alleged to be contractors engaged in certain work in the construction of the National Transcontinental Railway adjacent to and near the plaintiff\u2019s limits and in such construction used a locomotive engine.\nThe claim was that the defendants were negligent in the operation of the engine and that in consequence of their negligence the sparks from the engine escaped and set fire to plaintiff\u2019s limits.\nThe statement of claim was also based upon an alleged liability of the defendants for the damages caused by the sparks escaping from the engine, whether there was negligence on the defendants\u2019 part or not.\nThis last claim was based upon the 298th section of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 37, providing in certain cases for the absolute liability of \u201cthe company\u201d making use of the locomotive causing the fire whether guilty of negligence or not.\nIn the case at bar, however, the jury found, and no question was raised before us on the finding, that the damages were caused by the negligence of the defendants in not having the engine equipped with modern and efficient appliances for preventing the escape of sparks, and on that finding the verdict was entered.\nThe claim, therefore, for a right to recover under the 298th section of the statute for statutory damages, irrespective of negligence, does not arise here.\nThe important facts that the defendants were contractors for the construction of a part of the National Transcontinental Railway, and that while engaged in such construction they so negligently used and ran one of their locomotive engines as to cause the damages complained of, were conceded at the argument.\nThe only point upon which the defendants claimed to set aside the judgment was that the action was brought against them too late, and was barred by the 306th section of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nThe single question we have to determine is whether that section can only be invoked by a railway company authorized by Parliament to construct a railway, or whether contractors under the National Transcontinental Railway Commissioners for the construction of the whole or of part of such railway, can also invoke it.\nNow, the railway in question was the Eastern branch of the National Transcontinental, and was being constructed pursuant to the powers contained in the statute 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71, and conferred upon three Commissioners appointed by the Governor-in-Council, who were declared to be a body corporate.\nThese Commissioners had all the necessary powers vested in them to carry out the work of constructing the Eastern section of the road and operating it until completion. They had, by section 15, in addition to the special powers conferred upon them, all the rights, powers, remedies and immunities conferred upon a railway company under the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and such \u201cRailway Act,\u201d so far as applicable, was declared to be taken and held as incorporated in the Act 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71.\nThe Commissioners, by section 16, were obliged to let the work of constructing the Eastern division by tender and contract as specified. The defendants in this case were contractors for the construction of part of this Eastern division of the railway, and in the carrying out of such contract negligently caused the damages complained of.\nThe 306th section of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d provides that all actions or suits for indemnity for any damages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be commenced within one year next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, etc., and not afterwards.\nSub-section 2 provides that in any such action\nthe defendants may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special Act in evidence, and prove that the damages were done \u201cin pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act.\u201d\nSub-section 3 provides that nothing in the section shall apply to actions against \u201cthe company\u201d upon any breach of contract relating to the carriage of traffic or for damages respecting tolls.\nThis limitation upon actions for damages, though in form somewhat different, was contained in the general railway Acts for many years before that of 1903. In the Act consolidated that year, the clause making the railway liable for damages caused by fires from locomotives irrespective of negligence, was first introduced, and the language of the limitation clause was changed from damages sustained \u201cby reason of the railway,\u201d to its present form, \u201cby reason of the construction or operation of the railway,\u201d and the time limit extended from six to twelve months.\nThe first two clauses of the section 306 are as broad and general apparently as language could make them respecting damages sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway, and no words are used shewing any intention to confine their application to \u201ccompanies\u201d only.\nIn my opinion they refer to damages the result of negligence in the exercise of statutory powers given for the construction and operation of railways. For damages resulting from the exercise of such statutory powers without negligence no action at all would lie. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[8]. Are they confined to \u201cthe company\u201d authorized to construct and operate a railway, or do they extend to a contractor under such company who does such work of construction? In the case of the Eastern branch of the National Transcontinental the Commissioners were not authorized to do the work of construction themselves or by their employees. They were obliged by section 16 to let the work of construction by tender and contract and the defendants in this case were contractors under the Commissioners for the construction of part of the road.\nI cannot see why a construction should be put upon the broad general language of the section in question excluding the contractors from the benefit of it. It must be remembered that the Eastern division could only be built by contractors. If the section does not apply to contractors then it would not be applicable at all to any one constructing such Eastern division, for I do not see how the Commissioners could be held liable for such damages as were recovered in this action. If this was an action to recover the statutory damages, liability for which was created by section 298, then it would seem the question would have to be determined whether \u201cthe company\u201d declared in that section to be liable for the damages included a contractor under the company, and that would probably be solved by the construction put upon the words of sub-section 4 of section 2, the interpretation clause, which declares that company means\na railway company and includes any person having authority to construct or operate a railway.\nDo those words include persons having contractual authority to construct or operate, or are they confined to those who have legislative authority to do so? In this case it is not necessary that we should decide upon the point because the action does not involve any question of statutory damages, but damages for negligence only, and the limitation clause does not use the word \u201ccompany\u201d at all either in the first section or in its second sub-section, but speaks of the persons sued as defendants.\nI am of opinion that these damages sued for in this action were damages sustained by reason of the negligent construction of the railway, and are, therefore, within the Act. In the absence of any language restraining the privilege or benefit of the section to the company only and excluding contractors, I think the contractor who, in this case, alone could construct the railway has the right to invoke the benefit of the section.\nIn sub-section 3 certain actions against \u201cthe company\u201d upon any breach of contract or respecting tolls are excepted out of the section, but this is the only reference direct to \u201cthe company.\u201d\nWhile, therefore, the section doubtless includes a \u201ccompany\u201d which builds the road itself, it also includes a contractor who alone, under the Act for the construction of the Eastern branch of the National Transcontinental Railway, was authorized to do the work of construction.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The broad question raised by this appeal is whether or not contractors engaged in the construction of part of the National Transcontinental Railway, pursuant to the contract said to have been let by the Commissioners appointed under 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71, are entitled to plead section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in bar to an action for damages resulting from the contractors\u2019 own negligence in course of their execution of the work so let to them.\nThe respondents, as such contractors, had in their service a railway locomotive so defective that fire spreading therefrom burned appellant\u2019s timber.\nThe 15th section of the said 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71, is as follows:\u2014\n15. The Commissioners shall have in respect to the Eastern Division, in addition to all the rights and powers conferred by this Act, all the rights, powers, remedies and immunities conferred upon a railway company under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and amendments thereto, or under any general railway Act for the time being in force, and the said Act and amendments thereto, or such general railway Act, in so far as they are applicable to the said railway, and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of this Act, shall be taken and held to be incorporated in this Act.\nIn order to comprehend accurately the bearing of this section in relation to the matters respecting which section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d provides for a limited immunity, we must see who or what these Commissioners are and what acts they are authorized to do in respect of which such immunity may possibly serve them.\nThey are created a corporation. So are other public officers occasionally. It is here as in such other cases a convenient method of creating and providing a continuity of official life and action which need not depend upon or be interfered with by the accidents of death, removal or resignation of any of its members.\nSo far as the commission or its members may be enabled by the Act creating, or providing for its creation, to do anything that in the ordinary course of events might give rise to an action against it or them or any of them, I will assume for the present this section may entitle it or them to plead this limitation. But when we find that neither the commission nor any of its members are given power to construct a foot of the railway in question or do anything bearing on such a question except the mere getting of tenders and letting to the lowest tenderer a contract and reporting upon tenders for the work (for the large contracts like this one were let only, I believe, by the Crown, which is not liable, or by the sanction of the Governor-in-Council), and supervising the officers, such as engineers or others employed in the work of making the contractors live up to their contracts and similar service of supervision, and reporting upon the progress and financial matters connected therewith to the Government of the day as it may require, it seems difficult to imagine how this statutory limitation in said section 306 could serve the commission or its members in relation to a fire caused by the negligence of some one over whom neither had control in relation thereto.\nThe letting of a contract could involve no such responsibility as in question herein.\nThe section 306 in question is as follows in its first two sub-sections relied upon:\u2014\n306. All actions or suits for indemnity for any damages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall (be commenced within one year next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, or, if there is continuation of damage, within one year next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards.\n2. In any such action or suit the defendants may plead the general issue, and may give this Act and the special Act and the special matter in evidence at the trial, and may prove that the said damages or injury alleged were done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act.\nHow can the Commissioners under their limited powers relative to construction ever fall within these provisions by means of any act they may have done as regards construction?\nThe second sub-section clearly indicates by its language that the thing had in view which is to be barred is something done \u201cin pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the special Act.\u201d\nStatutory limitations are personal and confined to the person or body acting and cannot as a matter of course be extended to some one else. Indeed they may be applicable in one forum yet not in another in such peculiar cases as The Metropolitan Water Board v. Bunn[9].\nThe matter seems so clear I need not pursue it. The commission has in certain cases been enabled when the Government should see fit to operate the road or part of it, and then the second part of subsection 1 of section 306 might become in such cases operative and applicable. The difficulty in this case seems to have arisen from the statement of claim being partly founded on section 298 relative to fires from locomotives.\nThe appellant in that regard, I think, misconceived his right of action. If it had rested on section 298 alone it ought to have been dismissed, for the obvious purpose of this section was to provide for the cases of operating a railway. It was first enacted in 1903 after the decision of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[10], as a mode of solving a well known grievance. It never was intended to apply to contractors for mere construction work.\nI think the possibility of applying this statutory provision to the facts here is much more remote than it was to the facts respectively presented in the cases of Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[11]; and Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[12]. In the latter case leave to appeal was refused by the Privy Council. The former presented a case of operation, it was claimed. The latter it was suggested fell under construction.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The only point requiring specific mention, in my judgment, is whether the first sub-section of section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d applies.\nI think that by force of section 15 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d that enactment is pleadable by the respondents in defence to this action.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appeal in this case is taken upon three grounds, two of which involve the construction of section 306 of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 37. For the appellant it is contended (a) that section 306 does not apply to actions for damages for injuries such as that which is the subject of this action; (b) that it does not apply to the National Transcontinental Railway; (c) that, if applicable to that railway, it protects only the Commissioners and not contractors for construction under them.\nThe plaintiff sues to recover damages for injuries caused to his timber limits by fire which originated from sparks emitted from a locomotive in use by the defendants in the course of constructing a section of the Transcontinental Railway. The defendant contractors were employed by the Transcontinental Railway Commissioners, but contracted with the Government of Canada for the construction of a portion of the railway.\nThe jury found, and the present appeal proceeded on the basis, that the locomotive was defectively equipped and that the sparks that caused the fire which injured the plaintiff\u2019s premises were emitted owing to such defective equipment.\n(a) Assuming that section 306 applies to the National Transcontinental Railway and that the defendants are entitled to the benefit of it, I think the injury sued for was \u201csustained by reason of the construction of the railway.\u201d I am of the opinion that, applying the principles which underlie the decisions in such cases as Poulsum v. Thirst[13] and Newton v. Ellis[14], injury caused by negligence in carrying out the work of construction is within the purview of the section. \u201cThere was no evidence of a want of bona fides, that is to say, of any indirect motive for the defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d Their work was being done under the powers conferred by the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d \u201cThe action is brought for an improper mode of performing the work\u201d \u2014 for \u201cdoing unlawfully what might be done lawfully.\u201d\n(b) By section 15 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act\u201d (3 Edw. VII. ch. 71), it is provided that,\nthe \u201cRailway Act\u201d and amendments thereto * * * in so far as they are applicable to the said (National Transcontinental) railway and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of this Act shall be taken and held to be incorporated in this Act. I find nothing in sub-section 1 of section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d \u201cinconsistent with or contrary to\u201d any of the provisions of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d I, therefore, think that by virtue of section 15 of the latter statute, section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d so far as applicable, is incorporated in the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act.\u201d\n(c) The remaining question has occasioned me rather more difficulty. Upon an examination of section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d a feature of it which immediately strikes one is that sub-sections 1 and 2 are general in their terms, while sub-sections 3 and 4 are restricted in their application to railway companies themselves. This difference in language indicates an intention on the part of Parliament that the application of the two earlier sub-sections should not be confined to actions in which the railway company itself is defendant. We are asked by counsel for the appellant to read into sub-section 1 after the word \u201csuits,\u201d the words \u201cagainst the company.\u201d I see no justification for doing so. On the contrary, I think that to insert these words would be to place upon the operation of sub-section 1 a restriction which Parliament obviously did not intend. When the purpose was to confine the application of certain provisions of the Act to railway companies, Parliament has expressed its intention to do so by using the word \u201ccompany.\u201d The reason for giving to railway companies the benefit of such protection as sub-sections 1 and 2 of section 306 afford applies with equal force to the case of contractors engaged in railway construction authorized by Parliament. We cannot ignore the fact that probably nine-tenths of the entire railway construction work of Canada is done not by railway companies themselves, but by independent contractors to whom it has been let. If sub-sections 1 and 2 of section 306 apply only where a railway company itself undertakes the work of construction the great bulk of railway construction work in this country would not come within them. That contractors constructing a railway under contract from a railway company were entitled to the benefit of the similar provision in the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d was held by a strong Divisional Court (Armour C.J., Falconbridge J. and Street J.) in Hendrie v. Onderdonk[15]. I have seen a copy of the judgment delivered in that case by Street J., and while the applicability of the limitation provision to the contractors, who were there defendants, appears rather to have been taken for granted, it is scarcely conceivable that the question now under consideration escaped the notice of these distinguished judges.\nHaving regard to the provisions of section 16 of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d which oblige the National Transcontinental Railway Commissioners to \u201clet the work of constructing the Eastern division by tender and contract,\u201d contractors under that Commission certainly do not occupy in regard to section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d a less favourable position than that of contractors under companies constructing railways under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The principle underlying the decision in Michigan Central Railroad Co. v. Wealleans[16], may be applied in this case.\nThe constitutionality of section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d was not questioned in the pleadings, or factums, or at bar. For the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that the defendants are entitled to the benefit of the limitation conferred by section 306 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nIt follows that this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J. agreed with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The car was still in motion when other passengers in the same seat, apparently in a panic, cried to S. to get off, and when he did not do so, endeavoured to get past him whereby he was pushed off and injured. In an action for damages it appeared that the explosion was caused by a defective controller and that the motorman at once cut off the current but did not apply the brakes, and the jury found the company negligent in using a rebuilt controller in a defective condition and not properly inspected, and the motorman negligent in not applying the brakes.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont. L.R. 332), that the evidence justified the jury in finding that the controller had not been properly inspected and that a proper inspection might have avoided the accident.\nHeld, per Idington and Brodeur JJ., Anglin and Davies JJ. contra, that the motorman was guilty of negligence in not applying the brakes.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] maintaining the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellants.\nGamble K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The case is not free from doubt, but on the whole I am of opinion that we should not interfere.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the opinion stated by Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent has recovered a verdict and judgment for damages suffered in consequence of being pushed off an open street railway car by passengers whom a panic had seized on the occasion of an electric explosion therein and its results. It is claimed all this was consequent on the negligence of appellants.\nThe panic and its consequences so far as we are concerned was, I think, the natural result of the explosion and its results, and hence if appellants are liable at all, the damages are not too remote.\nThe jury found, amongst other things, as follows:\nQ. 2. If they were, of what negligence were they guilty. (If there are in your opinion more than one act of negligence, state them all fully.) A. For using a rebuilt controller in a defective condition, and not being properly inspected.\nThe explosion and fire creating all the excitement and confusion in question were the result of a short circuit caused by some defect in the electric controller or wires connected therewith, in use in said car. The controller was not a year old. It was of an approved kind. It had been a couple of months before this accident overhauled so that it might be correctly described as rebuilt according to its pattern. It was in daily use thereafter till the accident and supposed to be inspected daily.\nMr. McCrae, the master mechanic of appellants, who has supervision of the maintenance and inspection of the company\u2019s cars, says he never knew of so serious an explosion and loss of control of the electric current as happened on the occasion in question.\nHe was called by respondent and suggests one possible cause of the accident.\nMr. Richmond, an electrical engineer, also examined as an expert on behalf of the respondent suggests another possible cause thereof. Both agree it was the result of a short circuit produced by some defect.\nEither man may unconsciously be biased by his peculiar views as to the exact cause of the accident.\nNo intelligent person experienced in such tasks as involved in considering evidence, can read their evidence without feeling that both are absolutely honest in all they say in regard to the conclusions they have reached. Their mode of thought or point of view may account for the divergent results of their evidence.\nIn either result it seems to me we are forced to the conclusion that there is evidence presented by them both that rendered it impossible for the learned trial judge to withdraw the case from the jury.\nThe broad facts appear that the accident was the result of some defect in the controller or wires connected therewith, and that there was no external cause, suddenly supervening, such as an electric storm or collision, for examples, to account for such defect, or abnormal results.\nIt seems to me the whole matter is reduced to one of whether or not due and proper inspection the night before should not, if had, have averted the accident.\nIt is almost incredible that if such due care had been used, as ought to have been, in the inspection, that either of the only possible causes suggested could have existed without detection by the inspector.\nIt is not difficult to see how in his routine way of discharging his duties, the inspector may have failed to observe the defect on its first appearance. But the question of whether or not he, or his employers, could be reasonably excused therefor or not, is one for the jury.\nIt seems to me that a trial judge presuming to decide that question would clearly be going beyond his duty. Indeed, to hold that on such facts there could only be that conjecture which alone would justify a nonsuit, would in every case free the negligent and the careful inspector alike and his employers, from responsibility in every case of the kind where a doubt may exist as to exactly what might have been discovered.\nIt seems clear that eighteen years\u2019 experience of a capable, vigilant man, in so wide a field of experience having brought to the court and jury the results thereof that his story demonstrates due care can avert such results as produced on this occasion.\nIn the finding I quote there is an apparent resting upon the fact of the rebuilding of the controller. That seems to me only apparently so, for it is the non-inspection of such a rebuilt controller that is charged.\nNo doubt greater care is perhaps due in case of an old or rebuilt controller than in the case of one quite new, but the reason given does not affect the finding of negligence.\nI cannot agree with the Court of Appeal that a motorman able to turn round and go back to warn passengers is excused by reason of shock from applying the brake.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014I think there was evidence from which the jury, if they accepted it, might conclude that a short circuit, such as that to which the accident seems to be attributable, would not ordinarily occur if the controller were properly constructed and properly inspected.\nIf the jury took this view it was for them to say whether the company had acquitted itself of the onus which rested upon it to shew that in these respects proper care and skill had been exercised.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This action is brought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff as the result of his being thrown from a moving car in a panic caused by an explosion and fire resulting from a short circuit in the controller of the car. The controller, originally purchased from the Canadian General Electric Company, was admittedly of an approved type. It had been overhauled or rebuilt by the defendant company, according to their ordinary custom, about two months before the plaintiff was injured and had been in regular use during that period. The accident resulted in such a complete destruction of the wires and parts of the controller that it was not possible afterwards from inspection of them to determine its precise cause. The evidence clearly establishes, however\u2014it was in fact admitted\u2014that the short circuit could not have happened unless there had been a defect in the controller. The plaintiff charges that this defect was due to negligence in the rebuilding of the motor by the defendant company, or, if not, that it was of such a character that proper inspection would have discovered it. He also charges that the defendants\u2019 motorman was negligent in not applying the brake of his car so as to stop it immediately after the explosion.\nThe first trial of the action took place before Middleton J. It resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,200. That verdict was set aside by the Court of Appeal and a new trial ordered[2], on the ground that certain evidence tendered by the defendants had been improperly rejected.\nAt the second trial before Sir William Meredith C.J.C.P., the jury again found for the plaintiff. The damages were assessed at $1,100. The negligence attributed to the defendants consisted in their\nusing a rebuilt controller in a defective condition and not being properly inspected.\nThe motorman was also found to have been negligent \u201cin not applying his brake.\u201d The Court of Appeal upheld this verdict and from its judgment the present appeal is taken.\nCounsel for the defendants contended that there was no evidence upon which any finding of negligence against his clients could properly be based; and he further argued that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff were not the direct or proximate result of the explosion or fire, but were caused by an independent and voluntary act of two passengers who deliberately pushed him from the car.\nWhile the evidence may be susceptible of the view that the plaintiff was thus pushed from the car, it is quite open also to the construction that the two passengers were impelled by fear of injury to themselves to escape from the car and that in the course of doing so, owing to the narrowness of the space between the seats, they necessarily pushed against the plaintiff, who was sitting at the outside of the seat, and involuntarily caused him to fall from the car. I find no allusion in the charge of the learned Chief Justice to this contention on behalf of the defendants and it is not referred to either in their reasons for appeal to the Court of Appeal or in the reasons for judgment given by that court. Counsel for the plaintiff stated at bar that it was presented by the defendants for the first time in this court, and his statement was not controverted. Under these circumstances it would not, in my opinion, be proper to give effect to this defence even if the evidence sufficiently established it, which I do not think it does.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Garrow that if the verdict for the plaintiff depended on the finding of the motorman\u2019s negligence the evidence would not support it. It is very questionable whether owing to the fire which immediately resulted from the explosion it was possible for the motorman to apply his brake. The only evidence on this point is his own and it indicates that he could not have done so. In the exercise of his judgment in the emergency he appears to have considered that the most important thing to do promptly was to cut off the current from the car. He immediately shut off the controller with one hand and tried to reach the hood\u2011switch at the top of the vestibule with the other, but was prevented from doing so by the fire. He then leaned out of the vestibule and called to the conductor to pull the trolley pole off the wire, simultaneously shouting to the passengers not to attempt to get off the car. Having regard to all the circumstances I think the evidence does not support a finding of negligence on the part of the motorman. He appears to have done all that he could or, at all events, what he thought best in the emergency to prevent injury either to the passengers or to the property of his employers.\nThere was, however, in my opinion, evidence from which the jury might reasonably infer that an efficient inspection of the controller would have revealed the defect which caused the short circuit. They may, for the reasons which he gave, have not improperly accepted the view of the witness Richmond as to the place where the short circuit occurred and as the probable cause of it. Unless it should be held that where an accident results in the destruction of the physical evidence of its cause an injured person cannot recover\u2014a position which the Judicial Committee has decided to be not maintainable (McArthur v. The Dominion Cartridge Co.[3])\u2014a jury must be allowed to act upon evidence such as that which was put before them by the plaintiff in the present case. The defendants attempted to meet that evidence by shewing that they had a regular and adequate system of inspection of controllers and that the controller in question had been inspected on the 2nd of August, and again on the 7th of August. The accident happened on the 10th of August. Of neither inspection was the evidence offered entirely satisfactory. There certainly was room for the contention made on behalf of the plaintiff that the report of the inspection of the 2nd of August indicated that the controllers had not then been inspected. The evidence of the inspection of the 7th of August was still more unsatisfactory in that the man who made it was not called as a witness and the foreman, who was called, was unable to speak from personal knowledge as to its thoroughness or extent. I doubt whether the report of the inspection which was put in was admissible in evidence. But, if it was, the jury may not improperly have reached the conclusion that the plaintiff had sufficiently established that the defect was one which proper inspection would have disclosed and that the defendants had failed to satisfactorily establish that there had been such inspection.\nThis suffices to dispose of the case and renders it unnecessary to consider the other finding of the jury that the defendants were negligent in using a rebuilt controller in a defective condition. In regard to that finding I desire merely to remark that if by it the jury meant that the existence of the defect in the controller was due to negligence in rebuilding it, I am not satisfied that the evidence would support such a finding.\nIn the result the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The jury in stating that the company defendant was guilty of negligence by using a rebuilt controller in a defective condition and by not inspecting it properly, have returned a verdict that could be reasonably found on the evidence.\nIt seems to me that if the equipment had been minutely inspected the defect would have been detected and the injury would have been avoided. Besides, when the short circuit occurred and the fire started the motorman should have applied the brakes and stopped the car in order that the passengers could get off without fear and without accident.\nIn the circumstances of the case the principle laid down in Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co.[4] should apply. The car was under the management of the defendants and their servants and the acci- dent is such as in the ordinary course of things would not have happened if those who had the management used proper care. It affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.\nThe onus probandi that fell upon the appellants has not been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the jury and a verdict of negligence has been given.\nIt is claimed by the appellants that the shoving of the plaintiff off the car by the other passengers was not the natural and direct outcome of the explosion, because the passengers took hold of the respondent and pushed him off.\nIt is pretty evident that the passengers who pushed off the respondent were panic-stricken on account of the explosion and in trying to get off the car to reach the street and save their lives, they removed the respondent from his seat and he fell on the street.\nA similar case came before the Supreme Court in Illinois, and it was held as follows:\u2014\nWhere the passengers in a street car when an explosion occurred in the controller rushed to rear door in a panic, and the plaintiff being one of them was pushed and thrown from the car and injured, there was prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence on the part of the railway company under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed.

P. signed the way-bill in the form approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, which contained a clause providing that if the consignee or his nominee should be allowed to travel at less than the regular fare to take care of the property the company should not be liable for any injury to him whether caused by negligence or otherwise. R. was not asked to sign the way-bill though a form indorsed provided for his signature and required the agent to obtain it. The way-bill was given to R., who placed it in his pocket without examining it. On the passage he was injured by negligence of the company\u2019s servants.\nHeld, that R. was not aware that the way-bill contained conditions.\nHeld, also, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that the company had not done all that was incumbent on them to bring notice of the special condition to his attention.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont.

The material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nMcKay K.C. and Haight for the appellant. The appellant could not become a party to this special contract without his assent, obtained expressly or by reasonable implication. It was not so obtained and the case is within the principle of Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[3], approved in Richardson v. Rowntree[4], and Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[5] See also Stephen v. International Sleeping Car Co.[6]; Hooper v. Furness Railway Co.[7]; Marriott v. Yeoward Bros.[8]; Ryckman v. Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Railway Co.[9]\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondents. If appellant was lawfully on the train he could only be so by the contract with the company.\nThe company may limit its liability for injury to a passenger through negligence. Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[10]; Burke v. South Eastern Railway Co.[11] The appellant\u2019s assent to the limitation by the contract is clearly implied.\nThe fact that he did not read the conditions did not free him from their effect. Harris v. Great Western Railway Co.[12]; Coombs v. The Queen[13]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am very clearly of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The appellant was travelling on a freight train where he had no right to be except under the special agreement made with respect to the carriage of the horse of which he was presumably in charge. That special agreement contained a limitation of the company\u2019s liability in case of accident, and I agree with the judges below who found that the company did everything that was reasonably sufficient to draw the appellant\u2019s attention to that limitation.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The judgments below proceeded upon the assumption that the plaintiff must either have been travelling under the contract made between the owner of the horse and the railway company and that he was bound by such contract, or that he was a trespasser to whom the company owed no duty.\nI think his position was not, under the circumstances of this case, one or the other. I do not think he was travelling under and by virtue of a contract, which was made between his master and the company without any knowledge on his part of its conditions which he was not asked to sign or agree to, and which contained special clauses relating to him as man in charge of the horse not called to his attention, and of which he had no knowledge. One of these special clauses printed in the body of the contract declared the company.\nto be free from liability in respect of his death, injury or damage; and whether it be caused by the negligence of the company or its servants or employees or otherwise howsoever.\nIt was headed \u201cGrand Trunk Railway System\u201d\u2014\u201cLive Stock Special Contract.\u201d On the margin was written \u201cPass man in charge half-fare.\u201d The plaintiff was the man in charge of the horse to be carried by the contract. A special notice on the back required the company\u2019s agents to see that such man wrote his own name on the back of the contract. This may have been for the purposes of identification merely; but the evidence is clear that the plaintiff had not his attention called in any way to this clause by which the company attempted to contract themselves out of any liability for damages caused by their own or their servants\u2019 negligence.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s position on the car was certainly not that of a trespasser, but rather that of a licensee. The contract was not made with him or by him, and he cannot be held bound by provisions of such a startling character as the contractual exemption relied upon here unless his assent had been first obtained by his special attention being directed to the clause affecting him and his acceptance of it either expressly or impliedly.\nThere was nothing when this \u201cLive Stock Special Contract\u201d was handed to him to lead him to believe that it contained any such special exemption of liability with respect to his carriage as the one I have cited.\nIf the plaintiff had been told the substance of this condition respecting his carriage as man in charge, or had he read the condition and in either case had not objected, but had accepted his passage with such knowledge, he would probably have been held to have assented to the terms of the condition and been bound by it. But there not being, in my opinion, any obli- gation on him to read this \u201cLive Stock Special Contract,\u201d and he not having, as a fact, read it, or been invited to do so, or had his attention called to the condition with respect to himself, I cannot think he was bound by it.\nThe cases cited of Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[14], and in the Court of Appeal[15], and Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[16], amply support the conclusion that in a case like the present one, the company has not the right, under such circumstances as are here proved, to invoke a contractual exemption from liability arising out of their own or their servants\u2019 negligence, as this contract contains.\nThey fail because the plaintiff, the man in charge of the horse, had no knowledge of the condition they seek to invoke against him and because their servants neglected to do what was reasonably sufficient to bring such notice to his knowledge or attention.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant was sent by Dr. McCombe from South River to bring him from Milverton a horse purchased there by a friend, Dr. Parker, to be shipped by him from Milverton to South River.\nThe respondents required as a term of receiving such a shipment for a distance greater than a hundred miles, that the animal shipped should be accompanied by a man in charge of it. Hence the necessity for Dr. McCombe sending appellant to Milverton to take charge of the horse and travel on same train as it did.\nDr. Parker signed a contract of shipment as required by respondents\u2019 agent in a form which had the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners. He paid nothing. The charges were to be paid by Dr. McCombe. The form of contract signed by Dr. Parker expressly absolved the respondents from all liability in case of accident happening the man thus in charge of the horse.\nThe contract was not read by Dr. Parker, but he had the opportunity to have read it if he chose.\nThe respondents\u2019 agent was present when it was signed, but nothing was said by any one as to its terms. Dr. Parker had suggested mailing it to Dr. McCombe, but the company\u2019s agent said no, let the man take it as he might need it for identification by the conductor. Dr. Parker accordingly folded it up and handed it to appellant, who put it in his pocket without reading it and never knew what it contained until a week or so after the accident in question.\nDr. McCombe on getting it then from respondents paid the charges, which consisted of freight for the horse and half-fare for the appellant\u2019s transportation.\nThere was, as result of respondents\u2019 negligence, a collision between another train and the train on which the appellant travelled with the horse, whereby the appellant suffered serious damages for which respondents would admittedly be liable even if carrying gratuitously unless prohibited by the terms of the contract I have referred to.\nThere was indorsed on the back of the contract a memorandum which was as follows:\u2014 GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY SYSTEM.\nLIVE STOCK.\nTRANSPORTATION CONTRACT.\nFrom............................................................................\nTo.................................................................................\nDate.................................................................... 19 .\nShipper.......................................................................\nNames of persons entitled to a free pass or reduced fare in charge of this consignment\u2014\nAgent.\nNOTE.\u2014Agents must require those entitled to free passage or reduced fare in charge of Live Stock under this contract to write their own names on the lines above.\nConductors may, in cases where they have reason to believe contracts have been transferred, require the holders to write their names hereon to compare signatures.\nThis contract must be punched by Conductors of each Division.\nThis was never filled up or signed by any one.\nThe question raised is whether or not a man occupying the position of the appellant put in charge of the said horse and travelling as its caretaker, is without being made expressly aware of the terms of the contract his employer had entered into, debarred by virtue thereof from all right of recovery for injury suffered by \u201creason of the negligence of the company\u2019s servants or otherwise howsoever,\u201d as the terms of exemption I have referred to put it.\nIn regard to this question there is some similarity between this case and the case of Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[17] There the signature of the passenger was got toy telling her such signing was necessary for identification. Here no signature or assent of any kind was required, but incidentally to handing appellant the contract instead of mailing it as proposed by Dr. Parker, it was stated in appellant\u2019s presence that he might need it for identification. And as it turned out he never needed it for such purpose.\nIt seems to me the appellant, who was not asked to sign anything, but thus thrown off his guard, has quite as much ground to be excused as the plaintiff in that case who was induced to sign what she could not read by reason of sore or defective eyes, but did sign, though she might have insisted on the paper being read to her.\nThen we have the cases of Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[18], following Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[19], and Henderson v. Stevenson[20], which in principle seem to cover the whole ground involved in the dispute herein by requiring knowledge on the part of those concerned of the conditions pleaded and relied upon. The appellant was invited to trust himself to the care of respondent in discharge of its duty to carry appellant safely, and it pleads something his master, but not he, agreed to.\nIt seems rather a startling proposition of law that an employer can of his own mere will and motion so contract that his servant shall be treated as of less value than a horse or dog shipped as freight. It seems to me to come to that if we are to uphold the judgment appealed from, for there is no fair ground on the facts to impute to appellant an assent to something he knew nothing of.\nIf appellant had by his occupation been shewn to be accustomed to undertake such services, there might have been some basis for inferring assent to a some thing he in fact knew nothing of, but ought to have known.\nIf the principle of identification is to be carried so far, where would it not extend if applied in other relations of contractors with those for whom they undertake something to be done and on behalf of those in their employment presume, without their knowledge or assent, to bind them to assume all risks?\nAll the appellant was concerned with was that he was to be carried safely and for aught he knew gratuitously if you will.\nAll he knew was that the railway company needed him to go.\nIs there anybody else than railway managers and lawyers who can be conceived of as presuming that a man so sent for and invited by the company to ride upon its car in order to serve its purposes of protecting itself must know that he has agreed without recourse to be killed by the negligence of their servants \u201cor otherwise howsoever.\u201d Not only is that to be presumed as part of common knowledge, but also that the horse had to be paid for in such case, but not the man. Indeed, also he is supposed to know that the Railway Commissioners of Canada were such a set of humorists as to have approved thereof.\nThe learned trial judge by what transpired at the trial must be taken to have \u2018reserved to himself to dispose of what was not submitted to the jury and he seems to have had no doubt in regard to essential facts which they were not asked in regard to and did not pass upon.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored. DUFF J.\u2014The defendant was de facto accepted as a passenger on their train by the railway company which thereby prim\u00e2 facie incurred an obligation to use reasonable care to carry him with safety. The company says that this prim\u00e2 facie obligation was limited by the condition in the shipping bill. I do not understand that it was contended on behalf of the company that Dr. Parker, who signed the shipping bill on behalf of the consignee, had authority to bind the appellant by entering into an agreement on his behalf limiting this obligation. I am not required by law to hold that he had such authority and there is no evidence justifying a finding that the appellant had made him (or held him out as,) his agent in fact for that purpose. The evidence, moreover, is clear that the condition referred to was not actually brought home to the knowledge of Dr. Parker or of the appellant. In these circumstances the contention of the company is and must be that the company\u2019s agent took reasonable steps to notify the appellant that they were accepting him as a passenger on the special terms contained in the shipping bill and that the appellant\u2019s conduct in not perusing the bill shewed that he was content to accept the conditions without reading them; and that he must, consequently, in law be held to be bound by it. I think this contention must be rejected. The gist of it is that a normal person in the situation of the appellant would have read the bill unless he was content to abide by any reasonable conditions it might contain. I am not obliged \u2018by any rule of law to say that that is so. Treating the question as a matter of fact I think it is not so. I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. ANGLIN J.\u2014I am unable to discover any distinction in principle between this case and such cases as Richardson, Spence & Co. v. Rowntree[21]; Henderson v. Stevenson[22]; Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[23]; and Bate v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[24] Upon evidence warranting such a finding the trial judge held that the plaintiff was unaware of the special conditions contained in the shipping contract under which the defendants claim exemption from liability to him for personal injuries, and, if not expressly, I think impliedly, that neither the circumstances under which he received the contract nor what was done by the defendants\u2019 agent would suffice to convey to his mind (or \u201cto the minds of people in general\u201d) the fact that it contained special conditions affecting him or would justify imputing to him notice of them. The learned judge says that the plaintiff had \u201cneither notice nor knowledge\u201d of the special terms. By this I understand him to have meant that the plaintiff had not notice of any kind, actual or constructive. As put by Mellish L.J., in Parker v. South Eastern Railway Co.[25], at page 423:\u2014\nThe proper direction to leave to the jury in these cases is, that if the person receiving the ticket did not see or know that there was any writing on the ticket, he is not bound by the conditions; that if he knew (there was writing, and knew or believed that the writing contained conditions, then he is bound by the conditions; that if he knew there was writing on the ticket, but did not know or believe that the writing contained conditions, nevertheless he would be bound, if the delivering of the ticket to him in such a manner that he could see there was writing upon it, was, in the opinion of the jury, reasonable notice that the writing contained conditions.\nIt is this \u201creasonable notice\u201d that I understand the learned trial judge to negative in the present case by the word \u201cnotice,\u201d which he uses in contradistinction to the word \u201cknowledge\u201d by which he negatives actual notice.\nIf, however, the learned judge did not find that the defendants had failed to do what was necessary to bring the special conditions in the shipping contract to the attention of the plaintiff, treating him as a man of ordinary intelligence and acuteness, the Court of Appeal had power to make that finding (Ont. Jud. Act, sec. 53; Ont. C.R. No. 817), and upon my view of the evidence should have made it. Our statutory duty is to render the judgment which the Court of Appeal should have given.\nOn the single ground that the present case is governed by the authorities above cited, and without expressing any opinion upon the other interesting points taken by the appellant, I would, with respect, allow this appeal with costs in this court and the Ontario Court of Appeal, and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.L.

[1906] c. 37, s. 264, ss. 1(c).\nThe provisions of section 264, subsection 1(c) of The Railway Act which require every railway company \u201cto provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus\u201d for coupling and uncoupling cars without the necessity of going between them is contravened by the use of a foreign car not provided with such \u201cmodern and efficient apparatus\u201d in a train operated by a Canadian company, and the company using such car is responsible for any injury caused by the want of such equipment. A lever for opening and closing the knuckle of the coupler which is too short to be operated from the side ladder with safety is not \u201cmodern and efficient apparatus\u201d under the above provision.\nWhere a brakeman on a car approaching another with which it was to be coupled saw that the knuckle of the coupler of the car he was on had to be opened and had only fifteen seconds in which to do it, being unable to signal the engineer to stop, took the only course open to him, which was a common one, and was injured he was not guilty of contributory negligence.\nFitzpatrick C.J. dissented on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accident.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (26 Ont. L.R. 121) reversed, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] setting aside the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff and dismissing his action.\nThe material facts in relation to the matter which are not in dispute may be shortly stated as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff, a young man about 22 years of age, entered the employment of the defendants as brakesman in August, 1910, after being with the Canadian Express Company for five or six years and with the Grand Trunk Railway as brakesman. On the day of the accident, 18th March, 1911, he was engaged as brakesman on a freight train running between Toronto and Fraxa Junction, a short distance north of Orangeville, on the respondents\u2019 line and among the cars which made up this train was a foreign box or freight car belonging to the Wabash Railroad which was being returned empty to that company. This car was equipped with automatic couplers, it had the usual side ladders near the ends, but it had no ladders at either end. When the train arrived at Bolton Junction a car from near the centre of the train and attached to the Wabash car had to be uncoupled and left there. This was done and it was while the rest of the train was being coupled up again that the accident happened. The appellant went on the top of the Wabash car to signal the engineer and while there he noticed that the knuckle, i.e., a portion of the automatic coupler attached to the Wabash car, was closed. For the purpose of opening the knuckle and while the car was travelling at a speed of about 7 miles an hour, he went down the side ladder in order to get hold of the lever or coupling rod by which the knuckle was opened. According to his own testimony the appellant went to the bottom of the ladder. His left foot was resting on the step below the ladder and he was holding on with his left hand to the lowest rung of the ladder, there being a space of about only 20 inches between them. While his right foot was in the air, he tried to reach round the end of the car with his right hand and attempted to raise the lever or coupling rod. While he was in this cramped or doubled up position the car passed over a crossover between the two tracks, the jar caused his foot to slip from the bottom step and he fell with his right arm beneath the wheels. The arm was badly crushed and had to be amputated at the shoulder.\nThe allegations in the Statement of Claim were that the side ladder from which the plaintiff fell was improperly placed and was insecure, that the car was not equipped with end ladders as required by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and was not properly equipped with automatic couplers, in that the lever or coupling rod was too short, and to these defects the appellant attributes his accident.\nThe jury assessed the damages at $6,000 and the learned trial judge on their answers to questions submitted by him, entered judgment for that amount against the respondents, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the appellant\u2019s action dismissed on the ground that the accident was not caused by the short lever or want of end ladders, but was due to the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence.\nCreswicke K.C. and C.C. Robinson for the appellant. Sub-sections 1(c) and 5 of section 264 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d were passed for the protection of railway employees and should not be strictly construed if so doing would defeat that object. See Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co.[2], at page 18; Atcheson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3] Interpreting the words \u201cof the company\u201d in sub-section 5 as meaning \u201cowned by the company\u201d would defeat it.\nThe duty is imposed on the company of providing reasonably safe appliances for their employees. Ainslie Mining and Rway. Co. v. McDougall[4]; Marney v. Scott[5]; and the jury have found that such duty was not observed in this case.\nHellmuth K.C. and MacMurchy K.C. for the respondents referred to Barnes v. Nunnery Colliery Co.[6]; Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.[7]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I agree entirely with Mr. Justice Meredith. The appellant lost his balance and fell from the car after deliberately getting himself into an impossible position, and his own negligence in that regard was, in my opinion, the determining cause of the accident.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014In the final analysis of the evidence as to the facts and conditions under which the accident occurred, the question whether the appeal should be allowed seems to resolve itself into two, first, whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in his attempt to work the lever attached to the coupler of the Wabash car so as to enable the couplers to connect, and, secondly, whether the find- ings of the jury negative this contributory negligence on the one hand, and can be fairly construed as imputing negligence to the defendants which caused the accident, on the other.\nTo find the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence under the circumstances, it is not sufficient to find that he erred in judgment at the supreme moment when action was promptly required from him. He may have acted unwisely and imprudently in attempting to hang on to the ladder with one hand, clinging to the rung of the ladder immediately above the lower step on which one only of his feet was placed, and with crouching, bent body, reaching round the end of the car to get hold of and work the lever. The result places it beyond doubt that his judgment was faulty and his action dangerous. But I take it the question is not whether his judgment in the moment calling for instant action was prudent or otherwise, but whether it constituted gross carelessness.\nIt seems beyond reasonable doubt that if the lever had been long enough to reach the side of the car or nearly so, the method he adopted of going down the side ladder and operating the lever from it would have been quite safe. It was the shortness of the lever which compelled him to crouch and bend himself so as to give his arm a long reach and thus make up for the shortness of the lever. He had 15 seconds within which to stop the car. If the lever had been of the same length as those on the ordinary C.P.R. cars, it does not seem doubtful that he would have safely worked it. The extra reach to get hold of the short handle made his position perilous and the jar of the car in passing over the crossing of two tracks caused his foot to slip from the lower rung of the ladder and he fell with his arm under the car wheels. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence is that the lever was only about 16 inches long, bringing its length to about 2\u00bd feet from the side of the car. The defendants\u2019 witnesses, who inspected the car, but did not measure the lever, say it was about 2\u00bd feet long, which would bring its end to about 16 inches from the side of the car. No witness on either side suggested it came within 15 inches of the side of the car. The jury, in answer to questions 5 and 6, say the plaintiff was injured in consequence of defects in the make up of the car, and that the car lacked the ladder on the end and the long lever equipment used by the defendants on their cars. They do not find specifically the actual length of the lever, but they find its \u00abshortness, or want of normal length, was one of the defects which caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. I do not attach importance to the absence of the end ladder because under the circumstances with the rapidly approaching cars it seems obvious that it would have been dangerous and against good practice for him to have used an end ladder and so placed his body between the approaching cars.\nIt does seem to me that it was at least open to the jury to accept plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the length of this lever, and that at any rate they could find it was not the long lever equipment used on the Canadian Pacific Railway cars, and which doubtless experience had shewn was necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the statute.\nThey further find in answer to question 3, that as plaintiff had not received circular No. 4, he acted as he did to the best of his knowledge, and in answer to question 7, that he could not, under the circumstances, by the exercise of reasonable care, have provided for the coupling of the cars with safety to himself. It is true that they do not give any answer to the specific question No. 8, whether they found negligence as to the matters in dispute, (a) in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., or (b) in the plaintiff. But finding generally that the car and its fittings were not reasonably safe in the respects they mention for the employees in the usual operations of the road; that the plaintiff acted, not having received circular No. 4, to the best of his knowledge; that he was injured in consequence of defects in the make up of the car, and that what they found to be wrong was the absence of end ladder and \u201cthe long lever equipment used by the Canadian Pacific Railway,\u201d and that plaintiff could not, by the exercise of reasonable care, have provided for the coupling of the ears with safety to himself; they may have concluded that further specification of negligence in either party was unnecessary, and would only involve repetition of their previous answers.\nIt seems to me that these findings, read in connection with the charge of the Chancellor, negative contributory negligence of the plaintiff on the one hand, and find negligence in the defendants which caused the accident on the other.\nI may remark that the alternative course which was open to the plaintiff when he discovered that the knuckle of the coupler of the Wabash car was closed, was, from his place on the top of the car, to signal the engineer to stop the train. He says he did not do so because the engineer was not looking. The engineer was not examined, and there is no conflict of evidence on that point. The course he took in going down the side ladder and attempting to operate the lever from it was a perfectly safe one had the lever been the ordin- ary length of those in use on the Canadian Pacific Railway cars, that is, a length which would enable the brakesman to operate it without being under the necessity of placing at least a part of his body between the cars.\nThe statutory requirement as to trains is found in section 264 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which reads:\u2014\nEvery company shall provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means:\u2014\n* * * * *\n(c) to securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train, with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars.\nThis sub-section evidently requires such apparatus and appliances as will enable the couplers to be efficiently operated without the necessity of men going between the cars.\nIt was argued that this lever of the Wabash car was sufficiently long to enable such purpose to be accomplished when the cars were not moving, in other words, that the brakesman could have opened the knuckle of the coupler which was closed, and so enabled the cars automatically to be coupled without going between the ends of the cars, and that no doubt is so. But the question comes back to the one I started with: Was the plaintiff, when he found he could not convey to the engineer a signal to stop the train because that officer was not looking, guilty of gross negligence or \u201cinviting disaster,\u201d as one of the judges in the Court of Appeal pointedly puts it, by attempting to reach the lever in the manner and at the time and under the circumstances he did? Was he guilty of gross negligence in his attempt or only of an error of judgment at a moment requiring prompt and instant decision and action?\nThe answers of the jury taken as a whole placed the blame for the accident on the inefficiency of the lever on account of its shortness, and must be taken to have absolved the plaintiff from contributory negligence.\nI have not reached my conclusions without much doubt, founded in part on the absence of specific answers to question 8, and in part on the reasonings of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal which were ably supported at bar. But I feel myself bound by the construction I place upon the findings of the jury as I interpret them, and upon the conclusion I have reached that sub-section (c), of section 264, is applicable to the Wabash car which formed part of the defendants\u2019 train and which was found inefficiently equipped in not having the long lever equipment used by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. on its own cars.\nI, therefore, concur in allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment of the trial court, with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant was a brakesman on one of the respondents\u2019 trains engaged in shunting cars at one of their stations. He was on top of a self-coupling car being moved backward to be connected with another car standing on the track. He descended the side ladder of the car on which he was, in order to reach the lever by which the knuckle might be opened or pin raised of the coupler or part thereof attached to his car so as to prepare it to receive and connect with the part of the coupler on the other car towards which his train was moving at a rate of about seven miles an hour.\nHe put his left foot in the step which projected below the bottom of the car, seized a rung of the ladder with his left hand and attempted with his right hand to reach the lever which was unusually short, but failed to reach it, and whilst in this attitude the car crossed a part of the crossing of the tracks which gave a jolt or jar and he fell and then his arm was run over. The arm had to be amputated near the shoulder. This action was brought for the resultant damages. It was tried before the Chancellor, who refused to nonsuit and submitted to the jury a number of questions; and upon their answers thereto he entered judgment for appellant.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the action. Some difficulty is experienced in trying to harmonize the several reasons assigned therefor, and I shall not attempt to analyze same. Broadly speaking they may, I think, be properly described as attributing the accident to the alleged unjustifiable conduct of appellant in attempting to do what he did.\nIncidentally to the determination thus reached the interpretation and construction of sections 264 and 317 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d are dealt with in such a way as to render it more easy to reach a conclusion that the appellant is solely blameworthy for the accident. It is important for that reason to settle, if possible, the questions thus raised.\nUnder the caption in said Act of \u201cOperation\u2014Equipment and Appliances for Cars and Locomotives,\u201d appears, first, section 264, intended to be chief part of an efficient code for the purposes indicated.\nThis section enacts:\u2014\n264. Every company shall provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means:\u2014\n* * * * * (c) to securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train, with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the\u2019 ends of the cars.\nAnd then, after sub-sections 2, 3, and 4, follows sub-section 5, as follows:\u2014\n5. All box freight cars of the company shall, for the security of railway employees, be equipped with:\u2014\n(a) outside ladders, on two of the diagonally opposite ends and sides of each car, projecting below the frame of the car, with one step or rung of each ladder below the frame, the ladders \u2018being placed close to the ends and sides to which they are attached; and\n(b) hand grips placed anglewise over the ladders of each box car and so arranged as to assist persons in climbing on the roof by means of the ladders;\nProvided that, if there is at any time any other improved side attachment which, in the opinion of the Board, is better calculated to promote the safety of the train hands, the Board may require any of such cars not already fitted with the side attachments toy this section required, to be fitted with the said improved attachment.\nSub-section 6 enables the Board to deal with drawbars, and sub-section 7 provides as follows:\u2014\n7. The Board may upon good cause shewn, by general regulation, or in any particular case, from time to time, grant delay for complying with the provisions of this section.\nIt is attempted to distinguish the effect of subsection 5 from the rest of the section by reason of the use of the expression therein \u201cof the company.\u201d It is pointed out that the word \u201ctrains\u201d is used in some of the earlier sub-sections and that, therefore, this expression \u201cof the company\u201d must mean something else, though the entire sub-section is, as if to emphasize the very contrary, being enacted expressly \u201cfor the security of railway employees.\u201d\nI can hardly appreciate how \u201cthe security of railway employees\u201d is to be obtained in relation to cars that do not form part of a train and that in motion. When cars stand still there would not seem to be much need for securing employees or any one else against their defects.\nIt does not appear in the reasons given exactly how such security is to be attained anywhere else than where the cars are in motion and forming part of a train. It is said, however, that cars are exchanged with foreign roads which may not be so equipped, and we are referred to section 317 providing for a foreign traffic.\nThere is not a word therein or elsewhere in the Act shewing any discrimination is to be made between such foreign and the domestic cars in relation to the security of the employees in this regard. Indeed, section 317 is entirely devoted to another object and purpose.\nThe sub-section 7, of section 264, may or may not enable such discrimination, but if it does not there is none possible. And there is no pretence made that the said power has ever been exercised in the premises. There is no possibility of pretending that by section 317 or otherwise than by said sub-section 7 has the Board or any one else authority to suspend in favour of such foreign cars or use thereof, the provisions of this statute for the security of the employees.\nThe more the extent of the use of foreign cars is magnified, as it is impliedly in the argument put forward, the less justification is there for importing such an invasion of this security the statute was designed to provide.\nIf exception had been attempted in the case of other Canadian railways whose cars had failed to obey the statute, then it might have been argued with a degree of plausibility that the penalties of the Act imposed by section 386 must be held to be the only mode of relief, inasmuch as interchange of cars and traffic are made obligatory. I do not think that would be tenable, and no one has been bold enough to so argue.\nBut why exemption should be made in favour of foreign cars of which the owners could not be subjected to such penalties, is something I cannot understand if employees are needing and are to get protection.\nThe distinction, I respectively submit, is quite unwarranted. When one reflects upon the rapidity of judgment needed to be exercised by these employees in a variety of ways their situation so often calls for in discharge of their duties, it is not to be supposed in face of such legislation that it was ever intended that judgment was to be needlessly confused by considerations of the different rules to be applied to the nationality or kind of cars in relation to which it has to be exercised.\nI think the statute applies and must be held to apply to all cars in all trains, including such combinations of locomotives and cars as the statute constitutes a train in a yard or elsewhere.\nNow, what did this statute require, which, according to the interpretation I have given it, related to the cars and train in question?\nIt required modern appliances and these must, it is conceded, be progressively so modern as to keep pace with modern invention and known utility.\nThis Wabash car in question herein had the semblance of an automatic coupler, but it failed so lamentably in placing the lever which was to open or close it that it did not come up to the standard which the respondent and others had adopted before this accident. On any view one may take of the matter the antiquated appearance of the appliances on this Wabash car as compared with those in use by their own company, before the eyes of the inspectors of respondent, ought to have arrested their attention.\nInstead of their inspection being, as the reasons assigned by the Court of Appeal suggest, a means of shielding the respondent, the neglect of these inspectors and of those who permitted them to act, on their own responsibility in such matter, instead of directing their attention to the statute and its requirements furnishes the condemnation of the respondent in this regard so far as it bears on the issues raised herein.\nThen it is said that the provision of the section relative to the coupling or uncoupling of cars had only a bearing upon an operation to take place by the hands of some employee standing upon the ground, and not on the car or a ladder or platform of any kind attached to a car.\nNo one has been able to say so as a witness. Some of them seemed adroit in way of answering carefully framed questions to indicate that in certain emergencies this or that mode of doing something in relation to such a proceeding as coupling or uncoupling of cars, might be bad practice. But no one pretends that the raising of the lever in itself by a man standing on a ladder of a moving car, would in every case and of itself be bad practice.\nThese couplers may, it seems, so get out of order or be so misplaced as to require adjustment, and that the employees are warned against (though this man was not) doing when the cars are in motion.\nBut what the appellant attempted is nothing of that kind. It might be that the coupler in question needed such adjustment, but no one pretends such ever was discovered to be the fact. If it had been, no doubt, it would have been proven herein as giving some semblance of excuse or means of blaming the appellant.\nHaving read the entire evidence in the case I agree with the following extract from the judgment of Mr. Justice Magee in the Court of Appeal:\u2014\nIt is, I think, clear from the evidence, that it was customary for brakesmen to operate the levers from the ladders while the cars were moving. It had been done only a, few moments before by the other brakesman opening the coupler of the adjoining car to make a flying shunt. The conductor says it was quite customary, and he would not think of reporting a brakesman for doing it, and had never told any one not to do it. The general yard-master, called for the defendants, states that the lever can be operated from the side-ladder.\nIt is sought to draw a distinction between operating the lever on a moving car in order to uncouple, and doing so in order to couple. But the plaintiff states, and he is not contradicted, but indeed borne out by other evidence, that he had plenty of time to do what he was going to do and get around to the side out of the way before the cars would couple. Really all he proposed doing was operating the lever on a moving car. Nowhere do I find that to be forbidden. It was argued that this was contrary to the defendants\u2019 circular No. 4 of 15th February, 1911, which, however, the jury find the plaintiff not to have notice of. That circular forbids \u201call acts familiarly known as taking chances,\u201d and it calls attention to accidents which had occurred \u201csolely by carelessness on the part of some employee, such as,\u201d inter alia, \u201cadjusting coupler * * * when cars are in motion.\u201d But Mr. Hawkes, the defendants\u2019 yard-master, expressly states, as one might expect, that opening the knuckle by the operating lever is not \u201cadjusting the coupler.\u201d That circular naturally enough puts \u201cadjusting coupler\u201d in the same category with \u201cturning angle-cock or uncoupling hosebags\u201d\u2014all which would have to be done by going between the cars on the ground. But the circular is luminous in respect of several operations. Thus it refers to \u201caccidents from holding on side of car,\u201d but only \u201cwhen passing platform, building or other obstruction, known to be close to track;\u201d \u201ckicking cars into sidings,\u201d but only where other cars are standing; and \u201cdetaching moving cars\u201d without first seeing to the brakes being in order. This last instance impliedly recognises the practice of detaching moving cars if only the brakes are in order. The plaintiff was injured in an operation not a whit more dangerous than those which are here impliedly recognised, and not at all one which involved the danger of going between cars.\nThe appellant was attempting to do just what this practice so referred to justifies. In hopes of averting a mishap likely by reason of both parts of the coupler, that on the Wabash car and that on the car to be connected with it, being closed, he tried to reach and raise the lever to open the one on the Wabash car on which he was. He swears that this, if done, would have enabled successful connection, and he is not contradicted in regard thereto, or the possibility of its accomplishment by the means he tried.\nWhat Mr. Justice Magee condemns, and the sole reason for his judgment being adverse to appellant, is that appellant took such a position in his attempt that the overbalancing of his body, which he thinks was the direct result thereof, disentitled him to succeed.\nIt seems he, standing with one foot on the stirrup part (if I may so call it) of the ladder, holding on by a rung of the ladder twenty inches or more above that, had to bend down and thus be placed in an insecure position and be liable to be jerked off, as he was.\nThere was nothing impossible in such a feat. It was necessary to so bend down to reach the lever, or try to reach it.\nAnd if he failed, whose fault was it? The utmost that is said is that his doing so was bad judgment. That is the evidence of the respondent\u2019s own man called to testify as an expert. I respectfully submit he and appellant, as well as some of the jury, evidently knew a great deal more of the nature of the feat attempted, than some others possessed of higher gifts of another sort. When was error of judgment converted in law into either recklessness or negligence?\nWho invited him to so act? Who imposed upon him the duty of exercising a judgment determining how far he should venture? Who placed before him the necessity for his attempting such a thing and made for him the trap into which his misjudgment led him?\nIf the practice of the men and the masters placed in charge by respondent did not shew that they felt it was no more than a question of judgment, then surely the use by respondent of such a defective and illegal lever as this one in question did invite him, and as result of its use impose upon him the duty of determining how far he ought to venture to avert the damage likely to happen to respondent\u2019s property.\nThe respondent violated the statute in carrying such a car so equipped that the lever could not be reached without this undue straining of appellant to serve his master. There is not a word in the statute requiring the operation, needed to work such couplers, to be done when standing on the ground, or to indicate the protection was solely intended for such cases. Invention might well reach the point of making it with greater safety on a car than on the ground.\nIf the longer kind of lever used on other cars built and run by respondent had been placed on this Wabash car then there would have been no necessity for appellant running any risk. If even one of a shorter description than those of this latest pattern had been on said car, there would have been little risk.\nAnd if there had been a ladder on its end as required by said sub-section 5, of section 264, the operation needed could have been executed with the short lever. Of course, the operator in such case would have had to act with such promptness that the act of drawing it would be over and the operator straightened up or back to the top before the two cars being connected had met.\nThe respondent had equally violated the statute in carrying as part of its equipment on this train a car which had no ladder properly placed on the end of the car as required by the statute. That violation is perhaps not so clearly as the other a possible basis for this action. If there had been, however, no such violation of the law, the means of averting the consequence of the other violation of law would have had to be considered if the facts had presented such a case. The appellant, or any one so situated as he, would be bound to use that ladder so far as practicable as a means of mitigating the risks to be run in handling a car so defectively equipped in regard to the lever.\nThe point made by Mr. Robinson in his brief argument so admirable for its precision and direct bearing on the issue raised by a consideration of these subsections in their relation to each other, was well taken, and the authority of the case of The \u201cArklow\u201d[8], at page 139, which he cited, is as undoubted as the principle of law involved therein. The violating of a statute bearing on the duty of a railway company may well have prim\u00e2 facie the like results as attendant upon the violation of a statutory rule of navigation though the consequences as to measurement or apportionment of damages may not apply.\nThe reasonableness or unreasonableness of the effort made by appellant to operate with such defects has been passed upon by the jury, and I hold the Chan- cellor was quite right in submitting that question to the jury, and the Court of Appeal wrong in overruling such submission and direction.\nMuch might be said of the failure to instruct by means of the circular No. 4. If it aimed at anything such as appellant is said to have mistakenly done, which I do not think it did, then that clearly had been brought to the notice of the respondent\u2019s authorities a month before, and the need for directing regarding it and to stop what had become recognized practice by its employees.\nIt was the duty of the company to have seen to it, under such circumstances, in such a case that such practices as it describes should cease, and that a copy of the circular was duly delivered, especially in the case of men comparatively new to its service.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014The jury found in effect that the coupling equipment did not conform to the statutory requirements and that the accident was due to this deficiency. I think there was abundant evidence to support this finding. As to contributory negligence:\u2014I think the jury may not unreasonably have thought\u2014assuming the appellant in the circumstances in which he found himself on descending the ladder to be chargeable with an error of judgment\u2014that he was not fairly chargeable with the graver fault of recklessly or thoughtlessly exposing himself to unnecessary risk.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff appeals against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside the judgment in his favour entered by the learned Chancellor of Ontario on the following findings of a jury:\u2014\n1. Was the car in question owned by the C.P.R. or by another company?\nOwned by another company.\n2. Was the car and its fittings reasonably safe for the employees of the C.P.R. in the usual operations of the road?\nWe think not.\n3. Was the plaintiff, having regard to all the circumstances, in his method of arranging the gear for coupling the cars, acting according to good and proper practice?\nNot having received circular No. 4, we think he acted to the best of his knowledge.\n4. If not, wherein did he err?\n5. Was the plaintiff injured in consequence of any defect in the make-up of the car?\nYes, in our opinion we think he was.\n6. If he was so injured state everything which you find to be wrong.\nThe car in question lacked the ladder on end of car and long lever equipment used by C.P.R., in which company he was employed.\n7. Could the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable care have provided for the coupling of the cars with safety to himself?\nIn our opinion, not under the circumstances.\n8. Do you find negligence as to the matters in dispute:\n(a) In the C.P.R.\n(b) In the plaintiff.\n(c) Or, in both of them?\n9. If so, state briefly what was the negligence in each case.\n10. If the plaintiff is entitled to damages, state how much. The jury have agreed on $6,000 for damages for plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the evidence did not establish any negligence or breach of statutory duty on the part of the defendants, but did clearly establish that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was attributable solely to his own fault.\nI concur in the opinion of the Court of Appeal that, on its proper construction, sub-section 5 of section 264, of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d does not apply to foreign cars being hauled on Canadian railways in the ordinary course of, or as a result of, interchange of through traffic with foreign railways. But, I think, the provisions of clause (c) of sub-section 1 of that section apply to foreign cars equally with domestic cars when they form part of a railway train subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. That clause reads as follows:\u2014\n264. Every company shall provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means:\u2014\n* * * * *\n(c) to securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train, with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars.\nAlthough the words \u201cwithout the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars\u201d grammatically qualify only the verb \u201ccan be uncoupled,\u201d the same requirement is introduced with regard to the operation of coupling by the qualifying phrase \u201cautomatically by impact.\u201d Having regard to the means provided for preparing the coupler to operate automatically, viz., a lever extending from it towards the side of the car\u2014and to the fact that it is necessary to use this lever to open the knuckle of the coupler on one of the cars to be coupled whenever both knuckles are closed, in order to permit of their automatic operation, the statute, on its proper construction, requires that the lever shall be of sufficient length to permit of its being effectively used\u2014whether in coupling or uncoupling\u2014without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars. The jury has found that the \u201cmake-up\u201d of the car in question was defective in that it \u201clacked the * * * long lever equipment used by the Canadian Pacific Rway. Co., in which company he (the plain- tiff) was employed.\u201d The jury further found that the plaintiff was injured in consequence of that defect.\nAccording to the evidence of the plaintiff, the lever was about 16 inches in length, so that he had to reach 32 inches in from the side of the car to touch it. According to the evidence of the defendants\u2019 witnesses the lever was about 32 inches in length and came to within about 16 inches of the side of the car. Harry Bogardus, Grand Trunk Oar Inspector at Allandale, said that the lever \u201cshould run from the coupler out to the side of the car.\u201d John Hood, C.P.R. Inspector at West Toronto, said, \u201cI guess if it came to the edge of the car it would be better. * * * Yes, it should come to the edge of the car.\u201d Wm. Lillew, leading Hand-car Inspector at Toronto Junction, in answer to Mr. Creswicke\u2019s question, \u201cAnd you agree with Mr. Hood that the lever should really come out to the side of the car for better safety, you agree with his evidence?\u201d said, \u201cI agree with his evidence all right enough.\u201d Modern Canadian Pacific Railway cars are constructed with the lever coming out to the side. On some of the older cars the position of the buffers prevents this, but according to the evidence of John Hood, \u201ctaking the Grand Trunk and the C.P.R. and the ordinary trunk lines from the other side,\u201d the usual distance of the lever from the side of the car would be 7 or 8 inches. On the Wabash car in question, according to the evidence of Wm. Lillew, the lever could have been brought without difficulty to within 8 inches of the side\u2014i.e., 8 inches farther out than it was brought according to the evidence of the defence witnesses, and 24 inches farther out than it was brought, according to the evidence of the plaintiff. All the witnesses who were questioned on the point admitted that \u201cthe shorter the lever the greater the danger.\u201d John Hood stated that if the lever were as short as the plaintiff said it was it would be so improper that the company would have to change it. It is not surprising, in view of this evidence, that the jury found that the equipment of the car with such a short lever was a defect; and by that finding, having regard to the facts that it is coupled with the finding as to the lack of end ladders, and that negligence proper was covered by the eighth question which the jury did not answer, I have little doubt that they meant that the lever on the car was not in conformity with the requirements of the statute, in that it did not obviate the necessity of men going between the cars for the purpose of operating the so-called automatic coupler. A finding of negligence on the part of the defendants is probably involved in the finding of such a defect; but a finding of negligence is not requisite where a breach of statutory duty causing the injury complained of has been established. Such a breach of statutory duty has been found in the present case, as I understand the answers of the jury\u2014and, I think, upon sufficient evidence. Unless, therefore, the evidence makes it so clear that the plaintiff was himself guilty of some negligence or improper act which was the sole or a contributing cause of his injury that a finding to the contrary would be perverse, the verdict in his favour should not have been disturbed.\nThe defendants charge that it was improper to have attempted to work the coupling lever from the side ladder of a moving car; and that, if this were permissible under any circumstances, the crouching position which the plaintiff assumed to perform the opera- tion\u2014with his left hand he clutched the bottom rung of the ladder; his left foot rested on a step some 16 inches to 18 inches lower; his right foot hung in the air, and his body was strained forward and swung around the end of the car to permit of his right hand reaching the short lever to open the knuckle of the coupler\u2014entailed very great and unnecessary danger. On these issues the jury found in the plaintiff\u2019s favour. While the terms in which they couched their finding\u2014that the plaintiff could not under the circumstances, by the exercise of reasonable care have provided for the coupling of the cars with safety to himself\u2014have been made the subject of criticism because of the use of the somewhat equivocal words \u201cunder the circumstances,\u201d I incline to think that the jury made sufficiently clear its intention to acquit the plaintiff of the charge of contributory fault or negligence\u2014and, of course, to negative the view that his injury was ascribable solely to his own fault. Notwithstanding this finding, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have held that the plaintiff\u2019s own carelessness was the main, if not the sole, cause of his injury, and have reversed the judgment in his favour and dismissed the action. With great respect, I am of the opinion that the evidence did not warrant the appellate court in taking that course.\nThe faults attributed to the plaintiff are (a) that he attempted to make the coupling without stopping the train; (b) that in endeavouring to make it he assumed an unnecessarily dangerous posture.\n(a) According to the evidence, to effect a coupling between cars equipped with automatic couplers, the knuckle in the coupler of one car should be open and that in the coupler of the other closed. With both knuckles closed the coupling cannot be made, and if the cars come together with the knuckles in this position, although with a momentum which might not be too great with the couplers in proper position, it was stated by counsel for the appellant that there is a probability of the couplers being broken. There is no evidence, however, on this latter point. With both knuckles open the attempt to make a coupling is only occasionally successful.\nWhile the plaintiff admittedly knew, before he gave the engineer the signal to back the train from the freight sheds for the purpose of making the coupling, that the knuckle on the Wabash car was closed, his evidence, though not as explicit as might be desired, is open to the construction that he did not then know that the knuckle on the stationary car, with which the Wabash car was to be coupled, was also closed. It is not suggested in the evidence that he should have known or ascertained how this was before he signalled to the engineer to back up in order to make the coupling. He says he discovered the fact after he had reached the top of the Wabash car which was moving at about 7 miles per hour and was then about four car lengths from the stationary car\u2014a distance which would be covered in about 15 seconds. Asked why he did not then give a signal to the engineer to stop, his reply was \u201che was not looking\u2014that is why he did not get one.\u201d While there is no charge of negligence against the engineer, there is no contradiction of this evidence. There is evidence in the record from defence witnesses as well as from witnesses for the plaintiff, that it is usual and customary for brakesmen to open the knuckles of automatic couplers for coupling as well as for uncoupling, by operating the levers from the ladders when cars are in motion, and that a lever coming out to the side of the car can be operated from the side ladder \u201cwithout any trouble.\u201d\nThe defendants proved the issue of a circular warning their employees against the \u201cadjusting\u201d of couplers while cars are in motion. Some witnesses deposed that it was the previous \u201cunwritten law\u201d that this should not be done. But the plaintiff, who was not a regular brakesman, had not received this circular; and the witnesses for the defendants prove that opening the knuckle of a coupler by using the lever is not \u201cadjusting\u201d the coupler within the meaning of that term as used in the circular. That process is resorted to only when the lever fails to work. It involves going between the cars and handling the coupler itself. Hence the prohibition. This adjusting or handling of the coupler is what two of the defence witnesses pronounced dangerous; and, when pressed on cross-examination, the defendants\u2019 witnesses constantly revert to \u201cadjusting\u201d as the dangerous and forbidden thing. There is no suggestion in the evidence of any specific rule of the defendant company relating to the operation which the plaintiff was performing other than that contained in circular No. 4, and the so-called \u201cunwritten law\u201d which preceded it, forbidding the \u201cadjusting\u201d of couplers on moving cars. What the plaintiff was doing was not \u201cadjusting.\u201d The general rule against taking chances is referred to. But the evidence is that it is customary, and necessary, for certain purposes, for brakesmen to ride on the side ladders of moving cars, and that it is usual to operate the levers of automatic couplers from them. The conductor, Harcourt, called by the defendants, says he would not report a brakesman under his orders for doing so. There is no evidence that the plaintiff knew of the shortness of the lever until he attempted to reach it from the side ladder with his right hand. On the whole evidence, in my opinion, it is not possible to say that the plaintiff\u2019s attempting to open the knuckle of the coupler while the train was in motion was so clearly a wrong or improper thing that it is fatal to his right to recover notwithstanding that the jury has found in his favour on the charge of negligence against him. On this branch of that charge there was evidence to support the finding, and it should not have been disturbed.\n(b). Then as to the plaintiff\u2019s position when he endeavoured to operate the lever: On reaching the foot of the ladder and realizing that the lever was short he was confronted with a situation of some difficulty. Had the lever been of normal length, the defendants\u2019 witnesses say that he could easily have accomplished what he intended to do. The car on which he was was moving at the rate of 7 miles an hour. He scarcely had time to get down and open the knuckle from the ground even if he could descend with safety, or, having got down, could reach and operate the lever while the car was moving as rapidly as it was. The defence witnesses do not say that he could not, as a result of crouching as he did, swing his free right arm farther around the end of the car. That may have been, for aught that the testimony discloses to the contrary, if not the only, the most effective means of reaching the short lever. There is no evidence that the fireman was then on the locomotive or that the plaintiff could have signalled him to stop. He was on the wrong side of the train to signal the engineer. When he had left the top of the car the engineer was not looking in his direction. Should he have acted on the chance that if he again mounted the ladder he might find the engineer looking and might successfully signal him in time to have the train stopped before the cars would come together? Should he have attempted that, or allowed the cars to meet at whatever risk there might be of breaking the couplers because both were closed? Was it clearly wrong for him under the circumstances to have attempted to operate the lever of the coupler with his right hand by swinging it around the end of the car? In the effort to reach that lever he assumed a position which railway men condemn. But there is no evidence that he could have reached it had he held himself more erect. The objection which the defence witnesses take to the position which he assumed is that it was so strained that it could be held \u201conly for a short distance.\u201d But the moving of the lever would require the plaintiff to remain in that position only for a moment. He was an athlete, 22 years of age. Whether he should have realized that he was incurring risk and to what degree was eminently a question for the jury who had the advantage of seeing him. If he did err in the judgment which he formed on the spur of the moment as to what his duty required him to do, it was again for the jury to say whether that error under the circumstances amounted to negligence or fault on his part. They found that it did not, I have failed to discover in the record sufficient to justify an appellate court in setting aside that finding and holding that the evidence clearly establishes that the plaintiff was so negligent that he should be held to have been the author of his own injury notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the jury.\nThey are the tribunal entrusted by the law with the determination of issues of fact, and their conclusions on such matters ought not to be disturbed because they are not such as judges sitting in courts of appeal might themselves have arrived at.

L.R. 1), by which an appeal from a Divisional Court (23 Ont. L.R. 365) was dismissed, that the evidence established that between M.\u2019s land and the bay was marsh land and not land covered with water as contended and, therefore, M. was not a riparian owner.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court[2], which maintained the judgment at the trial dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s action was brought to compel the city to remove a bank of earth from Ashbridge\u2019s Bay which had been thrown up in excavating a channel and which, it was claimed, impeded or destroyed his right, as riparian owner, of free access to the waters of the bay. By the judgments of all the courts below the action was dismissed.\nMowat K.C. for the appellant. Adjoining appellant\u2019s land is a water lot which is navigable even if it is shallow at times. See Stover v. Lavoia[3]; Gardiner v. Chapman[4]; Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Light Co.[5]\nGeary K.C. and Colquhoun for the respondent. Niles v. Cedar Point Club[6] is precisely this case. See also The King v. Montague[7]; Baldwin v. Erie Shooting Club[8].\nDAVIES J.\u2014The plaintiff sues in this action, claiming to be a riparian proprietor on the shore of Ash-bridge Bay adjoining or forming part of the harbour of Toronto. His complaint is that his riparian rights of free and uninterrupted access to the waters of the harbour and bay to and from his lands, have been interrupted by the defendant, who dug a channel running east and west along the north side of the bay, and in and across lots owned by them lying to the south of plaintiff\u2019s lots, and threw up the excavation from the cut made by them upon its north side, thus impeding, if not destroying, the rights of access of plaintiff to the navigable waters of the bay.\nThe lands lying between plaintiff\u2019s lot in which he claims to have riparian rights, is wet, marshy, boggy land, and to maintain his claim for an injunction to prevent interference with his alleged riparian rights the onus lay upon the plaintiff of proving that this lot owned by him was really, as a substantial fact, bounded or covered in part by the waters of the bay, affording him navigable access to the deeper waters outside and beyond his land; in other words that he was what the law calls a riparian proprietor or owner of lands with rights of access, which had been impaired or destroyed by defendant\u2019s works.\nThere was much evidence, some of it conflicting, and some equivocal and indefinite, given at the trial as to the real nature and character of this marshy land, and in the result the trial judge dismissed the action simply without giving any reasons. It is difficult to see how he could have dismissed the action unless he found against the plaintiff on the crucial point of the case, and on an appeal to the Divisional Court against this judgment the learned Chancellor states plainly that\nthis action was dismissed by my brother Magee on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s property was land and not water, and that he was not in any sense a riparian proprietor.\nI assume he must, before making that statement, have consulted with the trial judge. The judges of the Divisional Court unanimously concurred with the finding of fact of the trial judge, holding that the plain- tiff was not a \u201criparian proprietor\u201d and did not possess any of his claimed riparian rights, and that the law governing his case was that pertaining to the ownership of marsh land only.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has made the same findings of fact, Maclaren and Clute JJ. dissenting.\nAfter examining such parts of the evidence as were called to our attention by Mr. Mowat, I am not able to conclude that the findings of fact of the three courts were wrong. On the contrary, I have reached the same conclusion as those courts did, which as I understand it was, that plaintiff\u2019s rights by virtue of his ownership of the land in question were not those of a riparian owner at all, but were those of the owner of marsh land simply.\nIt was claimed that this marsh or boggy land was simply a floating mass of vegetable matter more or less movable and with an appreciable depth of water below it.\nI think the evidence called to our attention by Mr. Geary as to the character of the marsh and soil in front of this land of plaintiff\u2019s, as shewn from the actual cutting of the ditch made by the defendant and the excavations taken from it, sufficiently dispose of that claim as applicable at any rate to the lands lying between plaintiff\u2019s claimed ripa and the deep water of the bay. The \u201cfloating marsh\u201d evidence was not applicable to the locality in front of plaintiff\u2019s land.\nNot entertaining any reasonable doubt on the crucial facts relating to the character of this marsh and bog land in front of and bordering upon plaintiff\u2019s lot, and not finding him to be in any proper sense of the term a riparian proprietor, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014Such remote and slim possibilities of riparian ownership relative to the navigable waters of Lake Ontario as appellant\u2019s predecessor in title may have had long ago, seem to have been effectually extinguished by the forces of nature and of social, commercial and political development.\nIf ever there was a time when the waters of Lake Ontario reached in such depth and volume the appellant\u2019s little plot as to make the owner thereof a riparian proprietor entitled to invoke the law he relies upon herein, it must have been before the Don and other earth carriers had deposited their loads in that vicinity to such an extent as to produce the growth of hay to be found in such close proximity to said plot as to prevent easy navigable approach thereto.\nEven if the hay may be of a coarse variety and grown upon a floating vegetable mass having no contact with the soil beneath, as is argued and as does happen with aquatic plants in tropical climes, the barrier to commercial utility developing out of that sort of riparian ownership is rather formidable.\nAnd it seems as if the social and political forces had got to work and constructed a break-water and other things calculated to help the Don to fill up and make of this land-locked bay, solid land in spots, soft land in other spots, with tufts of reed or grass thereon, and that floating vegetable mass peculiar to the climate, in other spots, and all interspersed with water holes, here and there. Indeed long before these later developments had been dreamed of there were dreamers in Toronto who got, in A.D. 1847, a license of occupation from the Crown to the good city to have, hold and occupy a large tract of land and marsh and water which, if we have regard to the illuminating effect of a statute of a later date defining the harbour, must have comprised the marsh whereon the works now complained of have been executed.\nThat license reserved the \u201cfree access to the beach for all vessels, boats and persons.\u201d It does not appear that the hay lands in close proximity to the appellant\u2019s land constituted a beach or part of that beach.\nThen in 1855 the legislature by way of confirming, as the title of the Act indicates, the city in the possession of the peninsula and marsh held by it under said license, passed an Act enabling a grant to be made by the governor of the province in council of said peninsula or marsh or any part thereof subject to such conditions or restrictions as he might be advised to impose.\nThat Act recites large sums of money had been expended by the city in laying out lots, etc., in said area. The result seems to me to be that the province had rights therein which the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d would have enabled it to execute in accordance with the intent of such legislation which might, but for that, have been of more doubtful effect having regard to the powers assigned by said \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to the Dominion over harbours.\nBe that as it may the province did make a grant in 1880 to the city and a confirmatory grant or one having that effect was got from the Dominion in 1903. These several transactions seem to raise a rather formidable barrier in appellant\u2019s way when he cannot shew himself possessed of a clearer right as a riparian proprietor than the evidence discloses.\nThe mandatory order and the restraining injunction he seeks herein are remedies requiring some clearer basis for a court to act upon than is made apparent in face of the foregoing history.\nAnd as to actual damages he seems to have suffered none that I am able from reading his evidence to appreciate.\nIt is not a case of trespass in which the bare invasion of his right might entitle him to nominal damages.\nAgain the work complained of seems to have been done pursuant to some authority directing it for sanitary reasons, and if he had, through interference with his rights in said lands suffered by reason of the injurious affection thereof his remedy would probably be by way of arbitration.\nThis latter ground has not been so relied upon, though pleaded, as to make clear we should rest thereon alone. It seems unnecessary to dwell thereon, for upon the findings of fact concurred in by so many courts there seems to be no interference with any riparian rights such as appellant imagines he has had.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the weight of evidence supports the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal and the Divisional Court that the locus in quo is land, not water. There is, consequently, no foundation for the claim put forward by the appellant that he is entitled to riparian rights.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The judgments of the Divisional Court and of the Court of Appeal upholding the conclusion of the trial judge, who dismissed this action without assigning reasons, rest upon a finding of fact that the plaintiff\u2019s lot on its southern side abuts not upon water, but upon land. This finding is supported not merely by evidence sufficient to sustain it, but I rather think by the weight of the evidence in the record. It is certainly quite impossible to say that it is so clearly erroneous that it should be disturbed in this court. It follows that the plaintiff has not the riparian rights upon which his action is founded and that his appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I entirely concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mowat, Laughton & Maclennan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William Johnston.\n[1] 27 Ont.

The proper method of effecting any such alteration is by proceedings under section 162 or section 167 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, chapter 37.\nAPPEAL from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada approving of a substituted location plan of the \u201cMolston-St. Boniface Branch\u201d of the Canadian Pacific Railway by an order having retrospective effect.\nThe railway company, in 1904, deposited plans of location and profiles and a book of reference of the cut-off branch of their line from Molson station to a point in the Town of St. Boniface, Man., which shewed a crossing of a portion of lot 97 of the Parish of Kildonan, the property of the appellants, the ground taken by the railway being shewn as 99 feet in width. Prior to the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1903, this was the width permitted to be taken, in ordinary circumstances, by the railway company but, by that Act, the width which could be so taken was increased to 100 feet. In 1906, the railway company registered another plan shewing alterations in the branch line and the effect of the new plan upon the appellants\u2019 property was that, instead of 99 feet, the width taken was 100 feet. Arbitration proceedings were subsequently commenced, the notice being given according to the last plan filed, and it appeared that, although the first plan had been regularly approved, the latter plan had been so filed without any approval being obtained. The appellants then applied for an order from the court in Manitoba to rescind the order appointing the arbitrators, which was refused on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and, subsequently, they made an application to the Board of Railway Commissioners for an order rescinding or repealing an order originally made by the Board respecting the construction of the railway across the lots, or for an order requiring the company to obtain the approval of the change or alteration effected by the later plan. The result was that, on the 18th March, 1912, the Board made an order that the railway company should be permitted to file a new location plan as of the date of the plan originally filed and approved by their original order, and shewing the width of 100 feet to be taken. On the present appeal it was contended that the Board of Railway Commissioners had no jurisdiction to make an order approving of a plan already filed and giving it legal effect as of an anterior date. The appellants contended that the whole proceedings should be commenced anew and that they are entitled to compe nsation for the land taken at the increased valuations now prevailing, instead of the prices which were in force at the time of the commencement of the proceedings which they contended were irregular.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. concurred in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondents filed, under the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d plans and profiles which claimed a right-of-way only ninety-nine feet wide. Some time later the Board of Railway Commissioners approved thereof. And, still later, the railway was built without making compensation for the lands so taken. In course of doing so, the company included toy its fences a space of one hundred feet wide, instead of the ninety-nine feet claimed by the plans and profiles filed.\nSome months after obtaining the approval of the Board to the first plans and profiles filed the railway company saw fit to file another set of plans claiming a right-of-way one hundred feet wide, but never applied for approval thereof.\nYears afterwards, the railway company gave notice of expropriation under this unauthorized set of plans and profiles and proceeded to arbitration as to the compensation to be made to the appellants.\nOn the proceedings being objected to, the Board made an order rescinding its original order of approval and permitting the railway company to file a new location plan of its railway as of the date of the plans filed and approved, said new plans to show a width of land to be taken which will coincide with the arbitration notice filed by the railway company.\nThe question is now raised by this appeal of the jurisdiction of the Board to make this last-mentioned order.\nI have no hesitation in saying such an order is entirely beyond the powers of the Board.\nIt would be a stretch of authority that in some conceivable cases might work most grievous wrong.\nThe claim seems to me hardly arguable. No such thing as antedating the operative effect of such an order is contemplated by the Act. It should not be permitted unless with the consent of all who, by any possibility, might be affected thereby.\nThe Board\u2019s extensive powers of rectifying errors do not countenance such a proceeding as this.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think there was no power to make the order impeached on this appeal. The order does not profess to be made, and clearly enough it is not made, under section 162 or section 167 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which are the enactments Mr. Chrysler invoked in support of it. It is simply an order permitting the company \u201cto file\u201d a new location plan of its railway, known as the \u201cMolson-St. Boniface Branch,\u201d as of the date of the plan filed and approved of \u201cby said order No. 544, dated July 12th, 1905.\u201d That is an order which can only mean that the plan so authorized to be filed shall be deemed to have been filed and shall take effect as having been filed on a date seven years before the date of the order. It is admitted that, according to the plan which is to have this ex post facto effect, the land occupied by the railway mentioned in the order is not identical with that occupied by it according to the plan it is to displace. I think it is clear that the Board has no jurisdiction, by an order of this description, to authorize the railway company to alter, retrospectively, the location plan of its railway. The remedy of the railway company, if it is in any difficulty, is by way of section 162 or section 167 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nBrodeur J. concurred with Duff J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hull, Sparling & Sparling.\nSolicitor for the respondents: E.

Thomson (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1912: November 18; 1913: February 18.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nOn Appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nCompany\u2014Subscription for treasury stock\u2014Contract\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Misrepresentation\u2014Fraud\u2014Transfer of shares\u2014Rescission\u2014Return of payments\u2014Want of consideration.\nV. entered into an agreement to purchase for re\u2014sale the unsold treasury stock of a foreign joint stock company \"subscriptions to be made from time to time as sales were made;\" it was therein provided that the company should fill all orders for stock received through V. at $15 for each share; that V. should sell the stock for $20 per share; that V. should \"pay for the stock so ordered with the proceeds of sales made by him or through his agency,\" and that the contract should continue in force so long as the company had unsold treasury stock with which to fill such orders. The company also gave V. authority to establish agencies in Canada in connection with its casualty insurance business and to appoint medical examiners there. At the time the company had no licence to carry on the business of insurance in Canada, nor any immediate intention of making arrangements to do so, and V. was an official of the company and was aware of these facts. V. appointed T. the sole medical examiner of the company for Vancouver, B.C., assuring him that the company would commence to carry on its casualty insurance business there within a couple of months, and then obtained from him a subscription for a number of shares of the company's treasury stock which were paid for partly by T.'s cheques, payable to the company, and the balance by a series of promissory notes falling due from month to month following the date of the subscription and made payable to V. A number of shares equal to those so subscribed for by T. were then transferred to him by V. out of the allotment made to him by the above mentioned agreement, the certificates therefor being obtained by V. in the name of T. from the company, but the company did not formally accept T.'s subscription nor issue any treasury stock to him thereunder. The company did not commence business in Vancouver within the time specified by V. nor did it obtain a licence to carry on the business of insurance in Canada until many months later. In an action by T. against the company and V. to recover back the money he had paid and for the cancellation and return of the notes.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (7 D.L.R. 944; 2 West. W.R. 658), Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting. that, in the transaction which took place, V. was the company's agent; that the company was, consequently, responsible for the deceit practised in procuring the subscription from \/T.; that there had been no contract for the purchase of treasury stock completed between the company and T.; that the object of T.'s subscription was not satisfied by the transfer of V.'s shares to him, and that he was entitled to recover back the money he had paid and to have the notes returned for cancellation as having been paid over and delivered without consideration and in consequence of the fraudulent, representations made by V.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside the judgment of Murphy J. at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nBy his action, the plaintiff asked rescission of a contract, made by him, for the purchase of 250 shares of the treasury stock of the company, on the ground of misrepresentations made by the defendant VanHummell, as agent of the company, for the return of moneys paid by him on account of the price of the shares so subscribed for and for the return of certain promissory notes made by him for the amount of the balance of the price of the shares, at $20 each, in order that the said notes might be cancelled as having been fraudulently obtained from him and for want of consideration. The action was tried by Mr. Justice Murphy without a jury and, as against the company it was dismissed with costs, judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff as against VanHummell for the return of the moneys paid on account and for the return of the promissory notes and the plaintiff was given costs of his action against VanHummell. By the judgment appealed from, an appeal by VanHummell from the judgment of the trial judge was allowed, without costs, and a cross-appeal by the plaintiff was also allowed and judgment directed to be entered for rescission of the contract and for the return by the company of the moneys paid and for delivery up of the promissory notes with costs of the action and of the cross-appeal.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the matters in issue of this appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nAnglin K.G. for the appellant company.\nD.J. McDougal for the appellant, VanHummell.\nHellmuth K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In this case the plaintiff, now respondent, asks for the rescission of a contract to purchase shares of stock in the appellant company on the ground of misrepresentation.\nIt was argued that the contract between the respondent and the company was never executed inasmuch as his offer to subscribe for shares in the capital stock of the company was not acted upon. Undoubtedly, Thomson's application purports on its face to be for treasury stock, the property of the company, and not for shares which were already allocated to VanHummell. It is equally certain, if we believe the evidence of the president, Ritter, and of VanHummell, that the certificate issued to Thomson was for 250 shares of the stock previously purchased by VanHummell and held by the company subject to his order, and counsel, at the oral argument here, pressed upon us this consideration: that, not having got the shares he applied for, Thomson is now entitled to recover his money back. That however, is not the case made upon the pleadings and, although there is some evidence to support it, the course of the trial was not directed towards that issue, nor is it discussed in the factum here. I also doubt very much whether Thomson would have refused to accept the shares if he had known of their previous allotment to VanHummell if all the- other conditions of the transaction had been faithfully fulfilled.\nDealing with the issues presented to the courts below, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has made out a case which entitled him to succeed.\nOn the pleadings and evidence two questions fell to be considered and decided. First: Who were the parties to the contract? Secondly: The character of the representations made on behalf of the company and their effect upon the transaction.\nBoth courts found that VanHummell acted throughout merely as the agent of the company and that the contract respecting the purchase of the shares was made by him for the company and not for himself. This concurrent finding of the two lower courts is supported by the documentary evidence, and VanHummell, when examined as a witness on discovery, admits that the contract was between the company and Thomson and that he was merely the agent \"in the sale of the shares.\" The application for the stock is addressed to the company and the two cheques given in part payment are made to its order. The notes for the balance of the purchase price are made payable to the order of VanHummell\u2014 why, I do not pause to inquire\u2014they were, apparently, signed after the transaction had been submitted to the head-office. The receipt for the money and notes is also signed in the name of the company.\nAs to the second question, I have read the evidence over very carefully and, if we believe Thomson, as the trial judge evidently did, I fail to see how we can refuse to grant rescission. Entering into the contract for the purchase of the shares meant the assumption of an obligation to pay $4,250 in monthly instalments, and having, as the trial judge says, been relieved of all his ready cash nothing could be more natural than that Thomson should be concerned about the payment of his notes at maturity. Dependent, apparently, upon his professional income, he relied upon the increase resulting from the new business to meet these notes. In such circumstances he naturally made inquiries as to the probabilities and says that he received from the authorized agent of the company positive assurance that it would be in business by the 1st of November, and in this he is corroborated by Wilmot. On the faith of this assurance he signed the notes and parted with his money. Time and again he repeats that he relied upon the business of the company to increase his revenue so that he might be in a position to meet his notes and he most emphatically states that the agent affirmed the intention of the company to begin business on the first of November. The exist- ence or non-existence of that intention is a fact, and, if he signed the application and parted with his cheques and notes on the faith of the statements made with respect to it, his position is the same as if he acted on a representation of the existence of any other fact. See 20 Halsbury, Laws of England, No. 1617.\nBoth courts below are agreed that VanHummell, to induce the subscription for the stock, made certain statements with respect to the time at which the company would be prepared to start business in Vancouver. The point of difference between them is just this: the trial judge found that the words used amounted merely to a qualified promise, and no more, that the company would be so far organized by the time fixed as to be then in a position to start business, that with this assurance the respondent was content, and that he was not induced to enter into the contract on the faith of what was said about the business beginning in November. The Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the words manifested and expressed and were intended to manifest and express a then \"fixed intention, readiness or capacity on the part of the company\" to commence operations on that date, and that the respondent was induced to apply for the shares on the faith of that representation. There is certainly room for much difference of opinion in the appreciation of the language used by the agent, but, on the whole, after giving the evidence the most careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that VanHummell did not give the respondent a mere promise or undertaking which was not fulfilled, but, being in the position of one who had special knowledge, he deliberately used language calculated to convey the impression that, at the time, there was an existing fixed intention on the part of the company to begin business on the first of November, and that the respondent was induced to subscribe for the shares on the faith of the representation made with respect to that intention. I am also satisfied on the evidence that such a representation made by one who had intimate knowledge of the then state of the company's affairs was false. The application for the Dominion licence, without which it was impossible to begin business, was not made for a month after the transaction was closed, and the licence did not in fact issue until this suit was brought and more than half the notes had matured. The strongest evidence in support of my conclusion I find in the terms of the bargain, as given by the trial judge, who says, page 120:\u2014\nEvidence is before me, uncontradicted, and I think very probable\u2014that the agent of those shares endeavoured to ascertain how much ready money the doctor had, and then gave him such terms as would induce him to make this purchase; that he pointed out to him that doctors in other places made $1,500 to $2,500 from their connection with this company, and thereby led him to infer that he could expect something, at any rate, for acting in connection with this company enabling him in part at any rate, to meet those notes.\nAll the probabilities support this view. As I have already said, the immediate benefit Thomson expected to derive from his connection with the company was to earn money with which to pay his notes as they matured and this he could not do if the company was not in business during their currency. Can it be said, therefore, that the date at which the company would be a source of revenue was not a determining factor or an inducing cause. The appointment as medical examiner was valuable only in so far as it placed him in funds to meet the liability he was induced to assume. Further, although it is exceedingly difficult to prove the presence or absence of an expressed intention, on all the facts it appears to me impossible that VanHummell could, in August, have been at all certain if he had taken reasonable care or made reasonable inquiries that the company would have been in possession of the necessary Dominion and provincial licenses to do business in November. If this is merely a case of error it is an error which should have been avoided. The company was then only in the preliminary stages of its organization in so far as the Canadian branch was concerned. The necessary deposit to satisfy the requirements of the \"Insurance Act\" had to be found out of the sales of stock in Canada and there remained the formalities with respect to the obtaining of the provincial license to be fulfilled. In fact, the licences did not issue until May of the next year. On the whole, I am of opinion that the consent of the respondent was given on the condition that the company would be in business on the first of November, 1910, and the appeal of the company should be dismissed with costs.\nOn the issue with VanHummell, I agree that this appeal also should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I am to deliver the judgment of myself and Mr. Justice Anglin in this case.\nIn his pleading the plaintiff seeks rescission of a contract for the purchase of 250 shares of the capital stock of the defendant company, on the ground that two definite misrepresentations were made to him by the defendant VanHummell when selling these shares as agent of the company. No other cause of action against the company was disclosed in the pleadings, or suggested at the trial, or on appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, or in the appellant's factum on his appeal to this court. The two misrepresentations relied upon were that the plaintiff would be appointed the company's sole resident physician for the City of Vancouver, and that the company would commence and actively carry on business in Vancouver on or before the first day of November, 1910.\nAs to the former it was established that the plaintiff was appointed the company's physician for Vancouver as had been undertaken; and the claim for rescission, so far as it was based upon that alleged misrepresentation, was abandoned.\nThe trial proceeded wholly upon the other ground of misrepresentation. The evidence in respect of it was somewhat conflicting. But at the close of the case the trial judge reached the conclusion that it had not been established that the alleged misrepresentation \"was unqualifiedly made\" and added that he could \"not hold that it essentially entered into the inducement\" or \"was made so clear as to operate on the doctor's mind to induce him to purchase in the sense set out above.\"\nThe learned judge, therefore, dismissed the plaintiff's action as against the company.\nOn appeal the learned Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that:\u2014\nIn obtaining subscription for stock from the plaintiff it was made part of the arrangement that the plaintiff should be physician of the company and it was represented that the company should commence business at a date set out as the first of November, which representation was not made good. Then we have the evidence of the plaintiff himself that that representation was material to him; that it was of the essence of the contract. The plaintiff is entitled to the rescission.\nIn both the trial court and the Court of Appeal it was held that, as put by the learned trial judge:\u2014 The relation that existed between the International Casualty Company and VanHummell was that of principal and agent for the sale of stock. I can put no other interpretation on the documents that were placed before me, and on the history of what happened between them. * * * VanHummell was the agent of the company and if there had been misrepresentation here which would entitle Dr. Thomson to rescission of this contract the company would be bound.\nAnd, as put by the learned Chief Justice on appeal:\u2014\nI think it is manifest that the arrangement between the company and VanHummell was only a contrivance between themselves to constitute him agent of the company; and that as such agent any representations made by him were within the apparent scope of that arrangement. He had authority as agent to sell stock.\nNeither in the trial court nor in the Court of Appeal was it found that the alleged representation as to the time when the company would commence business was fraudulently made.\nOn a careful perusal of the evidence the conclusion of the trial judge upon the question of fact as to the character of the statements made in this connection to the plaintiff appears to be correct. It is not possible, in our opinion, to contend successfully that it was made a term or condition of the plaintiff's contract that it should become void if the company did not commence business on or before the 1st of November, 1910. The application for stock is in writing. It contains no provision of this kind. At the time of his application the plaintiff stipulated for his appointment as physician and had this term of his bargain put in writing, with the following provision:\u2014\nThis agreement to be ratified by the president of the company and if not so ratified, application for stock together with cheques and notes to be returned.\nIt would be contrary to the elementary rule of evidence which excludes parol testimony of a term varying or altering a written contract to permit the plain- tiff to prove that the commencement of business by the company on or before the 1st of November was also a condition subsequent, the non-performance of which would avoid his obligation, to take the stock for which he subscribed.\nRegarded as a misrepresentation the alleged statements made by VanHummell as to the commencement of business by the company, in view of the fact that they, relate to matters of mere intention, would require to be very clear and positive in order to support the claim for rescission. I agree with the learned trial judge that the onus upon the plaintiff in this connection was very heavy. The mere fact that the stipulation as to his appointment as resident physician and for the cancellation of his subscription, should that appointment not be made, was so carefully reduced to writing, gives rise to serious doubt as to whether there was any definite or unqualified representation as to the time when the company would begin business, and casts still greater doubt upon the position taken by the plaintiff that the representation, if made, was a material inducement for his subscription. The plaintiff admits that he was told, the commencement of business would be contingent upon the company's obtaining necessary licences, and he must have known that the issue of these could not be absolutely controlled by it. Taking all the circumstances of the case into account and allowing for the advantage which the learned trial judge had in observing the plaintiff's demeanour when giving his evidence, my conclusion would be that his findings of fact that no unqualified misrepresentation was made and that whatever was said in this connection did not essen- tially enter into the inducement for the contract should not have been disturbed.\nAssuming, however, for the moment that there was an unqualified misrepresentation by the company's agent and that it did materially induce the contract, inasmuch as it related to a matter of intention and expectation on the part of the company it would not afford a ground for relief by way of rescission, unless it had been clearly established that it was falsely and fraudulently made. Clydesdale Bank v. Paton[2]; Kerr on Fraud (4 ed.), pp. 53-5. This has not been found either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal, and I have discovered nothing in the evidence which would justify such a finding, especially at this stage of the proceedings.\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing the trial judge on the question of fact and awarding judgment against the defendant company is not sustainable either in fact or in law.\nIn the course of his argument in this court, however, counsel for the respondent put forward an entirely new ground of claim not disclosed in the pleadings, not taken at the trial or in the Court of Appeal, and not mentioned in his factum on the appeal to this court. He claims judgment for return of the moneys paid by the plaintiff to the company on the ground that while his application was for unallotted treasury stock of the company he was given not such stock, but stock which had been already allotted to the defendant VanHummell and was transferred by him. In the first place, I do not think the plaintiff should be allowed now to set up this new ground of claim. Had it been raised in the pleadings or even at the trial there might have been more satisfactory evidence than is now before us as to the real nature of the arrangement between VanHummell and the company and as to the character in which he held the 30,000 shares of stock which stood in his name. Notwithstanding the evidence given by the company's president, Ritter, in support of its defence that the plaintiff's contract was with VanHummell and not with the company, to the effect that VanHummell was in fact as well as in name the holder of 30,000 shares, I am by no means satisfied that, had the issue now presented been before the court, other evidence might not have been forthcoming which would have made it clear why VanHummell became the nominal holder of all the company's treasury stock and what were precisely his rights and obligations under his arrangement with the company. The circumstances of this case and particularly the documentary evidence seem to indicate that all the facts are not before us. Moreover, from the examinations for discovery, of VanHummell and of Ritter, the plaintiff was made fully aware of all that he now knows concerning the alleged allotment of the 30,000 shares to VanHummell and of the means taken to satisfy his own application for stock. With that knowledge he deliberately elected to proceed with the branch of his action in which he sought to hold VanHummell liable to him on an alleged agreement to take the stock off his hands and dispose of it. He could only make and enforce such an agreement with VanHummell on the basis that the stock was his to dispose of. At the trial he succeeded in convincing the learned judge who presided that he had made such a bargain with VanHum- mell, and obtained a judgment against him for damages for breach of it. Having elected, with full knowledge of the circumstances upon which he now relies in order to recover back his moneys from the company, to proceed with a claim based upon his ownership of the shares which he obtained, he should not, in my opinion, be now allowed to take the stand that he never became owner of these shares and is entitled to a rescission of his contract because they were not what he had bargained for.\nBut if, notwithstanding these objections, the plaintiff should be allowed now to set up this new ground of claim, in my opinion he cannot succeed upon it. As pointed out by the learned trial judge, the documentary evidence makes it reasonably clear that VanHummell had no beneficial interest in or ownership of the 30,000 shares which stood in his name. He held them merely as agent of and trustee for the company. Concurrently with his subscription, an agreement was made between him and the company which recites that\nthe said Casualty Company is desirous of disposing of its unsold treasury stock within the shortest possible time,\nand that VanHummell had agreed to subscribe for and purchase the unsold stock of the company for the purpose of resale, said subscriptions to be made from time to time as sales are made. The agreement then provides:\u2014\n(1) That the said Casualty Company so long as it has unsold treasury stock shall fill all orders for stock received by or through said VanHummell at the agreed price of $15 per share, said stock to be sold at $20 per share;\n(2) That the said VanHummell is to pay for the stock so ordered with the proceeds of sales made by him or by his agency * * *\n(3) That this contract is to continue in full force and effect so long as the said company has unsold treasury stock with which to fill the orders presented by the said second party (VanHummell) or his agents.\nThe certificate issued to VanHummell was in a special form and certified him to be the owner of 30,000 shares \"subject to payment in cash.\" As pointed out by the learned trial judge there is no covenant by VanHummell to pay for the shares. The agreement is made upon the basis that, although the 30,000 shares put in VanHummell's name constituted its entire unsold stock, the company would still have unsold stock. It provides that out of its unsold stock the company will fill orders for stock received by or through VanHummell and it is only for such stock as he sells for the company that he agrees to pay anything to it. The price at which he is to dispose of the stock is fixed. The certificate issued makes his ownership conditional on payment. The obvious purpose of the transaction was, for some undisclosed reason, to place the company's treasury stock in the name of VanHummell, and to have him dispose of so much of it as he could as the company's agent. The company undertook to honour his orders for shares out of those so held by him and it was understood that it would take off his hands whatever might not be sold, under the provision enabling it to forfeit for non-payment at the end of a year. This was in fact done. Upon the incomplete evidence before us it is sufficiently clear that this was the substance of the arrangement between the company and VanHummell. However irregular the transaction may have been, and although, as between himself and the company's creditors on liquidation, VanHummell might be held to be a contributory in respect of the entire 30,000 shares, as between him and the company, it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that he had no beneficial interest in the stock, that he could neither be compelled to pay for, nor could he insist on holding as his own, any of the shares which he had not sold. Under these circumstances, while the shares which the plaintiff received may have been nominally VanHummell's, they were in reality and in substance the company's treasury stock. If, therefore, the plaintiff should be allowed now to put forward the new ground of claim devised by the ingenuity of counsel representing him in this court, possibly because he regarded the grounds on which the action was launched as of very doubtful value, he should not, in my opinion, succeed upon it. He has got in substance that which he contracted for and he should not be allowed to recover back what he paid for it.\nI would for these reasons allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge in so far as it dismissed this action as against the defendant company with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Notwithstanding the many legal questions argued, I think if we can find, as the Court of Appeal did, that in fact there was a representation made to respondent at or before the time of his making the application for stock, to which I will presently refer at length, that the appellant company would by first of November following have begun business in Vancouver, the problems involved are not difficult of solution.\nThe company was incorporated in 1909 in the State of Washington for the purpose, as its name indi- cates, of engaging in the business of casualty insurance.\nOn the solicitation of appellant, VanHummell, whose relations to the company will presently appear, the respondent made in writing on the 26th of August, 1910, an application to the company for two hundred and fifty shares of its capital stock.\nThe making of this application appears in said writing as follows:\u2014\nSaid stock being of the par value of ten dollars ($10.00) per share. I agree to pay the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00) per share for said stock, it being understood and agreed that the excess amount over and above the par value thereof is to be used for the purpose of securing subscriptions and perfecting the organization of said company, and for the creation of a surplus. Payable on demand.\nAll amounts must be paid by check, draft or money order made payable to the company.\nAt the same time he got a letter addressed to him as follows:\u2014\nDear Sir,\nThe International Casualty Company of Spokane, in consideration of your subscription for $5,000.00 of the Capital Stock of said Company, does hereby appoint you (said Dr. J. W. Thomson) the company's sole resident physician for the City of Vancouver.\nThis agreement to be ratified by the President of the Company, and if not so ratified your application for stock, together with checks and notes to be returned to you.\nH. VANHUMMELL,\nFor International Casualty Co.\nHe gave them, at same meeting as he thinks (but later according to VanHummell), two cheques together amounting to $750 payable to the company and twenty notes, each, except the last, for two hundred dollars, and the last for two hundred and fifty dollars, made payable in twenty successive monthly payments to VanHummell or order. He got therefor the following receipt:\u2014 INTERNATIONAL CASUALTY COMPANY,\nSpokane, Washington.\nCapital Stock, $1,000,000.00.\nRECEIVED of J. W. Thomson Five thousand cash, and notes * * * Dollars in full payment for 250 shares of the Capital Stock of the International Casualty Company of Spokane, Washington.\nINTERNATIONAL CASUALTY CO.,\nPer H. VanHummell.\n$5,000.00.\nIn evidence he speaks as follows:\u2014\nMr. Deacon: Q. Whose shares were you buying?\nA.\u2014I understood it was treasury stock of the International Casualty Company, the receipt was signed\u2014\u2014\nQ.\u2014On what ground did you understand that?\nA.\u2014I understood from VanHummell he was the agent selling stock for the company, and I asked him what authority he had to sell stock for the company, and he told me he was vice-president of the company, and, as near as I can remember, he showed me a letter authorizing him to sell stock for the company.\nCourt: Did he tell you he was selling stock for the company?\nA.\u2014Yes, sir, and the receipt I received was a printed form, signed by the International Casualty Company, per VanHummell.\n*****\nMr. Deacon: Q.\u2014You didn't know that they were VanHummell's shares?\nA.\u2014I heard nothing to that effect whatever.\nThe argument is put forward, notwithstanding said documents, that the transaction was one between VanHummell and the respondent in respect of shares which had been allotted by the company to VanHummell by what he calls an underwriting agreement.\nHe, however, with commendable frankness, in his examination for discovery, states the matter thus:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Now you see this receipt is signed by the International Casualty Company. Did you tell Dr. Thomson that they were your own shares that you were selling him?\nA.\u2014No.\n*****\nQ.\u2014What did you tell him about the shares?\nA.\u2014Nothing at all, as to whose or what shares they were.\nQ.\u2014You gave him a receipt signed by the International Casualty Company per H. VanHummell? A.\u2014As agent.\nQ.\u2014There is no mention of agent on this receipt?\nA.\u2014That was what he understood and what I understood.\nQ. That you were signing as agent for the company?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Was anything said in the course of the conversation which would lead him to believe that the shares which you were selling him were your own?\nA.\u2014No; nothing at all.\nQ.\u2014So he had no reason whatever to believe that the shares were not the treasury shares of the company?\nA.\u2014I cannot say what he thought or understood about the matter because there was no discussion regarding that point.\nQ.\u2014Had he any reason that you know of to suspect that these shares were not the treasury shares of the company?\nA.\u2014None that I know of.\nHe repeats this in substance in his examination taken under commission.\nThe above nomination of respondent by VanHummell was sent to the head\u2014office of the company in Spokane and returned with the written approval of the president of the company signed by him at the foot thereof.\nCuriously enough neither VanHummell nor respondent are very positive as to when or how it was returned. The former seems to think it came back to him before he got the cheques or notes above referred to. The latter thinks it came to him by mail.\nIf, as seems quite probable from the care respondent took to make sure of his appointment as the basis of his whole dealing, VanHummell is right, then the circumstance of the notes being made payable to him is easily explained, if, indeed, needing any explanation.\nThe company set up in its defence that it had, in short, nothing to do with the transactions beyond appointing respondent as its local physician; that the stock was VanHummell's and the transaction his own. This has been in fact its attitude throughout, though not distinctly pleaded affirmatively. Its denial of plaintiff's (now respondent's) statement of claim enabled it to make such contention. The effort to make the transaction wear that appearance and to carry it out in ways inconsistent with the documents, do not agree very well with what straightforward dealing required.\nThe truth seems accurately stated in the above evidence of both those who ought to know; the written parts of the agreement in question here bear that out; the cheques of respondent pursuant thereto were made payable to the company and received by it; and the agreement between the company and VanHummell, relied upon to displace all that, was hidden from the respondent and was nothing more or less than a round-about method of constituting him the agent of the company and giving him such terms of commission as it could not well do to a mere purchaser.\nThe power thus given was capable of great abuse and if the company adopted that method of creating agents so that it might be in a position to repudiate them and their acts, when leading to inconvenient results, it may as well understand such notions cannot avail anything herein.\nThe notes given in this case by respondent to VanHummell ought, in light of the foregoing, to have gone directly to the company as, no doubt, was intended by respondent, though a different purpose may have been in the minds of the company's officers.\nVanHummell explains that in some other cases this was in truth what was done with such notes. I infer it was well understood between him and the company that either of them might use them and discount them as occasion and opportunity might best promote the interests of the company, so long as it got three\u2014fourths and VanHummell one-fourth of the proceeds.\nI, however, suspect there was another purpose possibly arising from a necessity to show cash subscriptions instead of notes as a payment for shares.\nAn improper use of the company's shares was thus possible and in this case was the direct result of the methods of doing business which the company thus adopted.\nThe respondent's notes were used by VanHummell at the bank to obtain the money wherewith to pay the company for its shares taken out of VanHummell's allotment instead of from the treasury and issued as if for the respondent and then put up as collateral security at the bank along with the same notes that represented their purchase from the company.\nThese were acts which the company could not, I imagine, do directly, and unless duly provided for by its charter powers, which is improbable, were improper methods.\nAll these contrivances for whatever purpose were, if not ultra vires the company, at least beyond the scope and purpose of the plain contract entered into between the company and respondent, which was clearly intended to have been the foundation for a purchase from it of its treasury stock and to have remained executory instead of being apparently executed in ignorance of respondent and to his detriment in the way it was.\nThe company must herein be treated as owner of these notes and in all else as if the agreement had proceeded in the regular way it manifestly was intended should have been done.\nI have no difficulty, therefore, in holding, as did the Court of Appeal, that the transaction was between the company and respondent, and I have no further difficulty in holding that the company, under the circumstances, is bound by any material representations or misrepresentations made by VanHummell in the course of the negotiations inducing respondent to enter into the contract, and it must answer for the legal consequences thereof.\nAny difficulty in the case seems to have arisen from the gravity in form of the charges of misrepresentation, so called, inducing the contract.\nIt seems to me as if the learned trial judge was so oppressed by the nature of the charges that he shrank from believing and finding as fact that the representations had been made as sworn to by the respondent and another witness, yet seems to have no hesitation in believing the same two witnesses as against VanHummell regarding the agreement for cancellation or the taking back by VanHummell of the shares.\nIn this latter instance he finds corroboration in the circumstances.\nWith great respect it seems to me that those same circumstances he relies upon reflect as strong light upon and give as much strength to the first contention set up by the respondent as to this found in his favour by the learned judge. And added thereto in support of said first contention, which is the real matter in dispute herein, are the peculiar circumstances I am about to advert to.\nThe respondent says, and is corroborated by Mr. Wilmot, his witness (and both are reported by the learned trial judge as appearing credible) that, at the bargain which the above\u2014mentioned documents set forth, it was distinctly stated that the company would likely be ready for business in Vancouver by the first of October, but absolutely sure to begin by the first of November, 1910.\nI see nothing improbable in supposing such a statement might be made by VanHummell. And if made I see no reason why the company should not be bound by it when a determination has to be reached relative to the said contract and the inducements leading thereto and the bearing of statement thereon, either as representation or as misrepresentation, has to be considered.\nOn the contrary, it seems, from the nature of the business in hand, the terms made relative to the payments, and the facts (which all agree were mentioned), as to some doctors elsewhere earning $1,500 to $2,500 a year from such positions as the respondent was bargaining for, to be inherently a thing one should expect to be discussed, just as respondent and Wilmot say it was discussed.\nI agree, therefore, with the Court of Appeal in accepting the version of the respondent, and any uncertainty I have is as to whether or not the representation I so find to have been made should be classed as a misrepresentation as the learned trial judge thought, if in fact made and found untrue, it should be held, or as a condition of the contract. It may well have been both. It clearly was a very material part of the consideration inducing respondent to act and being so I do not think we need go further.\nI really cannot say that it makes much practical difference which view is taken. Neither the company nor VanHummell were as careful to show respondent all they meant, or as artless as they might have been.\nYet a perusal of VanHummell's evidence does not impress me unfavourably as to his veracity, though I am holding he is in error in his recollection and the respondent right.\nIt is not, perhaps, a case of gross fraud or deceit. It is rather a case of undue want of care in making the statement.\nNo reasonable man could well suppose that negotiations for a license begun in July should not end successfully by the first of November, if properly pressed. The thing seemed so probable that VanHummell was likely to assert as certainty if asked. At the same time he should have been able to show on what ground he founded his belief if he wanted to escape the suspicion of misrepresentation. His single answer is he never said so. I prefer to accept re-spondent's version corroborated as it is.\nI think he and the company were called on by the prima facie case made to show they had, and how they had, been misled after taking due care to make such representations, or abide by the legal result flowing from a misrepresentation whether wilful or looked upon as recklessly made.\nBut passing that I think it must be taken, as between the parties now in issue in this appeal, as a condition of the contract, and clearly in any case a material part of the consideration inducing it, and entitling respondent to rescission of the contract in the executory condition it is found when stripped of the false appearances already shown it is made to wear by means of improper contrivances.\nOne objection is that it is not in the written con- tract, and, therefore, is not credible. I do not think this can avail the appellant under the circumstances.\nThe other is that it is a variation of the written contract. I do not think so. It varied nothing. The contract was not necessarily all in writing, nor did it pretend to be so. Under the circumstances an oral term or condition not contradictory or varying that written might be shown to exist or to have been a material inducement as part of the consideration.\nI, moreover, think there always was in this peculiar contract an implication that the business should be carried on within a reasonable time at least, and this verbal part of the contract may be well held good for fixing as between the parties what might be termed reasonable.\nSuppose the company after assenting to this contract had decided never to enter the field of business contemplated, could it be said it might yet hold the respondent bound?\nI do not think so. It seems impossible to believe that such a defiance of the clear understanding in writing upon which the parties proceeded could be so tolerated in law.\nIt is clear to my mind that the respondent had a right when this suit was entered, in April, 1911, to have treated the reasonable time allowed even by implication as ended, unless some better reason shown than the appellants have suggested.\nAnd in proof there has been nothing offered to justify the delay. Glittering generalities can hardly be permitted to take the place of substantial details of fact to enable a court to judge for itself.\nThere is a curious piece of evidence not observed, or at all events remarked upon, at the argument. It is as follows:\u2014\nHe then made the excuse that there was certain red tape, in regard to the State Insurance Commission that had to be gone through with, that he was not aware of when he promised the return of the cash and notes. He said that that sometimes took as long as 30 days and as soon as the red tape was gone through with, the money and notes would be returned to me.\nThe company's president offered no explanation of this in his evidence given later, yet it seems to me suggestive of a great many things that lay in the path of getting licenses issued. Did the very method I have adverted to find a rebuke and form a difficulty? He does in effect testify the company could not traffic in its own stock.\nThe time for earning money by virtue of the contract which the respondent had a right to expect had been so long passed as to render it inequitable to hold him longer in suspense, especially seeing the terms of payment on his part had been, in a measure, made to be met by part of such earnings.\nI think the appeal of the company should be dismissed with costs.\nThe action was dismissed by the Court of Appeal as against VanHummell. Respondent has acquiesced in that judgment and thus there can be nothing involved in VanHummell's appeal but a question of costs.\nThis court has repeatedly refused to hear any appeal involving only a question of costs.\nSchlomann v. Dowker[3] seems exactly in point, even if we have jurisdiction. Moir v. Village of Huntingdon[4] is likewise. There the court said:\u2014\nThe court will not entertain an appeal from any judgment for the purpose of deciding a mere question of costs. No authority has been cited to the contrary. It is suggested that by reason of a recent statute requiring in the Court of Appeal that costs of appeal should, except in specified cases of which this is not one, follow the event, therefore, the appellant has been improperly deprived of a statutory right. That can create no new right of appeal here. Besides there is nothing to show that the statute in question was brought to the notice of the Court of Appeal and that thus an exceptional case has arisen to which it might not be proper to apply the settled jurisprudence of the court even where an appeal might lie, but has by virtue of such jurisprudence been denied a hearing.\nThen, if the appeal had to be considered on its merits and we had to determine what the proper judgment was in the court below as basis of an inference, I should say that the court below erred in dismissing the action as against VanHummell. The very cases cited in that regard here and below, if closely examined and applied to the peculiar facts herein, should lead to the conclusion that he was improvidently dismissed.\nIt was assumed below that, unless VanHummell was guilty of deliberate misrepresentation, he was not a necessary party and hence entitled to be dismissed. He was, unless previously instructed by the company to do so in such cases, guilty of most reprehensible conduct in suppressing the respondent's application instead of filing it with the company and thus inducing the company to act as if the application had never existed and to found its issue of shares to respondent on the hidden contract between him (VanHummell) and the company instead of on this respondent's said application. Even if this was done with the connive- ance of the company it was as regards the respondent an improper thing for him to have done.\nHe took to himself notes which clearly ought to have been taken to the company, and concealed the true situation from respondent. He then used these notes as if his own property and has them yet or subject to his redemption of them from his hypothecation of them so far as unpaid and for that apparent reason if no other as well as foregoing reasons was a proper party and ought to have been held jointly answerable for the surrender of the respondent's notes or due cancellation of same and return of the moneys paid by him.\nThe inference is clear from full consideration of all the facts that the company and VanHummell jointly entered upon a course of dealing that should never have been used towards the respondent.\nI have found his evidence so clearly fastening agency for all he did upon the company that I have had no difficulty in holding it liable, but that is no reason for excusing the appellant VanHummell, or holding he was entitled to be dismissed and hence entitled as of right to his costs either preceding the appeal to the Court of Appeal or costs of such appeal.\nI think he was not entitled to either, and what I have said must answer as my reasons in case the appeal were founded independently of the statute on the rule as to just cause in respect of costs.\nI may refer to section 53 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as sufficient ground besides, or independently of all I have said, for dismissing this appeal and depriving appellant of his costs below and giving costs of his appeal here against him. DUFF J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in an action brought by the respondent, Thomson, for the recovery back of certain sums of money and the cancellation of certain promissory notes paid and given by the respondent to the appellant, VanHummell, (as the proposed purchased price of certain shares in the capital stock of the appellant company upon an application by the respondent to the company for such shares) in which the Court of Appeal held that the respondent was entitled to succeed. I think the appeal ought to be dismissed; first, upon the short ground that the plaintiff's offer to purchase shares (which was an offer to the company and was intended by the plaintiff to form the basis of a contract between him and the company) was never accepted and that no such contractual relation as that contemplated was ever established. The moneys in question and the promissory notes having been received by the appellant, VanHummell, who was the company's agent to receive the same for a purpose which has entirely failed, the plaintiff is entitled to recover them back.\nThe first point is that no contract was ever concluded between the plaintiff and the company. That fact is undisputed. It was the ground upon which the company mainly based its defence at the trial. On that fact they relied in the Court of Appeal (as the judgment of the Chief Justice shows) and in this court Mr. Anglin, who appeared on behalf of the company, took the same position both orally and in his factum.\nThe contract was not a contract between the company and the plaintiff but between VanHummell and the plaintiff.\nThe contract was not between the plaintiff and the company but between the plaintiff and VanHummell personally. Whatever may have been the conception of the parties or any of them in this connection the facts appear to be that VanHummell sold for himself shares which he had bought or had a right to buy from the company.\nI shall presently discuss the question whether the contention that the plaintiff entered into a contract with VanHummell can be sustained. In the meantime I am emphasizing the point that, at the trial and every subsequent stage of the litigation, the company has deliberately taken the position that it never entered into a contract with Thomson in respect of the sale or allotment of any of its shares and never gave VanHummell any authority to enter into any such contract on its behalf.\nIt was in May, 1911, that the company entered into its arrangement with VanHummell. The company desired to sell its unsold shares. An agreement was made with VanHummell in which it was recited that VanHummell had\nagreed to subscribe for and purchase the unsold stock of the company for the purpose of re-sale, said subscriptions to be made from time to time as sales are made.\nThe subscription price was fixed at $15 per share and it was provided that VanHummell should sell the shares at $20 per share. Pursuant to this agreement, on the same day, VanHummell applied to the company to have allotted to him 30,000 shares at the price of $15 per share. That application, as was stated by Ritter, the president of the company, in his evidence given on discovery, was accepted by the company and the shares applied for were allotted to VanHummell. They were allotted, however, subject to the condition expressed in a special share certificate which is in evidence, bearing the same date as the application, that none of the shares comprised in the allotment should be transferable except on the payment of the subscription price of $15 per share. The plan of the company is plainly disclosed by these documents and the oral evidence. The intention was that the company should not enter into contractual relations with the ultimate purchasers of the shares. VanHummell was to sell shares allotted to him pursuant to his agreement with the company and he was to sell them at the price of $20 per share. This sum of $20 per share was not intended to pass through VanHummell's hands as agent of the company, but as the seller of shares which either belonged to him or which he was entitled to have allotted to him on his own account. From the point of view of the company VanHummell was to be the subscriber and the only subscriber. What the object of the company was in proceeding by this method is not expressly stated: but that this was the nature of the arrangement as the company intended it to go into effect is not open to dispute. As between the company and VanHummell this design was strictly carried out. It is stated both by Ritter and by VanHummell, whose evidence was put in by the company, that all shares sold by VanHummell were transferred at his request from shares which had already been allotted to him under the terms of this agreement with the company. It is stated by both of them that the practice was for VanHummell to pay the company for shares so transferred, but looking in turn for personal reimbursement to the persons to whom he had sold them. This course was observed in the transaction with the plaintiff. VanHummell applied to have the requisite number of shares transferred to Thomson from those standing in his name under the allotment already referred to, and he paid for them in full at the subscription price of $15 per share, and the shares were accordingly transferred. The company, according to Ritter's evidence, had no further concern in the matter. VanHummell's recourse was against Thomson and against him alone.\nThe understanding between the company and VanHummell then was perfectly clear and precise, that VanHummell, while representing himself as the company's agent to take subscriptions for shares, was to transfer to subscribers shares that had been already allotted to him under his own subscription contract. But the transaction, as it presented itself to the ultimate purchaser with whom VanHummell was dealing, wore a very different aspect. To him VanHummell, represented himself as the agent of the company to receive subscriptions addressed to the company and to receive also on behalf of the company the subscription price of $20 a share. To the subscriber dealing with VanHummell the form of subscription placed before him was not merely an application to the company for shares, but an application setting forth the terms of what, if the proposal should be accepted by the company, would become a contract between him and the company in relation to the disposition by the company of the subscriber's contribution to the company's capital. One of the terms of the application is as follows:\u2014\nI agree to pay the sum of $20 per share for the said stock, it being understood and agreed that the excess amount over and above the par value thereof is to be used for the purpose of securing subscriptions and perfecting the organization of the said company and for the creation of a surplus.\nThe contract proposed by the subscriber was, in a word, to involve the obligation on the part of the com- pany to carry out this undertaking. The subscriber having placed this proposal in the hands of VanHummell, together with the amount he had agreed to pay, afterwards received a share certificate which he regarded as an acceptance of this proposal. The respondent's proposal was never presented to anybody who had authority in fact on behalf of the company to accept it. Nobody had authority in fact to enter into such a contract on behalf of the company with Thomson. The sum of $20 per share paid by Thomson according to his belief into the coffers of the company was never intended by the company to pass through the hands of anybody who should be accountable for it as an officer of the company; and it was of the essence of the company's plan that, while VanHummell represented himself as the company's agent to obtain subscriptions, the company itself should not enter into any agreement which would make it accountable for the disbursement of the subscription price to any purchaser of shares under a subscription contract.\nIn fact, then, there was no contract between the plaintiff and the company. It does not follow, of course, that the plaintiff might not have been in a position to show that the company was estopped from denying the existence of such a contract. But that does not prevent the plaintiff himself from setting up the true facts if he chooses to rely upon the facts.\nThe respondent is entitled to say \"you permitted VanHummell to represent himself as your agent to receive on your behalf proposals for contracts to be entered into with you together with moneys payable to you by the terms of those proposals. I acted on the belief that he was your agent in fact for those pur- poses. When I seek to hold you responsible for the representations upon the faith of which my subscription was given, you declare that my proposal was never in fact accepted by you, that you never had any intention of accepting it, and that you have no contract in fact with me.\" He is entitled to say that, and he is entitled on discovery of these facts to insist that the moneys and securities which were handed to VanHummell for a particular purpose, and which pursuant to the arrangement between VanHummell and the company had been applied to another purpose should be restored to him. There are two points which perhaps call for some observation. The first point is this: It may be suggested that in substance the plaintiff has got what he expected to get. That, in a word, it was immaterial to him whether a contract was or was not in fact formed between him and the company, so long as he got shares in the International Casualty Company, and, as might perhaps be added, so long as the company by its conduct was estopped from denying that it had entered into such a contract. I do not think there is any substance in this. The evidence demonstrates and the company by its officials and its counsel in effect avow, that the persons having the charge of the company's affairs concocted this scheme with VanHummell which I have described, one object of which certainly was to conceal from persons applying for shares the fact that out of the sum of $20 per share which they believed themselves to be paying into the coffers of the company and for the application of which the company was directly contracting with them, 25% was to be intercepted before any part of it reached the hands of the company; and that this part of the subscription price was not to pass into the hands of any officer of the company who should be accountable for it as such. It was, I say, obviously, in part at all events, to conceal this state of facts from the subscribers that this scheme was designed. It involved, of course, deception. It was, in plain words, a fraud upon the subscribers. And it will not do for those who conceived and carried out that fraud to escape the consequences of it by saying \"now you have found us out, the law will compel us to give effect to the transaction according to your conception of it.\" Or, in other words, \"we elect to be bound by the transaction as you conceived it.\" The authors of such a fraud are not entitled to any such privilege.\nThe other point is this:\u2014It is now suggested that this ground upon which I think the plaintiff was entitled to proceed was not put forward at the trial, and the plaintiff ought not to be permitted now to rely upon it. This also appears to be without substance. The plaintiff has a judgment in his favour and if the record discloses grounds upon which that judgment can justly be supported it is our duty to give effect to them even although those grounds were not relied upon at any stage of the proceedings in the courts below. The judgment, of course, could not be justly supported upon grounds relied on for the first time in this court if there were any danger of this court being led into a mistaken conclusion by reason of not being informed of all the relevant facts, but in the absence of any such danger it would be the merest pedantry to reverse a judgment, which according to the record is the judgment that ought to have been pronounced by the court below, merely because counsel for the party who has succeeded did not in the court below put his case in the strongest way. I have already pointed out that all the facts necessary to form a complete foundation for the plaintiff's title to relief upon the ground I have stated have either been deliberately put forward by the company as a part of its case or are proved irresistibly. It is a mistake, however, to suppose that this point was not taken in the court below. The plaintiff made it a part of his case both in the cross-examination of VanHummell and in the examination of Thomson to show that VanHummell represented to Thomson that the shares with which VanHummell was dealing were \"treasury\" shares. The observations of the learned trial judge indicated that the bearing of this evidence was present to his mind and I see no reason to believe that the effect of it was not dwelt on both at the trial and in the Court of Appeal.\nThis would be a sufficient ground for dismissing the appeal. There is, however, another ground on which the respondent based his claim to relief and upon which I think he is entitled to succeed. The respondent alleges that for the purpose of procuring his subscription VanHummell, on the day on which the subscription was given as well as before that, told him in answer to his inquiry that the appellant company would probably commence business before the 1st of October, and that it would certainly commence business before the 1st of November. The company did not in point of fact commence business until the 1st of June in the following year; and if this statement of VanHummell's was made with the object of inducing the respondent to subscribe for shares by creating in Thomson's mind a belief that such was VanHummell's real opinion based upon his know- ledge as an officer of the company, and if such a belief was thereby created and operated as a material inducement in bringing about Thomson's decision to subscribe, and if in fact VanHummell did not believe that the company would commence business as early as the 1st of November, or if he had no opinion or belief on the subject, that is to say, no real belief, then there can be no doubt the respondent is entitled to recover back the notes and money delivered and paid to VanHummell. The first question is: Did VanHummell tell the respondent that the company would certainly commence business not later than the 1st of November in Vancouver? On this point the evidence of the respondent and one Wilmot is explicit. That evidence was accepted by the Court of Appeal. I do not understand the learned trial judge to have any doubt upon the point that the statement was made as reported by the respondent; but he thinks the effect of the statement was qualified by the further statement that it would be necessary to obtain a licence from the Insurance Department in Ottawa and that the statement was subject to the condition that such licence should be obtained before the date mentioned. It is quite true, of course, that this statement of VanHummell's was a statement as to something which was to happen in the future, and that being so, the respondent must have understood VanHummell to be only giving an opinion which might be falsified in the event. But I see no reason to doubt that the respondent was entitled to regard it, and did regard it, as a positive assurance by VanHummell, who represented himself to be the vice-president of the company, that the necessary licence would be procured and the company established in Vancouver and in operation before the 1st of November. Then: Was the assurance given with the object of inducing the respondent to subscribe for shares? About that there is little room for doubt. As the learned trial judge mentions, there is uncontradicted evidence and there seems no reason for disbelieving it, showing that VanHummell proceeded first to ascertain how much ready money the respondent had and then proceeded to arrange the transaction upon terms likely to induce the respondent to subscribe. But the main inducement was that the respondent, who had been for a comparatively short time practising his profession in Vancouver, was to be appointed the resident physician of the company. As VanHummell says he urged upon the respondent the advantage of such a connection, and as the respondent says, no doubt truly, the terms of payment were so arranged as to give some prospect that the instalments of the subscription price could be made from time to time out of fees earned through his connection with the company. The date at which the company should commence actively to carry on business in Vancouver was, therefore, of the very first importance and the object of the assurance is perfectly clear. Then: Was this assurance a material inducement in bringing the mind of the respondent to assent to VanHummell's proposal? I think there is no room for doubt that it was. There can be no doubt that the main inducement operating on the mind of the respondent was the undertaking given to him to appoint him a resident physician of the company. The virtue of that undertaking, of course, rested in the assumption that the company was to carry on business in Vancouver actively, and that the judgment of the respondent should not have been influenced by the probable date when active business was to commence is a supposition most difficult to accept. Having regard to the terms of payment of the subscription price one might almost consider it impossible to suppose that it would not be a most material consideration. The evidence of Thomson is explicit to the effect that the assurance did operate on his mind as one of the principal inducements and the learned judge appears to accept the statement of Thomson and the witness Wilmot that, at an interview which took place in October between Thomson and VanHummell at which Wilmot was present, Thomson charged VanHummell with having misled him with respect to the date on which it was expected that the company was to commence business. The learned trial judge seems to say that at that time the respondent honestly believed he had been so misled. That, of course, is strong corroboration of the respondent's statement that he was misled. The view of the learned trial judge appears to be that because the respondent did not insist upon this arrangement being inserted in the written contract between him and the company is conclusive against him on the question as to whether it operated on his mind as the \"essential\" inducement. If the assurance was relied upon as a condition or warranty I think the learned judge's reasoning would be unanswerable to say nothing of difficulties in point of law which such a contention would raise. But, if the assurance involved a fraudulent representation as to the state of VanHummell's opinion on the point, then it is sufficient that that representation should have been one of the inducements affecting Thomson's mind; and I think VanHummell succeeded in his purpose of producing in the mind of the respondent such a degree of certainty that the company's business would be in operation in Vancouver within the two months at the very most, that it never occurred to him to ask for anything in the nature of a written undertaking upon the subject. Consider the situation. When the respondent having finally decided to take shares in the company comes to sign his application and give his cheque he is presented with a formal appointment in writing as resident physician in Vancouver and he insists on having that confirmed by the president of the company as a condition of his subscription. Can it be supposed, if the possibility had suggested itself to his mind of the company not commencing business for nine months, that he would have gone on with the transaction in the form in which he actually did enter into it? I think it is impossible to suppose he would.\nThe last point is: Were these assurances fraudulent? I think the evidence justifies the conclusion that VanHummell knew he was not in a position to form any belief or opinion upon the point as to when the company would be ready to start business in Vancouver of such a character as could reasonably be regarded as forming a ground for action in any matter of business. As to the probability of the company commencing business in Vancouver as early as the 1st of November, he either did not believe that it would be in a position to do so or he had no actual belief or opinion upon the point at all. That is shown very clearly by his own evidence. VanHummell, indeed, does not deny that he had no ground whatever for making any such statement as that attributed to him. His defence is that he did not make the statement. Unfortunately there is too much reason to think that on other points also he was not unwilling to deceive the respondent in order to induce him to become a subscriber. The respondent, for example, says he told him he was vice-president of the company, which was untrue. The respondent also says that VanHummell stated the shares were \"treasury\" shares. VanHummell admits that he regarded these shares as his own, but denies he made the statement. With regard to all these matters he was given to understand in the clearest way on examination for discovery that his honesty would be attacked. Yet he does not appear at the trial and there is no explanation of his absence. The defence relied upon at the trial by the company in itself involved a grave imputation against the good faith of VanHummell. The defence was, as I have pointed out already, that VanHummell had no authority to act as the agent of the company in the sale of its shares, and that he represented himself as the company's agent is indisputable. At the time of the trial when this defence was set up VanHummell was vice-president of the company; and in face of all this he does not appear at the trial in person. All these circumstances, I think, powerfully supported the inference that VanHummell and the company had few scruples, if any, respecting the means they adopted in order to procure subscriptions.\nI should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nANGLIN J.

VII. c. 7, ss. 139, 166, 168.\nThe \"Companies Act\" (B.C.) .10 Edw. VII., ch. 7, secs. 139, 166, 168, prohibits companies incorporated otherwise than under the laws of British Columbia carrying on without registration or license in the province any part of their business; penalties are provided for doing so without provincial registration or licence; and they are denied the right of maintaining actions, suits or proceedings in the courts of the province in respect of any contract made in whole or in part within the province in the course of or in connection with any business carried on contrary to the provisions of the Act. The appellant company, incorporated under the Dominion \"Companies Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 79, has its head-office in Winnipeg, Man., and did not become licensed under the B.C. \"Companies Act.\" In February, 1911, the company entered into an agreement with A., who is domiciled in British Columbia, giving him the exclusive right to sell their goods in British Columbia in pursuance of which he ordered goods from the company to be shipped from Winnipeg to him, f.o.b. Calgary, Alta., assuming all risk and charges himself from that point to Elko, B.C., where the goods were to be received and sold by him. He gave the company his promissory notes, dated at Winnipeg, for the price of these goods, some of the notes being actually signed by him at Elko. In an action by the company to recover the amount of these notes the trial judge held that the action was barred by the statute and could not be maintained by the company in any court in the Province of British Columbia. On an appeal, per saltum, to the Supreme Court of Canada the judgment appealed from (8 D.L.R. 65; 2 West. W.R. 1013; 22 W.L.R. 243) was reversed, and it was Held, per FitzpatrickC.J. and Davies, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., that the transactions which had taken place between the company and A. did not constitute the carrying on of business by the company in the Province of British Columbia within the meaning of the B.C. \"Companies Act\" and, therefore, the disabilities imposed by that statute could have no effect in respect of the right of the company to recover the amount claimed in the action in the provincial court.\nPer Idington J.\u2014As the exclusive jurisdiction in respect of bills of exchange and promissory notes has been assigned to the Parliament of Canada, under item 18 of section 91 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" the word \"contract\" as used in section 166 of the B.C. \"Companies Act,\" 10 Edw. VII., ch. 7, cannot be considered as having any application to promissory notes; the plaintiffs' right of action in the provincial court was, therefore, not barred by the provincial statute.\nAPPEAL, per saltum, (by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada), from the judgment of Murphy J., at the trial in the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action was commenced on 1st March, 1912, and the questions at issue were settled in a special case which, after reciting the claim for the amount of four promissory notes with interest ($3,315.85), given for the price of the goods shipped as mentioned in the head\u2014note, proceeded as follows:\u2014\n\"1. The plaintiff is a company incorporated by letters patent * * * duly issued by the Secretary of State of Canada under the authority of the 'Companies Act' of Canada (R.S.C., ch. 79) giving power amongst other things to carry on throughout Canada the business of dealers in agricultural implements, carriages and wagons and machinery and a general agency, commission and mercantile business.\n\"2. The head-office of the plaintiff is at Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba.\n\"3. The defendant, Agnew, is a merchant residing at Elko, in the Province of British Columbia, and carrying on at that place the business of a general merchant.\n\"4. On 18th February, 1911, at the City of Winnipeg, the defendant, Agnew, entered into a contract * * * with the plaintiff under which contract the defendant was given the exclusive right for a certain territory in British Columbia to sell certain of the plaintiff's products.\n\"5. In pursuance of the contract the defendant ordered at different dates from the plaintiff to be shipped to the defendant f.o.b. Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, certain goods, for which goods the defendant gave promissory notes.\n\"6. The following notes represent goods ordered by the defendant at Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, namely: The promissory note for $1,082.25, dated the 20th May, 1911, represents goods ordered by the defendant in person at Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, which order was filled by the plaintiff by shipping the said goods in Winnipeg to the defendant at Elko aforesaid. The remainder of the promissory notes represent goods ordered by the defendant by post, by way of letters posted at Elko aforesaid, directed to the plaintiff at Winnipeg, which said orders were filled by the plaintiff by shipping the said goods to the defendant at Elko aforesaid.\n\"7. The two promissory notes last above mentioned, though dated at Winnipeg were in fact signed by the defendant at Elko in the Province of British Columbia.\n\"8. The plaintiff is not and was not licensed under Part VI. of the 'Companies Act' of British Columbia nor under any other Act of that province.\n\"The questions for the opinion of the court are:\u2014\n\"First: Whether the plaintiff is, in the absence of a licence under Part VI. of the 'Companies Act' of British Columbia (10 Edw. VII. ch. 7), precluded from carrying on business in British Columbia or from maintaining action in respect to any of the claims or notes aforesaid.\n\"Second: Whether the provisions of said Part VI. of the 'Companies Act' are, in so far as they purport to prohibit the plaintiff from carrying on business in the Province of British Columbia and to maintain actions in the courts of the said province, intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia.\n\"If the court shall answer each of the above questions in the negative, as to all of the items comprised in the claim of the plaintiff, then judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $3,315.85, together with interest at the rate of five per cent from the date of the writ in this action until the entry of judgment and costs of action to be taxed.\n\"If the court shall answer each of the above questions in the negative, as to the transactions and notes which represent the goods ordered by the defendant at Elko, then judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $2,197.90, together with interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum from the date of the writ to the entry of judgment, together with the costs of the action to be taxed.\n\"If the court shall answer each of the above questions in the negative, as to the transactions and notes which represent the goods ordered by the defendant at Winnipeg, then judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $1,117.95, together with interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum from the date of the writ to the entry of judgment, together with the costs of the action to be taxed.\n\"If the court shall answer the above questions in any other way than as above indicated judgment shall be pronounced in accordance with the effect and intent of such answers as may be given by the court or as the court may direct.\"\nThe following conditions governing shipments were made part of the contract referred to in the statement of the special case.\n\"The subscribers agree as follows:\u2014\n\"1. To accept the goods shipped on arrival as specified for herein, or hereafter, during the life of this agreement, paying the carrying charges thereon, safely housing and keeping free from taxes and all other charges for the company, goods on hand, and insure from loss or damage by fire in a reliable company by policy in the company's name at the subscribers' expense, all goods while in the subscribers' custody, and all goods shipped hereafter shall be subject to the same conditions as those herein specified for.\n\"2. That the said goods shall be at the risk of the subscribers hereto as to damage or destruction from any cause from the time of shipment until all oblige- tions given therefor have been satisfied, and the subscribers hereto will fulfil and carry out the covenants and agreements herein contained and satisfy all obligations given therefor with interest, notwithstanding that the said goods may become damaged or destroyed while in the possession of the subscribers hereto.\n\"3. That no claims will be made against the company for breakages unless they occur from manifest defects in material. Breakages thus caused during the first season's use of the implement or vehicle will be made good by new parts, which will be charged for when sent and corresponding credit will be made, only on return of the defective parts to the company, charges prepaid, and the carrying charges on the parts so replaced shall be paid by the subscribers hereto.\n\"4. That no claims for damages will be made against the company for delay in shipments for any cause whatever.\n\"5. That a clear shipping receipt for goods shipped shall relieve the company of all responsibility and place the same with the carriers.\n\"6. That the proceeds of all goods shipped by the company pursuant to this agreement, or which may hereafter be shipped by them, shall be and remain the absolute property of the company, and shall be held by the subscribers hereto in trust for them until payment in full is made to the company of all obligations under this agreement, and the said company shall not rely only on the personal liability of the shareholders hereto in respect hereof.\n\"7. That all goods shipped under this agreement are to be sold by the subscribers hereto at the prices and on the terms specified in the price list furnished by the company, either for cash or on lien notes to be taken on the form of and drawn to the order of the company when so requested, which notes must be taken by the subscribers hereto at the time of the delivery of the goods, and promptly forwarded to the company together with cash received; and upon payment in full of all obligations in respect hereof to the company under this agreement, all notes so taken in the name of the company shall be transferred by them back to the subscribers hereto, without recourse to the company.\n\"8. That the property and the title to all goods and the proceeds thereof shipped by the company as in this order provided, or which may be subsequently shipped by the company, shall remain in the company and shall not pass from them until all obligations given therefor shall have been satisfied; but the subscribers hereto shall have the right to the possession of same until default in payment of any note or notes or other obligations given to the company for all goods shipped. Upon default in payment, the whole of the amount remaining unpaid, and all obligations given therefor, shall, notwithstanding deferred times of payment mentioned in such obligations, become due and payable as cash forthwith, and the subscribers hereto covenant with the company to pay the same on demand, and in default of payment of all obligations given therefor, the company may resume possession of all goods shipped under this agreement, and which may be subsequently shipped by them, which the company may also do if any of the statements made herein are ascertained to be untrue, or if the subscribers hereto become insolvent or if the company consider themselves insecure, or whenever they may deem it necessary to resume possession from any good cause; and this agreement shall not be in any way cancelled or rescinded or otherwise affected thereby, or by any resale of such goods: and in the event of the company resuming possession as aforesaid, the subscribers hereto authorize and empower the company to sell the said goods or any of them on the subscribers' account, by public auction or private sale, and to credit the net proceeds of such resale, after deducting all expenses of resuming possession and reselling same, on the purchase money payable hereunder; and the subscribers hereto shall remain liable for the balance of such purchase money and interest, which shall then be payable forthwith, notwithstanding any deferred time of payment mentioned in any obligations given therefor and shall be collectable from any liens or securities held by the company, or by process of law against the subscribers hereto.\n\"9. To settle by cash and notes bearing the signature of the subscribers hereto promptly the first of the month following date of shipment for all goods shipped, upon the terms as set forth on pages 5, 6, and 7 of this agreement, and at the prices appearing therein opposite each article shipped, with all collection charges, and interest after maturity.\n\"10. That the rate of interest on accounts and notes past due or extended shall be eight per cent. (8%) and indebtedness past due or extended shall be secured by good farmers' paper, as collateral, at the rate of 1.25 of collateral paper for every dollar of past due or extended indebtedness.\n\"11. That in the event of the death of one or all the subscribers hereto, or failure, insolvency, loss by fire, transfer of property, suit filed against me or either (of us), discontinuing business, non-payment of ac- counts or notes covered by this agreement, or in case of preference given other creditors, all obligations arising under this agreement shall become due and payable forthwith, notwithstanding deferred times of payment.\n\"12. That no agreements, conditions or stipulations, verbal or otherwise, save those mentioned in this agreement will be recognized.\n\"13. That the copy of this agreement retained by the company is the original and to be the binding agreement in case the duplicate varies from it in any particular.\n\"14. All implements are shipped subject to the usual manufacturer's warranty to do good work when properly operated, and failing to do this after the subscribers have used their best efforts, they will give immediate notice to the company and allow time for instructions to be given, or, if necessary, the sending of a person to put it in order. Failing then to make the implement do good work, it may be held subject to the order of the company, but under no circumstances will the subscribers return goods without direction from the company. In case this fault is with the subscribers through their failure to follow directions or carelessness in using, the subscribers agree to pay for the time and expense of the person sent to put it in order.\n\"15. All claims for shortages must be made to the company in writing within forty-eight hours from receipt of goods. If a written notification of such claims does not reach the company at their office in Winnipeg within five days, no allowance will be made.\n\"16. No claim shall be allowed for breakage of hardened moulds, shares or landsides, nor for alleged defective material or workmanship, unless the article is produced and the defect is plainly apparent.\n\"17. The company shall not be held responsible for the performance of a plow, after it has been heated or radically changed by any one except from the factory.\"\nAt the trial, in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, it was held, (Murphy J.), that the action was barred by the B.C. \"Companies Act\" and could not be maintained by the company in any court in the Province of British Columbia. On the application of the company leave to appeal per saltum from this judgment was allowed by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChrysler K.C., Wegenast and Caldwell, for the appellant.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nBoth of the questions submitted for the opinion of the court assume that the appellant company, in the circumstances of the transactions in question, carried on in British Columbia \"a part of its business\" within the meaning of the statutory prohibition relied upon\u2014section 166 of the provincial \"Companies Act,\"\u2014or that the notes sued on were contracts made by that company in the province in the course of or in connection with its business. I do not pause to inquire whether the statute is intended to penalize contracts made in the province in connection with the business carried on there by an unlicensed or unregistered extra-provincial company, or whether all contracts made in the province by such companies are uninforceable. The distinction is not material in view of the conclusion I have reached, which is that, on the facts of this case, it does not appear that in taking the notes sued on the company appellant carried on any part of its business in the Province of British Columbia, and, therefore, the assumption on which the questions submitted are predicated is not founded.\nAs stated in the special case, the facts are: An agreement was entered into between the appellants and the respondent, at Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, under which the respondent was given the exclusive right to buy and sell certain of appellants' machines within a defined area of the Province of British Columbia. Under this agreement, the respondent ordered a shipment of goods, which was executed by delivering them f.o.b. at Calgary, in the Province of Alberta; the goods to be, thereafter, at the expense and risk of the purchaser. The consignment was to be paid for by promissory notes, and the notes sued on herein were made in execution of that undertaking. All of the notes are dated at Winnipeg, where the head-office of the company, appellants, is situate, and made payable at Elko, in British Columbia, where two of them were actually signed.\nI cannot see how, assuming the respondent was the agent of the appellants, under the agreement made in Winnipeg, it can be said, on these facts, that the company, appellants, carried on \"any part of its business\" in British Columbia. The most that can be said is that the appellants sold and delivered goods to the respondent in the Province of Alberta to be afterwards re-sold, possibly by the latter, within the Province of British Columbia. The statute is not in- tended to reach those who trade with the province, but those who carry on business within the province, and no act was done by the appellants within the province. If we had to deal with the sale of goods by the respondent to a customer, then the question of carrying on business through an agent in the province might arise.\ncan it be said that the promissory notes, made in the province and payable there, but sent to Winnipeg in payment of a debt due under a purchase made at the latter place is a contract made in the province in the course or in connection with the business of the company? A note executed, made payable and delivered to the payee in the province may be a contract made there by the maker of the note, but it is not a contract made by the appellants who assumed no obligation with respect to it. The notes must be considered in connection with the contract of sale and delivery, which is the consideration for which they were given. That contract was complete by the delivery of the goods beyond the limits of the province, and the notes made by the respondent, in British Columbia, were only made in performance of his obligation to pay the amounts specified in those notes under that contract.\nAs to whether a promissory note is a contract, see Pothier, \"Lettre de Change\" (Bugnet ed.), vol. 4, pages 473 and 474:\u2014\nLa lettre de change appartient a l'execution du contrat du change; elle est le moyen par lequel ce contrat s'execute; elle le suppose et l'etablit, mais elle n'est pas le contrat meme.\nJudgment will be entered for $3,515.85, the amount demanded, together with interest from the date of the issue of the writ, at five per cent, and for costs. DAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nUnder the facts stated in the case submitted to us, the plaintiffs were not doing or \"carrying on business\" in the Province of British Columbia. I think myself bound by the principle of the judgment of this court in City of Halifax v. The McLaughlin Carriage Co.[2], and Kirkwood v. Gadd[3]. Applying the test stated in those cases to the facts in this case it is impossible to hold, on the facts as stated, that the John Deere Plow Company could be considered as \"carrying on business\" in British Columbia, within the meaning of that phrase as used in the statute.\nIn this view it is unnecessary for me to categorically answer the questions submitted as the answers I would give are evident from what I have said above.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The judgment against which this appeal is taken is upon a stated case so framed as to raise questions that are not necessarily involved in determining the right of appellant to recover upon the promissory notes upon which it sues.\nCounsel for appellant in answer to a question I put as to whether or not this was the result of a design to obtain the opinion of the court upon legal questions not arising out of the facts stated, but of importance to the parties concerned herein, assured us such was not the case. Counsel for respondent did not dissent from this assurance. The learned trial judge must be taken also to have so viewed the action or he would not have heard it. I think we must, therefore, treat the case as if, on the facts stated, the submission had been whether or not the provisions of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia as it stood in the earlier half of the year 1911, or as revised later, when applied thereto constitute a defence in whole or in part to appellant's claim to recover on the promisory notes in question. The revision which took place in 1911 altered the numbering of sections and modified the language used in many parts. The action began in 1912 and the part prohibiting certain actions must be looked at as it stood in 1912. The pamphlet copy of this revision was used in argument and hence I refer to sections as numbered therein.\nThe Act is badly drawn. In the sections 139, 152, 153, and 168, which we have specially to consider, the object designated by the phrase \"every extra-provincial company\" is expressly or impliedly referred to as subject thereto.\nThe interpretation clause defines the term as follows:\u2014\n\"Extra-provincial company\" means any duly incorporated company other than a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, or the former colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island.\nBy close examination we find later it does not mean what is thus interpreted, but only means it subject to the awkwardly expressed limitation which the language of section 153 gives.\nThat section, which I take as the key of this part 6 of the Act, is as follows:\u2014\n153. Any extra-provincial company duly incorporated under the laws of\u2014\n(a) The United Kingdom;\n(b) The Dominion;\n(c) The former Province of Canada;\n(d) Any of the provinces of the Dominion of Canada; and\n(e) Any insurance company duly authorized by its charter and regulations to carry out or effect any of the purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Legislature of British Columbia extends, may obtain a licence from the registrar authorizing it to carry on business within the province on compliance with the provisions of this Act, and on payment to the registrar in respect of the several matters mentioned in the table marked \"B\" in the first schedule hereto the several fees therein specified, and shall, subject to the provisions of the charter and regulations of the company, and to the terms of the licence, thereupon have the same powers and privileges in the province as if incorporated under this Act.\nWhat does this phrase\nany of the purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Legislature of British Columbia extends\nmean? Let it be noted that it is what \"the charter and regulations\" of the foreign legislative or creative power of both have authorized to be done by the supposed corporate body that is to become the purpose or object to which the legislative authority of the provincial legislature has been thus directed.\nThe puzzles of the section do not end with these lines in the beginning of it, but are continued by the lines\nand shall, subject to the provisions of the charter and regulations of the company, and to the terms of the licence, thereupon have the same powers and privileges in this province as if incorporated under this Act.\nIt is quite possible for a company, by virtue of the limitations of its creation, to be prohibited from carrying on business in British Columbia and yet be able to make, as the appellant did in the case in hand, a contract outside of that province and in respect of some breach thereof be under the need of suing in British Columbia and be entitled to sue therefor in the courts of that province.\nI know not whether the appellant has \"by its charter and regulations\" the right to apply for a license to do business in British Columbia or not. Prim\u00e2 facie the patent creating it enables it to apply anywhere to do its business. This suggestion of its regulations limiting its capacity starts the inquiry I have just mentioned as possible. In light of what section 139 provides it becomes a pertinent inquiry as to whether or not the scope of this part VI. of the Act is such that a company may by virtue of its Dominion charter be entitled to enter into such a contract as I have suggested yet be disabled from following its debtor in the courts of that province without taking out a licence which its self-restrictive regulations may render useless for any other purpose than such litigation.\nThe language of section 139 seems to have been held by the learned trial judge to have some such effect. True, he relies upon other incidents such as the insurance of property that the appellant permitted another to carry into the province and deal with therein. Can the appellant not ship its goods through British Columbia, say to Seattle, and, in doing so, employ men in British Columbia to take care of them and if need be insure them there ? And for breach of duty on the part of those bound by or concerned in such obligations can it not bring an action in the courts of that province?\nI am not concerned with solving all these problems. I am only raising them here to illustrate the curious things that may happen if this section and some others are to be applied literally.\nWe are concerned here with section 166 as it stood in 1911, and section 168, of which the first part is as follows:\u2014\n166. * * * So long as it, (any extra-provincial company,) remains unlicensed or unregistered under this Act it shall not be capable of maintaining any action, suit, or other proceeding in any court in British Columbia in respect of any contract made in whole or in part within this province in the course of or in connection with its business, contrary to the requirements of this part\nof this Act.\nThis provision, it is said, bars this action. If the methods of interpretation and construction I have adverted to are correct the defence herein may be well founded.\nSection 153, quoted above, does not, however, seem to me to have been so framed as to warrant that mode of treatment. These other sections (including 168 just quoted) must be read as operative within its terms or not at all. It is the one which provides for a licence. The subject throughout part VI. is licence, and the meaning declared by section 152 must be held as limiting the operative effect of all these other penalizing and puzzling sections aimed at the consequence of not obtaining a licence.\nI must, therefore, revert to the consideration of the meaning to be extracted from section 152 to give the other sections vitality or force.\nIt seems inconceivable that a charter of another power can have had in view the carrying out or effecting of\nany of the purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Legislature of British Columbia extends.\nYet such creations are those that the literal meaning of this clause deals with.\nPassing that for the moment, what we are concerned with here is the recovery upon a number of promissory notes of which some were given in, and some outside the province.\nNow, it is as plainly written in the enumerated subjects of section 91, over which exclusive power is given to the Dominion, as anything can well be, that bills of exchange and promissory notes are not within either\nthe purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Legis lature of British Columbia extends.\nHence it seems to me that the kind of contract involved herein is one over which the legislature enacting the disabling section 168, which is relied on, has no more authority than it has over the other corporations and contracts founded on any of the subjects enumerated in section 91 over which Parliament has exclusive legislative authority.\nIt is possible that Parliament has not yet in this regard covered all the ground thus open to it to take in aid of its corporate creations which must rest only upon its residual power over \"Peace, Order and Good Government\" as distinguished from those other corporate creations I refer to above and hereinafter.\nBut the language of this section 152 which I have called particular attention to, lends itself peculiarly to the application of the principle that the legislature cannot deal with promissory notes. Indeed, it seems as if intended, however awkwardly, to exclude the field of legislation beyond its powers, from the range of anything contemplated by this legislation.\nThe legislatures of the provinces, having assigned to them exclusive legislative authority over property and civil rights beyond that part thereof primarily assigned exclusively to Parliament by said enumeration in section 91 and possibly by implication in a few other sections of the Act which do not concern us here, may, no matter how much inconvenience may possibly by reckless or improper legislation arise, so enact as to contracts as to render them in certain cases null. This power clearly cannot be so used as to affect the validity of promissory notes which Parliament has declared shall not be thereby invalidated.\nParliament in the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" has not expressly dealt with this aspect of the matter and gone so far as it may have a right to go. But, it may be asked, must we not hold that Parliament, by providing for the creation of such companies as the appellant, with the evident purposes of making the franchises so granted as effective as Parliament, acting within its powers, can make them for the execution of their respective purposes, has, so far as necessary therefor by implication, given such effect as it can in relation to promissory notes ? I express no opinion.\nSuch is the problem which I conceive may arise upon this Act in relation to the rights of the Dominion corporate creations resting upon the residual power of Parliament alone and on the law as it stands at present.\nOf course, other extra-provincial companies may not stand in the same position.\nIt seems to me that in this case and in view of the phraseology used in section 152, to which I have adverted the legislature has refrained from questioning the power of Parliament and so advisedly used the word \"contract\" in section 168, as to avoid any question of conflict.\nI admit the word contract might include promissory notes, but when we read it in light of all these considerations I have referred to, I conclude it does not.\nFor that reason alone the section 168 does not apply as a bar to this action.\nThere are many other considerations leading to the same result. The whole meaning of the section must turn upon the effect of the words \"carry on business within this province.\" That is what the licence is provided for. The fees exacted indicate it must be something thus substantial and not the mere incident, for example, of bringing an action.\nI admit the language used in other sections does seem at times to strike at isolated Acts. I cannot think they alter the scope and purpose of the whole of this part of the Act, but must be controlled or read in light of what seems to me the obvious purpose of section 152 as a licensing Act.\nI assume for argument's sake such a power of licensing exists, but by no means express any opinion in regard thereto.\nThen it has been urged it is a taxing Act within the power to impose direct taxation within the province, and the authority of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[4] is invoked.\nIt seems as clear as can be that banks and railways and other subjects falling within the enumerated subjects of section 91 of the \"British North America Act\" may be taxable by a province. But I do not think that involves the liability to comply with such regulations as these sections of the \"Companies Act\" in question require compliance with. And I should say that none of the conceivable corporate creations which may be the product of the exclusive powers over said enumerated subjects of section 91 fall within the sweeping language of these sections now in question unless restricted within the necessarily incidental powers for executing the taxing power. Destroying their right of contracting, or suing, does not seem to fall within that. And so far as the mere taxing power goes this should hold good also relative to other companies. These respective spheres of legislative authority of Dominion and provinces may well be viewed as if appertaining to two independent states in their relation to each other. Each may help the other, but can go no further. It never, however, was intended either should try to destroy the other.\nIt seems to me that there is also much to be said relative to the quality of the taxation. If it is imposed purely to enable a company to do what appellant has done, then, I submit, such methods of taxation would be indirect taxation and not within provincial powers.\nI am not to be taken as suggesting that promissory notes are, as a matter of course, to be held free from taints of illegality and consequence, thereof. The causes of illegality founded on mere revenue laws, however, may in regard to promissory notes be ultimately found such as Parliament alone may declare. I express no opinion here in regard thereto and only desire to avoid unwarranted inferences from what I have said.\nI conclude that there is nothing in the facts submitted that entitles a province to deprive a company of its ordinary rights of contract and suing in the province.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the British Columbia \"Companies Act\" (B.C. Stats., 1910) does not in its true construction disable the appellant company from maintaining this action.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are sections 139 and 166. These are in these words:\u2014 139. Every extra-provincial company having gain for its purpose and object within the scope of this Act is hereby required to be licensed or registered under this or some former Act, and no company, firm, broker or other person shall, as the representative or agent of or acting in any other capacity for any such extra-provincial company, carry on any of the business of an extra-provincial company within this province until such extra-provincial company shall have been licensed or registered as aforesaid.\nThis section shall apply to an extra-provincial Company notwithstanding that it was heretofore registered as a foreign company under the provisions of any Act.\n166. If any extra-provincial company shall, without being licensed or registered pursuant to this part, carry on in the Province of British Columbia any part of its business, such extra-provincial company shall be liable to a penalty of fifty dollars for every day upon which it so carries on business, and so long as it remains unlicensed or unregistered under this Act, it shall not be capable of maintaining any action, suit, or other proceeding in any court in British Columbia in respect of any contract made in whole or in part within this province, in the course of or in connection with its business contrary to the requirements of this part:\nProvided, however, that upon the granting or restoration of the licence or the issuance or restoration of the certificate of registration or the removal of any suspension of either the license or the certificate, any action, suit or other proceeding may be maintained as if such licence or certificate had been granted or restored or such suspension removed before the institution of any such action, suit, or other proceedings.\nThe disability to sue imposed by section 166 only affects the company in respect of rights of action alleged to arise out of some contract made\nin whole or in part within this province * * * contrary to the requirements of this part;\nand the last words \"contrary to the requirements of this part\" of this Act refer, it seems to me, to the requirements imposed by sections 139 to 167, which ordain that an extra-provincial company shall be licensed or registered under the Act before it can become entitled to \"carry on in the province any part of its business.\" The contracts, therefore, which an extra-provincial company not licensed or registered under the Act is disabled from enforcing by action in the courts of British Columbia in virtue of the provisions of section 166 are contracts made in course of or in connection with some business which the company in whole or in part \"carries on\" in that province.\nThe learned trial judge held that the appellants were carrying on business by the respondent as their agent or representative, and that the contracts in question were made in connection with that business. In support of this conclusion the respondent relies upon the provisions of an agreement set out in the special case between the parties to the action[5]. The appellants are manufacturers of ploughs, and their principal place of business is at Winnipeg; the respondent is a general merchant at Elko, B.C. The promissory notes sued on were given for goods shipped at Calgary by the appellants to the respondent at Elko under the terms of the agreement already mentioned. Some of these goods were ordered by the defendant in person at Winnipeg and others by letter from Elko. The agreement in question binds the respondent to accept all goods shipped under it and to \"settle by cash and notes\" for all such goods according to the prices set forth in the price list on the first of the month following each shipment. All goods affected by the agreement are to be at the risk of the respondent until paid for; and the respondent is to insure them for the protection of the appellants. In the event of the death of the respondent or his insolvency or of an action being brought against him all moneys owing are to become immediately payable. In default of payment of any obligation given to the appellants for any goods shipped under the agreement all moneys owing by the respondent become payable and the appellants are authorized to sell all goods to which the agreement re- lates and credit the proceeds to the respondent, who is to remain liable for any deficiency. In the meantime, pending the payment of all obligations in full, the title to all goods shipped remains, until they are sold by the respondent, in the appellants, and all notes taken on the sale of any of them by the respondent from purchasers are to be taken in the name of the appellants. The sales made by the respondent are to be according to a price list furnished by the appellants. This agreement constituted\u2014the learned trial judge holds\u2014the respondent the agent of the appellants for the sale of goods to which it relates. I cannot agree with this. It is, in my judgment, an agreement relating to the sale and purchasing of goods embodying elaborate provisions for the protection of the sellers. Until the sellers have been paid in full the property remains vested in them and all moneys received on sale by the respondent are to be treated as theirs; but the rights thus reserved to them are only for securing the payment of the purchase money; and on payment they would disappear at once. Subject to the rights so held by the sellers as security the purchaser is the beneficial owner of the goods. True, there is a covenant that he will not sell except at the prices specified in the agreement. I doubt very much whether this provision was intended to bind the purchaser with respect to goods that have been fully paid for. If it was intended to apply to goods that have become fully vested in the purchaser its validity is doubtful; but in any case it could only operate as a personal covenant by the respondent affecting the conduct of his own business.\nI see nothing in these provisions requiring or, indeed, justifying the inference that the respondent in carrying out the agreement was acting as the agent or representative of the appellants in carrying on the appellants' business. What was contemplated was that in the conduct of his own business he should observe the provisions of this contract that he had made with the appellants. The second part of the first question,\nwhether the plaintiff * * * is precluded from * * * maintaining action in respect of any of the claims or notes aforesaid\nought to be answered in the negative. The first branch of the first question, and the second question, do not arise on the facts and it would, therefore, be improper to answer them.\nI may add, although it is not strictly necessary to the decision, that section 166, which subjects extraprovincial companies to penalties for carrying on in the province any part of their business without licence or registration appears to indicate that the legislature by the phrase \"carrying on business\" contemplated such conduct on the part of the company as would, according to the general principles of law, amount to a submission to the jurisdiction of the British Columbia courts. According to that view no company would come within the penalties or disabilities imposed by the enactments quoted above unless it had a fixed place of business at which it carried on some part of its own business within the province.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion the notes sued on were not given to or taken by the plaintiffs in the course of carrying on their business within British Columbia. The burden was on the defendant to prove this. The evidence in the record does not establish that the plaintiffs carried on any part of their business in that province. On that short ground this appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The main question to be decided in this case is whether the appellants are carrying on business in the Province of British Columbia.\nBy the \"Companies Act\" of that province, it is provided that every extra-provincial company having gain for its purpose is required to take out a licence, and it is also provided, by the same Act, that\nno person shall as the representative or agent of, or acting in any other capacity, for any such extra-provincial company, carry on any of the business of that company until such extra-provincial company shall have been licensed. (Section 139.)\nAnd, if any extra-provincial company shall carry on any of its business in the province, it shall not be capable of maintaining any action in any court of British Columbia in respect to any contract made, in whole or in part, within that province in connection with its business. (Sec. 166.)\nIt appears by the stated case that the head-office of the company is at Winnipeg; that the respondent, Agnew, is residing in British Columbia and carrying on there the business of a general merchant. In February, 1911, Agnew, in Winnipeg, made a contract with the appellants under which they agreed not to sell, in a certain territory in British Columbia, the classes of goods which the respondent would order. In execution of that contract the respondent, at different dates, ordered from the appellants certain goods to be shipped to him in Calgary, in Alberta, and he gave his promissory notes for those goods. Some of those notes were made and signed in Manitoba. The other notes, though dated in Winnipeg, were, in fact, signed by the respondent at his place of business. The company was not registered in British Columbia.\nThe trial judge found that the appellant company should be considered, on the above facts, as carrying on business in the Province of British Columbia, and, as the company was not registered there, that it could not take any action to enforce the contract with the respondent.\nI am not able, for my part, to come to such a conclusion. It cannot be said that the appellants were carrying on any business in the Province of British Columbia. Some of their goods were being sold, it is true, by the respondent, but he was not their representative or agent and did not act in any such like capacity for the appellants, but he was doing with those goods the same as he would do with any other goods which, in his ordinary business, he would bring from any other part of the country.\nHaving come to that conclusion, I do not think it is necessary then to examine the other question which has been submitted by the plaintiffs, namely, whether or not the appellants, being a company incorporated by the Dominion Parliament, could be subjected to the requirements of the Act above mentioned.\nI think that the appeal is well founded and it should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Tupper, Kitto & Wightman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wilson & Jamieson.\n[1] 8 D.L.R. 65; 2 West.

Re Sproule (12 Can. S.C.R. 140) referred to.\nThe offence of housebreaking as described in the Imperial statute, 7 & 8 Geo. IV., ch. 29, sec. 15, became part of the criminal law of British Columbia on the introduction of the criminal law of England into that colony by the Ordinance of 19th November, 1858, continued to be so until the Union of the province with Canada, and since then by virtue of sec. 11 of the \"Criminal Code,\" and it is not an offence to' which sec. 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.'C., 1906, ch. 139, has application.\nAPPLICATION, in Supreme Court Chambers, at the City of Ottawa, for the rule calling upon the keeper of the common gaol in the County of Westminster, at the City of New Westminster, in British Columbia, to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum should not issue to bring up the body of one Charles Dean who was, as alleged, confined in the said gaol under a warrant of commitment, dated 5th September, 1912, to stand his trial upon a charge of the offence of housebreaking.\nJ. Travers Lewis K.C. supported the application. E. F. B. Johnston K.C. on behalf of the Attorney-General for British Columbia, showed cause.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think I have no jurisdiction to entertain this application. It will not be necessary, in view of my opinion as to the construction of section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" to decide the point raised by the contention of Mr. Johnston, on behalf of the Attorney-General for British Columbia, that that enactment is beyond the competence of the Parliament of Canada. Section 62 is as follows:\u2014\nEvery judge of the court shall, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of 'Canada.\n2. If the judge refuses the writ or remands the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.\nThe language indicates an intention on the part of Parliament to confer only a strictly limited jurisdiction. Anything like frequent interposition in the administration of the criminal law in the provinces by the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, through the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus, would obviously lead to the most undesirable results ; and, before exercising the authority in a given case, I think it is my duty to scrutinize most carefully the terms in which that authority is given to ascertain whether or not the case is clearly one of those in which it was intended to be exercised.\nThe jurisdiction extends only, I think, to those cases in which the \"commitment\" has followed upon a charge of a criminal offence which is a criminal offence by virtue of some statutory enactment of the Parliament of Canada; it does not, in my opinion, ex- tend to cases in which the \"commitment\" is for an offence which was an offence at common law or under a statute which was passed prior to Confederation and is still in force.\nThat, I think, is the effect of previous decisions by judges of this court. See Re Sproule[1]. The offence for which the applicant was committed to stand his trial is thus described in the warrant of commitment:\nHe, the said 'Charles Dean, at the City of New Westminster, in the County of Westminster, on the 15th day of September, A.D. 1911, did unlawfully break and enter the counting-house of the Bank of Montreal, situated at the corner of Columbia and Church streets, in the City of New Westminster aforesaid, and the sum of $271,000, the property of the said Bank of Montreal, then and there being found therein then and there steal, contrary to the 'form of the statute in such case made and provided.\nThese words aptly describe an offence under section 15 of 7 & 8 Geo. IV. ch. 29, which became part of the law of British Columbia under the ordinance of the 19th November, 1858, introducing the civil and criminal law of England into that colony. This enactment continued to be a part of the criminal law of British Columbia down to the time of the Union with Canada, and, by section 11 of the \"Criminal Code\" it is now part of the \"criminal law\" of the province in so far as it has not been repealed, \"altered, varied, modified or affected\" by competent legislative authority. The only change relates to the nature of the punishment to which an offender is liable.\nSection 62 has, consequently, no application.\nApplication refused.\n[1] 12 Can. S.C.R. 140.\n"}

After some proceedings before them it was arranged, for the convenience of counsel for the parties, that further proceedings should be suspended until the return of counsel who were obliged to be present at the sittings of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and nothing further was done until after the return of counsel from abroad at a date later than the time so fixed for the award. The arbitrators had not prolonged the time for making the award but, upon reassembling after the day originally fixed had passed, they fixed a later date for that purpose. The company\u2019s arbitrator and counsel then refused to take part in any subsequent proceedings and the two remaining arbitrators continued the hearing and made an award in favour of the claimant greater than that offered by the company for the lands expropriated. In an action by the company to have the award set aside and for a declaration that the sum offered should be the compensation payable for the lands,\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances of the case, the company should not be permitted to Object to the manner in which the arbitrators had proceeded in prolonging the time and making the award. The appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 22 K.B. 221), declaring the award to have been validly made was, consequently, dismissed with costs. APPEAL from the judgment, of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], by which an appeal from the judgment of Lemieux J., in the Superior Court, District of Quebec[2], was dismissed with costs and the award of arbitrators under the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, stood confirmed.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nEus\u00e8be Belleau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I have read Sir Louis Davies\u2019s judgment and were it possible for me to accept his construction of the arrangement made between counsel and the arbitrators at the adjournment of the proceedings on the 18th of January, I would have no hesitation in adopting his conclusion. Unfortunately the evidence of what occurred as given by Mr. Belleau, the respondent\u2019s counsel, and Mr. Mayrand, his arbitrator, convinces me that it was then agreed there would be an adjournment until the 26th of January, on which latter date the arbitrators would again meet, and if counsel were not then able to be present, a further postponement would be made until their return from England. The minute of the proceedings of the 18th January is very clear and explicit; it reads: \u201cL\u2019Enqu\u00eate est ajourn\u00e9e au 26 Janvier courant \u00e0 2 heures p.m.\u201d It is significant that Mr. Belleau drew the attention of the arbitrators to the statute and insisted that the delay to make the award should be extended if there was to be a postponement beyond the 15th of February, the date fixed for that purpose at their first meeting, as required by the express terms of section 204 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d This was clear notice to the arbitrators and if, at the time they did not intend to meet on the 26th January as the appellants contend, it is inconceivable that they did not then provide for the important contingency indicated by respondent\u2019s counsel. The award was not made within the delay and the time was not enlarged. There was no meeting on the 26th January nor on any day until after the delay fixed by the arbitrators at their first meeting on or before which their award would be made, and the award made at a subsequent date should be set aside.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court of Quebec, refusing to set aside an award made in the respondent\u2019s favour for the value of a piece of land expropriated by the railway company. The ground mainly relied upon by the appellants for setting aside the award was that the arbitrators in extending the time for making the award to a further day than that which they had first fixed upon, had not strictly complied with section 204 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of Canada, but had made such extension after the time first fixed had elapsed.\nIt appears to me that the result of this appeal must depend upon the appreciation given to the understanding and agreement made and reached by all the parties and their counsel on the 18th January, as to the postponement of the arbitration proceedings. After the arbitrators were appointed they met, and, on the 18th January, after having heard some evidence, counsel intimated that they desired to have the proceedings adjourned so as to enable them to attend the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, and suggested that an adjournment should take place till the 26th January on the understanding that if they were then unable to be present the proceedings should be prolonged until counsel\u2019s return from England, and should then be resumed. The 15th February had been originally fixed by the arbitrators as the date, under the section of the statute, for making their award and, when the proceedings were adjourned at counsel\u2019s request as above stated, no definite day was named by the arbitrators extending the time from the 15th February. On the return of counsel from England, however, a majority of the arbitrators met and fixed the 15th June as the time for making the award. The company\u2019s arbitrator and counsel refused to recognize or attend any of these later arbitration proceedings on the ground that, failing to make an extension of the time for making their award before the 15th day of February, the arbitrators had ceased to have any jurisdiction, and all further proceedings were ultra vires.\nWhether in making the extension at the time they did the arbitrators acted within their powers or not, depends, in my opinion, upon the construction of the consent agreement respecting the postponement. As I construe that agreement, it provided for a prolongation of the proceedings and their resumption after counsel\u2019s return to Quebec. The fact that the arbitrators failed to make an entry before the 15th February of an extension of time for the making of their award either at the adjournment on the 18th or on the 26th January, does not vitiate or render null and void all the further proceedings. Such extension was made by the majority of the arbitrators who met after counsel\u2019s return when they fixed the 15th June. The company\u2019s arbitrator had full notice of all these meetings.\nI do not think, under the circumstances and the agreement and understanding reached, that it was too late to name and fix such a date when the return of counsel enabled the arbitrators to resume the proceedings. Their action in so naming the day was an action which must be held to have been made with the consent of the parties; and I do not think the technical point relied upon by the appellants that such prolongation must necessarily be made before the lapse of the day originally fixed for making the award should, under such circumstances as existed in this case, be given effect to, or that it is open to the railway company, after a delay obtained at their own request, to ask that effect be given to such an objection.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The first question raised herein is upon the construction of section 204 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d which is as follows:\u2014\n204. A majority of the arbitrators, at the first meeting after their appointment, or the sole arbitrator, shall fix a day on or before which the award shall be made, and if the same is not made on or before such day, or some other day to which the time for making it has, either by the consent of the parties, or by resolution of the arbitrators, or by the sole arbitrator, been prolonged, then the sum offered by the company, as aforesaid, shall be the compensation to be paid by the company. The arbitrators had proceeded at some considerable length with their inquiry after having as required by this section named the fifteenth of February then next as the date on or before which their award should be made.\nOn the eighteenth of January it seems they had a meeting at which it was intimated counsel on both sides had business that would call them before the Privy Council and they might have to leave for England on or before the 26th January, then named as an otherwise convenient day for further proceeding with the continuation of the reference.\nThere is no dispute about the fact that it was agreed as a matter of courtesy to counsel that the continuation of the reference should be enlarged if counsel were called away on or before the 26th January until such time as they should have returned from England.\nThe counsel left Quebec for England, as anticipated, either on the 26th January or before. When the arbitrators assembled pursuant to adjournment at the place of sitting on the 26th January, no one met them, and they found or assumed as fact that counsel had gone to England.\nThe arbitrators disagree slightly as to what exactly was done or said on that day, or 18th of same month, relative to need of a formal record being made of the enlargement till after the return of counsel and to the fixing another date for the making of the award.\nCounsel for the appellant now argues, however, that all his side agreed to was that the board were to meet formally, fix a new date limiting the time for making the award, and only then postpone or adjourn, and that to a fixed day. There is no such record. There is not a scrape of a pen to indicate that the consent of appellants was expressly made so conditional, and so peculiarly conditional, and the learned trial judge has made a finding of fact undisturbed in appeal which leaves no room for such conditional form of consent having any operation.\nThere is not a shadow of doubt that all of them and appellant had agreed that the matter of further proceeding with the reference should stand over and await the return of counsel from England.\nThat they could not return within the time originally fixed for making the award must have been well known to all concerned. This consent by appellants seems to me, in any view one takes consistently with the findings of fact, clearly to delegate to the arbitrators the naming of a new day (which was ultimately done by the arbitrators) and to imply that it mattered not when this was done if done within a reasonable time. The reasonableness of the time fixed, under the circumstances, is not questioned. The reasonable course of awaiting their return before fixing a new date which perchance might prove too early or too remote does not seem open to question. The date was fixed as soon as the counsel had returned from England and the proceedings were then renewed, but the arbitrator named by the appellant, no doubt acting on its suggestion, refused to act longer.\nSuch a course of dealing seems to me a wretched piece of had faith which deserved the rebuke the courts below have given it.\nThe action of the arbitrator was within what was manifestly the purpose of the appellant\u2019s own consent and the respondent is not to be penalized because they chose to act within that but failed to give it the consecration of forms they might have adopted and acted upon without such consent.\nThen in the next place appellant contends that in dealing with the matters submitted the majority of the arbitrators exceeded the terms of the submission by allowing for items they had no power to make any allowance for. The submission was intended to cover the estimating of condensation to be made for taking real estate of which a part was taken from the respondent\u2019s mill-dam. Clearly that involved or might involve just such items as allowances were made for and now complained of.\nBut appellant\u2019s counsel, it seems, proposed some questions to a witness which the learned trial judge ruled were not admissible and now claims that as a result the trial ought to be set aside.\nThe learned trial judge when making his ruling pointed out to counsel that it would not be possible to pass satisfactorily upon the question relative to excess of jurisdiction without knowing what the evidence was which had been put before the board.\nI think the learned judge was right in this view whether technically or not his ruling was correct. The ruling itself did not cause any miscarriage of justice.\nAs counsel refused to place before the court the evidence by means of which alone the limits of the inquiry could be properly understood, I think he cannot now complain.\nEven now, as he declines to tell us just what in substance had been so refused to the learned judge, and why it should not have been given, or wherein exactly he does complain, save in regard to the ruling, I think the inferences relative to its substantial nature must be against his contention.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal. The respondent appeared at the first meeting of the arbitrators and was ready to proceed. To meet the convenience of the railway company there was an adjournment, and it was distinctly understood that in consequence of the adjournment it might not be possible for the arbitration to proceed until the return of counsel from Europe; and that if that proved to be so the arbitration was to go on, on a date to be fixed by the arbitrators.\nIt was, I think, clearly implied that the railway company would concur in any steps that might be necessary to enable that to be done. It is true it was supposed that the time would be prolonged by the action of the arbitrators themselves; but it was never in the contemplation of anybody that the respondent should lose his status by an oversight of the arbitrators. The railway company ought not to be permitted in violation of the spirit of the arrangement entered into at their behest and for the purpose of conferring a benefit upon them to raise the purely technical and altogether conscienceless objection which is now put forward.\nAs to the other point I can see no ground whatever for thinking that the arbitrators have considered elements of compensation that ought not to have been considered.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014I have very reluctantly come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed. While I think the evidence open to the construction that it was understood between counsel on the 18th of January that in the event of their being unable to proceed on the 26th of January the arbitration proceedings should stand enlarged until their return from their prospective trip to England, and that there should be a corresponding extension of the time for making the award, it leaves no room for doubt that it was intended and agreed that this extension should be effected by the arbitrators at a meeting to be held on the 26th of January. It was never agreed or intended that the extension of the time for making the award required by section 204 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d should be effected by the consent of counsel proprio vigore. The 15th February was originally fixed by the arbitrators as the date on or before which their award should be made. There was no extension of that period before it expired, and upon its expiry the arbitrators were functi and they were thereafter incapable of extending the time for, or of making a valid award.\nBut assuming in favour of the respondent that the understanding between counsel on the 18th of January and what occurred on the 25th of January, when they met and expressed to one another their purpose not to appear pro form\u00e2 before the arbitrators on the following day, should be taken as implying and evidencing a consent that the time for the making of the award should be extended until after their return from England, that would not, in my opinion, suffice to keep the arbitration alive beyond the 15th of February. Section 204 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is as follows:\u2014 204. A majority of the arbitrators, at the first meeting after their appointment, or the sole arbitrator, shall fix a day on or before which the award, shall be made, and if the same is not made on or before such day, or some other day to which the time for making it has, either by the consent of the parties, or by resolution of the arbitrators, or by the sole arbitrator, been prolonged, then the sum offered by the Company, as aforesaid, shall be the compensation to be paid by the company.\nThe clear purpose of this section appears to be to require that from the initiation of the proceedings of the arbitrators there shall always be a definite and certain date, original or extended, on or before which the award shall be made, and upon the expiry of which without an award being made the arbitration shall come to an end and the statutory consequences shall ensue. The requirement that the date to be fixed originally shall be a definite and ascertained day is, I think, equally applicable and for the same reason to any date to which the time may be extended. The statute, in my opinion, does not contemplate an extension for an indefinite period or to a date which is not certain. Assuming that counsel and arbitrators agreed that the time for making the award should be extended until after the return of counsel from England and to a day to be then fixed, that, in my opinion, would not be such an extension as the statute contemplates or authorizes and the arbitration came to an end on the 15th of February, the only date ever fixed as the limit of time for the making of the award.\nI, therefore, find myself driven to the conclusion that the alleged award of the 1st June, 1911, cannot stand. I feel, however, that I should not part with this case without animadverting upon the conduct of the plaintiffs in pressing this action as most dishonourable and reprehensible. It is sharp practice of a kind which, fortunately, we rarely encounter. But unfortunately upon the view which I hold as to the purpose and effect of section 204 of the statute we are in this instance powerless to prevent its success.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons dans cette cause \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 204 de l\u2019Acte des Chemins de fer du Canada qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\nLa majorit\u00e9 des arbitres, \u00e0 leur premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance apr\u00e8s leur nomination, ou l\u2019arbitre unique, fixe le jour auquel ou avant lequel la sentence est rendue; et, si elle n\u2019est pas rendue le ou avant ce jour, ou un autre auquel, du consentement des parties ou par r\u00e9solution des arbitres, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e, le montant offert par la compagnie est Pindemnit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle doit payer.\nL\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient \u00e0 proc\u00e9der devant les arbitres pour faire d\u00e9terminer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur pour son terrain expropri\u00e9. L\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s termin\u00e9e lorsque le 18 janvier, 1911, la compagnie de chemin de fer demanda \u00e0 faire remettre la cause au 26 du m\u00eame mois, afin de pouvoir produire une preuve additionnelle qu\u2019elle esp\u00e9rait se procurer pour cette date. L\u2019avocat du d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9, s\u2019y objecta et entr\u2019autres raisons il all\u00e9gua qu\u2019il devait sous peu partir pour l\u2019Angleterre avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante pour plaider une cause devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9. Il fut convenu alors que si les parties ne pouvaient pas proc\u00e9der le 26 janvier, l\u2019enqu\u00eate serait ajourn\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les avocats fussent revenus de leur voyage, et alors un jour serait fix\u00e9 pour la continuer.\nLes arbitres avaient au commencement de l\u2019enqu\u00eate fix\u00e9 le 15 f\u00e9vrier comme date \u00e0 laquelle ils devaient rendre leur sentence arbitrale, et \u00e0 raison de cela, lorsqu\u2019il fut question d\u2019ajourner la cause, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait demand\u00e9 aux commissaires de ne pas oublier d\u2019\u00e9tendre le delai si toutefois ils ne proc\u00e9daient pas le 26 janvier. Le 26 janvier les arbitres se rendirent au palais de justice, qui \u00e9tait l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 se faisait l\u2019enqu\u00eate, et comme les avocats \u00e9taient partis, ou sur le point de partir pour l\u2019Angleterre ils ne se sont pas r\u00e9unis et aucune entr\u00e9e ne fut alors faite dans leur livre de minutes.\nAu retour des avocats, dans le mois de mai suivant, deux des arbitres, (celui qui repr\u00e9sentait la compagnie refusant de proc\u00e9der,) donn\u00e8rent avis aux parties de terminer et entr\u00e8rent dans leur livre de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations les faits tels qu\u2019ils s\u2019\u00e9taient pass\u00e9s. Mais l\u2019appelante refusa de proc\u00e9der et les deux arbitres rendirent leur sentence. Par son action l\u2019appelante demande \u00e0 faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cette sentence arbitrale parce que les arbitres n\u2019avaient plus le droit d\u2019agir et elle veut faire condamner le d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9, \u00e0 accepter le montant qu\u2019elle avait offert avec son avis d\u2019expropriation. L\u2019article 204 de l\u2019Acte des chemins de fer a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet de plusieurs jugements et dans chaque cas il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne devait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 rigoureusement lorsque l\u2019intention des parties est \u00e9vidente.\nAinsi dans la cause de Shannon v. The Montreal Park and Island Railway Co.[3], l\u2019honourable juge Taschereau s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 comme suit:\u2014\nWe are bound to construe the sections in question so as to ensure the attainment of that object, and the carrying out of their provisions to their true intent, meaning and spirit. The company would have us read this section 156 textually and gain an advantage over the expropriated owner. La cour d\u2019appel dans la cause Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. v. La Fabrique de Sainte-Anne[4], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le consentement d\u2019ajourner peut r\u00e9sulter des faits et des circonstances. Cette derni\u00e8re cause a beaucoup d\u2019analogie avec la cause actuelle. Les parties avaient proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate et avaient ajourn\u00e9 de temps en temps, et par oubli ou autrement on n\u2019avait pas prorog\u00e9 la date o\u00f9 la sentence devait \u00eatre rendue de sorte que quand l\u2019enqu\u00eate f\u00fbt termin\u00e9e et que la cause f\u00fbt pr\u00eate \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par les arbitres \u00e9tait expir\u00e9. Les tribunaux ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait un consentement implicite d\u2019ajourner \u00e0 plus tard la sentence arbitrale et que par cons\u00e9quent la compagnie de chemin de fer ne pouvait \u00eatre justifiable de r\u00e9voquer le consentement qu\u2019elle avait donn\u00e9.\nIl est incontestable que dans la pr\u00e9sente instance la compagnie a consenti \u00e0 ce que la cause fut continu\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au retour d\u2019Angleterre de son avocat et de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nLes minutes des proc\u00e9dures des arbitres \u00e9taient ordinairement tenues par l\u2019arbitre de la compagnie et s\u2019il y a eu omission de sa part d\u2019entrer l\u2019ajournement et la convention qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9, ne doit certainement pas en souffrir.\nJe consid\u00e8re que ce serait une grave injustice que de priver dans les circonstances ce dernier de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que la majorit\u00e9 des arbitres lui a accord\u00e9e et je suis d\u2019opinion que le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel est bien fond\u00e9.

Woods K.C. for the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nWegenast for the Manufacturers\u2019 Association of Canada.\nGaudet for the Canadian Insurance Federation.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question in this reference is a narrow one, namely, whether section 4 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d 9 and 10 Edw. VII. ch. 32, and section 70 which fixes the penalty for violations of section 4 are ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nSection 4 reads as follows:\u2014\nIn Canada, except as otherwise provided by this Act, no company or underwriters or other person shall solicit or accept any risk, or issue or deliver any receipt or policy of insurance, or grant any annuity on a life or lives, or collect or receive any premium, or inspect any risk, or adjust any loss, or carry on any business of insurance, or prosecute or maintain any suit, action or proceeding, or file any claim in insolvency relating to such business, unless it be done by or on behalf of a company or underwriters holding a license from the Minister.\nIt is quite obvious that this Act is intended merely to regulate the business of insurance in Canada and in the Prohibition Case[1], Lord Watson said that in Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons (2), the business of fire insurance was admitted to be a trade.\nA review of the insurance legislation of Canada from 1868 downward, which is all set out in Mr. Newcombe\u2019s factum, shews that the law as it was at the time of The Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[2], contains substantially the same provision as section 4 now in question. The court is not called upon to consider the question as to how far the Parliament of Canada could override the statutory conditions of any province by legislating with respect to the conditions which should attach to all contracts of insurance in Canada. The question narrows itself down apparently to this: Assuming that under property and civil rights the provincial legislatures have jurisdiction to legislate generally with respect to insurance companies doing business in the province, in view of the fact that insurance is a class of business in which it is essential that the public interest should be safeguarded, and this business has always been of great importance and particularly in recent years has grown to be of enormous magnitude, cannot the Dominion Parliament legislate with respect to this subject under the head of \u201cPeace, Order and Good Government,\u201d just as it has been held to have jurisdiction in the matter of intoxicating liquors? The following references in support of this proposition are of importance.\nIn The Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[3], at page 114, Sir Montague Smith says:\u2014\nIt was further argued on the part of the Appellants that the Ontario Act was inconsistent with the Act of the Dominion Parliament, 38 Vict. ch. 20, which requires fire insurance companies to obtain licenses from the Minister of Finance as a condition to their carrying on the business of insurance in the Dominion, and that it was beyond the competency of the provincial legislature to subject companies who had obtained such licenses, as the appellants companies had done, to the conditions imposed by the Ontario Act. But the Legislation does not really conflict or present any inconsistency. The statute of the Dominion Parliament enacts a general law applicable to the whole Dominion requiring all insurance companies, whether incorporated by foreign, Dominion or Provincial authority to obtain a license from the Minister of Finance, to be granted only upon compliance with the conditions prescribed by the Act. Assuming this Act to be within the competency of the Dominion Parliament, as a general law applicable to foreign and domestic corporations, it in no way interferes with the authority of the legislature of the Province of Ontario to legislate in relation to the contracts which corporations may enter into in that province.\nSir Montague Smith in the same judgment refers to the weight to be attached to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Federal Parliament.\nIn the argument of the Dominion Liquor License Case[4], at p. 67, Sir Farrer, afterwards Lord, Herschell, in his argument, referring to the Dominion \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d says:\u2014\nI do not think it was questioned that the Dominion Act was a perfectly good Act, which did require all insurance companies throughout the Dominion to take out a Dominion license but it was held that the Ontario legislation was not inconsistent with it.\nSir Montague Smith remarked:\u2014\nI forget what the facts were, but I suppose that the case did not interfere with the license to be taken out under the Dominion Act.\nIn short it may be safely stated that the whole report of the Parsons Case[5] shews that it was assumed by both sides that it was within the power of the Parliament of Canada to grant licenses.\nAgain, at p. 165, Sir Farrer Herschell says:\u2014\nTake the statute which was under consideration in the Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons (7 App. Cas. 96), which was in no way disapproved by that judgment. The Dominion Parliament of Canada had said, in order for the general safety and to prevent people from being swindled by bubble companies, no insurance company shall carry on business in the Dominion without a license; that license being granted by the Dominion government. Of course, these insurance companies carried on their business in the provinces; there was nowhere else for them to carry it on, it may in one or it may in all. But the Parliament said: you shall not carry on your, business without a license from the Dominion Government, and certainly no suggestion was made by this Board in that case that the law was invalid, because that would have been an easy solution of the matter. Instead of that, the court proceeded to shew that the legislation in the particular case was not inconsistent with the general Dominion legislation.\nIt appears by the last returns published by the Insurance Department under the authority of Parliament and of the legislatures of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba that:\u2014\n1. The amount of fire insurance in force in Canada at December 31, 1912, in companies licensed by the Dominion was $2,684,355,895, and in companies licensed by the provinces, $949,863,538. The premiums paid for this insurance in 1912 amounted to $30,144,264.\nThe amount of life insurance in force at the said date in companies licensed by the Dominion was $1,070,308,669, and in companies licensed by the provinces, $14,700,988, the number of Dominion policies being 1,497,397.\nThe premiums paid in 1912 on this insurance amounted to $36,092,719.\nThe amount of premiums paid to companies licensed by the Dominion in 1912 for insurance other than fire and life amounted to $10,262,049.\n2. No figures are available shewing the amount of insurance in force at the time of Confederation. The earliest report is that for the business of the year 1872 from which I take the following:\u2014\nThe amount of fire insurance in force in December 31, 1872, was $251,725,940.\nThe amount of premiums paid in 1872 was $2,653,612.\nThe amount of life insurance in force at December 31, 1872, was $61,365,648.\nThe amount of premiums paid in 1872 on this insurance was $2,068,953.\nSo far as appears from this report no return was made of business other than fire and life insurance.\nThat the Parliament of Canada may legislate with respect to matters which affect property and civil rights when they have attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, is clearly established. See Russell v. The Queen[6], at page 839. Also, and particularly, see the judgment of Lord Watson in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[7], at pages 359 and 360.\nMy answer to the first question is, No.\nMy answer to the second question is, Yes.\nDavies J.\u2014I do not desire in these reasons for my answers to the questions put upon this reference to repeat what I have already said in the reasons for my answers to the questions on the reference respecting companies generally.\nIt is impossible, however, to avoid some repetition if one is to make one\u2019s opinion in the special questions submitted at all clear.\nThe Dominion Parliament has doubtless the right to impose restrictions upon companies of its own creation enacted in section 4 now under discussion. That I understand is not questioned.\nIt is conceded on the other hand that the exclusive legislative control over provincial insurance companies carrying on their business wholly within the province rests with the province creating such companies. The legislation here in question recognizes this and exempts from its operation and application every such provincial company.\nI have already, in the Companies Reference[8], expressed the opinion that the limitation upon the provincial objects is amongst other things territorial and that the Dominion statute professing to confer upon them extra territorial powers by means of a license is ultra vires.\nIf I am right, the Act does not apply at all to provincial companies. Of course, if there is no territorial limitation upon the powers of those companies, and they can legally carry on their business extra territorially and throughout the Dominion, they would not come within the exception of the Act.\nMy object in mentioning this is to have it clearly understood that the Act, the section of which is in question and under review, exempts from its application provincial companies confining their business to the provinces creating them which in my opinion they are bound to do.\nThe exemption is based upon the implication that the limitation upon the exclusive powers given to the provinces to incorporate companies \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d is at any rate a territorial one, and the Dominion Parliament proceeding upon that implication and assumption and conceding that such exclusive power should not be invaded by its legislation, declares that the Act shall not apply to such companies. It was evidently not the intention of the Dominion Parliament to entrench upon this exclusive power given to the local legislatures, but while carefully excluding from the operation of the Act all provincial companies created by virtue of it, to enact Dominion legislation which should as far as possible effectively regulate and control the business of insurance as carried on generally throughout the whole Dominion by Canadian and foreign companies alike.\nCounsel for the Dominion at bar submitted that the legislation in question could be supported on several of the enumerated powers of legislation assigned to the Dominion in the 91st section of its Constitutional Act. They relied upon the criminal law and the subject of aliens, but I am clearly of the opinion that the legislation cannot be supported under either of these enumerated powers. Parliament when enacting this insurance legislation was not dealing with the subject-matter of \u201caliens\u201d as such or with criminal law as such. It was dealing with the subject-matter of insurance attempting to regulate that business so far as it was not within the exclusive powers of the province and as part of such regulations requiring insurance companies within its legislative jurisdiction to take out a license and make certain deposits of money with the Finance Minister and be subject to inspection while carrying on such business.\nIt was the regulation and not the prohibition of a business that Parliament was dealing with and I shall subsequently attempt to shew the distinction is of vital importance on one at least of the grounds on which the power of the Dominion to enact the legislation is concerned.\nThe other enumerated powers of the Dominion under which it was sought to uphold the validity of this legislation was that of \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d If section 4 in question can be brought within that enumerated power all doubt as to its validity would at once be ended.\nIn the case of City of Fredericton v. The Queen[9] this court held that the provisions of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act, 1878,\u201d prohibiting the traffic in intoxicating liquors came within this enumerated power. On appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, sub nomine Russell v. The Queen[10], this judgment was not sustained as coming within the regulation of trade and commerce, but was sustained, as I understand the judgment, on the ground that the Act in question came within the general powers of legislation respecting peace, order and good government and not within the class of subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures. In the later prohibition case, Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[11], at pp. 362-3, Lord Watson, in stating the opinion of their Lordships on the case before them, said that the decision in Russell v. The Queen[12] must be accepted as an authority that the respective provisions of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act, 1886,\u201d must receive effect as valid enactments relating to the peace, order and good government of Canada and he went on to explain that as these enactments were prohibitive and not regulative their Lordships were unable to regard them as regulations of trade and commerce. He further explains that the object of the Act was\nnot to regulate retail transactions between those who trade in liquors and their customers, but to abolish all such transactions within every provincial area in which its enactments have been adopted.\nIn other words, because the aim and purpose of the Act was not regulation but prohibition, their Lordships could not agree that it was legislation under the \u201cRegulation of Trade and Commerce.\u201d The inference I draw from the language of the judgment is that if the provisions of the enactment there in question had been regulation instead of prohibition they would have been sustained as valid under the enumerated sub-section.\nIn the Judicial Committee in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[13], Sir Montague Smith said, at p. 113:\u2014 Construing, therefore, the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d by the various aids to their interpretation above suggested, they would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of Parliament, regulation in matters of interprovincial concern, and it may be that they would include general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion. Their Lordships abstain on the present occasion from any attempt to define the limits of the authority of the Dominion Parliament in this direction. It is enough for the decision of the present case to say that, in their view, its authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not comprehend the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade, such as the business of fire insurance in a single province.\nIn this view of the case it became unnecessary to consider how far the general power to make regulations of trade and commerce when competently exercised by the Dominion Parliament might legally modify or affect property and civil rights. But I take it as settled law now at any rate that regulation of trade and commerce when competently exercised by the Dominion Parliament may legally modify and affect any of the exclusive powers of the legislatures of the provinces.\nThe point decided in the Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[14], was of an extremely limited character and to the effect that the regulation of insurance contracts within a province as to the terms and conditions of the contract was within the legislative power of the province as a matter of property and civil rights and did not affect the regulations of trade and commerce.\nIt is conceded that the Judicial Committee has never yet expressly assigned to this power over trade and commerce, any Dominion legislation which has come before it. The furthest they have gone in that direction is I think to be found in the above quotation from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Citizens Insurance Company Case[15],\nit may be the words would include general regulation of trade throughout the whole Dominion.\nIt seems to me that such a general regulation of trade though confined to one particular branch of trade would also come within the jurisdiction of the Dominion and that this special legislation now in controversy may well be held within that enumerated power.\nThat insurance is a trade in one sense at least seems clear, and that it is one affecting the whole Dominion and all classes and conditions of its people is beyond controversy. That in some of its branches at least, such as the insurance of cargoes or property carried from one province to another by land or sea or both, it is a subject-matter of interprovincial concern which could only properly be legislated upon by the Dominion Parliament would, on the construction I put upon the powers of provincial companies, seem also clear. My general conclusion in the absence of any distinct authority is that the subject-matter of insurance generally throughout the Dominion but not including provincial insurance limited to the province may well be held as within the regulative power of Parliament under the enumerated clause relating to trade and commerce. The legislation in question here is assuredly of a character that no provincial legislature could competently enact. So far as provincial legislatures can competently deal with the subject-matter of insurance companies the Act in question in terms does not apply or interfere. The section under consideration would seem undoubtedly good so far as it applied to interprovincial trade insurance and my conclusion on the whole subject is that it may fairly on the authority of the decision of the prohibition case respecting the validity of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d be held good as a regulation of trade.\nIf I am wrong in that then I hold that it comes within the Dominion Parliament\u2019s general power of legislation for the peace, order and good government of Canada. Holding as I do the view that the limitation upon the provincial power to incorporate companies is territorial and confined to the provinces, then all other legislative power upon that subject-matter must be vested in the Dominion Parliament. If on the general question of the incorporation of companies the power of the provinces to legislate is strictly limited to their respective territorial areas, then it would necessarily follow that all companies with power larger than provincial must be incorporated by the Dominion Parliament and of course be entirely subject to its jurisdiction and control.\nIf the legislation in question is sustainable only on the general powers of the Dominion relating to peace, order and good government then in my opinion the subject-matter of it is one which to-day has become of national interest and importance, affecting the body politic of the Dominion as a whole and being so would on the authority of the Prohibition Case[16], be paramount legislation.\nIt would seem strange indeed if the Parliament of Canada, on a subject-matter affecting directly the lives, property and interests of a very large proportion of its inhabitants could not legislate either to prohibit foreign companies which may or may not be responsible or reliable from engaging in the business at all in Canada; and still more strange if such Parliament could not regulate these companies in the carrying on of their business in Canada by requiring them to make deposits of money as an assurance of their reliability and take out a license and subject themselves to inspection or otherwise as Parliament may decide.\nAs a fact ever since the year following Confederation, now more than forty years ago, Parliament has assumed the right so to legislate and the legislation for the past 25 years at least has been substantially in the form the constitutionality of which is now challenged.\nThe subject-matter of the legislation in question is of a Dominion and not of a provincial character. In its Dominion aspect it is not certainly within any of the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures and so far as companies incorporated by these legislatures can competently and legally operate and carry on their business they are exempted from the operation of the legislation.\nThe policy of regulating the business of insurance throughout Canada by foreign companies as well as Dominion companies to the extent of requiring deposits from them as a guarantee of their responsibility and subjecting them to inspection and to the obligation of obtaining a license to operate has been a feature of Dominion legislation since 1868, the year following the Union. It is beyond doubt regulative legislation only and its subject-matter may, I think, be appropriately described as the trade or business of insurance. The fact that with provincial companies excepted the legislation applies to foreign companies and to Dominion companies only and that it has remained unchallenged as to its constitutionality until now is not without significance and weight.\nThe business of life insurance alone in Canada carried on by the companies Dominion and foreign which come within the purview of the Act in question has to-day reached proportions which may well be described as enormous if not colossal. As to the mere amount of this assurance, it runs up into hundreds of millions of dollars. The ramifications of such business extend to every city, town, village and hamlet of the Dominion. The beneficiaries of these assurances are constantly moving from one part of the Dominion to the other. The failure of one or more of these companies carrying the enormous obligations their contracts assume in Canada would be a national disaster. Their proper regulation and the conditions on which foreign companies should be permitted to operate in Canada would seem necessary therefore from a Dominion or national standpoint. The fact that any such foreign company may limit its operation for the time to a single province would not in my opinion relieve it from compliance with the law. It is the subject-matter of its operation which brings it within the control of the Dominion legislation and not the amount of those operations or the limits within which they are carried on. This observation would also apply to persons and not companies engaging in the insurance business.\nBut it is not alone because the companies to which the section extends are Dominion and foreign, nor because of the enormous proportions and extent to which the business covered by the legislation has grown in volume and with respect to persons and properties which the subject-matter embraces affecting greatly the happiness, comfort and welfare of such a large and yearly increasing proportion of the Dominion\u2019s population, nor because some of its branches are clearly interprovincial, nor because the Dominion has exercised unchallenged legislative power with respect to it substantially in the form now before us for so many years that I hold this legislation to be valid but because the combination of these various facts and reasons convince me that the regulation and control of these insurance companies is necessary in the interests of the inhabitants of the Dominion as a whole and because I do not see how it would be possible for provincial legislation effectively to deal with the subject.\nLastly it seems to me that if the legislation is upheld under the Dominion general powers and not its enumerated ones the Prohibition Case[17], is authority that when so legislating on subject-matters which have attained national importance and affects the body politic of the Dominion the legislation is plenary and must be given effect to even if it affects subject-matters within the exclusive powers of the local legislatures.\nAs I have said, I think the subject-matter of this legislation has reached this state of national importance and in fact to a greater extent that had the sale of liquors prohibited by the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d of 1886 and the legislation with regard to the form which the regulation should take is entirely within the province of the Dominion of Canada. Having reached this conclusion as to the 4th section, it follows of course that section 70 providing sanctions for its due enforcement would also be valid.\nFor these reasons, I answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative.\nIdington J.\u2014To answer any questions involving, as these now submitted do, an accurate apprehension of the power of Parliament, we must first ask ourselves whether the power asserted can be rested upon any of the enumerated legislative powers specifically assigned by section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d or by other sections thereof to the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament.\nWhatever enactment can be rested thereon is maintainable. When it cannot be so maintained we must then ask if it touches upon any of the subject-matters assigned by section 92 or other section of the said Act to the exclusive legislative authority of the provincial legislatures.\nIf in any such case it trenches upon any of the powers thus assigned these legislatures, it is to that extent ultra vires.\nIf it can be maintained as resting solely upon the power given Parliament in section 91, over the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d of Canada, without invoking any of the enumerated powers therein, and without trenching upon any of these powers given the legislatures, then it is intra vires.\nWhat thus rests in this limitation of these words \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d in said section, I shall hereinafter refer to as the residual power of Parliament. In a sense it is exclusive, but it is not what I refer to as the exclusive power of Parliament. This latter term I apply to what may be used to override all other powers conferred by said Act.\nMy observation of the needless confusion of thought which so often exists in the minds of those dealing with the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d is my excuse for venturing to set out what seems elementary.\nCounsel in submitting the question herein and supporting the legislation challenged, correctly apprehended the great value it would be in the way of maintaining same if he could bring it within the enumerated legislative powers I first referred to and sought to rest it upon sub-section 2 of section 91, specifying \u201cThe regulation of Trade and Commerce.\u201d\nNotwithstanding all the learning gathered so carefully from dictionary, literary and legal authorities, I cannot find that the demonstration of what may in some instances be called a trade, even if insurance business fell within them in some such cases, does much to help us to interpret this phrase.\nIt has never struck me that the phrase \u201cTrade and Commerce\u201d could be properly broken into two or more pieces in order to give this sub-section its correct interpretation; and still less to make every trade, as such, subject to the exclusive authority of Parliament as a way out of the difficulty of finding an appropriate meaning for the whole phrase.\nI do not think the busy insurance agent following his trade or calling, falls any more within the scope of this sub-section than the farmer, or fisherman, or blacksmith, or grocer, or anybody else following his trade; not even the lawyer following his honest trade, and undoubtedly having much to do with commerce. Life insurance as a whole hardly seems more fitted to be classed as within the ordinary meaning of trade and commerce. And accidents, against which insurance may be had, will happen outside of acts or transactions involved in trade and commerce. Guarantees are needed in many forms, but are not entirely confined to business involving trade and commerce.\nAnd the chief branch of marine insurance, most closely related of all insurances to trade and commerce, seems to be excepted from the Act.\nIt is to be observed that this very legislation, so far as its principle of dealing with insurance companies foreign to a province is concerned, was before the court in the case of the Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[18]. And this very power over trade and commerce was there invoked to shew that the Ontario Act intituled \u201cAn Act to secure uniform conditions in Policies of Fire Insurance\u201d was ultra vires a local legislature. The nature of the power is discussed on pages 112 and 113 of that case, and on page 114 the relation of the Ontario Legislature thereto is dealt with.\nCan any one imagine that, if this power and its exclusive character overriding all local powers had been deemed to be what we are now asked to hold, the decision in that case would have been what it was and the judgment have stood so long the sheet anchor of provincial rights? I need not repeat here, but adopt what is said on pages 112 and 113, and refer in addition thereto to section 121. Why was that inserted if the Dominion Parliament was to have the sole interprovincial regulative power relative to trade and commerce? In this connection we may refer with profit to the cases in the Supreme Court of the United States interpreting the section of their Constitution giving Congress its powers, and which reads thus in subsection 3:\u2014\nTo regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes.\nThe latest decision thereon relative to this question of insurance seems to be New York Life Ins. Co. v. Cravens[19], and the court there held that the subject-matter of insurance did not fall within the term \u201ccommerce\u201d as there used. See also Paul v. Virginia[20].\nThe decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upon the subject of prohibition relative to the liquor traffic in the case of Russell v. The Queen[21], and The Attorney-General for the Dominion v. The Attorneys-General for the Provinces[22], seem to have proceeded upon the residual power in Parliament, though the court was invited there, as we are now, to rest upon the power to regulate trade and commerce.\nIt is true that in the first of these cases the court declined to specify on which ground it rested and intimated it was not to be taken as having discarded the power of trade and commerce. The chief point to be noticed in both cases is a reluctance to rely upon any of such specific powers though the subject-matter of the legislation in question there lent itself much more readily to give place to such an argument than does this Act dealing with all sorts of insurance. True it was said that Act was prohibitive and not regulative. Quite so, but must we assume that except by way of criminal legislation Parliament may prohibit anything it sees fit? Whatever may be well said of some kinds of insurance and their close relationship to the subjects of trade and commerce as being conceivably assignable in such an instrument as the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d under the description used in and for the purpose of sub-section 2, when we consider the composite character of this insurance Act it seems impossible to rest it as an entirety upon the said sub-section. And if it were permissible for purposes of interpretation to trace the genesis of its drafting we should find the present pretensions were still more unfounded than they appear from what I have urged.\nI am afraid we must put aside for the present this sub-section which has been brought out so often in despair to support doubtful arguments.\nI think the old residual power of Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, must alone be relied upon in this emergency.\nI now turn to the first question and find the sections submitted apply to persons as well as companies, and the many questions involved in this first one may be simplified and best answered by testing the validity of such legislation when applied to the individual.\nThe section 4 reads thus:\u2014\n4. In Canada, except as otherwise provided by this Act, no company or underwriters or other person shall solicit or accept any risk, or issue or deliver any receipt or policy of insurance, or grant any annuity on a life or lives, or collect or receive any premium, or inspect any risk, or adjust any loss, or carry on any business of insurance, or prosecute or maintain any suit, action or proceeding, or file any claim in insolvency relating to such business, unless it be done by or on behalf of a company or underwriters holding a license from the Minister.\nCan I say that Parliament is acting intra vires when enacting that\nno * * * person shall * * * grant any annuity on a life or lives * * * unless it be done by or on behalf of (some one) holding a license from the Minister?\nSurely if there is any civil right everybody has been supposed to have enjoyed, it is that of doing this very thing and no person but the local legislature can take it away. If it be answered, this is an insurance Act and it is not within the purview of the Act to deal with wills or ordinary contracts, I ask how or where am I to draw the line?\nI know of no such urgent situation as to take away from men their ordinary civil right even if some should expand the operation thereof beyond its daily use, and do so for other considerations than usually move thereto.\nAnd if insurance can be so treated why not everything else men engage in or can engage in?\nThis assertion of power to put everyone under the license of the Minister, does not seem to me a thing that falls, as of course by mere assertion of Parliament desiring it, within the only power whereby it may try to invade the civil rights of one living in a province.\nAnd what is true of the rights of a dweller in a province must be true also regarding the rights of all his agents acting in the same province. Each is protected by the law of the province in regard to his contracts made within same province. Their contracts in these regards as well as in every other regard are good, and cannot be invalidated by anything Parliament may try to enact but cannot.\nAll that is involved therein and in the several ways specified in said section 4, I must hold as ultra vires Parliament.\nThen as to insurance companies incorporated by a province, I think they must be held to have whilst acting in the province the same rights as the individuals I have referred to dwelling therein.\nIt was held in the case of Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Parsons[23], already referred to, that it was competent for the provincial legislature to so enact relative to the contracts of a foreign company, or of one which might be the creation of Parliament, when made in a province so enacting, that it must comply with the conditions imposed by the legislature for the form of contract, and the company be bound by what the legislature specified such contracts were to be held to mean and could not contract itself out of such act. Much more must a home company the creation of the legislature be so bound. It seems futile to suggest that Parliament can by such legislation as this invade such exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.\nIt is answered, that as to such companies the Act excepts them from its operation. I do not so read the Act. In the Act of 1868 there was an excepting provision, which was changed by the Act of 1886, 49 Vict. ch. 45, sec. 3, sub-sec. (e), so as to read more stringently in that regard and that was later amended to read as it does now in sub-sec. (b), of sec. 3, of the present Act, which is as follows:\u2014\nto any company incorporated by an Act of the legislature of the late Province of Canada, or by an Act of the legislature of any province now forming part of Canada, which carries on the business of insurance wholly within the limits of the province by the legislature of which it was incorporated, and which is within the exclusive control of the legislature of such province.\nThe clear effect of that is to exclude from the exception in favour of provincial companies, such of them as might choose, though acting within their corporate powers, to do business, for example, in the United States, and thus leave them subject to the penalties added as sanctions of the Act and make their contracts illegal if the sanction is valid.\nIn the case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[24], the question of the right of a corporate creation of a province to do anything beyond its limits was raised, in an incidental manner only, but thought to be so relevant to the issues in the case that a second and special argument was had in this court in regard thereto.\nI examined the matter then in as thorough a manner as I knew how, and came to the conclusion that corporate creations of a local legislature acting under section 92, sub-section 11, had inherent in their creation and must always have been intended to have inherent in their creation the same rights as other corporations to do business wherever it was to be found so far as the doctrine of the comity of nations would carry them unless specially restricted by the creating provision or prohibited by the foreign state or province where attempted.\nI have found no reason to change my opinion, and I adhere to the conclusion I then reached and have just re-stated. The argument is too long for repetition here even in an abbreviated form, indeed was thought by myself too long for what I was tempted (but for difference of opinion in this court and respect due thereto) to have considered as elementary law.\nEven if I was and am wrong and my reasoning therein worthless in itself, I would commend the quotation from Vattel which appears therein at page 438 as deserving the attention of any one concerned in the questions raised herein.\nIf I am right in regard to the inherent right of a provincial company to go abroad, then the attempt in this Act now in question to restrict the powers, or the exercise of the powers, so conferred is quite unwarranted.\nThe Dominion Parliament has no power to take away indirectly what it could not interfere with directly. And the curious thing is that by this very Act it clearly appears Parliament considered these provincial corporations had an inherent power to go beyond the limits of the province creating them.\nThe draftsman of the Act clearly held the same view of their capacity as I have expressed.\nElse why offer to extend to them the license of the Minister to do business throughout the Dominion? There is no thought of a re-incorporation by virtue of a license, but only of the control over and permission to a presumably duly constituted corporation competent to do business throughout the Dominion.\nOn the face of the Act the possession of such competency is attributable solely to the power of the local legislature.\nI think that section 4 so far as it thus strikes at such creations is ultra vires.\nWhen I called attention to this objection counsel did not argue that Parliament had any power to restrict the right of the provincial corporation from going abroad into a foreign state, but argued that the Act did not mean so to interfere. The language seems to me too clear to mean anything else.\nTo enable any provincial corporation doing any business in the parts of the Dominion outside its home province, this enactment requires a license. It need not get such license if its operations are confined wholly to its own province. But if it does such foreign business then it cannot be within the exception. Provincial companies doing such foreign business would, if this section were held valid, be restricted in such case from doing any business in the Dominion, including, of course, their own province. I can see no reason for the amendment unless this was its purpose.\nI must, therefore, answer the first question in the affirmative, subject to what I have to say relative to the second question and hypothetically of the whole.\nIt would be exceedingly difficult if we applied to the interpretation and construction of these sections the rule that prevails relative to illegality in a contract, to say that any one part of this section 4 could be severed from the rest. It, however, seems to me in passing upon the question of whether a statute is ultra vires or intra vires that it may sometimes be held operative so far as the power extends, and inoperative beyond, though the language used may not in its terms be clearly capable of such separation as to divide the good from the bad. This result, I suggest, may be reached by the test of its applicability to a given object or purpose. The penal clause 70 may not be quite so susceptible of such a mode of treatment.\nHowever that may be I will assume for argument\u2019s sake my construction may be wrong, and that the purpose of this first question may be to be advised relative to the power of Parliament to control by means of prohibiting contracts, or suit upon contracts, otherwise inoffensive and legal, the business of insurance by individuals domiciled in, or companies incorporated by, a province when carrying on such business in other provinces of the Dominion.\nIf anything ever has been settled relative to the powers of the Dominion and the provinces, there are two things which seem clearly so. One is that so far as the form and validity of any contract depend on the law of the place of making, they must, save in those cases arising out of and incidental to the exercise of the exclusive legislative authority embraced in the enumerated or specific powers of Parliament, conform to what the provincial legislature of that place has enacted. The other is that in regard to the form and validity of contracts so far as necessary to the full exercise and operative effect of such exclusive legislative authority as has been so assigned to Parliament, the will of Parliament is supreme, and it may rely upon or supplement or so modify the operation of the local law as (but only so far as) such exigencies require in order to accomplish its purpose.\nThe first is established by the case of The Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Parsons[25], already referred to. The second is also established by many authorities. The effect given to the use of warehouse receipts authorized by the \u201cBanking Act\u201d may illustrate this branch of these things.\nBut no decision determines how far, if at all, Parliament resting only on what I have called the residual power, as I hold it must in enacting section 4, can interfere with the power of the provincial legislatures over contract.\nThe liquor prohibition decision of necessity affected the law of contract so far as regards the sale of liquor.\nThe right to legislate relative to contracts, as now presented, was never directly touched upon in the argument so far as I can see, and the subject of property and civil rights including same, was only touched upon incidentally to finding a place for the local legislature to rest its right to prohibit, which seems to have been found in sub-section 16 of 92 relative to local matters. In the Russell Case[26] the regulation of trade and commerce was not abandoned, the criminal law was hinted at, the right to prevent dangerous things being done suggested. What all these meant or might mean was not decided. But if these measures had been treated as part of the criminal law many men would have approved that treatment as sound sense and I certainly do not see from the point of view of constitutional law, what answer could have been set up thereto. It might have fallen there quite as appropriately as the restraint of trade clauses in the Criminal Code upon which Ave decided the case of Weidman v. Shragge[27].\nHence I am not disposed to attach undue importance to the bearing on this question of contract of the last of these liquor cases so recent as 1896 and only perhaps a mere advisory opinion which the first was not.\nThe struggle in 1896 was a peculiar one. It would not, I suspect, have suited either party arguing to have the subject treated as part of the criminal law. And as to property and civil rights I would call attention to the remarks of Lord Macnaghten in the case of The Attorney-General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders\u2019 Association[28], at page 78, from which, as it bears directly upon what I am now dealing with, I quote the following:\u2014\nIndeed, if the case is to be regarded as dealing with matters within the class of subjects enumerated in No. 13, it might be questionable whether the Dominion Legislature could have authority to interfere with the exclusive jurisdiction of the province in the matter.\nIn passing I may note that at this period in Anctil v. Manufacturers\u2019 Life Ins. Co.[29], art. 2590 of the Quebec Code was held to have so fixed what might be an insurable interest that a condition in the policy making it incontestible at the end of a time which had elapsed at the death, could not validate it.\nThis insurance company was not a local company of Quebec creation.\nHaving already shewn why a man domiciled in a province must be held entitled to contract as an insurer according to the law of the province, how can one residing in one province be prevented from going into another to do likewise? Certainly there is no power given any province to prohibit a man coming there from another province for a lawful purpose. And when there he is entitled to avail himself of the protection of any law existing where he so finds himself to make any contract unless and until he has by reason of some general law of the province applicable to all men become deprived of such right.\nThere may be a local law requiring license or special qualifications to carry on his business as in the case of professional men. Or the province may possibly in general terms so limit the right of non-residents to transact a specified business as to exclude him, but yet that does not help the Dominion Parliament to assert authority to set aside or override the local law. What right has it to restrain men from passing from one province to another? Section 121 giving the absolute right to transfer the product of one\u2019s labour from one province to another free, may be incidentally referred to and imply that those doing so cannot be restrained from personally doing every act necessary to enjoy the benefit of the provision. How can Parliament or legislature interfere?\nThen in this regard where does the prohibitive power rest which every corporation is subject to when going beyond the limits of the state which created it? Is it in the province or is it in the Dominion? Or is it in both? Or is it in the former but only so until the latter has signified its will?\nIt is not difficult to distinguish between the right of the individual and the corporation. The former, as I have said, has prim\u00e2 facie the right to pass the line, but it is only by virtue of comity the latter can. And surely the power of the province to enact as to what contracts may be valid and what not, must end the matter for all practical purposes so far as the exclusive power over property and civil rights extends. As between the Dominion and foreign corporations, I can easily see how the Dominion can under its residual power prohibit the foreign corporations. But on what can it rest its alleged power to direct the admission of said corporations into the provinces against their will? And when attempting to deal with rival corporate creations of a province the difficulty seems much greater.\nSuppose, as men have advocated, the fire insurance business should be given by a province to the municipalities to undertake, just as the water supply and lighting are now so generally undertaken, and it became an object of local importance that each municipality or group of municipalities should enjoy the monopoly thereof, can it be said such a plan would be beyond the powers of a province acting under subsections 8 and 16?\nI am not prepared to say that such a thing is beyond the powers given to the provinces. And I cannot see why such an exercise of power should be controlled or trenched upon by the Dominion by virtue of anything to be found in this \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nIt has been frequently said that what cannot be enacted by a local legislature must of necessity be found within the competence of Parliament to enact. This I respectfully deny. It is in my humble opinion, beyond the scheme of our federal system to give operative effect thereto, no matter how high may be the authority laying down such dogma. It would be indeed a very simple formula for solving knotty questions.\nUniformity of law may be a most desirable thing. In the instrument creating our system this very thing is provided for by section 94, within certain limits, but subject to such conditions and limitations as to demonstrate the impossibility of such a conception being within the power of Parliament. Our school systems vary, our municipal systems vary still more. Our systems of land tenure also vary, as do our laws of inheritance and succession. Yet Parliament cannot meddle therewith.\nNo man would be bold enough to say we might create by and through Parliament, a State Church, and against the will of the legislature levy in support thereof tithes in the provinces upon property in same, though the oldest of civilized countries deem such an establishment essential. No more could Parliament in pursuance of such an establishment, add to or trench upon provincial mortmain Acts. Yet every one of these things could be dealt with by virtue of this doctrine if correct.\nIf we will bear in mind that our federal scheme has first assigned to the exclusive power of Parliament the authority to legislate on twenty-nine subject matters enumerated in section 91, besides some other things found in other sections; that subject thereto it has assigned to the legislatures the exclusive legislative authority over sixteen other matters, and only beyond these, but subject thereto and limited thereby, on such other subjects as may, without infringing thereon, be legislatively dealt with for the peace, order and good government of Canada, we will have cleared our minds on these matters and cease assuming that because a better state of law is conceivable, it must of necessity rest in Parliament. In regard to some things the power of legislation does not rest in this country.\nIn regard to other things desirable results are conceivable as possible by the co-operation of both legislatures and Parliament.\nSo far as the corporate creations of the Dominion rest upon one or more of the twenty-nine enumerated subjects over which Parliament has exclusive legislative authority, there can be no doubt of its power to authorize them to do such business as within the ambit of or resting on such basis of authority either throughout the entire Dominion or such part thereof as Parliament may choose to specify and every statute of any legislature or other law of a province though possibly operative and helpful so far as adaptable in that regard must be held null before the expression of the Parliament will in such cases when and so far as in conflict therewith.\nWhen we reflect that them go with such powers the incidentals thereof which interpretation has implied as a necessary part of same, we may faintly realize over what a vast field of possible corporate activity Parliament is supreme.\nMen are apt to be led by contemplation of these operations on that field which meet us at every turn, to the conclusion that all Dominion corporations must possess the same inherent power in relation to provincial laws or in competition with provincial corporations.\nSo far as I can see those Dominion corporations which cannot be said to rest upon one or more of the exclusive powers of the Dominion Parliament indicated above are as corporate creations of no higher order and possess no greater inherent power or right than any other, when brought in conflict with any law enacted by a legislature of a province acting within the sixteen enumerated powers in section 92 or other specific power.\nWhether Parliament may have or not under its powers over \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce\u201d the authority for directing corporations, directly related to the subjects covered by said phrase, to be permitted to enter all or any one or more of the provinces with the right to transact business therein notwithstanding there may be local regulations to the contrary, is a subject upon which I express no opinion. Indeed, I have none sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to satisfactorily express myself, and can conceive of none unless springing from some trade convention over or in respect of which Parliament might legislate.\nMy present purpose in referring thereto is merely to eliminate from the problem I am considering at least as much as possible, if not all, of what is entirely irrelevant to its solution.\nThe difficulty in this submission is that the legislation in question directly trenches upon the field of contract, and upon that field when and where not in subjection to the supreme powers of Parliament, but is to be viewed in relation only to what emanates from a residual power apt to be (and sometimes I fear has been) confused with the other yet supreme Parliamentary powers and their products.\nSubject to what I have said I think Parliament can, resting merely on its residual power, enact that any of its corporate creations may enter and transact business anywhere in the Dominion so far as in doing so it does it conformably with such laws as have been or may be enacted by any province under and pursuant to the subject matters assigned to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces.\nThe purpose of the legislation before us no doubt is so commendable that it has, therefore, stood a long time unchallenged. It had its origin in legislation of Old Canada existent at Confederation. See 23 Vict, ch. 33, and 26 Vict. ch. 43. Its purpose can be attained by the provincial legislatures each taking away from men and corporations or such class as specified, acting within the province so enacting, the power of contracting with insurers, unless and until the Dominion shall have given a license therefor.\nThen this kind of Dominion legislation if otherwise unobjectionable, having the field so cleared, could be so fitted thereto as to be made undoubtedly operative in the provinces so enacting or could be enacted conditionally upon provincial legislation being provided or found existent. This plan need not interfere with the operation of the provincial companies in their own provinces or with them being licensed by the Dominion to go elsewhere.\nI put it forward as illustrative of what may be done within the undoubted powers of Parliament and legislatures, when combined, and to shew that there is no such necessity for straining the residual power of Parliament as seems to be assumed in the theory that because we have a very large measure of self-government with distributed powers of legislation, therefore, we must only ask whether or not a given measure is within the power of the local legislatures, and if not found in its entirety there, conclude it must rest in Parliament.\nIt may be said the method I have suggested as within our powers of self-government is clumsy or difficult of execution. I answer that if the alternative of stretching the residual power of Parliament to cover all these defects is open, then there is an end of, or at least a means of ending, the federal system.\nI answer further that we already have analogous legislation in the adoption of the provincial franchise however variant it be as the basis for Parliamentary elections. Other illustrations exist.\nIt would seem very absurd to have had so many struggles renewed herein to try and bring any exercise of the power of Parliament within any of the enumerated powers of Parliament, if it has always had the power the easy formula I have referred to says it has. It, however, should never be forgotten that it was out of the need there was found for abridging the powers of Parliament that the federal scheme was begotten.\nNotwithstanding all I have said, when I seek to apply it to the case in hand I am confronted by the judgment in the case of The Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion[30], which at foot of page 581 and top of page 582, surely assumes that if it is desirable to legislate in respect of something which a province cannot, then Parliament must have the power. I quote the following therefrom:\u2014\nIn the present case, however, quite a different contention is advanced on behalf of the provinces. It is argued, indeed, that the Dominion Act authorizing questions to be asked of the Supreme Court, is an evasion of provincial rights, but not because the power of asking such questions belongs exclusively to the provinces. The real ground is far wider. It is no less than this\u2014that no Legislature in Canada has the right to pass an Act for asking such questions at all. This is the feature of the present appeal, which makes it so grave and far-reaching. It would he one thing to say that under the Canadian Constitution what has been done could be done only by a provincial legislature within its own province. It is quite a different thing to say that it cannot be done at all, being, as it is, a matter of affecting the internal affairs of Canada, and, on the face of it, regulating the functions of a Court of law, which are part of the ordinary machinery of government in all civilized countries.\nIn support of such doctrine we were referred by counsel to the judgment in the case of La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[31], which uses terms which, taken literally, might go far to support any Parliamentary legislation. It does not seem to me that the expressions thus relied upon were so clearly necessary for the decision of the case in either instance on the facts there respectively presented. But if that language (which is to be found also elsewhere) so used and referred to in these cases is to be taken as if they were final decisions demonstrating the true doctrine, the matter is ended.\nWhat I have said relative to the predominance of the enumerated exclusive powers of Parliament rests upon the declaration at the end of section 91, as follows:\u2014\nAnd any matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the Class of Matters of a local or private Nature comprised in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nI refer to this and the remarks thereupon of Lord Watson in The Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[32], at page 359, and top of page 360, as justification for the position I take. I prefer thinking his exposition there given is correct and do so all the more readily because of his high authority and unusual experience in dealing with our federal system.\nThe benefit of that is well illustrated by his correction in those pages of an earlier expression of opinion by the same court.\nThe proposition I quote above happened to be used in a case where it ought to have been present to the mind of the court that it was dealing with a subject to part of which the powers of the Dominion and the Province of Ontario through their respective legislatures had been addressed and had by concurrent action attempted a method of solving grave constitutional questions involving the limits of the power of either.\nThat seemed to me a sane method capable of expansion when public opinion had become ripe therefor. The serious part of the business so far as I am just now concerned is that Parliament having taken the matter in hand had so expanded, independently of the will of the provinces, its assertion of authority as to cover the entire ground. That assertion of authority is rested upon the grounds stated in above quotation.\nIt is largely justified in the judgment referred to by the long unquestioned use of some such power. The actual concurrence or assent of the provinces had in fact appeared in the cases of the interrogation of this court in regard to matters affecting the provinces.\nThat acquiescence was turned into an argument to maintain the propositions I have quoted.\nI am only concerned now with all these things to demonstrate the clear parallel between that instance of the assertion of Parliamentary authority and this now in hand. Each rests on the residual power of Parliament. Each has long been unquestioned. Each has been acted on for a long period. Each has had added to it as the years rolled on new legislative enlargements of accretions, if I may use such expression. Properly speaking I cannot say strength was thereby added unless I assent to the foundation as well laid. The supports of age and acquiescence seem more to favour the Act now questioned than the other.\nMy opinion has long been that there is a wide field for possible legislation which can only be effectively overtaken and good accomplished therein by such concurrent legislative action as I have adverted to and no doubt in my mind that was contemplated by our statesmen who framed this scheme of government.\nAm I to set this opinion aside in deference to expressions such as I have adverted to in the court above? Am I to adopt the easy formula I have referred to? Or may I say these judgments might have been supported on other grounds? I have already suggested such possibility but am far from being quite sure that my conception thereof in either case could meet the approval of the court.\nI can here do no more than point out the difficulty created and say that case is not this case.\nI think I must adhere to the old way which I have expressed above, of reading this written constitution.\nThe co-operative method of proceeding by concurrent legislation seems to be approved by the court above in the case of City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[33], at page 346. Yet in the Marriage Laws Case[34], where the terms of the instrument, as it seems to me, lent itself in a peculiar manner to such a mode of treatment, no countenance was given my suggestion in that regard and its application was swept aside so far as a mere advisory opinion can do so.\nThe criminal law jurisdiction of Parliament was also relied upon herein. My suggestion of its aid in the Marriage Laws Case34 does not seem to have evoked much enthusiastic support, though in that connection it seemed to me much more appropriate than here.\nThe truth is this \u201cInsurance Act\u201d was obviously not a piece of criminal legislation or intended as such. The mere penal sanction given to it cannot add to its jurisdictional strength, unless clearly resting upon that subject of jurisdiction. Local legislatures are given the like power and their Acts were given by 31 Vict. ch. 71, sec. 3 (Dom.) even greater sanctions. I may observe that that itself was a very early instance of what I am calling, for want of a better phrase, concurrent or co-operative legislation.\nIf the power to enact the section now in question existed, probably a wilful contravention of it might be indictable. But that jurisdiction to enact has to be found first in such aspect.\nI must answer, for reasons given above, the first question in the affirmative, and pass now to the second question.\nIt is quite clear without any elaborate argument that an Act dealing with insurance which may or may not have any relation to trade and commerce and securing the people of Canada from the possibly disastrous affects of trusting entirely to the honour of foreign companies over which they have no control and of which they may know little, can be enacted by Parliament. Parliament in so enacting does not trench upon any of the subjects assigned to the provinces and, therefore, in so far as a legitimate subject of legislation, seems to act within its powers.\nThe distinction between the right of one dwelling in or being within a province, and the right of a foreign company, or an alien dwelling in a foreign country, to come or send his agents into Canada against the national will as expressed by Parliament, seems as broad as it is possible to conceive of, relative to such things as involved in settling the limits of jurisdiction of the Dominion and the provinces.\nThe right to contract does not exist until the would-be actor is in the province.\nI see no infringement of any local law relative to contract which can be implied in this aspect of the matter and such restriction of civil right as there may be is implied in the residual power or it is useless.\nFor the sake of brevity, clearness and simplicity, I have used contracts as a test, but only as emblematic of all that exclusive domain assigned the legislatures over the sixteen enumerated subjects in respect of which they, in my opinion, by the express language of the Act are paramount over everything that may rest in the residual power of Parliament when the twenty-nine enumerated subjects of section 91 and other specific powers have been exhausted, though Parliament may by virtue of such residual power enact any law a colony can, conditional and dependent upon and to be given vitality and operative efficiency by the legislatures in their respective provinces, or by their existent legislation.\nI must answer the second question in the affirmative, if and so far as it may be possible to give any operative effect to a clause bearing upon the alien foreign companies as well as others within the terms of which is embraced so much that is clearly ultra vires.\nSubject to the qualifications and limitations expressed in the foregoing opinion, I answer the questions herein submitted as follows:\u2014\n(1) Are sections 4 and 70 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d or any or what part or parts of the said sections ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n(2) Does section 4 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d operate to prohibit an insurance company incorporated by a foreign state from carrying on the business of insurance within Canada if such company do not hold a license from the Minister under the said Act, and if such carrying on of business is confined to a single province?\nAnswer\u2014I must answer the second question in the affirmative if and so far as it may be possible to give any operative effect to a clause bearing upon the alien foreign companies, as well as others within the terms of which is embraced so much that is clearly ultra vires.\nDuff J.\u2014It is contended on behalf of the Dominion that the enactments in question can be supported as a valid exercise of the legislative authority of the Dominion either (1) under the introductory clause of section 91, or (2) under No. 2 of the enumerated heads of that section \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d First, as to the power of the Dominion under No. 2 of section 91:\u2014\nI think this does not embrace the regulation of occupations as such. \u201cTrades,\u201d the pursuit of which constitutes a part of the trade and commerce of the country, may very well be subject to regulation under this power but only as branches of trade and commerce. The regulation of occupations as such seems in its nature to be a matter rather of local than of general importance and I think it requires some straining of the language of No. 2 to bring that matter within it. I do not think that the various kinds of business which are comprehended under the term \u201cinsurance\u201d as used in the Act in question can be said to be part of the trade and commerce of the country; or that the transactions dealt with by section 4 of the Act are operations of trade or commerce in the sense in which those words are used in this provision.\nAs to the introductory clause: I think the Act cannot be sustained as having been passed in exercise of this power for two reasons. I think that the legislature of any one of the provinces could have passed an Act containing provisions substantially identical with the provisions in question (limited, of course, in its application to the province) under the authority given by section 92 to make laws in relation to \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province.\u201d\nI think that legislation declaring the qualifications required to enable persons\u2014natural or artificial\u2014in any given province to enter into contracts of the various kinds embraced under \u201cpolicy of insurance\u201d as defined in section 2 would be legislation in relation to civil rights. If I am correct in this the exception found in the introductory clause of section 91 excludes the subject-matter of this section from the general authority of the Dominion.\nIf the Act is not an Act relating to civil rights then it is, in my judgment, an Act relating to matters which in each province are \u201cmerely local or private,\u201d as those words have been construed by the Judicial Committee in the Privy Council in different cases. On behalf of the Dominion it is said that the object of the Act is to require companies and persons engaged in carrying on the business of insurance to provide security for the performance of their obligations; and that this being a subject of general importance the Dominion is entitled to deal with it by legislation applying uniformly to all the provinces. The decisions upon the \u201cdrink legislation\u201d are relied upon as authorities for this proposition.\nI have already given my reasons in my opinion in the Companies\u2019 Reference for thinking that the decisions on the \u201cdrink legislation\u201d afford no positive rule of general application. They do lay down, however, a negative rule that the Dominion cannot under the general power validly legislate for the whole Dominion in respect of matters which in each province are substantially of local interest. I have not been able to understand upon what ground it can be contended that the matter of the qualifications necessary to entitle a corporation or natural person in any single province to engage in transactions of the kind dealt with in section 4 (read in the light of section 2) is not a matter of substantially local interest in that province. The Act, it must be observed, exempts from its operation any company incorporated by the legislature of a province for the purpose of carrying on the business of insurance within that province alone; but section 4 has its full operation with regard to individuals and unincorporated associations; that is to say, with respect to the carrying on of the business of insurance wholly within a single province the Act draws a distinction between incorporated companies and natural persons acting either individually or in association with others leaving the former free to do the things mentioned in section 4, but with regard to the latter requiring that they shall comply with the regulations of the Act. Such legislation seems clearly to be directed to these matters as matters of \u201csubstantially local\u201d interest in each of the provinces.\nI do not think that the fact that the business of insurance has grown to great proportions affects the question in the least. The importance of some such provisions as this Act contains may be conceded. The question is: On what ground can it be contended that this is a matter which because of its importance has ceased to be substantially of local interest? The matter of the solvency and honesty of persons assuming fiduciary relations is at least as important as the matter of the solvency of the insurance companies. It would be difficult to argue that the qualifications of trustees and executors and financial agents is a matter with which the Dominion could deal by a uniform law applicable to the whole Dominion. The Act before us illustrates the extremes to which people may be carried when acting upon the theory that because a given matter is large and of great public importance it is for that reason a matter which is not substantially local in each of the provinces. The business of \u201cguarantee insurance\u201d by section 2(w) includes the executing of \u201cbonds in legal actions and proceedings,\u201d and section 4 would appear to prohibit the making of such contracts by persons who are not licensees under the Act. That seems very obviously a purely local matter when the proceedings are in the provincial courts; but if it once be admitted that the Dominion can prescribe the qualifications necessary to entitle anybody to enter into a contract of life insurance or fire insurance it is very difficult to see why it cannot also regulate the qualifications of persons entitled to enter into contracts of suretyship. Such legislation, in my judgment, involves a degree of interference with matters \u201csubstantially local\u201d that could not have been contemplated by the framers of the Act. The fact that this legislation has been in force since 1868 was dwelt on by Mr. Newcombe. It is a circumstance for consideration, no doubt, (although the law as it now stands is very much broader than it was down to 1910,) but it must be observed that when the Act was introduced it was opposed by Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Blake on the ground that the subject of insurance was a subject committed exclusively to the provinces, and the Act passed through Parliament on the assumption that the business of insurance carried on locally, that is to say, in a single province, was not interfered with. The Act, in truth, has until recently, at all events, never been enforced except as against Dominion companies and extra-Canadian companies.\nThe contention that the Act is criminal legislation is disposed of by the report of the Judicial Committee[35] upon the reference relating to the Dominion Licences Act, 1883. Precisely the same argument was with much greater reason (see preamble to the Act) there advanced and rejected, the legislation being held to be ultra vires.\nTo the first question my answer is \u201cYes.\u201d\nTo the second question my answer is \u201cYes\u201d if intra vires.\nAnglin J.\u2014The subject of insurance is not specifically enumerated as a head of legislative jurisdiction either in section 91 or in section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d The right to carry on that business is (at all events prim\u00e2 facie) a civil right in each province of Canada within the meaning of \u201ccivil rights\u201d in clause 13 of section 92.\nSection No. 4 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d undoubtedly purports to interfere with and to regulate the exercise of that civil right by \u201ccompanies, underwriters and persons.\u201d Section 70 is ancillary to, and has been passed as a means of enforcing, and to provide a sanction for, section 4. It is not an independent enactment and it is conceded that if section 4 is held to be ultra vires section 70 must fall with it.\nA provincial company which carries on its business \u201cwholly within the limits of the province by the legislature of which it was incorporated\u201d is the only material exception from the prohibitions imposed by section 4. A provincial company which does business in any foreign country, although it should not operate in any part of Canada other than the province by the legislature of which it was incorporated, is not excepted. Neither is a person nor an association of underwriters whose operations are confined strictly within the province of which he or they are residents.\nIt is sought to uphold this incursion by the Dominion Parliament into the field of civil rights on the ground that it is legislation either\n(a) In respect of aliens. (b) in the nature of criminal law, (c) in regard to trade and commerce, or (d) upon a matter which is \u201cof Canadian interest and importance.\u201d\nIf it can be fairly brought under (a), (b), or (c), subject perhaps to what Lord Atkinson recently said in regard to (c) in the Montreal Street Railway Case[36], at pages 343-4, with which, however, must be compared Lord Watson\u2019s language in the Prohibition Case[37], at pages 362-3, the paramount jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament in regard to the subjects of legislation enumerated in section 91 might properly be invoked to support it. If, however, the legislation in question is not properly ascribable to (a), (b), or (c) and it becomes necessary to resort to (d) the case for the validity of the statute is vastly more difficult.\nIt is only necessary to read the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d very cursorily to realize that in passing it nothing was farther from the mind of Parliament than an exercise of its jurisdiction in respect to \u201cAliens.\u201d The Act does not distinguish between alien companies and companies incorporated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom or by the Legislatures of the Canadian provinces (subject to the exception noted above) nor between citizens of Canada or subjects of the Empire and those of foreign states. \u201cThe leading feature\u201d\u2014\u201cthe pith and substance of the enactments\u201d of section 4 is wholly foreign to legislation in respect of \u201caliens and naturalization\u201d and that head of power may not be invoked to sustain it. Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia v. Bryden[38], at page 587.\nNeither can the provisions of sections 4 and 70 be ascribed to the exercise of legislative jurisdiction over \u201ccriminal law.\u201d No criminal offence is created. Fitting penalties are attached to breaches of prohibitions of a regulative character, not as providing for the punishment of crimes, but as incidental to the regulative legislation, much as a provincial legislature may provide for the contravention of its enactments under clause 15 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d This legislation is not criminal law in the sense in which that phrase is used in clause 27 of section 91.\nThe argument based on \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce,\u201d while perhaps more plausible, appears upon consideration to be equally fallacious. Whether the business of insurance can ever properly be spoken of as a trade is at least doubtful. But, read, as it must be, in connection with the word \u201ccommerce,\u201d with which it is associated, I think it reasonably clear that the word \u201ctrade\u201d in clause 2 of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d does not cover the business of insurance. The weight of authority certainly supports that view. If, however, insurance is a trade in the ordinary sense of that term, having regard to what has been said as to the scope and meaning of clause 2 of section 91, in such cases as Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Parsons[39], I think that under it Parliament is not empowered to regulate the conduct of any single trade or business in the provinces or to prescribe the conditions on which it may be carried on. That seems to me to be so purely a matter of civil rights in each province, something so essentially local that it appertains exclusively to provincial jurisdiction. The regulation of trade and commerce in clause 2 of section 91 should be given a construction which will preclude its being invoked to justify Dominion legislation trenching upon the provincial field. This I take to be the meaning of Lord Atkinson\u2019s observation in the Montreal Street Railway Case[40], at pages 343-4; so read it is reconcilable with what Lord Watson said in the Prohibition Case[41]. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the validity of sections 4 and 70 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d cannot be upheld under the power conferred on the Dominion for \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d\nIn the Prohibition Case41 Lord Watson laid down very clearly the proposition that Dominion legislation not ascribable to one of the enumerated heads of jurisdiction under section 91, but dependent wholly on the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d provision\nought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92.\nIn the Montreal Street Railway Case40, at pp. 348, 360, Lord Atkinson repeats and emphasizes this view. Yet in the Prohibition Case41, after pointing out that the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to enact the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d had been rested on the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d provision rather than on \u201ccriminal law\u201d and could not be sup- ported under \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce,\u201d Lord Watson says, at p. 367, that in so far as the provisions of the provincial \u201cLocal Option Act\u201d (upheld as an exercise of legislative power by the Province of Ontario under either clause 13 or clause 16 of section 92) come into collision with the provisions of the Canadian Act they must yield and remain in abeyance until the Canadian Act is repealed. In the same judgment his Lordship had already said (p. 361) that\nsome matters in their origin local and provincial might attain such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion and to justify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation or abolition in the interest of the Dominion. But great care must be observed in distinguishing between that which is local and provincial, and therefore within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, and that which has ceased to be merely local or provincial and has become matter of national concern in such sense as to bring it within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThis judgment rests upon the view that when a matter primarily of civil rights has attained such dimensions that it \u201caffects the body politic of the Dominion\u201d and has become \u201cof national concern,\u201d it has, in that aspect of it, not only ceased to be \u201clocal and provincial,\u201d but has also lost its character as a matter of \u201ccivil rights in the province\u201d and has thus so far ceased to be subject to provincial jurisdiction that Dominion legislation upon it under the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d provision does not trench upon the exclusive provincial field and is, therefore, valid and paramount.\nAs I understood him, counsel for the Dominion contended at bar that if there would, upon any state of facts, be jurisdiction to enact the legislation in question the existence of that state of facts must be assumed in favour of its validity. Had Parliament expressly declared the existence of such a state of facts, whatever might be the awkwardness, inconvenience and difficulty of inquiring into and passing upon the truth of such a declaration, in the absence of such a facultative provision as is found in clause (c) of sub-section 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d in regard to \u201cWorks,\u201d I incline very strongly to the view that the declaration of Parliament could not be taken as conclusive upon the question of its jurisdiction. The \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d however, does not contain such a declaration. Without it, although according to the view of it expressed by Lord Watson in The Prohibition Case[42], the decision upholding the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d would appear to rest upon a somewhat similar assumption, I know of no ground upon which it can be even plausibly argued that, merely because such an assumption is essential to the validity of an Act of Parliament, a matter so distinctly of civil rights in the province as the right to carry on a particular business and the conditions upon which that right may be exercised should, without any evidence of facts justifying such an inference, be deemed to have lost that character and to have become so much a matter of national concern that exclusive provincial jurisdiction over it had been superseded by Dominion control under the power to legislate for the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d of Canada. If such an assumption should be made\u2014if indeed the Parliament of Canada could by an appropriate declaration conclusively establish the existence of a state of facts upon which such a transfer of legislative jurisdiction would occur \u2014 the autonomy of the province would be entirely at its mercy and there would be few subjects of civil rights upon which it might not displace the provincial power of legislation.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that section 4 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d taken as a whole, is at all events prim\u00e2 facie] ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Excluding their application to Dominion companies and to certain companies incorporated by, or under the authority of, the legislature of the late Province of Canada, which is of comparatively slight importance, I find no sufficient ground for distinguishing between its several prohibitions which would all appear to be tainted with the vice of unwarranted interference with the exclusive jurisdiction over civil rights conferred on the provincial legislatures. Section 70, as already stated, falls with section 4.\nI would, therefore, upon the case as submitted, answer the first question in the affirmative as to the whole of sections 4 and 70, except in their application to companies incorporated by or under the authority of the Dominion Parliament, and to companies incorporated by or under the authority of the legislature of the late Province of Canada for the purpose of carrying on business in a territory not wholly comprised either within the Province of Ontario or the Province of Quebec.\nTo the second question I would answer\u2014It would do so if intra vires.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question that we have to consider is whether the Dominion Parliament can regulate the insurance business.\nThe business of insurance is not necessarily a trade. The large companies that are carrying out that business are, generally speaking, commercial ventures with an object of gain or profit for their shareholders. But alongside of that we have the Mutual Benefit Insurance Association, which is entirely beneficial, we have also in the large railway and other companies an insurance fund for the employees to which the employees themselves and their employers contribute that could certainly not rank as commercial enterprise and there is the contract of indemnity made by insurers which can scarcely be considered a trading contract.\nIt is true that the Dominion insurance law as it stands to-day does not undertake to control those mutual companies incorporated by local statutes. But if the existing law is declared constitutional nothing then would prevent the Federal Parliament undertaking to regulate those insurance associations in the same way as they are legislating to-day with regard to individuals. The contention on the part of the Dominion Parliament is that their legislative power rests on their right to regulate trade and commerce, to legislate with regard to aliens and naturalization and the criminal matters.\nThe claim as to criminal legislation was not strongly pressed at bar, but was simply mentioned. It cannot be stated that this insurance legislation has in view the creation of any new crime. It is not so worded. We might say the same thing concerning the naturalization idea. That legislation has certainly not for its object to give rights and powers to aliens, and the fact that foreign insurance companies could come and do business in Canada under certain conditions could certainly not be considered as legislation of a naturalization nature. The only strong claim that can be made for the validity of this law is that it falls under sub-section 2 of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d\nIt is contended on the part of the provinces that the insurance contract is essentially a civil right and the Dominion insurance legislation virtually wipes out the sub-section 13 of section 92 as far as insurance business is concerned.\nIf the power to regulate trade and commerce gives the power to regulate a particular trade and commerce then it follows that the Federal Parliament would have the authority to determine the nature of the insurance contracts and the laws of the province in that respect would be of no concern. (Tennant v. Union Bank[43].) It has been decided by the Privy Council on the contrary in Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Parsons[44], that statutory provincial legislation may be passed to determine the nature of the contract that insurance companies may make.\nIt seems to me that if the authors of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d intended to put insurance under federal control they would have mentioned it as they have done for banking, weights and measures, bills of exchange, interest, patents and copyrights. The special enumeration of those subjects does not necessarily preclude any others being included in the provisions of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d but it goes a long way to shew how the insurance question was considered. Besides the existing legislation at the time of Confederation and the proceedings of the Quebec Conference shew very conclusively that the matter of insurance pertains to provincial legislation.\nUnder the Union of Upper and Lower Canada the matter was considered so much a question of local interest that those two provinces had each their own mutual insurance law. See Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860, ch. 68; and Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, 1859, ch. 52.\nThe chapter 68 of the Lower Canada Statutes was under the title \u201cJoint Stock Companies,\u201d and the Upper Canada legislation was under the title \u201cMunicipal Institutions.\u201d\nThe Commissioners appointed for the Codification of civil laws of Quebec in their 7th report dealt with the insurance law and enacted the articles 2468 and following of the Code, which cover the whole subject.\nThey considered the insurance law as a matter of civil law.\nThat report was made and discussed in Parliament at about the same time the Confederation resolutions were framed and discussed.\nIt is to be noticed that in 1864, at the Quebec Conference of the delegates of the provinces the question of insurance was mentioned. A proposition which carried was at first made that the regulation and the incorporation of fire and life insurance companies should be under the legislative control of the Federal Parliament; but a few days later that proposition was struck out. (Pope, Confederation Documents, pp. 30 and 88.)\nThe only inference to be drawn from those facts is that the insurance laws are pertaining to civil rights and that the subject was in the opinion of the Fathers of Confederation a matter that should be under the legislative control of the provinces.\nWhat is the scope of the power to regulate trade and commerce? The regulation of trade and commerce in sub-section 2 of section 91 refers to political arrangements or interprovincial trade and perhaps to the trade generally. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[45], at page 111. The commercial relations with foreign nations or with the British Empire are of Federal concern. The question whether our country should be under a free trade or a protectionist policy pertains to the central Parliament; but the regulation of a particular trade could not be done under that section and we have in that regard the authority of the Imperial Parliament. By the Act of Union of England and Scotland (6 Anne, ch. 6) it is provided that all subjects of the United Kingdom should have \u201cfull freedom and intercourse of trade and navigation,\u201d and that all parts of the United Kingdom should be under the same prohibitions, restrictions and regulations of trade.\nThe Imperial Parliament has passed laws affecting and regulating specific trades in one part of the United Kingdom only, without it being supposed that it violated the Union. Laws like those relating to bankruptcy and sale of liquors vary in Scotland and England.\nI am of the opinion that under the sub-section 2 of section 91, of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d the Canadian Parliament cannot undertake to regulate any specific trade.\nThe section 4 of the Dominion \u201cInsurance Act\u201d that requires all persons to take a permit before making any contract is ultra vires and the section 70 which imposes a penalty on those that would carry on the business of insurance without taking that license is also illegal.\nWe are asked by a second question to state whether the above section 4 applies to foreign companies. I think there is no doubt as to this section applying to foreign companies.\nThen my answers to questions referred to us would be as follows:\u2014\nQuestion I.\nAnswers.\nAre sections 4 and 70 of the \u201cInsurance Act of 1910,\u201d or any and what part or parts of the said sections ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThose two sections are ultra vires.\nQuestion 2.\nDoes section 4 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d operate to prohibit an insurance company incorporated by a foreign state from carrying on the business of insurance within Canada if such company do not hold a license from the Minister under the said Act and if such carrying on of the business is confined to a single province?\nYes, if intra vires.\n[1] Attorney-General for Ontario v.

Denman (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Clover Bar Coal Company (Defendants) Respondents\n1913: March 3, 4; 1913: October 14.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nCompany law\u2014Agreement by directors\u2014Onerous contract\u2014Non-disclosure to shareholders\u2014Breach of contract\u2014Damages\u2014Settlement of accounts\u2014Appeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Reference to master\u2014 Final judgment. After some subscriptions for stock had been received and the company was about to offer other stock for public subscription, a meeting of the directors was held at which the plaintiff, then one of the directors and the company's manager, resigned his office as a director and was appointed sales agent for the company's output of coal for five years from that date, at a liberal scale of remuneration, with the exclusive right to make such sales in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. At the same time an arrangement was made by which the other directors derived advantages in regard to certain matters in dispute, respecting the affairs of the company, between them and the plaintiff. The material facts and circumstances connected with these arrangements were not disclosed to the shareholders who then held stock in the company nor to other persons who subsequently subscribed for shares of its stock.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (7 D.L.R. 96: 2 West. W.R. 986; 22 W.L.R. 128), that, as the plaintiff and his co-directors were in a fiduciary position and complete disclosure of the circumstances in regard to the making of the contract had not been made to all the shareholders, present and future, the agreement was not binding upon the company.\nThe order in the judgment appealed from directing that, on taking the accounts between the parties, an allowance should be made to the plaintiff, on the basis of quantum meruit, for services rendered by him while in the employ of the company was not disturbed. Per Fitzpatrick C.J., and Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Where the judgment sought to be reviewed has finally disposed of one of the issues, forming a distinct and separate ground of action, the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. La Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur (40 Can. S.C.R. 139), and McDonald v. Belcher ([1904] A.C. 429), followed; Hesseltine v. Nelles (47 Can. S.C.R. 230), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] by which the judgment of Stuart J., at the trial, was set aside in respect to the damages awarded thereby, the plaintiff's claim therefor disallowed, and the judgment varied in certain other respects.\nThe action was brought by the appellant against the company and A. W. Denman and H. E. R. Rogers, shareholders and directors of the company, to recover damages for breach of an agreement granting him the exclusive rights as agent for the sale of the company's output of coal, in the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and also to recover moneys expended by him, as manager, on behalf of the company in the management of its business. The circumstances in which the agreement was made are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThe judgment, at the trial, in favour of the plaintiff ordered re-payment of the moneys expended by him as manager on the company's account and directed a reference for the ascertainment of the amount of the damages. On an appeal by the defendants, the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed the trial court judgment in respect of damages, disallowed the plaintiff's claim, and varied the order as to re-payment of the moneys expended by directing that the amount should be included in the general accounts between the parties and that an allowance, on the basis of quantum meruit, should be made for services rendered by the plaintiff while in the employ of the company.\nOn the 18th February, 1913,\nW. L. Scott, for respondents, moved to quash the appeal, for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the judgment appealed from, though final in regard to some of the issues, left other issues undecided upon the reference to the master for taking accounts and assessment of damages. At the same time, in case it was held that there was jurisdiction, Mr. Scott moved for an order giving him leave to amend the cross-appeal by the respondents on their counterclaim against the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar opposed the motion, and judgment thereon was reserved.\nThe appeal was heard on the merits on the 3rd and 4th March, 1913.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the -Supreme Court of Canada from that portion of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta which disallowed his claim for damages. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that, in taking the accounts, the moneys alleged to have been expended on behalf of the company by the plaintiff should not be credited to him against the claims of the defendants, also as to the manner in which it was directed that the conveyance of certain coal lands assigned by him to the company should be dealt with, and, likewise, in regard to the credit to be given to the plaintiff, on the basis of quantum meruit, for services rendered by him during the time he was acting as sales agent for the company. S. B. Woods K.C. and O. M. Biggar for the appellant.\nJ. H. Leech K.C. and W. L. Scott for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The contract of the 27th of June, 1908, between these parties, sued upon herein, was negotiated for and verbally concluded whilst appellant was one of the three directors of the respondent company, and its manager. He had been its promoter and, with his fellow directors, its founder. They had got others to subscribe for stock and were seeking subscribers for that as yet unallotted and open to be taken by the public.\nThese men having, under such circumstances, reached an agreement between themselves met as a board on said date and what they did is tersely stated in the appellant's factum, as follows:\u2014\nA meeting of the directors was held on the 27th June, 1908, at which the sales agreement was ratified, the plaintiff's resignation as director and secretary-treasurer accepted, the transfers of shares approved and resolutions passed that one Finch, an employee of Rogers in Winnipeg, be appointed secretary-treasurer, and that Rogers be empowered to employ some one to keep the books. This he never did and they continued to be kept by the plaintiff until the following February.\nThe contract thus produced gave the appellant for five years from the following 1st September the unusual commission of fifty cents a ton upon the sales of all the company's output of coal from a mine near Edmonton which could be sold in the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and a large part of Manitoba. The other terms did not of necessity impose any very formidable risk on the part of the appellant, and he had the option of terminating the contract on two months' notice. The company could not end it unless appellant made default in carrying out his part of its terms for two months.\nThe proposition that such a contract made by one holding the position of a director is voidable does not seem to permit of much doubt; unless the power to do so has been expressly given by its charter, or unless and until the shareholders concerned have been consulted, and ratified it.\nNor could the resignation of the directorship add much to the strength of such a contract when the proceedings relative thereto were had upon the express understanding that the resignation was to be contemporaneous with the formal execution of the contract.\nAnd when, as here, the whole business, including the execution of the contract, depended upon a compact between the directors whereby those remaining such were, as the price of their assent, to get satisfaction from the appellant for claims he had repudiated up to then and the purpose of all was then to invite new subscriptions for stock and unload the burthen of this contract upon the public, I do not think it could be maintained against the will of a single shareholder then in existence or who might have become such pursuant to such contemplated invitation, without full disclosure having been made to him of the facts.\nYet such seems, on the admitted facts, to be so clearly appellant's position in this case that it might have simplified matters and saved laborious analysis of evidence relative to the chief ground taken by the respondent to have had this simple proposition briefly taken and maintained.\nI think, possibly, it is within the exact ground taken, which is that there was a fiduciary relation between the appellant and the company, and between him and his co-adventurers, which made it incumbent on him to shew that the contract was fair and reasonable and the result of full disclosure on his part of all he knew which might, if known, be reasonably supposed to have influenced the minds of those contracted with.\nA director has been often said to stand as a trustee, and, if any quarrel has been made with the application of that term and \"agent\" is substituted, he so stands that if a contract made by him with his company is, as I have already said, unless in the excepted cases which have been referred to, voidable, and not one of which he can claim a profit. The appellant has, therefore, having failed to bring himself within any of the exceptions, including the fairness of the contract to which I am about to advert, no right to the damages he claims.\nThat alone should answer his action and this appeal.\nHe claims, however, with a certain degree of plausibility, that there were only himself and his fellow directors concerned, and that they each got substantial advantages as the result of the compact made between each of them and him, and, as we cannot herein restore him that which they got from him, we ought not to give relief.\nI answer \u2014 that is just what renders his case the more offensive, and looks so like the bribery of his fellow-directors, inducing them to enter upon the negotiations for this contract, and, indeed, the causal reason or motive for its existence, and its manifest advantages in favour of the appellant, and its features detrimental to the company's interests; and all intended to be unloaded upon the public invited to subscribe.\nThey were all anxious for new subscribers, and got them we are told; and, having got them according to their plans and desires, they, as part of the respondent, must be protected, whatever happens appellant or his fellow delinquents. They all forgot the duty a director owes in such cases to the future as well as to the existent shareholders.\nI incline to think it is impossible by any evidence in this case to overcome the vicious nature of the transaction upon which the contract sued upon must rest. We have, however, not to rest upon that alone, which was, perhaps, not fully argued, but upon the failure of the appellant to justify himself within the narrower ground taken.\nThe appellant lived in the neighbourhood of the mine, had managed the business throughout from the time he had got, prior to the incorporation, a personal option for the purchase of the property, and the others lived at great distances from the scene of operations. He represented, amongst other things, to his fellow directors that the expense of producing the coal from the mine had been for the years 1907 and part of 1908, anterior to April of last year, from ninety-six cents to $1.05 a ton.\nThe respondent charges that the contract was in- duced by this representation and that the cost had been and continued to be much greater.\nI think the weight of evidence goes to shew that this representation, which it was practically admitted had been made, but is presented in another light, was a most material consideration under the circumstances, was not well-founded, and, hence, so unfair that a fiduciary agent relying upon a contract, evidently based thereon, cannot maintain it.\nIt may be that the estimates which appear in the judgment of Mr. Justice Beck, and adopted by at least one judge in the court below, may be such as might be varied by a close and exhaustive analysis of the evidence. I do not propose to enter upon such an exhaustive inquiry as would settle exactly which view was right, for it would, in any event, leave a material difference at best, doubtful and unexplained or inexplicable between the actual cost and that so represented.\nThe burden of explaining rested upon the appellant. He, while practically admitting the representation, ought to have been able to shew in a more satisfactory manner than his evidence discloses exactly what the cost of production had actually been, and to justify his representation much better than he has done. The time in question was not long. The quantity of coal in question, which was only a little over thirty thousand tons, rendered the problem comparatively easy to solve in a better or clearer way than the appellant has done, especially seeing he had remained in charge for months of the time after that period up to which his representation extended.\nThe learned trial judge, though disposed to minimize the nature and effect of the representation, does not find the charge unfounded. He chiefly proceeds on the ground that there was not prompt repudiation, and that, in fact, there was such acquiescence as to debar the respondent from complaining.\nThe operations of the contract ran from 1st September, 1908, to 1st March, 1909, when it was repudiated.\nHaving regard to the fact that those most concerned lived at great distances from the mine and seat of business and, in reason, might only have become alive to the actual facts from the results discovered when the appellant's managership ceased, it seems to me there is no such evidence of acquiescence after discovery as to form a bar to the present complaint. Indeed, there was no discovery, or likely possibility thereof, save from the experience got from results which proved how delusive the representation must have been. And the long period over which appellant seems to have acquiesced in the repudiation, even if conditional, renders it difficult to restore him to such rights as he might have had under the contract.\nMeantime, whilst he was acquiescing in this repudiation, others were taking stock in the company and must be entitled to some sort of consideration, and presumed to have acted upon the objectionable contract having been put an end to.\nSurely they are entitled through the company to say that one who rested content for nearly a whole year without giving any sign of warning to them, or urgent insistence in regard to his rights under what seems to have been an onerous contract cannot now be restored to his original position.\nThe application of the principle of acquiescence may not, on either set of facts, settle the rights of either party herein arising out of the peculiar condition of things the evidence discloses, but, certainly, cannot help appellant.\nThe learned judge properly points out that Rogers seemed almost to have forgotten the representation. If he alone were to be considered that might have furnished an effectual answer.\nThe recklessness, to put it mildly, of such an influential director, is neither proper basis of a contract nor helpful in supporting it, when otherwise unsupportable, by reason of others being interested.\nThe second or tentative bargain substituted for the one I have dealt with is properly found terminable at will.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The cross-appeal, or notice of motion therefor, ought to share the same fate, for the judgment below seems to give no more than is right, if, indeed, so much.\nThe costs of the motion to quash, which must be dismissed, should be fixed at fifty dollars and deducted from the costs allowed respondent.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in dismissing the appeal and cross-appeal with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014If Rogers, A. W. Denman, Robertson and the plaintiff had been the sole shareholders in the defendant company when the agreement of the 27th June, 1908, was made, and if there had then been no intention to bring in other shareholders, or if other shareholders had been brought in only after full disclosure of all the material facts and circumstances connected with the making of that agreement, I should hesitate before rejecting the view of Stuart J. that the company had not the right to repudiate it when and as it did.\nBut that agreement was made between persons standing in a fiduciary relation to the company. It was made concurrently with, if not as part of, and in consideration for a transaction by which Rogers and A. W. Denman obtained personal benefits from the plaintiff. It gave to him, at the expense of the company, an extravagantly advantageous bargain. It was admittedly obtained upon representations of fact made by him, which were unquestionably most material, and which, if not proved by the defendants to have been false, as I rather think they have been, have certainly not been satisfactorily established to have been true by the plaintiff, on whom that burden of proof clearly lay. There were other shareholders at the time the bargain was made some of whom, no doubt, have ceased to be interested in the company. It was then intended that shares should be offered for public subscription and, in fact, a very considerable amount of the company's stock has since been disposed of. There is no suggestion that there was, either to the persons (other than the plaintiff and the interested directors) who held shares when the agreement was made, or to the persons who subsequently acquired shares, such full disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the making of it and such express or tacit ratification by them as would be necessary to render it binding upon them.\nWhatever might be urged, were the question one between Rogers, A. W. Denman and Robertson on the one side and the plaintiff on the other, I have not been convinced that as between the plaintiff and the company the temporary and tentative arrangement made by Robertson with the plaintiff in May, 1909, to replace the arrangement of June, 1908, had lost that character and had become binding as a permanent, agreement.\nIt is not necessary or desirable to enter upon a discussion, or to attempt an analysis of the voluminous evidence in the very bulky record before us, a great deal of which might well have been omitted. I agree with much that the learned trial judge said in condemnation of the conduct of Rogers and A. W. Denman as directors and of their negligence and indifferent attitude to the affairs of the company. But, upon what are the crucial issues of fact as between the plaintiff and the defendant company, my study of the record has not satisfied me that wrong conclusions were reached by the majority of the learned judges who sat in the court en banc.\nI prefer, however, to rest my opinion that the judgment in appeal should not be disturbed on the ground that the first agreement made by the plaintiff cannot, having regard to his fiduciary position, be held binding on the company, because he failed to prove full and complete disclosure to all the then present and to the future shareholders of the material circumstances surrounding the making of his bargain with the personally interested directors, and that, as against the company, he failed to establish that the temporary arrangement with Robertson had become permanent.\nI have not found any ground for disturbing the judgment of the full court in regard to the Bush transaction, as to which the view of the learned trial judge has been practically affirmed. Neither has a sufficient case been made, in my opinion, to justify interfer- ence with the direction of that court that, on the taking of the accounts between the parties, an allowance should be made to the plaintiff, on the basis of a quantum meruit, for his services while in the employment of the company.\nI would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal, both with costs.\nBy the judgment of the court en banc the plaintiff's claim to recover damages for breach of contract was finally disposed of. That was \"a distinct and separate ground of action.\" Under the authority of La Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[2], and of McDonald v. Belcher[3], there applied, which is not affected by the judgment in Hesseltine v. Nelles[4], the plaintiff had a right of appeal to this court from the judgment dismissing his claim for damages for breach of contract. He is, therefore, entitled to his costs of the motion to quash, which should be fixed at $50, to be set off against the costs of the appeal which he is ordered to pay.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother Anglin.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs; motion to quash dismissed with costs.\n[1] 7 D.L.R. 96; 2 West.

Whether the \u201cobjects\u201d of a particular company as defined by its constitution are or are not \u201cprovincial\u201d in this sense is a question to be determined on the facts of each particular case substantially as a question of fact.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J., that a company incorporated by a Provincial legislature has no power or capacity to do business outside of the limits of the incorporating Province but it may contract with parties residing outside those limits as to matters ancillary to the exercise of its powers.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Such company has, inherently, unless prohibited by its charter, the capacity to carry on the business for which it was created, in any foreign state or province whose laws permit it to do so.\nPer Duff J.\u2014A provincial company may conduct its operations outside the limits of the Province creating it so long as its business as a whole remains provincial with reference to its province of origin.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Such a company has, inherently, unless prohibited by its charter, the capacity to accept the authorization of any foreign state or province to carry on, within its territory, the business for which it was created.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J., that a corporation constituted by a provincial legislature with power to carry on a fire insurance business with no express limitation as to locality has no power or capacity to make and execute contracts for insurance outside of the incorporating province or for insuring property situate outside thereof.,\nPer Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Such, a company has power to insure property situate within or without the incorporating province and to make contracts within or without the same to effect any such insurance. In respect to all such contracts it is not material whether the owner of the property insured is or is not a citizen or resident of the incorporating Province.\nPer Duff J.\u2014It is not necessarily incompatible with the provincial character of the \u201cobjects\u201d of a provincial insurance company that it should have power to enter into outside the province contracts insuring property outside the province.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J.\u2014A provincial fire insurance company cannot make contracts and insure property throughout Canada by availing itself of the provisions of sec. 3, sub-sec. 3, of 9 & 10 Edw. VII. ch. 32 (\u201cThe Insurance Act, 1910\u201d).\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J.\u2014That such enactment is ultra vires so far as provincial companies are affected.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014Such enactment is ultra vires of Parliament.\nPer Idington J.\u2014Part of said sub-section may be intra vires, but the last part providing for a Dominion licence to local companies is not.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The said enactment is ultra vires except in so far as it deals with companies incorporated by or under Acts of the legislature of the late Province of Canada.\nHeld, that the powers of a company incorporated by a provincial legislature cannot be enlarged either as to locality or objects, by the Dominion Parliament nor by the legislature of another Province.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J.\u2014The legislature of a province has no power to prohibit companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada from carrying on business within the province without obtaining a licence so to do from the provincial authorities and paying fees therefor unless such licence is imposed in exercise of the taxing power of the province. And only in the same way can the legislature restrict a company incorporated for the purpose of trading throughout the Dominion in the exercise of its special trading powers or limit the exercise of such powers within the province. Brodeur J. contra.\nPer Idington J.\u2014A company incorporated by the Dominion Parliament in carrying out any of the enumerated powers contained in sec. 91 cannot be prohibited by a provincial legislature from carrying on business, or restricted in the exercise of its powers, within the province though subject to exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction to make laws in relation to \u201cdirect taxation within the province.\u201d But a company incorporated under the general powers of Parliament must conform to all the duly enacted laws of a province in which it seeks to do business.\nPer Duff J.\u2014A company incorporated under the residuary legislative power of the Dominion is not in any province where it carries on business subject to the legislative authority of the province in relation to matters falling within the subject \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d; but as regards all other matters falling within the enumerated subjects of section 92 it is subject to such legislative jurisdiction just as a natural person or an unincorporated association would be in like circumstances. The enactments of sections 139, 152, 167 and 168 of the British Columbia \u201cCompanies Act\u201d are valid.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The provincial legislature may impose a licence and exact fees from any Dominion company if the object be the raising of revenue, or obtaining of information, \u201cfor provincial, local or municipal purposes\u201d but not if it is to require the company to obtain provincial sanction or authority for the exercise of its corporate powers. And the legislature cannot restrict a company incorporated for the purpose of trading throughout the Dominion in the exercise of its special powers nor limit the exercise of such powers within the province, nor subject such company to legislation limiting the nature or kind of business which corporations not incorporated by it may carry on or the powers which they may exercise within the province.\nREFERENCE by the Governor General in Council of questions respecting the incorporation of companies to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration.\nThe questions so referred to the court were the following:\u2014\nIn the matter of a Reference by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada pursuant to section 60 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d of certain questions for hearing and consideration as to the respective legislative powers under the \u201cBritish North America Acts\u201d of the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Canada in relation to the incorporation of companies and as to the other particulars therein stated.\nA report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 9th May, 1910.\n\u201cThe Committee of the Privy Council have had under consideration a report, dated 2nd May, 1910, from the Minister of Justice, stating that important questions of law have arisen as to the respective legislative powers under the \u201cBritish North America Acts\u201d of the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Canada in relation to the incorporation of companies and as to the other particulars hereinafter stated, and it is expedient that these questions should be judicially determined.\n\u201cThe Minister accordingly recommends that under the authority of section 60 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, chapter 139, the following questions be referred by Your Excellency in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, namely:\u2014\n\u201c1. What limitation exists under the \u2018British North America Act, 1867,\u2019 upon the power of the provincial legislatures to incorporate companies?\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of the expression \u2018with provincial objects\u2019 in section 92, article 11, of the said Act? Is the limitation thereby defined territorial, or does it have regard to the character of the powers which may be conferred upon companies locally incorporated, or what otherwise is the intention and effect of the said limitation?\n\u201c2. Has a company incorporated by a provincial legislature under the powers conferred in that behalf by section 92, article 11, of the \u2018British North America Act, 1867,\u2019 power or capacity to do business outside of the limits of the incorporating province? If so, to what extent and for what purpose?\n\u201cHas a company incorporated by a provincial legislature for the purpose, for example, of buying and selling or grinding grain, the power or capacity, by virtue of such provincial incorporation, to buy or sell or grind grain outside of the incorporating province?\n\u201c3. Has a corporation constituted by a provincial legislature with power to carry on a fire insurance business, there being no stated limitation as to the locality within which the business may be carried on, power or capacity to make and execute contracts\u2014\n\u201c(a) within the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province;\n\u201c(b) outside of the incorporating province insuring property within the province;\n\u201c(c) outside of the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province?\n\u201cHas such a corporation power or capacity to insure property situate in a foreign country, or to make an insurance contract within a foreign country?\n\u201cDo the answers to the foregoing inquiries, or any and which of them, depend upon whether or not the owner of the property or risk insured is a citizen or resident of the incorporating province?\n\u201c4. If in any or all of the above mentioned cases, (a), (b) and (c), the answer be negative, would the corporation have throughout Canada the power or capacity mentioned in any and which of the said cases, on availing itself of the \u2018Insurance Act,\u2019 Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, chapter 34, as provided by section 4, sub-section 3?\n\u201cIs the said enactment, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, chapter 34, section 4, sub-section 3, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\n\u201c5.

Has the legislature of a province power to prohibit companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada from carrying on business within the province unless or until the companies obtain a licence so to do from the government of the province, or other local authority constituted by the legislature, if fees are required to be paid upon the issue of such licences?\n\u201cFor examples of such provincial legislation, see Ontario, 63 Vict. ch. 24; New Brunswick, Cons. Sts., 1903, ch. 18; British Columbia, 5 Edw. VII. ch. 11.\n\u201c7. Is it competent to a provincial legislature to restrict a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada for the purpose of trading throughout the whole Dominion in the exercise of the special trading powers so conferred or to limit the exercise of such powers within the province?\n\u201cIs such a Dominion trading company subject to or governed by the legislation of a province in which it carries out or proposes to carry out its trading powers limiting the nature or kinds of business which corporations not incorporated by the legislature of the province may carry on, or the powers which they may exercise within the province, of imposing conditions which are to be observed or complied with by such corporations before they can engage in business within the province?\n\u201cCan such a company so incorporated by the Parliament of Canada be otherwise restricted in the exercise of its corporate powers or capacity, and how, and in what respect by provincial legislation?\n\u201cThe Committee submit the same for approval.\n\u201cF.

Woods K.C. for Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nChrysler K.C. for the Manufacturers\u2019 Association of Canada.\nANSWERS OF THE JUDGES.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The first two questions in this reference can be dealt with together, and this has been done by counsel in argument.\nTo those two questions my general answer is: The words \u201cProvincial objects\u201d in section 92 (11) are intended to be restrictive; they have reference to the matters over which legislative jurisdiction is conferred by that section, i.e., matters \u201cwhich are, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature\u201d (Lord Watson, Prohibition Case[1]).\nThe Parliament of Canada can alone constitute a corporation with capacity to carry on its business in more than one province. Companies incorporated by local legislatures are limited in their operations to the territorial area over which the incorporating legislature has jurisdiction. Comity cannot enlarge the capacity of a company where that capacity is deficient by reason of the limitations of its charter or of the constituting power. Comity, whatever may be the legal meaning of the word in international relations, cannot operate between the provinces so as to affect the distribution of legislative power between the Dominion and the provinces under the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nThis does not imply that a provincial company may not, in the transaction of its business, contract with parties or corporations residing outside of the province in matters which are ancillary to the exercise of its substantive powers. I use the terms \u201csubstantive\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d as descriptive of the two classes of powers inherent in the company, as these are used in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2].\nIt was contended on behalf of the provinces that a distinction must be drawn between trading companies or companies which simply buy or sell commodities, and companies such as manufacturing industries, the incorporation of which contemplates a physical existence within the province; but if the view above expressed as to the capacity of the provincial company is correct, no distinction can be made. In both cases, the substantive functions of the company must be confined to the incorporating province; but as incidental or ancillary thereto such provincial company would not be precluded from entering into contracts with persons or corporations beyond the province, or suing or being sued in another province.\nThe answer to the third and fourth inquiries respecting insurance companies is covered by the opinions expressed by me in the Ottawa Fire Insurance Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[3].\nThe Parliament of Canada alone can constitute a corporation with powers to carry on its business throughout the Dominion; Colonial Building Co. v. Attorney-General of Quebec[4]; and two or more\nprovinces by joint action, whether by comity or otherwise, cannot extend the powers of a provincial corporation so as to cover the field assigned by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to the Dominion.\nQuestion 5. Answer: Distinguishing between comity and capacity it follows from the view above expressed of the limited capacity which the province can confer that neither another province nor the Dominion can enlarge by consent or comity the capacity which a company has received from the incorporating province.\nQuestions 6 and 7. Answer: The right of the province to restrict the operations of the Dominion companies by the imposition of a licence fee was based upon the decisions of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[5]; Brewers\u2019 and Maltsters\u2019 Association v. Attorney-General for Ontario[6], and the Manitoba Licence Holders\u2019 Case[7], and these cases are undoubtedly authority for the exercise of the licensing power where the licence is a bon\u00e2 fide exercise of the taxing power of the province; but it was clearly established by the case of La Cie. Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[8], that a province cannot exclude a Dominion company from its territory and it cannot do indirectly what it is precluded from doing directly, and to require a licence to be obtained not for revenue purposes, but in reality to shut out the operations of such corporation, is not within the power of the provincial Parliament. The province might well require that foreign corporations should be registered and file evidence of their corporate powers, names of officers and other details respecting the internal affairs of the company for registration purposes, and impose penalties for noncompliance with such legislation by way of fine; but such legitimate exercise of its powers is quite a different thing from legislation which, under the disguise of a licence requirement, is intended to prevent, or has the effect of preventing, the operation of foreign companies within the territory of the province.\nDavies J. \u2014 This reference for the opinion of the judges of this court on the questions submitted involves a consideration and determination of the meaning of Canada\u2019s Constitutional Act and especially of sub-sec. 11 of sec. 92, \u201cThe Incorporation of Companies with Provincial Objects.\u201d We are asked whether there is any, and if any, what limitation expressed in this sub-section and as to the meaning of the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d together with a number of subsidiary questions to which I will later refer. The vital and substantial question, however, before us is as to the meaning of the words \u201cwith provincial objects.\u201d Is it necessarily a limitation? If so, is the limitation a territorial and provincial one or is it a limitation of a legislative character only covering all such subject-matters as are assigned in sec. 92 to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures but without regard to area?\nAmong the \u201cclasses of subjects\u201d assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada \u201cthe incorporation of companies\u201d is not expressly mentioned except in sub-sec. 15, \u201cBanking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money.\u201d It is not, however, denied that the Parliament of Canada has under the residuum of power assigned to it the power to incorporate companies to carry on throughout Canada the objects for which they are incorporated. If any possible doubt at any time existed on the point after the decision in the case of Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[9], it seems to have been set at rest by the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Chancellor Loreburn in the case of Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[10]. In dealing with cases where the text of what he calls a completely self-governing constitution founded upon a written organic instrument such as the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d says nothing expressly, he says, p. 583:\u2014\nIt is not to be (presumed that the constitution withholds the powers altogether. On the contrary it is to be taken for granted that the power is bestowed in some quarter unless it be extraneous to the statute itself (as for example a power to make laws for some part of His Majesty\u2019s dominions outside of Canada) or otherwise is clearly repugnant to it\u2019s sense. For whatever belongs to self government in Canada belongs to the Dominion or the provinces within the limits of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nThe respective powers of the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislature to incorporate companies has received some consideration by the Judicial Committee in the cases of The Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[11], above referred to, and Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[12]. In the former case Sir Montague Smith speaking for their Lordships says at p. 116, with respect to the Dominion\u2019s enumerated power to legislate in respect to trade and commerce:\u2014 In the first place, it is not necessary to rest the authority of the Dominion Parliament to incorporate companies on this specific and enumerated power. The authority would belong to it by its general power over all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, and the only subject on this head assigned to the provincial legislature being \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects,\u201d it follows that the incorporation of companies for objects other than provincial falls within the general powers of the parliament of Canada.\nIn the Colonial Building Case[13], Sir Montague Smith who again delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee after affirming their Lordships\u2019 adherence to the view expressed by them in the Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[14] as to the respective powers of the Dominion and provincial legislatures in regard to the incorporation of companies, goes on to say, at p. 165:\u2014\nThe Company was incorporated with powers to carry on its business consisting of various kinds throughout the Dominion. The Parliament of Canada could alone constitute a corporation with these powers.\nAnd again, at p. 166:\u2014\nWhat the Act of incorporation has done is to create a legal and artificial person with capacity to carry on certain kinds of business, which are defined, within a defined area, viz., throughout the Dominion. Among other things, it has given to the association power to deal in land and buildings, but the capacity so given only enables it to acquire and hold land in any province consistently with the laws of that province relating to the acquisition and tenure of land. If the company can acquire and hold it, the Act of incorporation gives it capacity to do so.\n\u201cCapacity\u201d and \u201cpowers\u201d are here used as synonymous and the conclusion I draw from a careful study of these two judgments is that the Judicial Committee intended to affirm the proposition that the Parliament of Canada alone could confer a capacity upon a company exercisable in more than one of the Dominion\u2019s provinces.\nIn a later case which came before their Lordships, La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[15], their Lordships held that the respondent company incorporated by the Dominion Parliament could not be restrained from operating under its statutory powers at the suit of the appellant company which under later Quebec statutes had the exclusive power of so operating in the locality chosen by the respondent.\nThe judgment was based upon the broad ground that several decisions of the Board had established\nthat where a given field of legislation is within the competence both of the Dominion and Provincial legislatures, and both have legislated the Dominion enactment must prevail over that of the province if the two are in conflict as they dearly are in the present case.\nNo distinction is here made between legislation by the Dominion Parliament under its general powers and legislation by it under some one of its enumerated powers. When legislating under these latter it is clear that Dominion legislation is paramount. I have not understood it to be so when legislating under its general power unless when exercised with reference to a subject matter which had attained national importance. Mr. Lafleur suggested that in this appeal the Judicial Committee were dealing with a company incorporated under the exception to sub-sec. 10 of sec. 92, which formed part of the enumerated powers of the Dominion Parliament under sub-sec. 29 of sec. 91, and that this would explain the language of the judgment. But so far as the report of the case goes there does not seem any ground for the suggestion. On the contrary the judgment seems to assume that it was merely formulating propositions which had already been approved of and acted upon by the Judicial Committee. The decisions on which their Lordships rely are not expressly given but I assume that they had in mind amongst others the Prohibition Case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General, for the Dominion[16], where their Lordships upheld the validity of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act, 1886,\u201d enacted by the Dominion Parliament, and held that although it was not legislation within the enumerated powers of that Parliament, but was enacted under the general power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada still it was paramount legislation because it was on a subject matter unquestionably of national interest and importance and which had attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, and further that in so far as the provisions of any provincial statute came into collision with the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d\nthe Provincial must yield to Dominion legislation and must remain in abeyance until the \u201cDominion Act\u201d was repealed by the Parliament which passed it.\nUnexplained and accepted as reported simply this Hydraulic Company Case[17] would conclude and settle the difficulties as between Dominion and Provincial legislation, as to which the vital questions on this reference are asked. In the late case of The City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[18], Lord Atkinson speaking for their Lordships of the Judicial Committee, at p. 343, sums up the result of the various decisions of the Judicial Committee on the meaning of these two important sections 91 and 92 of our Constitutional Act, and seems clearly (pp. 343-4) to adopt the view that it is only Dominion legislation enacted under some one of the enumerated powers of section 91, or which is necessarily incidental to the powers conferred therein which can encroach upon or invade any class of subjects which are exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures. I do not think, however, that their Lordships intended to reverse or overrule their previous decision with respect to the constitutionality of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d or to question the construction put in that decision upon the general powers of the Dominion to legislate upon matters not enumerated in the 91st section, but which unquestionably had attained national interest and importance, or to determine that the Dominion in legislating under these general powers upon such matters of national interest and importance must not trench upon any of the enumerated subjects in section 92, assigned to the provincial legislatures. If their Lordships did so intend then it would seem to me that the result would be tantamount to a declaration that the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. I venture to think that if their Lordships intended to deny the power of the Dominion Parliament when legislating under its general powers on matters unquestionably of national interest and importance, which have attained dimensions affecting the body politic of the Dominion to trench upon any of the enumerated powers of the Provincial legislatures they would have used different language from that which they have used. Such a construction of the Act would practically deny to the Dominion Parliament power to grapple effectively with any great national evil or condition quite beyond the powers of the legislatures to deal with because the prohibition against trenching upon provincial powers would be fatal. I have no doubt that this was one of the grounds on which their Lordships in the Prohibition Case[19], upheld the Dominion legislation as intra vires. That the \u201cCanada Temperance Act,\u201d 1886, did trench upon \u201cProperty, and Civil Rights\u201d seems beyond argument, and still as I understand it, the legislation was upheld because its subject matter had attained national importance and such dimensions as affected the body politic of the Dominion. Lord Watson did not find that it was legislation within any of the Dominion\u2019s enumerated powers, but accepted the previous decision of the Judicial Committee in Russell v. The Queen[20], as authority\nthat the restrictive provisions of the Act of 1886, when they have been duly brought into operation in any provincial area within the Dominion must receive effect as valid enactments relating to the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nLord Watson went on to say further that their Lordships were unable to regard the prohibitive enactments of the Canadian statute of 1886 as \u201cRegulations of Trade and Commerce\u201d for the reason that the object of the Act was not to regulate but to abolish all retail transactions between those who trade in liquor and their customers within every area where the Act is brought into operation.\nThe validity of the Act was therefore maintained solely under the Dominion\u2019s general powers to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada, although it directly affected property and civil rights in provincial areas and was in conflict with provincial legislation on the same subject-matter of legislation. And the ground on which its validity was upheld was that the subject-matter was one of national importance affecting the body politic of the Dominion. My understanding of the decision is that such legislation forms an exception to the general rule that legislation under the peace, order and good government clause must not trench upon the enumerated powers of section 92. The result would be that while Dominion legislation generally under the peace, order and good government power might be good if it only affected incidentally the enumerated powers of the provincial legislatures under section 92, it could only directly affect and overrule legislation under those enumerated powers when enacted on such subject-matters of unquestioned national interest and importance as had attained dimensions affecting the body politic of the Dominion.\nIf the observations and decisions of the Judicial Committee in the several cases I have referred to as to the powers conferred upon the provincial legislatures with respect to the incorporation of companies are not conclusive as to the nature, character and extent of these powers and we construe sections 91 and 92 of our Constitutional Act broadly and generally and apart from authority we cannot fail to observe what care was apparently taken to assign to the provinces exclusive jurisdiction over all matters or subjects of a purely provincial or local or private nature while assigning to the Dominion jurisdiction over all other matters or subjects relating to the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole. Bearing this in view and reading with critical care the 16 subsections of section 92 in which these exclusive powers are expressed, one fails to find anything to support an argument by which the exercise of any of them could have been intended to have a direct extra-provincial object or purpose. Words of provincial limitation of some sort or character are to be found in each one of the 16 sub-sections. These words vary, naturally, as the subject-matter requires; but whether the words or phrases used are \u201cfor provincial purposes,\u201d or \u201cfor provincial, local or municipal purposes,\u201d or \u201cof the province,\u201d or \u201cin the province,\u201d or \u201cin or for the province,\u201d or \u201cwith provincial objects,\u201d they one and all indicate a consistent and uniform purpose of limiting the constitutional powers conferred to matters and subjects purely provincial or merely local or private as distinguished from those which were either Dominion wide in their extent or related to or affected more than one of the provinces.\nThe special words of limitation as to the meaning of which we are asked are found in the 11th sub-section. \u201cThe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d The power given is an exclusive one. The words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d are clearly words of limitation. The addition of the word \u201conly\u201d or the words \u201cand no others\u201d would not alter or change the nature or extent of the limitation. In my opinion the limitation is as to area, the area is that of the province. The company to be incorporated is one with an object or functional purpose to be carried out within the province as distinguished from one with a more general object or purpose, that is one extending to two or more provinces or to the Dominion at large. The limitation has doubtless reference not only to the area within which the companies are to operate but to the subject-matters over which exclusive legislative jurisdiction is conferred on the provinces by section 92. The argument for the provinces was that it related only to these subject-matters and had no reference to area. I cannot so read it. As was said by the Judicial Committee in the case Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[21], before referred to, the Parliament of Canada can alone constitute a corporation with power to carry on its business throughout the Dominion. If the provincial argument is sound that the limitation was not intended to have a reference to area but solely to the subject-matters assigned exclusively to the provinces to legislate upon it is strange that the draftsmen and framers of the Act should have used such inapt language to express their intention as is to be found in sub-section 11. The phrase \u201cclasses of subjects\u201d is used many times over in the Act and if the intention was to add a limitation to the power to incorporate companies which would have no reference to area but should apply only to the subject matters assigned to the exclusive legislative powers of the provinces one would imagine that the draftsman would have continued the use of his favourite phrase and made the sub-section to read \u201cThe Incorporation of Companies upon or for any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures.\u201d\nThe result of the acceptance of the provincial contention would be that the provincially incorporated companies would have equal capacity with Dominion incorporated companies to carry on their business throughout Canada. The only difference would be that the provincial companies would do so by virtue of the comity or permission of the provinces other than the one incorporating the company which might be withheld or withdrawn while the Dominion companies would do so by virtue of the inherent powers they derived from their Acts or letters of incorporation.\nSuch a result would seem to me not only to violate the cardinal principles adopted in the distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion and the provinces of confining the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures to the province alone and assigning the residuum of legislative power to the Dominion Parliament but is at variance with the rule of construction many times adopted with respect to legislation alike Dominion and provincial of prohibiting that being done indirectly which cannot be done directly.\nIn the view, however, which I take of the character of the limitation contained in the provincial power to incorporate companies this question of the company carrying on its business beyond the area of the province which created it does not arise. If I am right that the limitation on the power of a province to incorporate companies is a territorial one and limited to the province as distinguished from the Dominion at large then it is plain that every charter granted by statute, or letters patent under the \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d by the province must have that constitutional limitation read into it and I cannot understand how any doctrine of the comity of nations could avail either to enlarge the limited constituent powers of a company or the limited area within which the exercise of unlimited powers of a company were constitutionally confined.\nThe argument of inconvenience arising from the construction of the Act I have reached was pressed very strongly and it was said air Bar that many companies with millions of capital had been incorporated by the provinces and would be seriously hampered if they were not allowed to carry on their business throughout the Dominion in all the provinces which did not expressly prohibit their doing so. In the first place the constitutional limitation upon the exercise by these provincial companies of their powers while preventing them from carrying on their business or exercising their functional powers outside of the province would not prevent them doing everything within or without the province incidentally necessary to the carrying out of any of these functional powers.\nA provincial company incorporated for the manufacture and sale of any article while confined to the province creating it so far as the manufacture and sale of the article was concerned could doubtless purchase outside of the province the machinery and raw material necessary to enable it to carry out the purposes for which it was brought into existence and so while confined to the province in carrying on its business of selling its manufactured products could do so to any one willing to buy from any other province so long as it did not attempt to carry on its business in such other province. But I cannot see, unless my construction of our constitutional Act is entirely wrong, how a company incorporated for mining, or fishing, or lumbering, or milling, or manufacturing, say in Nova Scotia, could carry on the business of mining, fishing, lumbering, milling or manufacturing in, say the Province of British Columbia, or in any other province than Nova Scotia. To say that with regard to trading companies it is almost impossible for them effectively to carry on their business within the limits of a province, except with great inconvenience and possibly loss is merely to say that they should get a Dominion and not a provincial charter. But while I think the inconveniences and difficulties were greatly exaggerated at Bar I do not see in them any justification at all for adopting an improper construction of our Canadian Constitutional Act with respect to the division of legislative powers.\nThe foregoing observations and conclusions reached by me contain my answer to the first question submitted which is that the limitation contained in the words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d is a territorial one and also one controlled as to subject matters by the ambit of the legislative powers of the province as defined in section 92 of the Act. They also embody my answer to question two (2) which answer is in the negative, except with regard to such incidental business as may be necessary to carry out the functional powers conferred upon the companies.\nThe third question reads as follows:\u2014\nHas a corporation constituted by a provincial legislature power to carry on a fire insurance business there being no stated limitation as to the locality within which the business may be carried on power or capacity to make and execute contracts\u2014\n(\u0430) within the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province;\n(b) outside of the incorporating province insuring property within the province;\n(c) outside of the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province?\nHas such a corporation power or capacity to insure property situate in a foreign country or to make an insurance contract within a foreign country?\nDo the answers to the foregoing inquiries or any and which of them depend upon whether or not the owner of the property or risk insured is a citizen or resident of the incorporating province?\nTo each and all of these questions my answer is in the negative.\nThe fourth and fifth questions read as follows:\u2014\n4. If in any or all of the above mentioned cases, (a), (b) and (c), the answer be negative, would the corporation have throughout Canada the power or capacity mentioned in any and which of the said cases, on availing itself of the \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d 1910, 9 & 10 Edw. VII. chapter 32, section 3, sub-sec. 3?\nIs the said enactment, \u201cThe Insurance Act,\u201d 1910; chapter 32, section 3, sub-sec. 3, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\n5. Can the powers of & company incorporated by a provincial legislature be enlarged, and to what extent either as to locality or objects by\u2014\n(\u0430) the Dominion Parliament?\n(b) the legislature of another province?\nI answer these questions in the negative. I feel I need hardly enlarge on what I have already said on this branch of the subject. The Imperial Parliament has assigned to the legislatures of the several provinces exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d My construction of the limitation in this assignment of powers is that it is a territorial one and confined to the subject matters exclusively assigned to the provinces by section 92; that provincial objects mean provincial as distinguished from Dominion and that the class of companies it can incorporate is only limited by the exclusion of those companies which may be incorporated by the Dominion Parliament under its enumerated powers. I am quite unable to see how the Dominion Parliament could invade the exclusive power assigned to the provinces and either alter, extend or abridge a provincial charter, or how a provincial legislature could on the other hand alter, extend or abridge powers with which the Dominion Parliament invested a company of its creation. The powers of the Provincial legislatures are exclusive though when they clash with legislation of the Dominion under any of its enumerated powers or with legislation under its general powers on subject matters which have attained national importance and affect the body politic of the Dominion at large they must give way to the Dominion legislation which is paramount. But once these limitations upon the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures are reached and the powers themselves defined, nothing short of another Imperial Act can avail to change or alter that which an Imperial Act has already fixed. The Dominion Parliament certainly cannot even with the consent of all the provincial legislatures amend the Imperial Act and they cannot, therefore, add to the powers or objects of a provincial company which have been defined and circumscribed by Imperial legislation. Nor can a legislature of one province with its limited and defined powers of incorporating companies add to or enlarge the powers of a company incorporated by another province. I answer 4 and 5 in the negative.\nThe 6th and 7th questions read:\u2014\n6. Has the legislature of a province power to prohibit companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada from carrying on business within the province unless or until the companies obtain a licence so to do from the government of the province, or other local authority constituted by the legislature, if fees are required to be paid upon the issue of such license?\nFor example, of such provincial legislation see Ontario, 63 Vict. Ch. 24 New Brunswick, Cons. Sis., 1903, Ch. 18; British Columbia, 5 Edw. VII. Ch. 11.\n7. Is it competent to a provincial legislature to restrict a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada for the purpose of trading throughout the whole Dominion in the exercise of the special trading powers so conferred or to limit the exercise of such powers within the province?\nIs such a Dominion trading company subject to or governed by the legislation of a province in which it carries out or proposes to carry out its trading powers limiting the nature or kinds of business which corporations not incorporated by the legislature of the province may carry on, or the powers which they may exercise within the province, or imposing conditions which are to be observed or complied with by such corporations before they can engage in business within the province?\nCan such a company so incorporated by the Parliament of Canada be otherwise restricted in the exercise of its corporate powers or capacity, and how, and in what respect by provincial legislation?\nIt is difficult if not impossible, to answer these questions categorically. Much necessarily depends upon the form of the enactment passed by the local legislature. \u201cDirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes\u201d is one of the enumerated powers assigned provincial legislatures. Legislation, therefore, the bon\u00e2 fide object of which is such direct taxation within the province would of course be intra vires even when laid upon Dominion companies. In the cases of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[22], and Brewers\u2019 and Maltsters\u2019 Association v. Attorney-General for Ontario[23], the Judicial Committee have laid down the principles which should govern in cases where provincial legislation attempts to lay taxes upon Dominion companies, and I do not see how I can usefully add on a reference such as this, anything to what their Lordships have already said on that subject. My present opinion is that local taxation of a Dominion company otherwise valid, would not be rendered invalid merely by a provision requiring the payment of the tax as the condition of the company carrying on its business in the province.\nMy formal answer indicates the nature, character and extent of the restrictions, if they may be so called, which the local legislatures may, in my opinion, put upon the exercise by the Dominion companies of their powers within provincial areas.\nIdington J.\u2014We have here submitted seven interrogative paragraphs, each containing a principal question and a number of subsidiary questions. The answers, however brief, must involve the survey of a wide field of constitutional law.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council referring to the nature of these questions and the difficulty of answering them \u201cexhaustively and accurately without so many qualifications and reservations as to make the answers of little value\u201d has said herein:\u2014\nThe Supreme Court itself can, however, either point out in its answer these or other considerations of a like kind, or can make the necessary representations to the Governor General in Council, when it thinks right so to treat any question that may be put. And the Parliament of Canada can control the action of the executive.\nOpinions of this court, or that higher up, in answer to such questions have been declared by the same judgment to be \u201cadvisory * * * and of no more effect than the opinions of law officers.\u201d\nTo answer all these questions, a man might write a large volume, without departing from the lines of thought they suggest, and then leave unanswered a good many of them.\nI most respectfully submit, for my part, in line with the foregoing suggestion, that problems such as are raised by these questions can only be properly solved by the march of events, political and judicial.\nThe main issues raised by the present inquiry are relative either to the assumption by provincial incorporations of power which it is alleged they have not, or to the enactment by provincial legislatures of statutes claimed to be ultra vires, in so far as bearing upon corporations of Dominion creation.\nThere are legal methods available to attorneys-general of either the Dominion or the provinces, by which the assumption by corporate bodies of powers they have not, and the validity of provincial legislation, can be tested and judicially determined by due process of law.\nA single decision on a single point wherein any undue assumption of such like powers has been challenged would be worth more as a guide to future action than all the answers that can ever be got herein. The growth of judicial decision in concrete cases can alone settle the law. That may be obtained either by the prompt and proper method I have suggested, or by the slower method of awaiting the results of private litigation. In any case it can only be reached in a satisfactory manner, step by step.\nWhen one point has been thus decided it furnishes a safe guide to the decision of the next.\nThis method of solution by getting mere advisory opinions binding no one upon a group of questions can settle nothing but may mar much. Radical error in any one point and the answer it brings may vitiate the entire results got in such an unusual sort of submission as this. Experience, intelligence and understanding, however serviceable if starting rightly and progressing step by step as each point has been settled, may be wasted, or worse, for want of the first thing having been finally decided and used as a guide.\nThose who have given most attention to, and brought to bear upon the problems involved the greatest learning and deepest thought, will be those who will have the most profound appreciation of what I have just said, and the need of saying it here.\nIf I have not made clear the impossibility of a satisfactory solution by this method, perhaps what follows may help to illustrate the soundness of these submissions which I in discharging my duty respectfully make.\nPassing to the task of answering the questions I will treat them in their order, taking questions one and two together.\nThe substantial part of the first question submitted was before this court in the concrete case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Insurance Co.[24], when the diversity of opinion in this court relative to the meaning of the phrase \u201cThe incorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d as used in sub-section 11 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d illustrated the worthlessness of advisory opinion and need of a binding decision.\nIt is difficult to understand the exact position of the counsel for the Dominion in regard to the first question. Their factum puts the matter thus:\u2014that \u201ca provincial company may not it is submitted exercise any of its functional capacities beyond the limits of the incorporating province,\u201d though it may he forced by circumstances to go beyond its province to institute an action. Yet in deference to what transpired in argument relative to the corporate journalist with subscribers in many provinces, Mr. Newcombe seemed to me to concede much more than he thus desired or intended to argue for.\nAnd Mr. Atwater, going for a time far beyond this position in the factum as the reporter\u2019s notes shew, said:\u2014\nJudge Duff.\u2014Well, carrying on any mercantile business, whatever is understood by a mercantile business, which consists in making a profit by buying and selling.\nMr. Atwater.\u2014If it was incorporated for the purpose of buying and selling in the City of Montreal, I don\u2019t know\u2014I would perhaps hesitate to say it could not import into Montreal the classes of goods which came within its capacities which it was entitled to deal in and do business in, and which could not be obtained in Montreal.\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Atwater.\u2014Well, if your lordship asks me for my own opinion, for what it may be worth on that point, I don\u2019t know that it would be doing business, I don\u2019t know that the mere taking of orders by a traveller would constitute doing business.\nI understand the term \u201cfunctional capacities\u201d to cover the daily activities of business within the corporate capacity and that the argument of the factum was intended to deny the power of contracting, for the purpose of such activities, in any place beyond the limits of the province, save incidentally to the necessity of following property or rights for which the possible remedy of recovery had accidentally been removed beyond the limits of the province.\nThere is, I admit, a difficulty in adhering strictly to such a proposition in face of the concrete facts existent at the door of our court house. There the middle of a stream separates two provinces, and two cities, which the stranger looking at the busy scene would, until told otherwise, say were one. Much if not the greater part of the vast business done there is the product of provincial companies acting in utter defiance of such a doctrine. The difficulty of arguing for such a proposition is enhanced when we know that such a growth of provincial authority has taken place under the shadow of the parliament buildings and unchallenged till now by the legislators assembled there.\nThat, however, is no reason for casting discredit on the work of the dead statesmen who framed the scheme and used the language of which so much has been made. They possessed at least ordinary Canadian intelligence, and knew that corporate companies in Canada had as matter of business necessity to cross the interprovincial and international boundary lines, and that to give them only such limited powers as it is now contended were given, would be a solemn mockery.\nCounsel making this contention referred to the historical record in Mr. Pope\u2019s book in support thereof.\nWe find therefrom, that it was only when Mr. (afterwards Sir) Oliver Mowat had moved the adoption of the sixteen subjects to be assigned the provinces, that some one moved in amendment to add:\u2014\n17. The incorporation of private or local companies, except such as relate to matters assigned to the Federal Legislature.\nThat found its place later as item 14, then placed next after the item of \u201cLocal Works and Undertakings\u201d and the words \u201cFederal Legislature\u201d were changed to \u201cGeneral Parliament.\u201d So amended in 1864 the item stood throughout the remaining negotiations for Confederation, the adoption of the scheme by the Canadian Parliament and the London Conference in 1866, until the draft bill of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was submitted.\nThen it appears the draftsman made it read (11) \u201cThe incorporation of companies with exclusively provincial objects\u201d; which stood till the 4th draft of the bill when it was made to read (11) \u201cThe incorporation of companies,\u201d which was changed at the final draft to what it now reads.\nSurely this was a singular struggle for such men seeking apt words to express such a purpose as that of restricting the business operations of such companies within the territorial limits of each province creating them. Such a failure in power of expression is remarkable if that was their purpose, or if such an absurd idea ever entered the mind of any one.\nClearly the sole difficulty was, if the subject were touched upon at all, to avoid invading the Dominion\u2019s exclusive and enumerated share of legislative authority, and to define something in contradistinction thereto, but in no way to alter the inherent character of an ordinary corporate company as understood in Canada and England at that time.\nThe references to debates and proceedings anterior to an Act are generally not permitted in argument as guides to its interpretation. But counsel for the provinces need not complain of this illuminating piece of history which is introduced by their opponents and if allowed any weight destroys any pretension that the private or local companies, or whatever they may be called, were to be crippled creations of a new order unknown in the business world.\nWe were also referred by counsel for the Dominion to the despatches and opinions of past Ministers of Justice in discharging their duties relative to the veto power. If we must accept them as authority, why are we asked? If we need not, and differ therefrom, how much advanced is the solution?\nA striking commentary upon the citation of such authority are the facts that the late Sir Oliver Mowat, who is thus cited and relied upon to support the proposition that provincial corporations cannot transact business beyond the respective limits of the province creating them, was long Attorney-General of Ontario, and longer premier of that province, was quite as conversant with the legal conditions under which the provincial corporations operated as any one could be, and as much likely as any one to be alive to the dangers of such corporations transacting business beyond the province if in doing so, as is now contended, they were acting ultra vires and had not the inherent power to do so, yet he never instituted proceedings against one of them to restrain this alleged abuse. Those who knew the man, know he was the last man to tolerate such a state of things if he believed it to be illegal. The conclusion to be drawn is that he in common with others held that such corporations had the inherent power, when once created without restriction, to go abroad for such purposes of business as they had been incorporated to carry on, yet that it would be unwise to express such purpose in the charter.\nWhether or not a legislature may from time to time have in its enactments so reached out as to appear to be doing what was ultra vires its power is one thing. Whether without so reaching out by express language to assert the power that power is inherent in each provincial corporation to avail itself of the comity of nations, is quite another thing.\nThe Minister of Justice looking to the developments of the future and possible need, in order to subserve the purposes of the Dominion, of restricting the power of the provinces by means of the exercise of the veto power over provincial legislation, might well desire to avoid giving any apparent sanction for such express reaching out as in fact sometimes existed. In other cases pursuant thereto and to the traditions and policy of his office any such minister may have pushed his argument too far.\nThe arguments maintaining such authority are only good for some or one of such purposes, and prove nothing herein.\nThe fact that not a single Minister of Justice or Attorney-General of any province has taken the argument so seriously as to invoke the judicial authority to enforce it, is perhaps the best answer of all to this sort of argument.\nSurely all those dealing with the matter of framing this new constitution intended these corporations to be what the ordinary business man supposed a business corporation to mean.\nHe looks upon it, as these framers acting for him no doubt did, no matter what the philosophers or mystics may say, as simply a convenient method of forming a combination of men having a common business purpose, under a common name with limited or unlimited liability, and such powers of expressing a common will and purpose suitable to the business in hand and restricted in all that within the limits of their articles of association, but by no national boundary line if the foreign country beyond will permit it to go so far.\nIf such a man had been asked to join an Ontario milling company and did so, he would never have imagined such a thing as that his company could not buy wheat in Chicago, grind it in Toronto and carry the flour to Liverpool, or Constantinople if it chose. If its Chicago office or broker had, for example, got enough of wheat to load a boat, or line of boats, but early frost had closed navigation on the lakes so that it would be more profitable to grind the wheat in Chicago and ship the flour by rail to New York to catch the earliest steamer for Liverpool, and he were then told his company could not save itself that way, what would he say? I imagine that if he were told then, under such circumstances, that if he had got a Dominion charter instead of a provincial one, neither power having any more right to confer power or right to go abroad than the other, he would be tempted to say that the superstition of the days of the big medicine man had passed away. Such is my expansion of the sub-question put in question number two, and the view I hold in answer thereto.\nThe interests of these provincial incorporations and their creditors have grown to be so vast that to cut away by a stroke of a pen, as counsel for the Dominion Attorney-General urges, the foundation upon which they have proceeded and destroy as ultra vires the contracts made on faith thereof, would create financial disaster of such magnitude as to appal any but those heedless of others\u2019 rights and reasonable expectations.\nDestroy such contracts and under our system Parliament could not so deal with these provincial corporate creations as to enable justice to be done. Parliament has no right to meddle with these provincial corporations or the civil rights which exist in the province creating them. Save in the possible case of local works and undertakings which it can declare to be for the general benefit of Canada, it would be absolutely powerless to avert the disastrous results sure to follow a final determination such as seems to be sought herein.\nThose possible consequences of long years of interpretation, must in such a case be heeded herein and I submit are a bar to publications or invitations thereto of advisory opinion productive, if acted upon, of such results.\nIt is not our province to deal with the political or economic results, but yet our duty to point out clearly the legal consequences involved in the departure sought.\nIt never was, in my opinion, intended by the phrase \u201cprovincial objects\u201d to restrict the business operations of such a corporation within the province creating it.\nIn Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[25], I dealt with the question at length and touched upon the chief phases of it, and may be permitted to refer those caring for the details of the argument to pages 436 to 454 of the report of that case. I remain of the opinion there expressed and am quite sure that opinion was and is in accord with what has been acted upon by those provincial authorities creating corporations and of those accepting such corporate powers.\nBriefly put, however, it is that the provinces had always had prior to Confederation the power of incorporation of companies having power to do business either at home or abroad; that there is no reason to suppose they ever were intended to have less effective powers, in that regard, when acting within the limits of the subjects over which they were assigned exclusive control; that the assignment of that exclusive control implied the power of incorporation whenever such am expedient could advantageously be resorted to; that no power was given to incorporate municipal institutions or schools, yet no one could pretend that the power to do so did not exist, or that such corporations were restricted from going beyond the province if they saw fit for any purpose of borrowing money or acquiring supplies; that the asylums, hospitals, charities and eleemosynary institutions in and for the respective provinces were in the like position in relation to incorporation and going beyond the province for supplies; that if it had properly been implied that incorporation of all these various institutions could be affected, it should also be as clearly implied that the exclusive power given over property and civil rights implied the power of incorporation, so far as necessary to give efficacious operation to any of such civil rights, and that there was nothing in sub-section 11 to restrict that power save in the case and sense I am about to refer to.\nI there also tried to shew that \u201cprovincial objects\u201d could not be held to refer to any of the purposes of government which in a sense are the only \u201cprovincial objects\u201d most appropriately covered by such a term.\nItem number 11 being placed next after that relative to the local works and undertakings might suggest that it may have been in relation to government works that the term was used.\nThe later item, number 13, of \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d being thus left unrestricted, the power of creation of any corporation should follow as a necessary part thereof or implication therein. However that may be, I thought then and still think and take the liberty of repeating here what I said then in regard to the question of \u201cprovincial objects\u201d:\u2014\nI have shewn that the phrase \u201cprovincial objects\u201d cannot relate to or be confined within what its strict literal meaning might require.\nIt seems difficult and I would have said impossible, but for the contention here set up and heed given to it, to extract from such a phrase any restrictive meaning save that involved in distinguishing the subjects exclusively assigned to the provinces, from those assigned to the Dominion as the line of incorporating power given. That restriction may reasonably be found in the phrase. It may even have been one of the purposes of using it, to save possibility of conflict with or embarrassment, in that regard, in the Dominion\u2019s exercise of the power of incorporating.\nIn view of the civil rights and property (which are the essential elements to be controlled in creating any company) within the provinces being exclusively assigned to the provinces it might have been but for sub-section 11 said that the Dominion had to look to the provinces for incorporating power to subserve its exercise of its powers.\nThe exclusive legislative control over property and civil rights in the province is of such a sweeping and comprehensive character that even the final part of section 91 might not have sufficed for its restrictive purposes unless the incorporating power of section 92 were thus restricted by something to indicate that when the province undertook to incorporate it should keep to that field that was provincial in its character.\nBut how does that affect the question of the quality of power inherent in a corporation? Sub-section 11 clearly was pointed at something in the nature of a partition of the sovereign legislative powers between the Dominion and the provinces.\nBut how could that help in regard to a power that neither of them possessed, neither of them could acquire, neither of them modify, but which either of them might without consulting the other exclude from their corporate creatures the right to exercise? I refer to the power to enjoy rights given by virtue of the comity of nations which I refer to hereafter.\nI use this extract because it shews not only the argument I wish to adopt here but as it seemed to me fitted to the necessities of a concrete case where definite legal results had to be attained. The notion that men may get a charter in one province in order to abandon its use there and take the seat of business of the company, if it ever had one, to another or a foreign country, yet carry on no business in the province of its creation, implies men may resort to such an absurd impropriety to accomplish by such roundabout methods, what in these days of easy incorporation can so easily be reached by acting directly.\nPublic opinion and the coercive measures it may demand and which lie within the power of the legislatures of other provinces as well as possibly in some extreme cases in the Dominion Parliament, can no doubt check such abuses. A company incorporated expressly to carry on mining or farming or fishing in another province, might well find itself in such conflict with the legislation of that province as to be made speedily aware of such impropriety.\nThere is an instructive line of American authorities which shews that corporations may be held to have, as inherent in their creation, the power of going beyond the bounds of the parent state to make such contracts as they are capable of, yet when it conies to a question of doing anything for which the special sanction of the company\u2019s shareholders is requisite, such business must be done at the company\u2019s seat or within the parent state. Some of such cases also seem to say the like rule should be observed where the sanction of the directors is needed. These cases are instructive as illustrations of what is supposed to form part of the inherent power and the inherent limitation which may be implied.\nTo sum up what I have said and furnish such answers, qualified and limited, as that so said, indicates, the best reply I can give to these questions is as follows:\u2014That a provincial legislature cannot incorporate a company to do any of the things which lie within the exclusive power of Parliament, and hence cannot be provincial objects, (though possibly Parliament may use such companies acting within their capacity for executing any of its purposes) but its corporate creations have each inherently in it unless specifically restricted by the conditions of the instrument creating it, the power to go beyond the limits of the province for such purposes and transactions as are needed to give due effect to the business operations of the company so far as within the scope of what they were created for. And if they be formed for the purpose of buying and selling grain, they can do so in any place where their business will carry them, and the comity of nations permit them. And those formed to grind grain can, subject to the like limitations, grind it where deemed desirable.\nI submit that I have substantially answered all the riddles in questions 1 and 2, yet the subject has no clear limitations that my limited range of vision can reach and outline.\nAs to question 3 and its subsidiary divisions, I answer each of the latter in the affirmative, always provided, however, that there has been no restriction placed by the charter of the company upon its doing so, and no prohibition in the foreign state or province where contracting invalidating such contracts, and that the company has a home or seat of business in the creating province to which the authorization of such transactions must be attributed. The company\u2019s own by-laws or regulations empowering its agents to act abroad, can and must define the details to be observed in the execution of such contracts and the transaction of such business as done there.\nAnd as to the last subsidiary question. I think it can make no difference what the citizenship may be unless such condition has been imposed by the charter of the company, or some rule of the foreign state concerned.\nOf course, in relation to all these questions, we must never lose sight of the possibilities that lie in sub-section 25 of section 91, giving Parliament exclusive power over the subject of \u201cnaturalization and aliens,\u201d but I do not apprehend anything relative thereto is implied in the questions as put.\nIn answer to the amended or substituted question, number 4, I, having answered No. 3 in the affirmative, need not answer here save as to the sub-question relative to the power of Parliament to enact sub-section 3, of section 3, of chapter 32, of the \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d 1910.\nI have dealt so fully in answering the shorter catechism directed recently as to the power of Parliament relative to some provisions of the \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d that I respectfully refer thereto for the reasons which govern me in answering this part of the longer catechism.\nI cannot say that this sub-section is entirely ultra vires, for it may possibly for some purposes be read as part of concurrent legislation dependent upon and to become operative along with and dependent upon such provincial legislation. But as it stands the last part of it must be held ultra vires, for the power does not extend to the enabling corporations to do anything beyond the power given by their respective creators. The insurance companies incorporated by the late Province of Canada are quite independent of anything Parliament may enact unless something falling within the twenty-nine enumerated powers of section 91, such as bankruptcy for example.\nThey may have had express powers given them to do business anywhere in the world. They may have had such powers made dependent upon any competent legislative authority and got it. Whatever they had they are entitled to hold and to act upon unless duly taken away.\nTheir case illustrates perhaps more strongly than the case of the provincial companies of any of the present provinces can do, the futility of such legislation as involved in this sub-section.\nIn the absence of any such companies and those directly concerned, it would seem to me improper to deal further with this inquiry or in any way cast a doubt on the validity of their transactions. The chances are they have done just what they were entitled to do without the proffered licence and the matter is thus reduced to insignificance.\nThere may be, for aught I know, or have heard, facts furnishing reasons analogous to those upon which the judgment in the case of Dobie v. The Temporalities Board[26], proceeded, which may enable legislation relative to the companies incorporated by the legislature of the late Province of Canada to be upheld.\nIn answer to question number 5, I do not think it is competent for any legislature save that creating a corporation to so meddle with the corporation\u2019s powers and capacities as to add to or diminish them, unless by the unanimous consent of all concerned, or\nin special cases, such, for example, as those over which Parliament has a potential power of control by declaring the works which they manage or control to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nAs to question No. 6, at first blush this seems an enormous question. Counsel for the Dominion, however, graciously intimated it was not expected we should investigate and pass upon the constitutionality of the several statutes cited therein.\nThe question embraces all companies incorporated by Parliament, as if all stood upon the same footing. This groundless assumption, so often made, lies at the root of nearly all the trouble in which the Dominion and provinces are involved over the subject of their respective powers relative to incorporated companies.\nIt is as clear as anything can be that it never was intended that Parliament should by any act of incorporation resting merely upon its residual power, be enabled to override or control the legislative powers of the provinces or deal with any of the subject matters exclusively assigned to the provinces.\nThe great importance to be attached to a clear comprehension of this matter and its bearing upon the entire arguments of this submission must be my apology for a repetition of what I have said so elaborately elsewhere.\nIn the first place all companies incorporated by Parliament acting within its exclusive legislative authority over the twenty-nine enumerated subjects of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which is an authority that takes precedence of all else in the Act, cannot be prohibited from doing anything, or going anywhere that Parliament wills they should. They require no licence and pay no fees therefor, though liable to direct taxation by a province.\nThose companies that are not incorporated by virtue of such exclusive legislative authority, but by virtue of the residual legislative authority resting in the general power of Parliament for the peace, order and good government of Canada, must stand before the provincial legislatures on the same footing as all other companies and persons subject to the powers of such legislature in regard to licensing, to taxation and to property and civil rights or other legislation over or incidental to any of the sixteen enumerated subjects in section 92 of said \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nHow has such confusion of thought as the question indicates ever entered the mind of any one? I can only account for it as flowing from the result of men seeing the large field of commercial activity occupied by the corporations created under the exclusive authority of Parliament, and their failing to discriminate. There cannot be anything clearer or more comprehensive than the authority given each provincial legislature by section 92, sub-section 13, over \u201cProperty and Civil Eights in the Province.\u201d\nIt is, however, made expressly subservient to the full exercise by Parliament of the enumerated powers assigned to it in section 91.\nThe final sentence of said section, reads as follows:\nAnd any Matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section shall not be deemed to come within the Class of Matters of a local or private Nature comprised in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nThis sentence read in light of the introductory part of the section, comprehends all that there is in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d derogatory of the absolute and exclusive legislative authority of the provincial legislatures over sixteen enumerated subject matters assigned to them; save some general enactments giving Parliament, as in regard to the subject of education, for example, certain specific powers, and saying the veto power to which I will presently refer.\nThat sentence and all it implies coupled with section 92, ought to settle the matter so far as questions like this number 6 submitted to us, are concerned.\nSection 92 is as follows:\u2014\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say:\u2014\nThe last sentence of section 91 and this section 92 make it clear that the enumerated powers in section 91 are paramount, and all else that falls within the scope of the enumerated powers in section 92, must be and remain exclusively within the legislative authority of the provincial legislatures. What possible right then can the Dominion Parliament have to interfere by virtue of its residual powers with any enactment duly made by a provincial legislature relative to the civil rights or property of any one, either individual or corporate, seeking entrance into such province and contracting there?\nThe right to do so has sometimes been rested upon sub-section 2 of section 91, enabling Parliament to enact relative to the \u201cRegulation of Trade and Commerce.\u201d\nThat obviously enough relates to what may or may not be done in connection with, or in relation to, the external trade and commerce of the Dominion as a whole and all incidental thereto. The adjustment of the tariff, for example, is not otherwise provided for. Legislation within section 132 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to carry out conventions relative to trade with foreign countries forms another subject which in some of the incidental consequences thereof might possibly require legislation to fall within this item and rest therein as Avell as upon that section.\nThe attempt, so often made, to make this cover mere details of business and the laws relative thereto, was not pressed in argument herein as it was in the Insurance Case[27].\nWhen it is attempted to bring within its range some branch or mere detail of business connected with or incidental to trade and commerce, one is confronted with the many instances wherein the section specifically provides for separate items equally related to trade and commerce, as, for example, navigation and shipping, currency and coinage, banking, savings banks, weights and measures, bills of exchange and promissory notes, and bankruptcy and insolvency, as well as others which might all be covered by the generic term \u201ctrade and commerce,\u201d as well as these many other things now and again sought to be brought under its wing. Why should these specific assignments of power relative to matters falling within what the term \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d in the widest sense it is capable of, have been made if it ever was intended to cover such as it is now contended it does?\nTo attempt to stretch the power so as to enable Parliament to override the local laws duly enacted relative to property and civil rights or aught else assigned to the exclusive legislative powers of the legislatures is dangerous. Indeed, it seems to me that if such attempts were upheld and followed to their logical consequences they would be destructive of the federal system.\nWhere can one draw the line if not where I have indicated?\nThe vast body of property and civil rights is in a sense almost entirely the offspring of trade and commerce.\nThe family relation, education and municipal institutions are specifically provided for. What then of property and civil rights would remain to the provinces to be dealt with by them if the phrase \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d is to be given the extensive meaning urged?\nIt is attempted to distinguish what is involved herein as interprovincial trade and commerce, and thus justify interference.\nLet us in answer thereto consider the situation at Confederation, and in connection therewith, section 121 of the Act, which provides as follows:\u2014\n121. All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.\nAnd then the purpose of the veto power given by section 90 to the Dominion.\nThere was at Confederation no hindrance by law to any one going from one province to another. No law but those making tariffs thus swept away, prevented any one from dwelling where he saw fit, and doing business in one or all of the provinces. And so far as I can learn, the condition of corporate life and activity was similarly free. When the tariff barriers were thus removed there was no need for any regulation of the so-called inter-provincial trade and commerce. And the enactment of section 121 seems to negative the idea of there being implied any power to take any future action in that regard by Parliament or any other authority. All that could ever be done was to preserve this condition of things. Interprovincial trade and commerce was to flow thereafter as freely as if its right to do so had been declared by an organic law. Such seems clearly to have been the conception of the framers of this instrument. Certainly the draftsman of the Act never could have supposed that a province which was only given a power of direct taxation and a subsidy from the Dominion to help cover its expenses of g overnment, could resort to indirect taxation, even though this section never had existed.\nNo one seeks to deny the right of Parliament by virtue of its residual powers to incorporate companies. The conflict, so far as it exists, is between Parliament and the provinces relative to the civil rights of these companies thus created.\nNow, the condition of things at Confederation, as I have outlined them, permitted those corporations, created thereafter, to go any place within the Dominion, and long years elapsed before any legislation was permitted to interfere therewith.\nThe Dominion Government was, by section 90 of the Act, given the express power to veto or disallow any Acts whether intra vires the powers assigned the provinces or not.\nThat power alone was all that ever was needed or designed to be exercised by the Dominion in the way of interference with the legislative action of the provinces acting within the powers specifically assigned them, and not in conflict with any of the enumerated powers of section 91 given the Dominion, or specific powers given in other sections.\nAn Act might be ultra vires a province and fail by reason thereof before the judgment of the courts without the exercise of the veto power.\nBut it was never supposed by any one until recent times, that an Act on its face intra vires a local legislature, could, after the lapse of time given to veto it, be interfered with by Dominion authority, by virtue of anything resting on its residual power. Yet such is the strange contention that is now set up.\nThis veto power was given for the express purpose of preserving as matter of expediency or public policy the rights of every one in the Dominion, corporate or individual, to enjoy such rights in as full measure as they existed at Confederation, or might exist thereafter by later legislative development.\nThe narrow contracted views of a local patriotism, it was felt, might be used by the exercise of the wide powers given the legislatures to the detriment of the Dominion as a whole and of the people thereof outside a province so moved.\nIt became from the time of Confederation thenceforward the duty of the government of the Dominion to watch local legislation and see that nothing was enacted, even if intra vires the powers of a legislature, that would interfere with the prosperity of the Dominion as a whole.\nThe rich heritage thus to be guarded was that in which every Canadian had a right to share and not that alone of any class of people either as mere provincials or otherwise. The right to dwell where one saw fit, and there or elsewhere follow his or her avocation, was the common heritage of every Canadian and, for many years, of every Canadian company. If the right has not been well and sufficiently guarded, it must be because the veto power, the only power given by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to guard it, has not been properly exercised and such rights duly preserved.\nIt is not that the Acts passed by the provinces are ultra vires. It may be that they are intra vires. And if a provincial legislature, acting intra vires, has duly enacted legislation detrimental to the original rights of persons or companies outside or beyond a province and that has not been duly vetoed there is no help for it in law.\nIn so far as such enactments may happen to be ultra vires they are null. But if intra vires they cannot be nullified by any resort on the part of Parliament to its residual power. Such a power is neither expressly nor impliedly given and I venture to say never was thought of by the framers of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nI am not writing to glorify the veto power, for it also may he capable of great abuse. It seems to have fallen into disuse; perhaps because abused.\nYet, I repeat, it was intended as a beneficent power and is capable of great good service in the class of questions such as raised herein.\nTo seek to apply it when the proposed legislation can only affect the rights of the people of the province concerned, may be offensive, and in the domain of practical politics be an impossibility. Yet when the legislation proposed would manifestly improperly affect people elsewhere, or corporations created outside the province, such as the Dominion corporations resting upon the residual power of Parliament, or those of other provinces, and thus affect the people of the whole Dominion, surely the exercise of the power in that regard ought to be, and to be held, practicable.\nThose who would interpret aright our \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and especially the features of it that hinge upon this veto power, must never forget that our Confederation was framed whilst the United States was passing through a civil war for which the want of greater power in the federal government was thought by some to be indirectly responsible.\nThe nullification ordinances of South Carolina, a generation previously, had formed a prominent feature of much argument.\nOur statesmen, profiting by the experience of others, tried to find by anticipation the means of averting such like possible dangers as the result of their work. They found these in the assignment of the residual power to Parliament instead of to the provinces, as it had been left with each of the states in the United States and in the veto power which was in harmony with British legislation and practices in relation to the colonies, which latter in its turn was but part of an early condition of things in the growth of the English Constitution. The residual power given Parliament was as it were a complement of the veto power, but not to be used in substitution therefor. It might operate over that field which the veto power kept open.\nSpeaking in general terms, what the legislatures seem to have done is to enact that in certain specified contingencies the companies failing to comply with what has been required of them, shall not be entitled to recover, on contracts they have made in the province, in the courts of the province, which can only exercise such jurisdiction as their parent authority has given them.\nIt may seem a drastic sort of legislation but not necessarily ultra vires. These courts originally were not so restricted. If these restrictions have been detrimental to the rest of the Dominion, that is the fault of those who had the veto power and failed to exercise it.\nThe consideration, since the argument herein, of the British Columbia legislation in question in the appeal of the John Deere Plow Company v. Agnew[28], in a case in which the learned trial judge and Court of Appeal for British Columbia, had held a Dominion company, by reason of that legislation on this subject, could not recover, shew many opportunities have occurred and probably may occur again, to apply that remedy to amendments to that particular legislation.\nIt seems beyond dispute that all such companies carrying on business in a province are subject to direct taxation. See the case of The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[29]. And at least those companies resting upon the residual power of the Dominion are also liable to the power of a legislature over licensing, if I understand rightly The Brewers and Maltsters\u2019 Association v. The Attorney-General of Ontario[30]. The method adopted relative either to taxation or licensing may be objectionable, and the form it takes may be such that on a test thereof the Acts may be found so crudely worded and ill-directed as to render them ineffective.\nThere are besides other aspects of the matters arising under these exclusive powers of the provinces that are worthy of consideration.\nThe province within the sphere of action assigned to it occupies the position of an independent state.\nNot only is it entitled as a means of protecting its people against improper dealing leading to financial loss at the hands of foreign companies attempting to transact business in the province, to insist upon such information from them as may be reasonably necessary for such protection and for making it readily and locally accessible; but there is also the much wider field of social and economical questions bearing upon the welfare of the people dwelling therein which require the collection of an almost infinite variety of statistical information to lay the foundation for future legislative action to avert, and as occasions may demand to cure the disorders growing from the development of industrial and mercantile pursuits.\nIncidentally thereto, for example, the cost of production and rate of profit which people may be entitled to know, from those enjoying benefits at the expense of the public, the modes of business done, or to be done, by these corporate companies, the conditions of those serving them, the conditions under which the service is performed, the housing of such operatives as their mines, factories, or warehouses, may employ, the conditions of the relations of master and servant, and, in a word, the moral and material well-being of those in such service, and those enjoying such service, may each and all absolutely require information to be given and enlightened legislation to be enacted enforcing needed publicity and bearing upon the respective duties of all concerned.\nAll these, and many other things, as the result of present and future development, in the operations in which such companies and their relation to others may be concerned, may give rise to a need for local legislation.\nWe must, if we would in some faint measure realize the magnitude of the task that lies in the path of duty which is before the future legislators of our provinces, grasp the facts that some of these provinces, by reason of their territorial area, vast resources and attractive conditions which they hold out for men to live in and under, at no very distant day will each become the home of many more people than now dwell in the whole Dominion. And resulting therefrom, and their diversities of character and development in industrial pursuits, each will have possibly greater problems of a kind peculiar to itself than we can now readily conceive of to solve, so far as the several exclusive powers given them can enable them to solve or anticipate them.\nIn short, that field of legislative power which touches most intimately the lives and welfare of the people has been intrusted to such an extent to these local legislatures as to make thoughtful men chary of sweeping their work aside.\nLet no one be deceived, for behind the contentions set up herein, there lies if not the set purpose at least the possibility and perhaps hope that as a result to flow from the adoption of these several contentions there may only be Dominion corporate companies and that the only laws any such corporations can be expected to obey are such as Parliament may enact. Such a programme is entirely inconsistent with our federal system which has armed the legislatures with the powers I have just adverted to, yet has not disarmed Parliament from enacting the most beneficent legislation restrictive of its corporate creations and their relations to others.\nThe legislation, however, required in a province whose inhabitants are most largely devoted to mining, would not be so apparent to those inhabitants of another, more largely devoted to fishing and industries related thereto, or legislation required by either be so apparent to the inhabitants of yet another, devoted solely to agricultural pursuits, and vice versa. And hence Parliament might be slow to act when the legislature on the spot might be quickened to action therein by local knowledge.\nSuch are the conditions which lie at the basis of the federal system, relative to the need for legislation anticipating or curing evils, prompt response to the need, and adequate application of the remedy.\nAgain the corporate power and its many manifestations of combinations and of encroachment upon the rights and expectation of others, may need the fullest application of these powers in order that right be done and the future well being of all be assured.\nI see no reason to fear all such growth if properly watched and checked in regard to such possible abuses which occasionally in modern times are said to reach almost to a something akin to piracy. But I do see that it may need all the watchful care of both Dominion and provinces to furnish the necessary checks upon abuse. Indeed, I suspect the outcome of such development as is progressing, will, if public opinion is well directed, be a scheme requiring concurrent legislation and united action of both the Dominion and the provinces. The power that alone controls the laws giving and governing property and civil rights and defining the jurisdiction of the courts to enforce them, has the master hand and can neither be ignored nor defied. It alone can apply the most effective weapon against this combination and encroachment, which I have referred to, by withdrawing, and that automatically, as the offence is committed, the right to resort to the courts. Is possible realization thereof to be deleted from our constitution?\nThe power of Parliament over criminal law can never be half so effective as this merely provincial power if well directed.\nThe trouble is the matter has not been dealt with in the way the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d provided.\nIf the Dominion authorities chose they could have vetoed any such legislation as now complained of, if it seemed likely to improperly interfere with the operation of Dominion corporations. They can by watching such local legislation insist on that conforming to what is reasonable under pain of vetoing it. That is the clear method and the only direct method, which the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d furnishes. It is likely to be very effective if confined to such like use as involved in the fair and reasonable limitations thereof needed to protect Dominion corporations resting upon the residual power in their legitimate expectations. If this power has not been and is not to be directed by a public opinion sufficiently enlightened and robust to check any evils of a possible kind, nothing any court can do by the way of advisory mixed construction or misconstruction of the Act will help. I am not assuming this has not been done. I merely point out, if such legislation as complained of has existed or may hereafter exist and is or may be a source of well founded grievance, where the fault, if any, lies or may lie and the remedy, if one be required.\nThe prevalent public opinion of the entire people of the Dominion must ultimately determine where and to what extent the exercise of this veto power is to be effectively operated.\nThat public opinion can be most effectively evoked by the Dominion authority challenging and proposing to veto any obnoxious measure.\nIf any such changes of an undesirable nature have already been made, they can be rectified by public opinion and self interest being made to operate upon the enacting legislature. The time has passed in such cases for Dominion interference.\nI do not find any right in Parliament to override in any direct way as the question seems to imply, the will of the legislature, save, I repeat, in relation to companies and things falling within its exclusive legislative authority already referred to.\nProhibition of a company going into a province is rather an inapt term in this connection. It is conformity with the law of the province that is required. And if we drop the word \u201ccompany\u201d for a moment and ask what power Parliament has in any way relative to the person, to say he or she is or is not entitled to do business according to forms of contract in a province, not sanctioned by its legislation, and may or may not refuse to conform to the law of the province, we may get a clearer view of how matters stand. I repeat, the corporate company is but a certain legal combination of men, and in a legal sense no greater than the man, before the legislature.\nI may observe that the provincial legislation seemingly questioned is directed against (if such a term is proper) all foreign companies as well as those created by Parliament or other local legislatures. Dominion creations, save those clothed by Parliament by virtue of the exclusive legislative authority with other rights, stand on the same footing in this regard as those of the provincial legislatures or of a foreign state.\nThere is, however, another feature of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d relative to contracts which I suspect has not been developed as it might be. That is the exclusive control that Parliament has over bills of exchange and promissory notes.\nThis is part of the law of contracts not necessarily within the item of property and civil rights, as given the provinces. If Parliament should choose to exercise all its power relative thereto in favour of its companies, it might do much to ameliorate the condition of things a province may be disposed to push too far.\nThe province cannot take away this part of a Dominion company\u2019s contractual powers if Parliament says so in an effective manner, and its incidental power relative thereto is to be as liberally construed as it has been in other instances relative to contract. See, for example, the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The Attorney-General of Canada[31].\nIn view of all these considerations I can see no valid constitutional objections to a reasonable Act providing for registration and information and taxation. In regard to question number 7, I am at a loss to find in it anything but what I have covered by the foregoing.\nWhat is meant by a trading company? No one has ventured to tell us or explain the meaning of such language. Is this another attempt to get an opinion on sub-section 2 of section 91? That sub-section, however, was not brought forward as prominently in argument herein as in the case of the Insurance reference. We have, indeed, heard little argument bearing upon this question, save references to the Telephone Case[32] and the Hydraulic Case[33] which I am about to refer to.\nThe former was held to fall clearly within another exclusive power of Parliament contained in sub-section 29 of section 91, and the power incidental thereto, and not sub-section 2.\nThe case of La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[34], relied upon, I have dealt with in the Insurance Companies Reference heard before this one, and I need not repeat here what I said there. In addition thereto I may refer to what I said in the case of In re Alberta Railway Act(3), at foot of page 27 to top of page 33, relative to the features of the opinion in the Hydraulic Case(2) in regard to the respective fields of legislation open to the Dominion and the provinces.\nIt seems to me, I respectfully submit, that there may have been in that case a grave misapprehension of the doctrine involved in what has been expressed, sometimes loosely, as entitling the provincial legislature to occupy a certain field until the Dominion had entered the same field. In truth they never can occupy the same field in the sense which seems to have prevailed in that case, and indeed may have been present to the minds of others elsewhere. My reasons for so holding appear in the passages I refer to in the Alberta case just cited.\nI may refer also besides to what I have said in the Insurance Case[35], to the language used in the Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[36], at pages 112 and 113, as to the scope and purpose of sub-section 2 of section 91.\nI may add, however, that in my opinion, if the doctrine apparently laid down in the Hydraulic Case[37], that the Dominion Parliament can, in matters not resting in its exclusive authority, prevail over the provincial authority, is to stand, then there is not in the Act any restraint upon Parliament such as people for a lifetime have believed there was, and to secure which Confederation was brought about. Where, if followed, would such a doctrine land us?\nThe conclusive establishment of such a doctrine, I respectfully submit, would be fraught with danger to the Canadian scheme of federation, if not entirely destructive thereof.\nWhen the A. B. C. of the framework of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d has been duly observed, there need not be so much perplexity in determining its interpretation in any given case as seems so often to have arisen. Such is my excuse for repeating, with perhaps tiresome reiteration that A. B. C.\nIn conclusion I may add a word as to Russell v. The Queen[38], and its bearing upon questions raised herein.\nThe judgment therein shews an analysis of the Act based upon something like my A. B. C. suggestion and adopts a mode of reasoning upon which the decision rests which expressly finds the question of property and civil rights and the item in the Act regarding same are not involved in the enactment there in question. Hence the decision cannot help an attack such as made herein upon actual or hypothetical provincial legislation expressly dealing therewith and resting thereon.\nWhatever may be said of the reasoning in the Russell Case38 it can hardly be said that the propositions involved in these later contentions are necessary corollaries thereof.\nSubject to the respective limitations indicated in my foregoing opinion, the questions submitted should be respectively answered as follows:\u2014\nI would group questions one and two together, and for answer thereto say:\u2014\nA provincial legislature cannot incorporate a company to do any of the things which lie within the exclusive power of Parliament enumerated in section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and hence cannot be \u201cprovincial objects,\u201d but its corporate creations have each inherently in it, unless specifically restricted by the conditions of the instrument creating it, the power to go beyond the limits of the province to do business for such purposes and transactions as are needed to give due effect to the business operations of the company so far as within the scope of what they were created for, and the comity of nations will permit them. And if they be formed for the purpose of buying and selling grain, they can do so in any place where their business will carry them, and the comity of nations permit them. And those formed to grind grain, can, subject to the like limitations, grind it where deemed desirable.\nAs to the question No. 3, I answer in the affirmative; provided no restriction against the corporation doing so has been placed in the company\u2019s charter, and no prohibition in the foreign state or province where contracting. Citizenship cannot affect the matter unless by reason of some such restriction, or by reason of Parliament, by virtue of its power over aliens and naturalization, having legislatively intervened for such purpose.\nAs to question No. 4, my last answer renders it unnecessary to answer it save as to the sub-question, and in answer to that I submit the section may be held to be so completely ultra vires as to render it entirely inoperative. It may be, however, that it is capable of being read as a prohibition of alien or foreign companies, which Parliament by virtue of its powers over aliens, desired to prohibit unless when licensed; or it may be operative by virtue of some possible conditions of fact of which we are not informed, relative to pre-confederation companies.\nAnything of that nature may involve so many limitations and qualifications as to render any answer worthless; or worse as being possibly prejudicial to companies that may be concerned.\nTo question No. 5, I answer \u201cNo.\u201d\nAs to question No. 6, I answer that as to companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada, their rights must depend upon whether incorporated by virtue of the paramount and exclusive powers of Parliament over the subject-matters enumerated in section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d or upon the residual powers of Parliament.\nIf upon the former there can be no prohibition properly so-called though they are subject to direct taxation which may possibly assume a licensing form.\nBut, if dependent upon the residual powers of Parliament they must conform to the laws of the province which have been duly enacted within the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures, and not vetoed by the Dominion authorities.\nWhen the veto power has not been exercised in respect of any provincial enactment, intra vires, the Dominion must be held to have given its irrevocable sanction thereto so effectually that Parliament by virtue of its residual power cannot override same.\nAs to question No. 7.\nIn answer to this question, I know of no corporate bodies which can be distinguished in their legal capacities and powers by any such term as \u201ctrading companies.\u201d Such corporations as fall within the enumerated powers of Parliament are entitled to the rights it may have given them. All others must conform with the laws of the province duly enacted within the enumerated powers given by section 92 to the exclusive legislature authority of the provinces, and not disallowed by the veto power.\nDuff J.\u2014The first two questions are as follows:\u2014 (1) What limitations exist under the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d upon the power of the provincial legislatures to incorporate companies? \u201cWhat is the meaning of the expression \u2018with provincial objects\u2019 in section 92, article 11, of the said Act? Is the limitation thereby defined territorial, or does it have regard to the character of the powers which may be conferred upon companies locally incorporated, or what otherwise is the intention and effect of the said limitation?\n\u201c(2) Has a company incorporated by a provincial legislature under the powers conferred in that behalf by section 92, article 11, of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d power or capacity to do business outside of the limits of the incorporating province? If so, to what extent and for what purpose?\n\u201cHas a company incorporated by a provincial legislature for the purpose, for example, of buying and selling or grinding grain, the power or capacity, by virtue of such provincial incorporation, to buy or sell or grind grain outside of the incorporating province?\u201d\nIt will be convenient to consider these questions together. The \u201ccompanies\u201d referred to in them may be assumed to be companies incorporated for the carrying on of some business for gain to be distributed among the members thereof as private individuals. There are certain kinds of business and certain classes of undertakings which by section 91 are exclusively committed to the control of the Dominion, e.g., banking and works extending beyond limits of a province. I do not intend to consider the exact scope of this exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion. Such exclusive jurisdiction being vested in the Dominion by force of the enumerated clauses of section 91 cannot be affected by any of the provisions of section 92. It will be understood that what follows has no reference to companies to which that jurisdiction extends.\nThe point to be considered really is: What are the meaning and effect of No. 11 of section 92? I think only a very general answer can be given to this question. \u201cObjects\u201d means, I think, le but organis\u00e9 of the company, the business which the company is authorized by its constitution to carry on with a view to the profit which is the ultimate purpose of its members. This business must be such, I think, that it falls within the description \u201cprovincial\u201d\u2014the adjective provincial having reference to the incorporating province. The legislature of Ontario, that is to say, is empowered by No. 11 of section 92 to incorporate companies for carrying on any kind of business which fairly falls within the description \u201cOntario business.\u201d The view put forward on behalf of the provinces that \u201cprovincial\u201d is used in another sense, that its antithesis is not \u201cextra-provincial\u201d or \u201cnon-provincial\u201d but \u201cDominion,\u201d (\u201cDominion\u201d including those matters which regarded as the objects of a company are exclusively committed to the Dominion by section 91) does not appear to me to be a view which can be reconciled with the decisions in the Parsons Case[39], and the Colonial Building Association\u2019s Case[40], I have given my reason for this in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co.[41]. Here I will only say this: In Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons39, at page 117, Sir Montague Smith observed:\u2014\nThe incorporation of companies for objects other than provincial falls within the general powers of the Parliament of Canada,\nand this proposition is based upon the ground that the only subject assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces \u201con this head\u201d (incorporation of companies) is \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d In the subsequent decision above referred to[42], at pages 164 and 165, it is stated that their Lordships adhere to the view expressed by them in the Parsons Case[43],\nas to the respective powers of the Dominion and provincial legislatures in regard to the incorporation of companies.\nAgain, referring to the company in question in that case \u201cthe company was incorporated with powers to carry on its business consisting of various kinds throughout the Dominion. The Parliament of Canada could alone constitute a corporation with these powers.\u201d Upon this last passage an argument has been based to the effect that their Lordships in these judgments are dealing not with the nature of the capacity which the respective legislatures may confer upon companies incorporated by them, but with the rights with which they may invest them in respect of the carrying on of their business. \u201cPowers to carry on its business\u201d meaning according to this construction the right to carry on its business throughout the Dominion. No doubt there may be ambiguity in the word \u201cpowers\u201d when taken apart from the context in which it is employed, but in this judgment a reference to the following passage at page 166 seems to me to remove all possible question as to their Lordships\u2019 meaning. Their Lordships\u2019 opinion as expressed in the judgment, be it observed, was that a certain Act of the Parliament of Canada incorporating the company in question was within the authority of the Dominion because a provincial legislature would have no authority to incorporate a company with such \u201cpowers.\u201d At page 166 the effect of this Act is stated by their Lordships in the passage referred to.\nWhat the \u201cAct of Incorporation\u201d has done is to create a legal and artificial person with capacity to carry on certain kinds of business, which are defined, within a defined area, viz., throughout the Dominion. Among other things, it has given to the association power to deal in land and buildings, but the capacity so given only enables it to acquire and hold land in any province consistently with the laws of that province relating to the acquisition and tenure of land. If the company can so acquire and hold it, the Act of Incorporation gives it capacity to do so.\nIt was an enactment having this effect that in their Lordships\u2019 view could not be passed in exercise of the powers of a provincial legislature under section 92.\nThe limitation above indicated, viz., that the business is to be a \u201cprovincial\u201d business in the sense mentioned is the only limitation, I think, which can be derived from the Act. In the cases just referred to their Lordships are of course dealing only with companies carrying on business for the private profit of their members; but it is arguable that the characteristic marked by the word \u201cprovincial\u201d may consist in some relation between the company and the province as a political entity. One may instance a company formed by a province exclusively for some purpose connected with the Government of the province; but, as I have already said such companies are outside the range of the present discussion. I mention them here because I do not wish to be understood as expressing a positive opinion that the characteristic expressed by the word \u201cprovincial\u201d as used in No. 11 can only consist in some relation between the business of the company and the province as a geographical area. The cases just mentioned decide that as a rule the territorial relation must as regards companies formed in the usual way for the profit of their members furnish the test; but I am not sure that these decisions oblige us to hold that this is the single exclusive test for the application of No. 11.\nOne can, however, say with confidence, that where the business as authorized by the constitution of the company is so related to the territory of the incorporating province that the business can be said to be \u201cprovincial\u201d in the territorial sense, then it is clear that the company comes within the class of companies to which No. 11 applies. Whether a particular business does or does not fall within that description must be a question to be determined in each case substantially, it seems to me, as matter of fact. It seems very clear that the business of working a coal mine in Cape Breton must be a provincial business in relation to Nova Scotia and equally clear that the business of working coal mines in Nova Scotia, Alberta and Vancouver Island is not a provincial business in relation to Nova Scotia, Alberta or British Columbia. Coming to the concrete instances mentioned in the questions I think the business of working mills for grinding grain in a single province is as to that province a \u201cprovincial\u201d business. The business of working mills for grinding grain in more provinces than one is not as to any one of those provinces a \u201cprovincial\u201d business. The case of a mercantile business presents perhaps more difficulty. I think the decision of the Privy Council in the Colonial Building Association\u2019s Case[44] requires me to hold that the business of a grain merchant carried on in such a way that there are places of business in different provinces of Canada is not a \u201cprovincial\u201d business within the meaning of that word as used in No. 11. On the other hand, I have not been able to convince myself that the business of a grain merchant carried on by means of places of business confined to one province cannot fairly be described as a \u201cprovincial\u201d business in reference to that province, merely because it is a part of the business so carried on, that grain is bought outside the province and sold outside the province. I think there is nothing in the decision or the language of the judgment in the Colonial Building Association\u2019s Case[45] inconsistent with that view. The judgment ought to be read secundum subjectam materiam. The Act of Incorporation which was there in question and was held to be beyond the powers of a province authorized the company to carry on its business anywhere in Canada and to establish branch offices in London, New York and in any city or town in the Dominion. The company was enabled, indeed, to carry on as much or as little of its business as the directors might see fit in any province of Canada subject to the single restriction that the general office was to be in Montreal. In applying the rule stated in their Lordships\u2019 judgment that the incorporation of a company empowered to carry on its business throughout the Dominion is beyond the powers of a provincial legislature one ought, I think, to construe the phrase \u201ccarry on business\u201d in the light of these provisions of the Act then before their Lordships. Their Lordships had not before them any question, and I think one is entitled to say that their Lordships did not intend to lay down any binding rule for determining just how far a company incorporated by a province might be authorized by the provincial legislature to enter into business transactions beyond the limits of its province of origin. The decision unquestionably establishes, in my judgment, as I have already said, that the capacity to carry on business throughout the Dominion in the unlimited way provided for in the Colonial Building Association\u2019s Act of Incorporation is a capacity which a provincial legislature could not confer upon a company incorporated by it. I do not think that the authority of the decision can fairly be said to extend beyond that so far as this point is concerned.\nI think you may find the characteristic \u201cprovincial\u201d for the purposes of No. 11 in the fact that the business is carried on by means of places of business situated in one province alone. It appears to me that you must look at the business as a whole and that such a business (as the business of an incorporated company) is prima facie \u201cprovincial.\u201d\nWhat I have just said will indicate the extent to which I think the question relating to the capacity of provincial companies to carry on business outside the province can be answered. I think a province can confer upon its companies the capacity to acquire rights and exercise their powers (in respect of matters relating to the business of the company), outside the province, so long as the business when looked at as a whole as that of an incorporated company (in connection, that is to say, with the capacities and powers of the company so exercisable beyond the limits of the province) is still a \u201cprovincial\u201d business. Whether in any particular case that is or is not so is a question to be determined according to the circumstances of that case. There is one observation which I think ought to be added in view of an argument presented by Mr. Nesbitt to the effect that the opinions above indicated as to the construction of No. 11 of section 92 are views which are novel in this country and which, if accepted, would throw the business of the country into confusion. As to the practical effect of this construction I do not feel satisfied that one has before one the material necessary to enable one to form a judgment upon that point. As to the view being a novel view I think I may properly call attention to some observations made by Sir Oliver Mowat in 1897 in the report made by him as Minister of Justice upon an enactment of the Legislature of Nova Scotia. The report so far as material is as follows:\u2014\nThe only authority conferred upon a provincial legislature to incorporate companies is for \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d The undersigned construes this authority to mean objects provincial as to the province creating the corporation. In the case of the Colonial Building and Investment Association v. The Attorney-General of Quebec[46], the appellant company had been incorporated by the Parliament of Canada with power throughout the Dominion to acquire and hold lands, construct houses, sell and dispose of such property, lend money upon mortgages, and deal in public securities. There can be no doubt that a provincial legislature could have incorporated a company with authority to exercise the same powers within the limits of the province, yet in delivering the judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee, Sir Montague E. Smith held that inasmuch as the company was incorporated to carry on its business throughout the Dominion, the Parliament of Canada could alone constitute a company with these powers.\nIt would seem to follow that the statute in question which confers upon the company authority to acquire, cultivate, improve and sell lands not only in the Province of Nova Scotia, but also in the Province of New Brunswick and elsewhere, is not limited to provincial objects in the sense in which that expression is used in the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and, therefore, that the enactment is ultra vires. The undersigned considers that this view should be submitted to the provincial government, and that the statute should be disallowed unless Your Excellency\u2019s government is assured that it will be amended within the time limited for disallowance by repealing the authority so far as extra provincial territory is concerned.\nThis suggestion was accepted by the provincial government and the suggested amendments were made. See Reports of Ministers of Justice on Provincial Legislation, 1896 to 1898, p. 33. Sir Oliver Mowat was, it is perhaps unnecessary to mention, one of the Members of the Quebec Conference, and his long experience in dealing with questions on the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d and the weight attaching to his views on such questions make this report a very cogent piece of evidence (if it is not indeed entirely conclusive) against the suggestion put forward by Mr. Nesbitt. The concluding paragraph seems to shew that according to the opinion of Sir Oliver Mowat there was not much room for doubt upon the point. It is difficult to believe if the views expressed by him had been but recently formed (it is impossible to suppose that the subject was a new subject to him) or were considered by him to be opposed to the general current of competent professional opinion that he would have expressed himself so positively on the subject of disallowance.\n\u201c(3) Has a corporation constituted by a provincial legislature with power to carry on a fire insurance business, there being no stated limitation as to the locality within which the business may be carried on, power or capacity to make and execute contracts\u2014\n\u201c(a) within the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province;\n\u201c(b) outside of the incorporating province insuring property within the province; \u201c(c) outside of the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province?\n\u201cHas such a corporation power or capacity to insure property situate in a foreign country, or to make an insurance contract within a foreign country?\n\u201cDo the answers to the foregoing inquiries, or any and which of them, depend upon whether or not the owner of the property or risk insured is a citizen or resident of the incorporating province?\u201d\nAssuming the business of the company to be prima facie provincial in the sense indicated in the reasons given for the answers to questions 1 and 2, I think it is not necessarily incompatible with that restriction that the company should make and execute contracts of the kinds and in the circumstances indicated in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).\nThe answer to the question in the second paragraph is \u201cYes,\u201d and in the third paragraph \u201cNo.\u201d\nQuestion 4. \u201cIf any or all of the above mentioned cases (a), (b) and (c) the answer be negative, would the corporation have throughout Canada the power or capacity mentioned in any and which or the said cases on availing itself of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d 9 and 10 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 3, sub-sec. 3?\n\u201cIs the said enactment, the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d ch. 32, sec. 3, sub-sec. 3, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\u201d\nSince my answer to the previous questions is in the affirmative the necessity for answering the question in the first paragraph does not arise. In answer to the question in the second paragraph\u2014Since the main enactments of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d are ultra vires the ancillary provisions fall with them.\nQuestion 5. \u201cCan the powers of a company incorporated by a provincial legislature be enlarged and to what extent, either as to locality or objects by\n\u201c(a) the Dominion Parliament?\n\u201c(b) the legislature of another province?\u201d\nMy answer to the question in paragraph (a) is that the Dominion Parliament cannot do so under its general powers.\nThe effect of declaring a local work to be a work for the general advantage of Canada upon the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament in relation to the powers of a provincial company by which it is owned and worked was not argued, and I express no opinion upon it.\nAs to paragraph (b) my answer is in the negative.\nQuestions 6 and 7 are as follows:\u2014\n\u201c6. Has the legislature of a province power to prohibit companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada from carrying on business within the province unless or until the companies obtain a license so to do from the government of the province, or other local authority constituted by the legislature, if fees are required to be paid upon the issue of such license?\n\u201cFor examples of such provincial legislation see Ontario, 63 Vict. ch. 24; New Brunswick, Cons. Sts., 1903, ch. 18; British Columbia, 5 Edw. VII. ch. 11.\n\u201c7. Is it competent to a provincial legislature to restrict a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada for the purpose of trading throughout the whole Dominion in the exercise of the special trading powers so conferred or to limit the exercise of such powers within the province?\n\u201cIs such a Dominion trading company subject to or governed by the legislation of a province in which it carries out or proposes to carry out its trading powers limiting the nature or kinds of business which corporations not incorporated by the legislature of the province may carry on, or the powers which they may exercise within the province, or imposing conditions which are to be observed or complied with by such corporations before they can engage in business within the province?\n\u201cCan such a company so incorporated by the Parliament of Canada be otherwise restricted in the exercise of its corporate powers or capacity, and how, and in what respect by provincial legislation?\u201d\nAs to companies incorporated or exercising powers conferred by the Dominion Parliament under the authority of the enumerated heads of section 91, I do not think I could usefully attempt to answer either of these questions, except in relation to some specific Dominion enactment passed or contemplated.\nAs to companies incorporated under the general authority of the Dominion to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, and possessing powers conferred in exercise of that authority my answer to the 6th question is \u201cYes.\u201d\nAs to the 7th question: Referring to the sole concrete point discussed before us in relation to such last mentioned companies it was I think competent to the British Columbia Legislature to enact sections 139, 152, 167 and 168 of the British Columbia \u201cCompanies Act\u201d (ch. 39, R.S.B.C.); and that those enactments are operative with respect to trading companies (carrying on business in the province within the meaning of the Act) incorporated under the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act\u201d for carrying on any business which if carried on in a single province would not be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada by force of one or more of the enumerated heads of section 91.\nMy reasons for my answer to questions 6 and 7 are as follows.\nAre trading companies incorporated by the Dominion (as such) exempt from provincial jurisdiction in relation to matters comprised within the subjects of the enactments referred to in question 6?\nThe discussion was confined to the effect of provincial legislation upon companies incorporated and exercising powers conferred under the authority of the introductory clause of section 91 or under No. 2 of section 91, the regulation of trade and commerce. The argument against the legislation mentioned in the addendum to question 6 assumed that a company empowered by the Dominion under one or other of these provisions to carry on in more than one province a business which would be a branch of \u201ctrade\u201d within the last mentioned enactment is in a more favourable position (as regards such legislation as that in question) than companies incorporated for other purposes because it was argued that such trading companies are (as \u201cagencies of inter-provincial trade\u201d I think the phrase is) in a larger degree reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion. It will be sufficient in the view I have to express to consider whether such legislation is effective in its application to this species of companies.\nConsider a trading company incorporated by the Dominion under the general powers to make laws for the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d of Canada, conferred by the introductory clause of section 91. In speaking of this power I shall refer to it as the \u201cgeneral power\u201d or the power given by the \u201cintroductory clause.\u201d A typical company of this class would be a company incorporated under the provisions of the Dominion \u201cCompanies\u2019 Act\u201d to carry on generally throughout the Dominion or elsewhere a mercantile business of a particular description. By section 5 of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d\n5. The (Secretary of State may, by letters patent under his seal of office, grant a charter to any number of persons, not less than five, who apply therefor constituting such persons, and others who have become subscribers to the memorandum of agreement hereinafter mentioned and who thereafter become shareholders in the company thereby created, a body corporate, and politic, for any of the purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends, except the construction and working of railways or of telegraph or telephone lines, the business of insurance, the business of a loan company and the business of banking and the issue of paper money.\nI shall first consider the provincial legislation on the assumption that there is no Dominion legislation in terms conflicting with it, except in so far as it may be supposed or contended that such provincial legislation is necessarily in conflict with the provision just quoted.\nThe question of the effect of Dominion legislation professing to confer upon a Dominion company rights or powers exercisable in derogation of such provincial enactments as those under consideration, I will refer to later.\nThe provincial jurisdiction in relation to the subject of the incorporation of companies of the kind we are concerned with on this reference, viz., companies incorporated for the purpose of carrying on some business for private gain has been held by the highest judicial authority (Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[47]; Parsons v. Citizens Insurance Co.[48]; Dobie v. The Temporalities Board[49]) to be exhaustively defined by No. 11 of section 92. Whatever, therefore, belongs strictly to the subject of the \u201cincorporation of companies,\u201d as that phrase is to be properly understood in this connection, is a matter which in relation to companies whose objects do not fall within the description \u201cprovincial objects\u201d has not been committed to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces. As regards our typical company, a company having capacity to carry on a mercantile business throughout Canada it is clear that no legislation by a province in relation to the subject \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d can affect it. On the other hand jurisdiction is conferred upon the provinces in relation to taxation, administration of justice, licenses, property and civil rights, matters merely local and private within the province, and such a company is not by reason of the fact that it is exempt from provincial jurisdiction in respect of the subject of the \u201cincorporation of companies,\u201d exempt also in any further degree whatsoever, from the jurisdiction of a province in respect of these other subjects. The integrity of the provincial jurisdiction in relation to these subjects is preserved by the express provision in section 91 that the general jurisdiction conferred by the introductory clause (of which the authority respecting \u201cincorporation\u201d is a part) has only relation to \u201cmatters not coming within the class of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces,\u201d and by the provision of section 92 that the jurisdiction conferred thereby upon the provinces is \u201cexclusive.\u201d The companies, therefore, which owe their corporate character to this Dominion authority once they receive that character, are not (as such) entities set apart and as a privileged class exempt from the jurisdiction of the provinces in relation to other matters comprised in the subjects assigned exclusively to the provinces.\nThe authority in relation to \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d assigned to the provinces by No. 11 of section 92 does not and was not intended to confer upon the provinces the power to create corporations exempted from the jurisdiction of the Dominion with regard to any of the matters properly the subjects of legislation by the Dominion under section 91. Just as little reason could there be for asserting that under the general powers (from the scope of which \u201cmatters coming within the class of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces\u201d are in terms excluded by the Act) the Dominion can create a corporation removed from the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces in respect of the matters thus excluded from Dominion jurisdiction. In each province the Dominion company which as a company is within the provincial territory is (with the reservation indicated above) subject to the provincial jurisdiction and to the Dominion jurisdiction just as other companies and natural persons are.\nThe division of powers (under the general scheme of the Act) is according to the subject matter of the legislation, not according to the persons to be affected by the legislation. Care was taken to specify those cases in which it was thought necessary that the rights of a particular class of persons as such or a particular class of institutions as such should be exclusively committed to the control of one legislature or of the other. When, therefore, with regard to provincial legislation which deals with matters prima facie falling within the \u201cadministration of justice within the province,\u201d \u201cproperty and civil rights within the province,\u201d \u201cmatters merely local and private within the province,\u201d it is contended that such legislation is inoperative as regards a Dominion company merely because the Dominion company is a company incorporated under the authority of the general power conferred by the introductory clause then it rests with those who so contend to shew that such legislation is legislation relating to the \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d and not legislation in regard to the subjects with which it professes to deal. That subject (\u201cincorporation\u201d) would include the constitution of the company, the designation of its corporate capacities, the relation of the members of the company to the company itself, the powers of the governing body. How much more it would include may be left to be determined in each concrete case in which the point arises. In every such case the question would be: On a fair construction of such provincial legislation is the matter of it within the subject of \u201cincorporation of companies?\u201d If it is, it cannot affect a company validly incorporated to carry on trade throughout the Dominion. If it is not and if it relates to matters falling within the subjects enumerated in section 92 then it is not invalid because it applies to such companies. It seems to me to be incontestable that this must be so, even if the legislation did (what the legislation under consideration does not), viz., singled out Dominion companies in general or a Dominion company in particular as the object of its provisions; for the reason that as I have already said, save only as regards matters which fall within the subject matter of the \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d the Dominion company is subject in the various provinces where it is found to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces in the same way as any other corporation or natural person, and this jurisdiction is plenary\u2014\u201cas supreme\u201d as that exercised by the provinces before the passing of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d: Liquidators of Maritime Bank. v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[50], at page 441.\nIn this view it does not appear to me that the legislative provisions in question which were particularly discussed on the argument (sections 139, 152, 167 and 168 of the \u201cBritish Columbia Companies Act\u201d) present any serious difficulty.\nBefore I come to the consideration of these provisions in detail, however, it is more convenient, I think, that I should deal with certain general assumptions which really constitute the foundation upon which the argument against this legislation rests. The first assumption is that all matters relating to \u201ccompanies\u201d whose \u201cobjects\u201d are not \u201cprovincial\u201d are withheld by the terms of section 92 from the jurisdiction of the provinces; the second assumption is that being withheld\u2014in the sense of not having been given\u2014these matters are to be taken to constitute a field of activity \u201cexcepted\u201d from the field of provincial jurisdiction; and the third assumption is that such being the case the Dominion jurisdiction in relation to the subject of \u201ccompanies\u201d other than companies with \u201cprovincial objects\u201d stands in the same category as the Dominion jurisdiction in relation to the subjects expressly enumerated in section 91. As to the first of these assumptions it is of course opposed to the express language of the Act. No. 11 of section 92 deals with the subject of \u201cincorporation\u201d and there is no warrant for giving to the words anything other than their natural meaning. They do mean, I agree, that as regards the \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d the provincial jurisdiction relates only to a particular class of \u201ccompanies,\u201d and that (whatever otherwise might have been the effect of No. 13 and No. 16, if No. 11 were not there) on this subject of \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d it must be taken that the provincial jurisdiction is thus limited. But you cannot by any permissible process, infer from the language of No. 11 any limitation upon the jurisdiction of the provinces, in relation to \u201ccompanies\u201d not within No. 11 in regard to matters which do not fall within the strictly limited subject of \u201cincorporation.\u201d With regard to the second assumption it is of very little consequence whether you say that the subject of the \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d other than those having \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is not included in the matters which are excepted from the general jurisdiction, and therefore falls within that jurisdiction; or whether you say that such matters are excepted from the provincial jurisdiction, so long as the exact meaning of your proposition is clearly understood; viz., that the legislative jurisdiction in relation to the \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d with other than \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is a jurisdiction which not having been excepted from the general authority of the Dominion under the introductory clause of section 91 remains a part of that authority.\nIt is important at this point to note that it cannot be contended\u2014it certainly was not contended at the bar\u2014that the subject of the \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d with \u201cobjects\u201d other than \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is a subject \u201cexpressly excepted\u201d from the matters assigned to the provinces by section 92 within the meaning of No. 29 of section 91. I do not dwell upon this point; it appears to be obvious that such a conclusion cannot be reached without deleting in effect the word \u201cexpressly\u201d from the language of No. 29.\nThe effect of the third assumption is, of course, to abolish for the purposes of this question the distinction between the general power and the power of the Dominion in relation to subjects enumerated in section 91; with the result first of attracting to the support of the Dominion authority in relation to this particular subject the exception at the end of section 91 (which by its express terms applies only to the enumerated subjects) as well as the primacy conferred by the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding anything in the Act\u201d in the early part of the section. These assumptions being made and the net result of them being that the subject of \u201ccompanies\u201d having objects other than \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is one of the enumerated subjects under section 91\u2014it is argued that the legislation in question (which unquestionably is legislation in relation to such \u201ccompanies\u201d although not legislation in relation to the \u201cincorporation of companies,\u201d) is legislation upon a matter, strictly relating to a subject which has been assigned to the Dominion; that while it may be in a sense legislation relating to civil rights, administration of justice, and so on, it still is, when it is looked at carefully, legislation which in reality singles out as its objects corporations which have been exclusively committed to the authority of the Dominion. Given the assumptions stated above, there would unquestionably be not a little force in this contention. Even in the absence of conflicting Dominion legislation (which is the hypothesis upon which I am now proceeding), it may very well be doubted whether such legislation as this could be enacted in respect of corporations included (e.g., Banks) co nomine among the enumerated subjects of section 91. But the assumptions involve, as I have already pointed out, first a misreading of No. 11 of section 92, and secondly, a total misconception of the effect of the introductory clause of section 91.\nThe argument against the provincial legislation on this head falls to pieces when one brings it into touch with language of the Act.\nThe contention is really based upon certain decisions and dicta which, for the reasons I shall presently give, appear to me to have been misunderstood. These I think it will be convenient to discuss after I have considered the provincial enactments themselves.\nThe licensing provisions of the \u201cBritish Columbia Companies Act.\u201d\nComing to the particular provisions which were discussed upon the argument (certain enactments in the \u201cCompanies Act of British Columbia\u201d), the first point concerns the authority of a province to require extra-provincial companies including Dominion companies to take out a licence and to pay a licence fee as a condition of carrying on business in the province. There are two points to be noted at the outset: (1), sections 139 and 152, R.S.B.C., 1911, shew clearly enough that the provisions of Part 6 apply only to companies \u201cauthorized by their charter and regulations to affect some purpose or object to which the legislative authority of the legislature of British Columbia extends,\u201d and therefore, can have no application to a bank or to companies incorporated for the purpose of constructing or working a \u201cwork or undertaking\u201d extending beyonds the limits of the province or carrying on any business which if confined to one province would be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament under one of the enumerated heads of section 91.\n(2). The tenor of the license when granted is to authorize the company to carry on business within the province and the Act prohibits the carrying on of any part of the company\u2019s business in the absence of such a license; but the construction I draw from the Act as a whole and particularly from secs. 167 to 172 is that the words \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in these provisions ought to be read as \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in such a way as to bring the company within the penal legislative jurisdiction of the province and generally within the jurisdiction of the courts of the province according to the general principles of law; that is to say, so that the company as a company is present at some place within the province. The provision which forbids any company broker or other person from carrying on any of the business of the company within the province as the representative or agent of the company is very necessary to prevent evasions of the principal enactment, and the penalties imposed by section 170 upon such agents or representatives are, in my judgment, clearly exigible only when in truth and reality the business carried on is the business of the company; and when, of the company, it can be said in truth by a court in British Columbia in any proceedings against it \u201cthey are here\u201d as Lord Halsbury\u2019s phrase is. Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Transatlantique v. Law[51].\nThese preliminary observations being made, it is difficult to say upon what ground it can be seriously argued that the province is acting beyond its powers in requiring the companies to which the Act applies before carrying on any business to which the Act relates, to take out a licence and pay a licence fee. The enactment in this respect, in my judgment, can be supported under either the second or the ninth head of section 92. Ex hypothesi the company is within the province. Being there it is subject to the taxing power of the province. It seems clear enough that the fee imposed by these Acts can be supported as a tax. The fact that it is imposed once for all is really no objection. It is a public impost levied by the authority of the Legislature for the purpose of providing a public revenue.\nIt was argued that under section 92 (2) that is to say, under the authority to \u201cmake laws in relation to direct taxation within the province,\u201d the province has no power to require the taking out of a licence as a condition of carrying on business, that the authority of the province in other words in respect of licences is limited to that conferred by No. 9. That is certainly not the necessary construction of section 92. It is obvious that a licence fee may be imposed in such a way as to amount to an indirect tax. Even so, the province has authority to impose it if it come within No. 9. In the Queen Insurance Case[52], it was held that the pretended \u201cLicence Act\u201d there under consideration was in reality a Stamp Act, in other words, that the pretended licence required by the Act was not a licence within No. 9 and that consequently the duty or fee exacted under the name of a licence fee, which was held to be an indirect tax, could not be supported under that number. The decision does not suggest that a fee which is truly a licence fee and which is at the same time an indirect tax cannot be imposed under No. 9, but on the contrary, the judgment implies the opposite. No. 9, therefore, ought not to be read as limitative of No. 2.\nAn enactment requiring a licence to be taken out as a condition of carrying on business and the payment of a licence fee as a condition of the right to the licence may, if not otherwise open to objection, be supported as an enactment in relation to the subject of \u201cdirect taxation.\u201d The point was decided by the Privy Council, in Brewers\u2019 Association v. Attorney-General of Ontario[53]. In that case their Lordships had to consider certain provisions of the \u201cOntario Liquor Licence Act\u201d which required brewers and distillers to take out licences paying therefore a licence fee as a condition of carrying on their business. Lord Herschell in delivering the judgment of the Board stated at p. 235 that the question was whether the fee imposed was direct taxation within the meaning of section 92 (2) or if not whether the license was comprised within the term \u201cother licenses\u201d in sub-section 9. The effect of the judgment is that if the fee was \u201cdirect taxation,\u201d the enactments requiring brewers and distillers first to obtain a licence under the Act in order to sell liquor manufactured by them was a valid enactment, independently altogether of the question whether the licence could be sustained as a licence under No. 9. Their Lordships in fact held that the fee was \u201cdirect taxation,\u201d and having stated their Lordships\u2019 conclusion upon that point Lord Herschell proceeds to observe that \u201cthe view which their Lordships have expressed is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.\u201d His Lordship then proceeds to say that their Lordships were not satisfied with the argument of the appellants, that the licence was not a licence within No. 9. But the decision was rested upon the ground that the enactment in question which required a licence to be taken out and a fee to be paid as a condition of carrying on a particular business was \u201cdirect taxation\u201d within No. 2.\nIt appears to me, however, that the enactments in question in so far as they require the payment of a fee as a condition of taking out the licence and the licence as a condition of carrying on business are sustainable under No. 9. I have not been able to satisfy myself that a licence to carry on any business for gain would not fall within the category of \u201cother licences\u201d in No. 9, unless it should be a business which could be held to be exempted from the operation of No. 9 by reason of the provisions of section 91. The considerations bearing upon this last mentioned point may be conveniently postponed until I come to the discussion of the effect of the provincial legislation as regards trading companies incorporated under No. 2 of section 91. The fact that the enactment is framed in general terms could hardly be a ground of objection. If the legislature could validly require licences in respect of any business carried on for gain within the province subject, let us assume, to the overriding effect of Dominion legislation, it is difficult to see how the legislation can be objected to because it is framed in general terms and made applicable to all persons or all companies or all partnerships or all unincorporated associations carrying on in the province any business the object of which is gain. In point of fact it is not an uncommon form of legislation on the subject of licences to impose a licence fee of a named amount upon every trade, business or occupation other than certain enumerated ones. It is a clause commonly introduced as a drag-net in order to meet the possibility of the enumeration not having been exhaustive. I have never seen any reason to doubt that such legislation provided it is otherwise unobjectionable is perfectly valid notwithstanding the generality of its terms. The argument presented on behalf of the Manufacturers\u2019 Association that the licence in order to be valid must be imposed equally upon all persons, corporations, etc., carrying on any of the kinds of business in respect of which it is imposed is one which perhaps hardly requires discussion. The answer to it of course is that the power conferred upon the province is not the power to impose licences but to \u201cmake laws in relation to all matters\u201d coming within the subject which is described by the words of No. 9; and this power is plenary.\nI come now to the requirements which must be observed before a licence can be obtained. The regulations broadly speaking are of two classes: first, those designed to give public information regarding the financial position of the company; and second, those requiring the company to place on record in a public office the particulars of its constitution and its regulations, and requiring the appointment of an attorney for the province, having power to act for and bind the company in judicial proceedings. When one considers the privileges that a limited company enjoys as a limited company these regulations seem to be of no very extraordinary character and moreover to be regulations having direct relation to civil rights and the administration of justice within the province. Such companies carry on their operations, speaking generally, under the protection of the English rule of ultra vires and its members enjoy the protection of the principle of limited liability; and as a rule persons dealing with them are deemed to have notice of the limits imposed by the constitution and regulations of the company upon the authority of the governing body and of other officers and agents of the company. It is obvious, of course, that these principles might operate with great injustice in the case of extra-provincial companies in the absence of some such regulations as those in question. In the case of an English company, for example, incorporated under the \u201cEnglish Companies Act,\u201d carrying on business in British Columbia the rule affecting persons dealing with the company with notice of the restrictions upon the authority of the company\u2019s officers to be found in the articles of association would be little short of an absurdity in the absence of some provision requiring a public record of the companies articles in British Columbia. So with regard to the doctrine of ultra vires. Giving full effect to that doctrine it seems reasonable in the interests of those dealing with it that a company should be required in any separate jurisdiction in which it carries on business to make a public record of the instruments defining its constitution. As regards to the appointment of an attorney, for the purpose of judicial proceedings, this seems a reasonable measure for ensuring that companies enjoying the protection of the provincial laws as if they were residents of the province and the provisions made for the administration of justice should themselves be amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts. When one considers the difficulties that arise in the course of judicial proceedings in such matters for example, as obtaining discovery where a foreign corporation is concerned, there seems to be nothing extravagant in the regulation referred to as a regulation relating \u201cto the administration of justice.\u201d Not one of these regulations can fairly be said to be a regulation relating to the subject of \u201cincorporation\u201d of extra-provincial companies. One may assume for the purpose of the question before us that that subject includes everything embraced in what may be called the \u201cpersonal law\u201d of the company. But one gets into a different region altogether when one comes to consider the measures required in a particular jurisdiction in which the company is carrying on business for the purpose of protecting the public generally in its dealings with such companies in view of the fact these very matters are under the control of another jurisdiction. There is nothing in these provisions inconsistent with the loyal recognition of the Dominion jurisdiction in all matters falling within the subject of \u201cincorporation.\u201d\nContention that these licensing provisions were not passed in bona fide exercise of provincial jurisdiction.\nOn behalf of the Manufacturers\u2019 Association the argument was presented that the legislation ought to be declared invalid as not being passed in the bona fide exercise of any of the powers conferred by section 92. It is said that the real object of the legislation is to embarrass Dominion corporations in the conduct of their business in the province. Now it is quite true that there is authority for the proposition that if a province professing to legislate in exercise of the powers conferred by section 92 shews by its legislation that it is in reality attempting to exercise some power conferred upon the Dominion, exclusively, then the legislation may be ultra vires. Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[54], is an instance, which case ought, it may be mentioned, to be read with the subsequent decision Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[55]. But it has never been held and manifestly it would be impossible to hold that the court has any power to effect the nullification of a provincial statute, because of the motives with which the legislation was enacted. In the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[56], at pages 586-7, it was argued that the tax in question was imposed with some such object as that imputed to the provinces on the present occasion, and the Judicial Committee, speaking through Lord Hobhouse, said this:\u2014\nPeople who are trusted with the great power of making laws for property and civil rights may well he trusted to levy taxes. There are obvious reasons for confining their power to direct taxes and licenses, because the power of indirect taxation would be felt all over the Dominion. But whatever power falls within the legitimate meaning of classes 2 and 9, is, in their Lordships\u2019 judgment, what the Imperial Parliament intended to give; and to place a limit on it because the power may be used unwisely, as all powers may, would be an error, and would lead to insuperable difficulties, in the construction of the \u201cFederation Act.\u201d\n* * * * * * *\nThe appellant invokes that principle to support the conclusion that the \u201cFederation Act\u201d must be so construed as to allow no power to the provincial legislatures under sec. 92, which may by possibility, and if exercised in some extravagant way, interfere with the objects of the Dominion in exercising their powers under sec. 91. It is quite impossible to argue from the one case to the other. Their Lordships have to construe the express words of an Act of Parliament which makes an elaborate distribution of the whole field of legislative authority between two legislative bodies, and at the same time provides for the federated provinces a carefully balanced constitution, under which no one of the parts can pass laws for itself except under the control of the whole acting through the Governor-Genenal. And the question they have to answer is whether the one body or the other has power to make a given law. If they find that on the due construction of the Act a legislative power falls within sec. 92, it would be quite wrong of them to deny its existence because by some possibility it may be abused, or may limit the range which otherwise would be open to the Dominion Parliament.\nThose who were responsible for the scheme of Confederation deliberately rejected the American system of constitutional limitations. So far as provincial legislation is concerned they adopted the safeguard of investing the Governor-in-Council with a power of disallowance.\nThe argument addressed to us on this occasion seems to be addressed to the wrong authority. It is, moreover, to be observed that legislation of this character has for many years past been the subject of discussion between the provincial and the Dominion Governments. Efforts have repeatedly been made to get such legislation disallowed upon the grounds now put forward as a reason for holding the legislation to be ultra vires. The arguments which failed to convince the Governor-General-in-Council that the legislation was passed in bad faith, that it was not an honest exercise of provincial powers are now addressed to us. I may observe that the \u201cBritish Columbia Act\u201d was the subject of a correspondence when first enacted in 1897. The Minister of Justice, Sir Oliver Mowat, expressed the opinion that the regulations which are now denounced as dishonest were not unfair or unreasonable. Correspondence relating to provincial legislation, 1896-1898, pp. 82 and 83. In point of fact the similar legislation in force in Ontario and Manitoba was only allowed to go into effect after vigorous criticism by the Dominion and after amendments had been made which had been demanded by the Department of Justice. The first and second Manitoba Acts were disallowed on the ground that they unfairly interfered with Dominion interests. In 1903 when the \u201cNew Brunswick Act\u201d was passed no objection was taken. The history of the discussion indicates that the legislation as it now stands appeared to the various Ministers of Justice who had to consider it to be not fairly open to objection as interfering with Dominion interests. In these circumstances it is, I confess, a little difficult to treat this contention seriously. The truth is that one circumstance which, among many others, led to this legislation was the habitual abuse of the Dominion power of incorporating companies. As the provincial governments have pointed out from time to time when legislation of this character was the subject of discussion a Dominion charter of incorporation under the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act\u201d is given to those who seek it without any inquiry whether the intention is to carry on business in more than one province or not. It is within the knowledge of every experienced lawyer that numbers of companies are incorporated under the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act\u201d (with no expectation on the part of anybody of carrying on any but a strictly local business) with the hope of escaping regulations governing provincial companies framed for the protection of the public on subjects in relation to which the Dominion Act is silent. Again everybody knows that the assumption by the Dominion of jurisdiction over works obviously of only local interest by declaring them to be for the \u201cgeneral advantage of Canada\u201d became a few years ago a grave scandal. Is it suggested that there is any power in any court in the Empire to nullify a charter under the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act\u201d or such an Act of the Dominion Parliament on the ground that there had been an absence of the Dominion power? In the case of enactments of the Dominion Parliament (which are subject to no power of disallowance such as that which exists in respect of provincial legislation) there might be some possible reason for investing the courts with such a power. The constitution, however, has not done so.\nI refer to these things to illustrate the difficulties standing in the way of a court which should apply itself to the task of investigating the question whether an enactment of a provincial legislature professing to deal and dealing with matters in respect of which it has jurisdiction ought to be declared invalid on the ground that it is directed against some supposed Dominion interest.\nHas the Dominion power to override such provincial legislation?\nI have been considering the effect of this provincial legislation in the absence of the conflicting Dominion legislation. On behalf of the Dominion it is contended that the Dominion in exercise of the general power or of the jurisdiction conferred by No. 2 of section 91 could effectually legislate in such a way as to exempt companies incorporated for trading throughout Canada from provincial authority in respect of such matters as those dealt with in the provisions of the provincial statutes which we have been just discussing.\nThe argument as I understand it in support of Dominion jurisdiction is put in some such way as this: the Dominion has, it is said, under the general power authority to legislate in respect of matters which are truly of \u201cnational interest and importance,\u201d in addition to its authority to legislate in relation to matters comprised within the subjects enumerated in section 91. The business of a company having authority to carry on its business beyond the limits of one province and the powers with which such a company is endowed for that purpose and the right to execute those powers are said to constitute, taken as an entirety, a single subject matter of such \u201cnational interest and importance.\u201d It being, therefore, competent for the Dominion to legislate on such matters under its general power, such legislation when it comes into conflict with provincial legislation must, it is argued, prevail. It is said that the Dominion enactment incorporating such a company to carry on business in more than one province without imposing any condition or limitation does effectively exempt such a company from the necessity of complying with such provisions as those we have been considering. I think the decisions and the dicta relied upon in support of these propositions when properly understood have not the effect they are assumed by counsel for the Dominion to have and I proceed to consider the authorities in some detail. The question is one of great practical importance; for the proposition advanced amounts to nothing less than this, namely, that in all matters which may appear to the courts to be truly \u201cof national interest or importance\u201d the Dominion possesses plenary power to make laws which in each province supersede provincial legislation upon subjects enumerated in section 92; and this principle applied as the Dominion on this reference contends it ought to be applied would unquestionably leave to the provinces very little of that local autonomy which the parties to the Confederation compact believed they had reserved to them.\nThe cases which have admittedly involved the construction of the introductory clause of section 91 and the scope of the power conferred by that clause are the cases dealing with legislation on the subject of the \u201cdrink question\u201d (as Lord Macnaghten called it, in the Manitoba Licence Holders\u2019 Case[57], and the Parsons Case[58]; the Colonial Building Association Case[59], and the Montreal Street Railway Case[60]. The counsel for the Dominion as well as for the Manufacturers\u2019 Association rely upon La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Frangois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[61], as supporting the view just indicated, but my own conclusion, which I have reached after careful examination of that case, is that it did not turn upon a consideration of the general power and I shall give my reasons for thinking so later. In the meantime I propose to examine the effect of the decisions which unquestionably are relevant.\nThe judgment in the Montreal Street Railway Case60, contains an impressive warning against yielding too easily to such contentions as that I am now considering. The following is the passage to be found at pages 343 and 344.\nIt was laid down in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of the Dominion[62], (1) that the exception contained in sec. 91, near its end, was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by the 16th sub-section of sec. 92, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local or private, in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the power conferred upon that Parliament under the heads enumerated in sec. 91; (2) that to those matters which are not specified amongst the enumerated subjects of legislation in sec. 91 the exception at its end has no application and that in legislating with respect to matters not so enumerated the Dominion Parliament has no authority to encroach upon any class of subjects which is exclusively assigned to the provincial legislature by sec. 92; (3) that these enactments secs. 91 and 92, indicate that the exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada in regard to all matters not enumerated in sec. 91 ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 92; (4) that to attach any other construction to the general powers which, in supplement of its enumerated powers, are conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by sec. 91 would not only be contrary to the intendment of the Act, but would practically destroy the autonomy of the provinces; and, lastly, that if the Parliament of Canada had authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject upon which it might not legislate to the exclusion of provincial legislation.\nThe cases on the drink legislation ought to be read by the light of this judgment and so read they lend no support to the Dominion\u2019s contention.\nIn Russell v. The Queen[63], it was admitted by Mr. Benjamin, who appeared for the defendant (the provinces were not represented) that the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d of 1878 (which provided for what may be called the \u201cprohibition\u201d of the sale of intoxicating liquor in the localities within which it should be brought into force) if brought into force at once throughout the Dominion would have been valid. \u201cA large admission\u201d Lord Herschell called it in a subsequent case; page 168 of the stenographer\u2019s note of the argument in the Liquor Prohibition Appeal, printed in 1895 by William Brown & Co. He relied on the machinery for bringing the Act into force as shewing that the subject was dealt with as a local matter. And their Lordships did not really apply themselves in that case to the consideration of the question whether the matter of the suppression of the \u201cdrink\u201d traffic was \u201csubstantially a local matter in each of the Provinces.\u201d In the Prohibition Reference, Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada[64], at page 362, Lord Watson said that their Lordships were relieved by this decision (Russell v. The Queen[65]), from the \u201cdifficult duty\u201d of considering the validity of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act,\u201d 1886, which was a re-enactment of the Act of 1878. Their Lordships also said that if the prohibitions of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d had been made imperative throughout the Dominion their Lordships \u201cmight have been constrained by previous authority to hold\u201d that the jurisdiction of Ontario to pass a local Act of a similar nature would have been superseded. When these two judgments are read together with the subsequent judgment in the Manitoba Licence Holders\u2019 Case[66], it becomes apparent that they rest upon considerations which would have no possible application to any question before us.\n1st. The judgment in Russell v. The Queen65, proceeds upon the proposition that the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d could not be regarded as a law relating to property and civil rights. It is implied that if such had been the matter of the legislation it could not have been sustained under the general power. In the Manitoba Licence Holders\u2019 Case[67], at page 78, their Lordships express the opinion that the effect of the previous decisions was that an enactment of similar character when passed by a province would fall within No. 16 rather than No. 13 and that if it fell within the latter it would be doubtful if the provincial enactment could be superseded by Dominion legislation.\nFrom all these judgments it may be inferred, although they do not expressly decide, that uniform legislation by the Parliament of Canada imperative throughout the Dominion relating to matters which if dealt with in a single province would fall within any of the first fifteen heads of section 92, cannot in any circumstances be sustained under the general power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. If it were otherwise the enactments of section 94 would, as Lord Watson[68], said, be \u201cidle and abortive.\u201d Legislation conferring upon Dominion companies rights in derogation of the provisions of the statutes now in question or dealing with the same subject matters unless passed under the authority of the enumerated heads of section 91 would necessarily be legislation in relation to the matters assigned to the provinces under Nos. 2, 9, 13 or 14.\n2nd. But assuming this legislation ought, from the provincial point of view, to be regarded as enacted under No. 16, it seems impossible to deduce from these judgments the proposition now advanced. In Russell v. The Queen[69], the matter and purpose of the legislation under discussion are indicated by such phrases as \u201cnecessary or expedient for national safety or for political reasons\u201d \u201ca law placing restrictions upon the sale, custody or removal of poisonous drugs or dangerously explosive substances\u201d * * * \u201con the ground that the free sale or use of them is dangerous to public safety * * * and making it a criminal offence to violate these restrictions\u201d; \u201clegislation * * * relating to public order and safety;\u201d \u201claws for the promotion of public order, safety or morals which subject those who contravene them to criminal procedure and punishment;\u201d laws having \u201cdirect relation to the criminal law\u201d[70].\nTheir Lordships on the prohibition reference appeared to find some difficulty in convincing themselves that legislation to which even such terms were appropriate could be supported under the general power of the Dominion.\nIn the earlier reference, in 1885 (relating to the Dominion Licence Acts of 1883-4, commonly known as the \u201cMcCarthy Act\u201d) their Lordships had before them a statute dealing with the \u201cdrink question\u201d; but instead of prohibiting the drink traffic professing to make provision for regulating it. The preamble to the Act, 46 Vict. ch. 30, was \u201cWhereas it is desirable to regulate the traffic in the sale of intoxicating liquors and it is expedient that the law respecting the same should be uniform throughout the Dominion and that provision should be made in regard thereto for the better preservation of peace and order.\u201d This Act which professed to establish a uniform system regulating the \u201cdrink\u201d trade throughout Canada for these purposes was held to be ultra vires of the Dominion. It is obvious therefore that even as regards a state of affairs which the Dominion may treat as constituting a national evil to be suppressed by laws which in effect are criminal laws the same authority may be disabled from otherwise dealing with it; and this is another indication of the difficulty of extracting from these decisions on the \u201cdrink\u201d legislation any principle which can serve as a support for legislation upon another subject even when that subject admittedly concerns directly public order and morals unless the legislation in itself bears a \u201cdirect relation to the criminal law\u201d[71].\nThere is certainly nothing here to afford a basis for the proposition that rights of a company which has been incorporated for carrying on, in more than one province of Canada, an ordinary mercantile business constitute by reason of that fact alone (I exclude of course matters relating to \u201cincorporation\u201d) a \u201cmatter\u201d in relation to which the Dominion under its general power may legislate to the exclusion of provincial jurisdiction or in derogation of the enactments of a province within whose territorial jurisdiction the company is found, upon matters prim\u00e2 facie within the subjects of section 92. Assuming such matters as subjects of legislation to fall within No. 16 rather than within No. 2, No. 9, No. 13 or No. 14 of section 92, when looked at from the provincial point of view, it could hardly be denied that they are matters \u201csubstantially of local interest\u201d in each province merely because legislation upon them only relates to companies carrying on business in more than one province; still less because it relates only to companies having power to carry on business in more than one province. Nobody would argue that the Dominion could by the exercise of any of its residual powers pass laws in relation to a natural person or an unincorporated association of persons carrying on business in more than one province which could have the effect of superseding, as regards such persons or associations, legislation (in respect of such matters) by any province in which he or they should be found setting, up a place of business. On the question whether such matters are or are not \u201csubstantially of local interest\u201d it must be immaterial whether they are considered in relation to a partnership carrying on business in two provinces or to a corporation carrying on business in two provinces, matters relating to \u201cincorporation\u201d\u2014I repeat\u2014being left out of view.\nWhere it is intended that a business of a particular character, or an undertaking of a particular character, shall be under the control of the Dominion or the provinces the authors of the Act seem to have said so. In section 91, for example, not only the \u201cincorporation of banks\u201d but \u201cbanking\u201d also is specified. In No. 10 of section 92 it is the \u201cundertaking\u201d or \u201cthe work\u201d which is expressly committed to the Dominion or the province as the case may be. In the case of \u201cmunicipal institutions\u201d where the subject is defined as \u201cmunicipal institutions\u201d simpliciter it was held by their Lordships, in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[72], that the power of creating the institution was all that was thereby conferred.\nAnd the authorities cited in support of the proposition are all authorities upon the effect of some provision of the Act by which the control of a particular kind of business or work or undertaking is committed exclusively to the Dominion. In The Union Bank v. Tennant[73], for example, Lord Watson says that section 91 expressly declares that\nnotwithstanding anything in this Act the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada shall extend to all matters coming within enumerated clauses,\nand at p. 46, he says, referring to No. 15 of section 91, the \u201clegislative authority conferred by these words is not confined to the mere constitution of corporate bodies with the privilege of carrying on the business of bankers. It also comprehends \u2018banking,\u2019 an expression which is wide enough to embrace every transaction coming within the legitimate business of a banker.\u201d In The City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[74], Lord Macnaghten in the judgment upon which counsel for the Dominion relies was dealing with No. 29 of section 91 and No. 10 of section 92 the joint effect of which is that \u201cworks\u201d extending beyond the boundaries of the province or connecting one or more provinces are under the exclusive control of the Dominion.\nThe Cie. Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[75].\u2014The decision in this case which appears to me to be in the same category must be examined at length. The appellant company was a company incorporated by an Act of the legislature of Quebec, chapter 76 of the statutes of 1902, which authorized it, among other things, within a radius of 30 miles around the Village of Disraeli, and for Disraeli, to construct certain electric tramways, to utilize certain water powers, to acquire the franchises and exercise the powers conferred upon certain named companies, to work the tramways, to generate and distribute electricity for heat, light and motive power and to establish all necessary works in and over the streets and public lands for these purposes. By a subsequent statute it was enacted that no company \u201cshall exercise any privileges, franchises or rights of a like nature to those conferred upon the St. Francis Water Company in the territory designated by the said Act\u201d without obtaining the consent of the said company. In 1897 the respondents in the appeal had been incorporated as the Continental Heat and Light Company by the Parliament of Canada (60 & 61 Vict, ch. 72) with powers (exercisable without any restriction as to territory) to manufacture, supply, sell and dispose of electricity for the purpose of light, heat and motive power, and to construct tramways; and by section 8 it was specially empowered with the consent of \u201cthe municipal council or other authority having jurisdiction over any highway or public place\u201d to enter thereon for the purpose of constructing and maintaining lines for the conveyance of the electric power when deemed necessary by the company and to erect, equip and maintain poles and other works and devices, stretch wires and other electrical contrivances thereon, and it was provided that the company should be responsible for all \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d caused in maintaining or carrying out any of the said works. The Continental Company having proceeded to establish itself by constructing works within the territory designated by the \u201cSt. Francis Company\u2019s Act,\u201d an action was brought to restrain them. No question appears to have been raised as to the interest of the St. Francis Company to maintain the action, the point dealt with and decided which was probably the point the parties desired to raise, being the question of the effect of the prohibition above mentioned as against the Continental Company. Their Lordships held that the prohibition was not effective.\nIt appears from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench[76], that in that court counsel on behalf of the St. Francis Company admitted the Dominion legislation to be intra vires. This admission that the Act was intra vires would appear to have removed from the controversy any question material to the present reference. The case was in that court supposed to be governed by the Bell Telephone Case[77], in other words the Continental Company\u2019s undertaking was treated as an undertaking governed by No. 29 of section 91 and No. 10 of section 92 as an undertaking that is to say extending beyond the limits of a single province. It was, I think, on this hypothesis that the judgment of the Privy Council proceeded. The \u201cSt. Francis Act\u201d authorized the establishment of works in a particular locality in the province of Quebec and prohibited the establishment in the same locality of any works of the same character. That was clearly an Act relating to local works within the meaning of No. 10 of section 92. In face of that prohibition no municipal authority or other authority in the Province of Quebec could lawfully authorize anybody to enter upon a highway for the purpose of establishing any similar work which was also a local work. The Dominion Parliament could validly authorize the establishment of a work of similar character by declaring that work to be for the general advantage of Canada, or if it were a work connecting two provinces or extending beyond the boundaries of a single province; and it seems clear that their Lordships must have taken that to be the character of the works authorized by the \u201cContinental Company\u2019s Act.\u201d That the Dominion legislation was paramount in the sense that the provincial legislation was overborne by it, was treated by their Lordships as a self evident result of the authorities. Now, if the Continental Company\u2019s undertaking was not a work or undertaking extending beyond the boundaries of the province within No. 10 of section 92, it was certainly a local work or undertaking within that article; and there certainly was no decision, prior to 1909, countenancing the proposition that under the general power Parliament could authorize the establishment of a local work of that description in face of a prohibition enacted by a province.\nIn this connection it is important to bear in mind the construction which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has placed upon No. 8 of section 92, and which can best be stated in the language of Lord Watson in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[78], at pages 363 and 364:\u2014\nThe first of these, which was very strongly insisted on, was to the effect that the power given to each province by No. 8 of sec. 92 to create municipal institutions in the province necessarily implies the right to endow these institutions with all the administrative functions which had been ordinarily possessed and exercised by them before the time of the Union. Their Lordships can find nothing to support that contention in the language of sec. 92, No. 8, which, according to its natural meaning, simply gives provincial legislatures the right to create a legal body for the management of municipal affairs. Until Confederation, the legislature of each province as then constituted could, if it chose, and did in some cases entrust to a municipality the execution of powers which now belong exclusively to the Parliament of Canada. Since its date a provincial legislature cannot delegate any power which it does not possess; and the extent and nature of the functions which it can commit to a municipal body of its own creation must depend upon the legislative authority which, it derives from the provisions of sec. 92 other than No. 8.\nThe control exercised commonly throughout Canada by municipalities over highways, tramways, works for distribution of light, heat and power, is based upon powers conferred by the provinces under heads of section 92 other than No. 8, such for example as 10, 13, 16.\nA municipality can confer only such rights in respect of its highways as it is authorized to confer by the legislature having control of such rights. If the legislature of a given province prohibits the establishment of local works of a particular character in a particular municipality, that prohibition is final and decisive unless it be overborne by some superior legislative authority. The prohibition to be found in the \u201cSt. Francis Water Company\u2019s Act\u201d having made it unlawful for the municipality or other authority having control of highways, to confer any right upon the Continental Company in respect of the establishment of any such works as those authorized by the \u201cSt. Francis Company\u2019s Act,\u201d the effect of the decision as construed by counsel for the Dominion is that the Dominion by incorporating a company having authority to establish similar works in any locality in Canada could override such a prohibition. If that is so, it is obvious that the control of the streets of every municipality in Canada with respect to local works, as local works, rests with the Dominion Parliament. That would appear to be a very remarkable result in view of No. 10 of section 92 by which local works and undertakings within a province are committed to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the province, and by which exact provision is made for a specific procedure by which the Dominion can obtain control of such works, viz., by declaring them to be for the general advantage of Canada. It is impossible to suppose that their Lordships could have given their decision upon any such principle.\nThe conclusion I have reached is that this decision proceeded upon the basis of the \u201cContinental Company\u2019s Act\u201d having been passed in execution of the authority conferred upon the Dominion by the combined force of section 91 (29), and section 92 (10). Whether a work or undertaking authorized by the Dominion is really a work or undertaking extending beyond the limits of a single province, is a question, of course, which must in each case depend upon the construction of the particular enactment in question.\nThere is one conceivably possible contention not put forward during the argument, which perhaps ought not to be overlooked in dealing with this point, and that is that the word \u201cundertaking\u201d in No. 10 is intended to include the business of an incorporated company as such. The undertaking of a mercantile company carrying on business in more than one province might perhaps be said to be an undertaking extending beyond the limits of the province. There are many reasons for rejecting any such construction of the word \u201cundertaking\u201d in No. 10 of section 92, which so far as I know has never been put forward, and certainly has never been acted upon. In Montreal Street Railway Case[79] their Lordships observed that the works and undertakings referred to in No. 10, are \u201cphysical things.\u201d It is also rather difficult to see why if the business of an incorporated company which carries on business in more than one province is an undertaking in the sense of these words, the business of an un-incorporated association or of an individual having several places of business in different provinces, should not equally be an undertaking in that sense. It would follow of course that the Dominion could authorize the construction of a series of local works in each of the provinces quite disconnected as works, merely by authorizing a single company or individual to construct them; a tramway in Winnipeg, another in Montreal, another in Halifax. This seems to be inconsistent with the general objects of the enactments of No. 10 of section 92.\nFor these reasons I think it is impossible to maintain the contention that such provisions as those above considered as a part of the \u201cBritish Columbia Companies\u2019 Act,\u201d are not operative against the Dominion companies incorporated and exercising powers conferred under the authority of the introductory clause of section 91.\n\u201cRegulation of trade and commerce.\u201d\nThe 7th question, however, is broad enough in its terms to include powers of trading conferred under the enumerated heads of section 91. I do not propose to attempt to deal with this question in its broadest sense. What trading powers might be conferred in conceivable circumstances upon a Dominion company under several of the enumerated heads (e.g., Militia and Defence), and how far such power might be held to be in their exercise free from provincial control, is a question that it would be futile to enter upon. The only one of the enumerated heads to which reference was made during the argument was No. 2, Trade and Commerce. Here again I do not propose to attempt to define or even to indicate what powers might be conferred upon a Dominion company in exercise of this particular jurisdiction. In the Montreal Street Railway Case[80] their Lordships held that the same general considerations as those governing the construction and application of the introductory clause, would apply to Trade and Commerce. In The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[81], it was in effect stated that its jurisdiction under this head would not enable the Dominion to exempt traders from the provincial power of taxation in any province in which they should be carrying on their trade. In the Brewers\u2019 Case[82], it was held that the provinces might exact a license fee and regulate the manner in which a Dominion brewing company carried on its trade within the province. In the Manitoba Liquor Licence Case[83], it was held that a province might prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors even by traders trading under a Dominion license, so long as the legislation did not directly interfere with transactions between residents of the province and outsiders. So far as I know nobody has doubted that the \u201cOntario Liquor Licence Act\u201d which was held to be valid in Hodge v. The Queen[84], and under which authority is given to municipal bodies to require licenses to be taken out by persons dealing in intoxicating liquors, to fix the number of licences and to nominate the licensees, applies to Dominion companies carrying on that business in the province. I have already referred to the decision upon the \u201cMcCarthy Act.\u201d These decisions seem to suggest that, save at all events in exceptional circumstances, the Dominion could not confer powers upon a Dominion company under No. 2 of section 91, to be exercised in derogation of provincial legislation in respect of the matters dealt with in the legislation under consideration. Whether in any circumstances or in what circumstances, if any, the Dominion would possess such authority, is another point upon which I think it would be utterly futile to attempt to offer an opinion. The point pressed upon us by Mr. Newcombe was this: applying some words of Sir Montague Smith in the Parsons Case[85], to the effect that trade matters of interprovincial concern are given to the Dominion by No. 2, of section 91 and that such legislation as that before us necessarily affects interprovincial trade, in so far as it affects companies authorized to carry on some business which could be called a \u201ctrade\u201d in more than one province. Now it is observed in the first place that this legislation is not legislation relating to trading companies. It is legislation relating to all companies carrying on business for gain. As I have already pointed out, it deals with companies as established in a province, as being in the province and subject to the general territorial jurisdiction of the province, and it is with the business so carried on in the province that the legislation is intended to deal. It is not intended in any way to deal with Ontario companies as trading with British Columbia, or as trading into British Columbia. It deals with companies that establish themselves in British Columbia, and there carry on their trade. It may be that the British Columbia establishment is the only establishment the company has. But let us take the case of a company having an establishment in Vancouver and another in Winnipeg. On what conceivable ground can it be said that this legislation affects interprovincial trade in such a way as to make it legislation in respect of the interprovincial trade of that company? The \u201cPartnership Act\u201d of British Columbia requires that every partnership carrying on business in the province shall be registered. The registration involves the public record of certain information and a fee is to be paid. A partnership formed according to the law of Ontario carrying on business in Toronto and desiring to set up business in Vancouver would be obliged to comply with this law.\nIs it not an absurdity to suggest that such an enactment is an enactment relating to interprovincial trade? And if the partners form an incorporated company which takes over the business, carrying it on as before, on what ground can it be said that [save as to incorporation] the company is in a less degree subject to the jurisdiction of the Province than the partnership was?\nIt is conceivable that conflicting Dominion legislation under No. 2 might in exceptional circumstances overbear some of the provisions of the legislation in question. But I must decline to pass any opinion upon such a question until the particular legislation is brought before me. Confining the question to companies incorporated under the Dominion \u201cCompanies Act\u201d I have no hesitation in saying that there is nothing in that Act which in any way has the effect of removing companies formed under it from the operation of such legislation as that in question.\nTo summarize my views on the points raised by the questions 6 and 7 excluding any question as to the effect of competent Dominion legislation enacted under any of the enumerated heads of section 91.\nThe authority of the Dominion Parliament under the introductory clause of section 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada is not exercisable by the express words of that clause in respect of those matters which fall within any of the classes of subjects exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures by section 92. In the matter of the incorporation of companies the authority of the provincial legislatures has been held by the Privy Council to be limited to the matters described in the words of No. 11 of section 92, the \u201cincorporation of companies with provincial objects,\u201d It has accordingly been held by the same authority that the power of the Dominion Parliament in relation to this subject, \u201cthe incorporation of companies,\u201d extends to all companies having objects which within the meaning of No. 11 of section 92 are other than \u201cprovincial objects\u201d; and it has further been held that the objects of a company incorporated with capacity to carry on its business in all or any of the provinces of Canada without restriction are objects which do not answer the description \u201cprovincial\u201d within the meaning of that clause.\nThe subject of \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d in relation to such companies as those just mentioned is, therefore, one of the subjects which (not having been assigned to the provincial legislatures by section 92) is comprised within those matters over which the Dominion exercises authority by virtue of its residual powers.\nBut this particular jurisdiction relates strictly to the subject of the \u201cincorporation of companies.\u201d As regards all other matters in connection with such companies they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Dominion and of any province in which they carry on business respectively as a natural person, an unincorporated association, a provincial company, an extra Canadian company would be in the like circumstances.\nThe limitation upon the provincial authority in relation to the creation of that species of corporate persons known as companies which is expressed in No. 11 of section 92 does not imply any restriction upon the provincial jurisdiction over corporate persons in relation to matters not comprised within the subject of \u201cincorporation.\u201d And with regard to all other matters the jurisdiction of the provinces and the Dominion respectively in relation to corporate persons as well as to natural persons must be discovered by an examination of the provisions of sections 91 and 92 other than No. 11 of section 92.\nThe argument that the rights of a company incorporated to carry on trade in more than one province even although in fact it carries on its trade in one province only are (by virtue of the fact that it has corporate capacity to carry on trade in more than one province), in any province in which the company does carry on its business, something other than matters of local interest in that province, even although they are prim\u00e2 facie matters falling within the subjects enumerated by section 92, is an argument which cannot be supported. The argument would lead to the conclusion that the rights of an unincorporated partnership or of an individual, carrying on business in more provinces than one, must in each province with respect to the business carried on there, be considered a matter in respect of which the Dominion could legislate to the exclusion of provincial jurisdiction. There is no warrant in the Act for this theory that the Dominion has authority, in addition to its authority under the enumerated heads of section 91, to legislate (in respect of all persons natural or artificial who happen or have power to carry on business in more provinces than one) in derogation of the provincial authority in relation to matters which would prim\u00e2 facie fall within the provincial jurisdiction. Similar considerations lead to the rejection of the contention that such legislation as that we are considering is legislation in relation to the subject of interprovincial trade. The argument would equally apply to a natural person carrying on business in more provinces than one.\nOn these principles the provisions of the \u201cBritish Columbia Companies Act\u201d referred to in question 6 must be held to have been validly enacted and they have the operation indicated above.\nAnglin J.\u2014In this reference we are confronted with what the Judicial Committee has characterized as a series of searching questions very difficult to answer exhaustively and accurately without so many qualifications and reservations as to make the answers of little value.\nThe main purpose would appear to be to elicit opinions from the members of this Court as to the nature and extent of the restrictions upon the power of provincial legislatures in regard to the incorporation of companies, and chiefly as to whether a corporation created by or under the authority of a provincial legislature without any limitation confining the area of its activities within the boundaries of the province, either expressed in its charter or necessarily to be implied from the nature of its undertaking, is capable of exercising such activities outside the territorial limits of the province subject to the law of the sovereignty or other province within which it seeks to operate. Incidentally we are asked to answer a number of questions, more or less cognate, which cover a wide field. In regard to some of these at least, the Lord Chancellor, speaking for the Judicial Committee, has seen fit to suggest that we may with propriety represent to the Executive the inadvisability of attempting to deal with them[86].\nIn the same judgment their Lordships have once more emphatically stated that in the provisions of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d are to be found all powers necessary and appropriate for self-government in Canada; that when a power appertaining to self-government is not explicitly mentioned in the Act\nit is not to be presumed that the constitution withholds the power altogether; on the contrary it is to be taken for granted that the power is bestowed in some quarter unless it be extraneous to the statute itself * * * or otherwise is clearly repugnant to its sense. For whatever belongs to self-government in Canada belongs either to the Dominion or to the provinces within the limits of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d (pp. 683-4).\nThe only clauses in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d in which any reference is made to the incorporation of companies are No. 15 of section 91, \u201cBanking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money,\u201d and No. 11 of section 92, \u201cThe Incorporation of Companies, with Provincial Objects.\u201d If the \u201cIncorporation of Banks\u201d had been omitted from the enumeration of the legislative powers of Parliament, and section 92 did not contain clause 11, in my opinion, the faculties of the Dominion Parliament and of the provincial legislatures, in regard to incorporation, would, under the other provisions of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d have been the same as they are with these two clauses in the statute. The creation of a corporation may be regarded as a means appropriate, convenient and sometimes necessary to the efficient exercise of plenary legislative power in regard to many of the enumerated subjects of legislation comprised in both categories of powers \u2014 federal and provincial \u2014 under the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d The power of the\u2019 Dominion Parliament to create corporations other than banks is unquestionable under \u201cthe peace, order and good government\u201d provision, if not under several of the enumerated clauses of section 91. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[87], at pages 116, 117; Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[88], at pages 164-5. Is it open to doubt that, if the words \u201cthe incorporation of banks,\u201d in clause 15 of section 91, had been omitted, the power \u2014 and the exclusive power \u2014 of incorporating banks would have belonged to the Federal Parliament? I think not. If clause 11 of section 92 had not been inserted in the statute, could the exclusive right of provincial legislatures to create municipal corporations, or charitable or eleemosynary corporations (probably not covered by the word \u201ccompanies\u201d in clause 11) or companies for purely local purposes be questioned? Again, I think not. And it is, I think equally clear that, although the word \u201ccompanies\u201d in clause 11 should not be taken to include such bodies as municipal corporation, or charitable or ecclesiastical corporations, the presence of that clause in section 92 does not negative the provincial power of incorporating these or other provincial corporations to which it does not apply.\nWhat then was the purpose and effect of the introduction of clause 11 amongst the enumerated exclusive legislative powers of the provincial legislatures? I think it was intended to preclude the contention that, if the power of incorporation should be regarded as a substantive and distinct head of legislative jurisdiction, it was wholly vested in the Dominion Parliament as part of the residuum under the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d provision of section 91 (see Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons)[89], at pages 116, 117,) because not expressly mentioned in the enumeration of provincial powers; and to make it clear that this power, if so regarded, is divided between the federal and provincial jurisdictions as conferred in part on the latter by clause 11 of section 92, and in part on the former, in the case of banks by clause 15, and in the case of other Dominion corporations under the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d provision of section 91. When it was deemed advisable to introduce into the list of provincial legislative powers a reference to the incorporation of companies the delimiting or qualifying words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d were added in order to preclude the contention that the exclusive legislative power expressed in clause 11 comprises the whole field of incorporation, to assure to the Dominion its jurisdiction in regard to incorporation as a convenient means of effectively legislating in regard to the subjects assigned to it and to serve as an index of the line of demarcation between the two legislative jurisdictions. It was thus made clear that from provincial jurisdiction there was excluded the incorporation of companies with Dominion objects\u2014 companies for the carrying on of works and operations within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada\u2014companies formed for the transaction of affairs \u201cunquestionably of Canadian interest and importance.\u201d\nNotwithstanding the introduction of this clause, I think the powers of the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures, respectively, in regard to incorporation are precisely what they would have been had it been omitted from the Act and had the power of incorporation been treated not as a distinct and substantive head of legislative jurisdiction\u2014an end in itself\u2014but as a means for the working out of legislative power in respect of the enumerated subjects and as such conferred as incidental to legislative jurisdiction over them. I regard clause 11 as an instance of the express declaration in a statute of what the law would imply, made in the hope that all doubt as to the intent of Parliament should be removed. Abundans cautela non nocet. Yet, assuredly, language of more certain import and less provocative of controversy might have been chosen.\nThe Judicial Committee has, on at least four occasions, affirmed the exclusive power of the Dominion to incorporate companies whose capacities, as set forth in their constating instruments, expressly entitle them to operate in more than one province. Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Ontario[90], at p. 165; Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[91], at pp. 99, 116; Dobie v. Temporalities Board[92], at page 152; Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Francois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[93]. A similar view was taken by the late Chief Justice of this Court in Hewson v. Ontario Power Co.[94], at page 604. Yet had the objects of such companies not been expressed as intended to be carried out in more than one province they might properly be regarded as provincial.\nIt is argued, and with much force, that if a provincial legislature may not in express terms confer on its corporate creature power to operate outside the territorial limits of the province, and if a provincial charter purporting to confer such extra-territorial powers is ultra vires, it follows that in every provincial charter there must be implied the limitation that the exercise of the powers of the company (at least what have been called \u201cfunctional\u201d powers or objects, as distinguished from incidental powers) shall be confined to the territory of the province, and that a provincial corporation upon whose objects or powers no territorial restriction is expressly imposed is, nevertheless, subject to the same limitation as if its operations were by its charter expressly confined to the province. No doubt that is the case when the nature of the objects of the corporation indicates that they are to be carried out in a certain locality within the province, e.g., the establishment and maintenance of a hospital, or the building of a railway. But I find nothing in the language of clause 11 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d which compels us to hold that the ordinary mercantile trading or manufacturing company incorporated by a province to do business without territorial limitation is precluded from availing itself of the so-called comity of a foreign state, or of a province, which recognizes the existence of foreign corporations and permits their operations in its territory. Of course such foreign operations must be of the class authorized by the constating instrument of the company and not in contravention of the law or policy of the state in which they are carried on.\nIf the operations or activities of any foreign corporation should depend for their validity upon the powers conferred on it by the law of the incorporating state, it would in my opinion be difficult to sustain them, inasmuch as \u201cthe law of no country can have effect as law beyond the territory of the Sovereign by whom it was imposed.\u201d But the exercise of its powers by a corporation extra-territorially depends not upon the legislative power of its country of origin but upon the express or tacit sanction of the state or province in which such powers are exercised and the absence of any prohibition on the part of the legislature which created it against its taking advantage of international comity. All that a company incorporated without territorial restriction upon the exercise of its powers carries abroad is its entity or corporate existence in the state of its origin coupled with a quasi-negative or passive capacity to accept the authorization of foreign states to enter into transactions and to exercise powers within their dominions similar to those which it is permitted to enter into and to exercise within its state of origin. Even its entity as a corporation is available to it in a foreign state only by virtue of the recognition of it by that state. It has no right whatever in a foreign state except such as that state confers.\nWhen the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was passed the doctrine of comity in regard to foreign corporations was well established as a rule of international law universally accepted. It had been long acted upon in English courts and had received Parliamentary recognition. Modern law acknowledges this capacity of every corporation, not expressly or impliedly forbidden by its state of origin to avail itself of privileges accorded by international comity, as something so inherent in the very idea of incorporation that we would not, in my opinion, be justified, merely by reason of the presence in the clause expressing the provincial power of incorporation of such uncertain words as \u201cwith provincial objects,\u201d in ascribing to the Imperial Parliament the intention in passing the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d of denying to provincial legislatures, otherwise clothed with such ample sovereign powers, the right to endow their corporate creatures with it. Bateman v. Service[95], at page 391. The impotency which such a construction of the statute would, in many instances, entail upon provincial companies affords a strong argument against adopting it. Had Parliament intended in the case of the provincial power of incorporation to depart from the ordinary rule by confining the activities of every provincial corporation within the territorial limits of the province creating it, it seems to me highly improbable that the words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d would have been employed to effect that purpose. Some such words as \u201cwith power to operate only in the province\u201d would have expressed the idea much more clearly and unmistakably. Inapt to impose territorial restriction the words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d may be given an effect, which seems more likely to have been intended and which satisfies them, by excluding from the provincial power of incorporation such companies as have objects distinctly Dominion in character either because they fall under some one of the heads of legislative jurisdiction enumerated in section 91, or because, they \u201care unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance.\u201d\nThe provincial company is a domestic company and exercises its powers as of right only within the territory of the province which creates it. Elsewhere in Canada, as abroad, it is a foreign company and it depends for the exercise of its charter powers upon the sanction accorded by the comity of the province in which it seeks to operate, which, although perhaps not the same thing as international comity, is closely akin to it. The Dominion company, on the other hand, is a domestic company in all parts of Canada. It exercises its powers as of right in every province of the Dominion. While a Dominion company is, generally speaking, subject to the ordinary law of the province, such as the law of Mortmain (Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[96], at p. 117)\u2014while it may be taxed by the province for purposes of provincial revenue (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[97]), while it may be required to com form to reasonable provisions in regard to registration and licensing (The Brewers\u2019 Case[98]), a provincial legislature may not exclude it, or directly or indirectly prevent it from enjoying its corporate rights and exercising its powers within the province (City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[99]; Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[100]), as (subject perhaps in the case of alien corporations to the provisions of any general Dominion legislation dealing with them under clause 25 of section 91) it may do in the case of other corporations not its own creatures. It may be that there is some distinction to be drawn, in regard to the extent to which they are subject to provincial law, between corporations created by the Dominion, under clause 15 of section 91 or in the exercise of incidental legislative power under some one to the enumerated heads of section 91, and other corporations created by it solely in the exercise of its power to make laws for the \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d of Canada. For instance, a Dominion railway company in regard to the acquisition and tenure of its right of way might not be subject to a provincial law of mortmain, although it is undoubtedly subject to provincial direct taxation (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe97), and to certain municipal regulations affecting it as a resident of the province (Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[101]). Upon this branch of the subject under consideration I desire to reserve my opinion.\nThe granting of a charter which in terms purports to confer on a corporation the right to carry on its operations in portions of Canada beyond the limits of the province is ultra vires of the provincial legislature and an invasion of the Dominion legislative field because it is an attempt to enable the corporation to exercise its powers as of right in parts of the Dominion not subject to the jurisdiction of the legislature which confers them. It would also seem to be beyond the competence of a provincial legislature to create what is known in American law as a \u201cTramp Corporation\u201d (Thomson on Corporations, 2 ed., par. 6632), or a corporation with express power to operate abroad (Hewson v. Ontario Power Co.[102], at page 604).\nIn its transactions outside the jurisdiction of the legislature to which it owes its existence, a corporation always remains subject to the limitations imposed upon it by its constitution. While it may be further limited in the exercise of its charter powers by the law of the country where it operates, it cannot invoke the law of that country to authorize the transaction of business or the exercise of powers not allowed under its constating instrument. Where the exercise of its corporate powers is territorially limited by the legislature which creates it a company cannot obtain from another legislature the right to exercise those powers beyond the territorial limit so imposed. It is only by re-incorporation, which is nothing else than the creation of a new and distinct body corporate, that another legislature may enlarge the powers or capacities of a company as defined by the legislative authority which created it. The power to amend or to destroy legislation is measured by the capacity to enact it or to reconstruct it. Dob\u00ede v. Temporalities Board[103], at page 152; The Prohibition Case[104], at pages 366-7.\nLegislation of the Dominion Parliament authorizing a provincial company, as incidental to the accomplishment of its provincial purpose, to affect matters or things subject to Dominion control (such, e.g., as an Act allowing a provincial railway or a municipal corporation to erect a bridge over a navigable river\u2014see In re Brandon Bridge[105]; Bourinot\u2019s Parliamentary Procedure and Practice (2 ed.), p. 680) is in furtherance of that purpose and something which the incorporating province must be taken to have contemplated and sanctioned, and is, therefore, not in any sense an enlargement of its powers or capacities obnoxious to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislature over its corporate creature. For the same reason, express or tacit sanction by one provincial legislature of the exercise within its jurisdiction of the corporate powers of a corporation created without territorial limitation by, or under the authority of, the legislature of another province is not an enlargement of the powers of such corporation involving an invasion of the exclusive control over it of the legislature to which it owes its existence.\nHaving regard to the extent and importance of the interests which may be affected by the opinions of the judges of this court and which have not been represented before us, to the difficult and complex nature of the subject submitted for our consideration and to the utter impossibility of preconceiving all the questions surrounding that subject which may arise, or the varying aspects and circumstances under which they may present themselves, it is, I think, inadvisable to add to the foregoing general statement, which contains many propositions that are obviously elementary as well as some views which I am fully aware have been seriously controverted. It will probably suffice, however, to make clear the reasons upon which are based the following answers to the questions submitted:\u2014\n(1) The Legislature of a Canadian province cannot validly incorporate a company which\n(\u0430) is expressly empowered to exercise its activities in any other part of Canada or abroad, or\n(b) is empowered to carry on works or operations within the enumerated legislative powers of the Dominion Parliament, or business or affairs \u201cunquestionably of Canadian interest and importance.\u201d\nThe latter limitation\u2014 (b) \u2014is expressed in clause 11 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d in the words \u201cwith provincial objects.\u201d\n(2) Yes\u2014subject to the general law of the state or province in which it seeks to operate and to the limitations imposed by its own constitution, but not \u201cby virtue of (the powers conferred by its) provincial incorporation.\u201d\n(3) (a) and (c). Yes, unless forbidden by its constitution to insure such property.\n(b) Yes.\nThe nationality or residence of the owners of the property insured is not material to these answers.\n(4) The answer to question (3) being affirmative it becomes unnecessary to deal with the first part of question No. 4.\nIn regard to the second part of question No. 4, as amended, except in so far as it deals with companies incorporated by or under Acts of the legislature of the late Province of Canada which were not confined in their operations to territory not wholly comprised either within the Province of Ontario or the Province of Quebec, sub-sec. 3 of sec. 3 of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\n(5) (a) No. (b) No.\n6. Yes\u2014if the real and primary object of the provincial legislation be the raising of a revenue or the obtaining of information (such, e.g., as the designation of a place at which, or a person on whom process may be served within the province) \u201cfor provincial, local or municipal purposes.\u201d\nNo\u2014if the real and primary object be to require the company to obtain provincial sanction or authority for the exercise of its corporate powers.\n(7) As to the first part; No.\nAs to the second part: The Dominion \u201ctrading company\u201d is not \u201csubject to or governed by legislation of a province limiting the nature or kind of business which corporations not incorporated by the legislature of the province may carry on or the powers which they may exercise within the province.\u201d The validity of provincial legislation \u201cimposing conditions to be observed or complied with by Dominion trading companies before they engage in business within the province\u201d may be tested by the criterion stated in answer to question No. 6.\nIt is practically impossible to anticipate every conceivable form in which provincial legislation directly or indirectly restrictive may be enacted and it would, therefore, seem to be advisable to refrain from attempting to answer the third part of this question.\nThe answers to question No. 6 and to the latter half of the second part of question No. 7 are not to be taken as intended to be exhaustive.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The purpose of that reference is to ascertain\n(1) whether the provincial companies can carry on business outside of the incorporating province;\n(2) if the power of those companies can be enlarged by the Dominion Parliament or by the legislature of another province; and\n(3) we are called upon to state whether the provinces may impose restrictions upon Dominion companies.\nThe subject of the incorporation of companies or corporations is specifically mentioned twice in the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nIn the section 91 of that Act, which enumerates the legislative powers of the Federal Parliament, it is stated that\nIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the Peace, order and good Government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive Legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say......\n15. Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the issue of Paper money. The section 92 of the same Act contains the other formal reference to the incorporation of companies and reads as follows:\u2014\nIn each province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say * * *\n11. The incorporation of Companies with Provincial objects.\nWhen the terms of Confederation were discussed at the Quebec Conference, 1864, the question of incorporation of companies was not mentioned at first (Pope\u2019s Confederation Documents, p. 24, art. 7, and p. 27); but later on we see that the incorporation of banks was formally assigned to the Federal Parliament. (Pope\u2019s do., p. 44, art. 20.) And the incorporation of companies was put under the legislative control of the provinces in the following terms:\u2014\n17. The incorporation of private or local companies, except such as relate to matters assigned to the federal Legislature. (Pope, do. pp. 28 and 47).\nThat wording of the clause was adhered to at the London Conference in December, 1866 (Pope, do., p. 106, art. 14). But when the bill came to be drafted, they substituted the following phraseology:\u2014\n11. The incorporation of companies with exclusively provincial objects (p. 153, art. 11);\nand at last, when the last draft was made, the word exclusively was struck out.\nDuring the proceedings of the Quebec Conference we see that it was proposed at one time to vest the Canadian Parliament with the power of regulating and incorporating fire and life insurance companies (Pope, art. 3), but it was decided to strike out that item (Pope, p. 88), and we do not see now in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d any reference to the regulation or incorporation of insurance companies. The intention of the delegates of the provinces of the Canadian Confederation, if we may infer from those historical documents, was that the companies which do not relate to matters assigned to the central authority should be incorporated by the provinces.\nBy the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d the property and civil rights are under the legislative control of the provinces and it has to be assumed in general principle that the creation of artificial or ideal persons under the name of companies is logically of the provincial domain.\nA company is a larger form of a partnership with one special privilege added as to the limitation of the liability of its members.\nA company in its ordinary relations with other members of the society is clothed with the same powers and is bound by the same obligations as natural persons are.\nThe rules that govern those relations are necessarily borrowed from the civil law of which they form a part as well as the rules which govern the rights, obligations, incapacities and privileges of minors, absentees, insane persons, etc. (Reports of the Codifiers of the Civil Code, p. xcvii.)\nThe creation of an association would then belong essentially to the provinces; but the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d as well as the Fathers of Confederation, put in a restriction that the provinces could incorporate companies for matters that fell under their legislative control.\nThe word \u201cprovincial\u201d in section 11 of section 92, is not used in its geographical sense: the objects are not territorial; but that word \u201cprovincial\u201d is used with regard to the legislative powers of the province; and provincial objects are those that the provincial legislature can authorize or confer.\nThe \u201cprovincial objects\u201d carry the suggestion that they should be distinguished from Dominion objects. They could be defined as all objects which as subjects of legislation are assigned to the province. That restriction has been put in in order to avoid the construction that would have allowed the provinces to incorporate companies to carry out Dominion objects.\nThere would not have been in the enumeration in section 91 anything relating to the incorporation of companies with the single exception of banks, and could have been argued that the right to incorporate all companies, being of its nature a civil right, should be exercised by the province. We would have seen then interprovincial railways connecting one province with another under the legislative control of Dominion Parliament; but the companies that control those railways would have required provincial charters. Such a state of affairs would have brought a serious confusion and in order to avoid that it was declared that the provincial authorities could incorporate companies whose objects were of the legislative domain of the provinces.\nWhen we examine another sub-section of section 92 we see that the provincial legislatures\nmay exclusively make laws in relation to * * * property and civil rights in the province.\nThere again we see a restriction. Does it mean that the capacity of a person should be determined in a neighbouring province or in a foreign country by federal legislation? No, certainly not. The capacity of a person is determined by the law of its domicile and that law is the provincial law; and when that person goes into another province or into another country his capacity to contract is based upon the law of his province.\nThe comity of nations recognizes the right of foreign incorporated companies to carry on business and make contracts outside of the country in which they are incorporated, if consistent with the purposes of the corporation and not prohibited by its charter and not inconsistent with the local laws of the country in which the business is carried on. As to the comity of nations, each province should be considered as a country.\nAll the powers granted by a province to a company are generally recognized in the other provinces and so long as the powers which that company seeks to exercise are not inconsistent with these granted by the incorporating province and with the laws and policies of the other provinces, the company can carry on there its business.\nWhen a company receives its original incorporation from a provincial legislature, then the breath of life has come into it; it becomes equivalent to a natural person and has the power to do business outside the province which incorporated it.\nA province could as well incorporate a company and that company could go and carry on business in a neighbouring province by the laws of courtesy or comity, as a bank incorporated by the Dominion Parliament could go and carry on business in a foreign country.\nNow with regard to the enlargement of the powers of a company, I am of opinion that those powers could not be enlarged. A company authorized by its charter to do a certain business could not be authorized by the provinces or by the country in which it operates to do another kind of business. It is a question of capacity and by the rules of private international law the capacity of a person is determined by the law of his domicile. I would not hesitate then to answer in the negative sub-section (b) of section 5, unless the extension by the legislature of another province to a company of the courtesy should be deemed an enlargement of its corporate powers.\nAs to the power of the provinces on the Dominion companies, the jurisprudence is well established today that those companies can be taxed by the provinces and they can be prevented from carrying on business if they don\u2019t take the license provided by the provincial legislation (The Brewers Case[106]). Of course, in dealing with those restrictions, the provinces should be careful that those restrictions cover the exercise of powers vested in them by section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d On the other hand, the Dominion Parliament should not incorporate any company whose objects are not federal nor interprovincial. I am afraid that in many cases companies have been incorporated by the Dominion with the intention of carrying on a local business and not an interprovincial undertaking, though they alleged in their petition that the undertaking was interprovincial.\nMy answer to the different questions should be as follows:\u2014\nQuestions.\nAnswers.\nI.\nI.\nWhat limitation exists under the \u201cBritish North\nThe \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d has assigned in America Act, 1867,\u201d upon the power of the provincial legislatures to incorporate companies?\nsection 92, sub-section 11, to the provinces the power to incorporate companies with provincial objects.\nWhat is the meaning of the expression \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d in section 92, article 11, of the said Act? Is the limitation thereby defined territorial, or does it have regard to the character of the powers which may be conferred upon companies locally incorporated, or what otherwise is the intention and effect of the said limitation?\nThat restriction should not be interpreted with reference to any territorial limitation of their capacities; but it has reference to the distribution of the legislative powers between the Parliament and the Legislatures.\nII.\nII.\nHas a company incorporated by a provincial legislature under the powers conferred in that behalf by section 92, article 11, of the \u201cBritish North America Act. 1867,\u201d power or capacity to do business outside the limits of the incorporating province? If so, to what extent and for what purpose?\nYes, subject to the laws of the country or province in which it seeks to operate and subject to the limitations imposed by its own constitution.\nHas a company incorporated by a provincial Questions.\nAnswers.\nlegislature for the purpose, for example, of buying and selling or grinding grain, the power or capacity, by virtue of such provincial incorporation, to buy or sell or grind outside of the incorporating province?\nIII.\nIII.\nHas a corporation constituted by a provincial legislature with power to carry on a fire insurance business, there being no stated limitation as to the locality within which the business may be carried on, power or capacity to make and execute contracts\n(\u0430) within the incorporating province insuring property outside of the province?\n(b) outside of the incorporating province, insuring property within the province?\n(c) outside of the incorporating province, insuring property outside of the province?\nYes, subject to the laws of the country or province in which it seeks to operate. Questions.\nAnswers.\nHas such a corporation power or capacity to insure property situate in a foreign country, or to make an insurance contract within a foreign country?\nDo the answers to the foregoing inquiries, or any of them, depend upon whether or not the owner of the property or risk insured is a citizen or resident of the incorporating province?\nThe nationality or residence of the owner of the property or risk insured is not material to these answers.\nIV.\nIV.\nIf in any or all of the above mentioned cases, (a), (b) and (c), the answer be negative, would the corporation have throughout Canada the power or capacity mentioned in any and which of the said cases, on availing itself of the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d 9 and 10 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 3, sub-sec. 3?\nMy answer to question No. 3 being affirmative, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the first part of the question.\nIn regard to the second part of this question, the sub-section 30, section 3, of the \u201cInsurance Act of 1910\u201d is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nIs the said enactment, the \u201cInsurance Act, 1910,\u201d ch. 32, sec. 3, sub- sec. 3, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nV.\nV.\nQuestions.\nAnswers.\nCan the power of a company incorporated by a provincial legislature be enlarged, and to what extent, either as to locality or objects by\n(\u0430) the Dominion Parliament?\n(b) the legislature of another province?\nNo.\nVI.\nVI.\nHas the legislature of a province power to prohibit companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada from carrying on business within the province, unless or until the companies obtain a licence so to do from the government of the province, or local authority constituted by the legislature, if fees are required to be paid upon the issue of such license?\nYes.\nFor examples of such provincial legislation, see Ontario, 63 Vict. ch. 24; New Brunswick, Cons. Sts., 1903, ch. 18; British Columbia, 5 Edw. VII.. ch. 11\u2014now sec. 166, R.S. B.C., ch. 39.\nVII.\nVII.\nIs it competent to a provincial legislature to restrict a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada for the purpose of trading throughout the whole Dominion in the exercise of the special trading powers so conferred or to limit the exercise of such powers within the province?\nAssuming as the question does that a trading company can be duly incorporated by the Parliament of Canada, I say that those companies are subject to the provincial laws enacted under section 92, \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nIs such a Dominion trading company subject to or governed by the legislation of a province in which it carries out or proposes to carry out its trading powers limiting the nature or kinds of business which corporations not incorporated by the legislature of the province may carry on, or the powers which they may exercise within the province, or imposing conditions which are to be observed or complied with by such corporations before they engage in business within the province?\nCan such a company so incorporated by the Parliament of Canada be otherwise restricted in the exercise of its corporate powers or capacity, and how, and in what respect, by provincial legislation?\n[1] [1896] A.C. 348, at p. 359.\n[2] [1908] A.C. p. 54.\n[3] 39 Can.

In November, 1908, M. conveyed, a hotel property in Madoc to his wife subject to a mortgage which she assumed. M. and his brother carried on the Ottawa business until March, 1910, when they assigned for benefit of creditors who brought suit to set aside the conveyance to M.\u2019s wife. On the trial it was shewn that for some time before November, 1908, M.\u2019s wife had been urging him to transfer to her the Madoc property, which she had helped him to acquire, as a provision for herself and their children; that she had joined in a conveyance of a property in Toronto in which they both believed she had a right of dower, and the proceeds of the sale of which were applied in the purchase of the Ottawa business; and that all of M.\u2019s liabilities at the time of said conveyance had been discharged. M. ascribed his failure in Ottawa to the action of the License Commissioners in compelling him to move his bar to the rear of the premises whereby his receipts fell off and he lost rents that he had theretofore received, and had to make expensive alterations; and to a fire on the premises early in 1910. The trial judge set aside the conveyance to M.\u2019s wife; his judgment was reversed by a Divisional Court (24 Ont. L.R. 591), but restored by the Court of Appeal. Held, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont. L.R. 319), Davies J. dissenting, that the conveyance by M. to his wife was voluntary; that it denuded him of the greater part of his available assets and was made to protect the property conveyed against his future creditors and is, therefore, void as against them.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2], and restoring that of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nF. B. Proctor for the appellants. The Court of Appeal rested its judgment against the appellants on the cases of Crossley v. Elworthy[3], and Mackay v. Douglas[4]. But the principle of those cases is, that where a person makes a voluntary settlement on the eve of engaging in trade the onus is on him to prove that he was in a position to make it. That proof has been made by the appellants in this case. And see French v. French[5]; Buckland v. Rose[6]; In re Lane-Fox[7], at page 513.\nIn Collard v. Bennett[8], Vice-Chancellor Spragge upheld a voluntary settlement under conditions very similar to those in the present case.\nMrs. McGuire gave valuable consideration for the Madoc property. The release of a supposed right of dower is sufficient. May on Fraudulent Conveyances (3 ed.) 226.\nHogg K.C. for the respondents referred to Jackson v. Bowman[9]; Campbell v. Chapman[10]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court (Chief Justice Falconbridge dissenting), and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, Chief Justice Mulock, setting aside a conveyance made by the appellant John L. McGuire to his wife of the former\u2019s equity in a hotel property in the Village of Madoc, on the ground that such conveyance was fraudulent and void as against the grantor\u2019s creditors under the statute 13 Elizabeth.\nThe debts due the creditors of McGuire at the time of the execution of the impeached conveyance, outside of the mortgage debt secured upon the property conveyed, were contracted some time subsequent to the conveyance. Only two creditors gave evidence respecting the debts due them and it shewed that their debts were contracted long after the impeached settlement was made. There was no evidence that any of McGuire\u2019s debts which were due at the date of the settlement remained unpaid at the date of the insolvents\u2019 assignment.\nThe mortgage debt was one secured upon property much more than sufficient to pay it and may, therefore, for the purposes of this action, be disregarded. Jenkyn v. Vaughan, in 1856[11].\nIt may be conceded as established by the cases that the statute extends to subsequent creditors. They have the same right to set aside an alienation made with intent to delay, hinder or defraud them, as credi- tors whose debts were due at the date of the alienation, but they have a more difficult task in proving a fraudulent intent on the part of the grantor in the case of a voluntary settlement. In such case they must prove either an express intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors or that after the settlement the grantor had not sufficient means or reasonable expectation of being able to pay his then existing debts. 15 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, page 88 par. 180. The cases there cited I think support that proposition.\nThe courts below have all found that the impeached settlement was a voluntary one and I shall deal with the case on that finding, though I am bound to say I should have some difficulty in reaching it on the evidence.\nThere is no pretence for saying that any fraudulent intent under the statute was proved and the single question left was whether the grantor after the settlement was left without sufficient means or reasonable expectations of being able to pay his then existing debts and so that a fraudulent intent might be inferred.\nAs to the financial condition of McGuire at the time he made the settlement, I think the statement embodied by Riddell J. in his judgment a fair and proper one. It omits the Madoc property, the settlement of which is in question, and the mortgage upon it, and subject to which the property was conveyed to Mrs. McGuire, and aside from that shews McGuire to have been left with assets of the value of $14,180 and liabilities amounting to $3,947.\nAmongst the assets was included $8,500 which he had paid for the Ottawa business and chattels, in- cluding the \u201cgood will.\u201d I agree that looking at McGuire\u2019s financial position from a business stand point there is no reason in the world why its value should not be taken into consideration. But when you are considering that financial position with respect to a settlement made by the man upon his wife of part of his property, and determining the \u201cintent\u201d with which it was made, to omit the value of such good will from your consideration would be, to my mind, most unfair.\nThe learned trial judge in his statement of McGuire\u2019s financial condition at the time of the making of the settlement, including the Madoc property in the assets and the mortgage secured upon it in the liabilities, shewed the latter to have been $14,711, while the assets he estimated at $26,754.\nDeducting from these assets the $15,000 estimated value of the Madoc property, he reduced them to $11,754. But the learned Chief Justice, while deducting the whole value of the Madoc property from the assets, omitted at the same time to deduct the amount of the mortgage upon that property from the liabilities. This, I think, was a manifest mistake on his part as the mortgage debt of $3,250 being secured upon a property of the agreed value of $15,000, should in such a statement as was being prepared have been omitted from the liabilities.\nBut in addition to that the learned judge omits any allowance for the good will of the Ottawa business and only allowed $1,134.23 for the chattel property in that business which was valued at $3,500. The reason assigned for this large reduction was that the $1,134.23 represented the actual cash, $571.23, which McGuire\u2019s estate received at a much later date when the insolvency took place as the result of a forced sale by the landlord of the chattels. The landlord when McGuire assigned had distrained under the terms of the lease upon the goods and chattels for three months advance rent, and these $571.23 were the net proceeds of the sale. The balance of the $1,134 consisted of $563 received from the insurance company for a part of the property burnt in a fire which occurred before McGuire\u2019s assignment. But even with these reductions which I cannot accept as fair, there was added to the above assets of $11,754 (without the Madoc property), $4,634.23, namely, cash in bank, $1,500, stock on hand $2,000, and chattels property $1,134.23. Thus an apparent surplus of only $1,134.23 of assets over liabilities was shewn which, if the error I have pointed out of counting the mortgage debt as part of the liabilities while excluding the property on which it was secured from the assets, was corrected, would leave a surplus of $4,877.23. No allowance was made for the hotel license or the lease, or the good will of the business. The hotel license was valued in the consideration McGuire had paid at from $3,000 to $5,000.\nOn the facts as he found them and formulated in this statement the learned Chief Justice drew the inference that the settlement was fraudulent and void under the statute.\nI have already stated why I accept Mr. Justice Riddell\u2019s statement of McGuire\u2019s financial position at the time he made the settlement as correct. It shewed McGuire to have had a very handsome surplus of assets over debts and quite justified the settlement he made upon his wife. His business in Ottawa had continued prosperous from the time he bought it and remained so for six or eight months afterwards. The firm\u2019s obligations seem to have been met with reasonable promptness as they matured and to McGuire the outlook was promising. There was no indication or anticipation by either defendant that the venture was likely to prove a failure. My conclusion is that McGuire was clearly solvent when he made the settlement. He made that settlement in consequence of a promise given by him to his wife when at his solicitation she joined with him in the conveyance of some property he owned in Toronto. He and she both thought she had a dower interest in that property. They may have been wrong in their belief, but from their evidence both husband and wife believed she had. She thought she had a moral claim at any rate to the Madoc property as she had done as much if not more to build it up and make it what it was as her husband had done. He admitted that to be so. She was apparently living in Toronto with her two invalid daughters and the settlement seems to have been made when their home there was broken up and a very short time after she signed away whatever rights she had in the Toronto property. It was made at a time when, if the statement of his financial condition I accept is correct, he was undoubtedly entitled to make it. Even if the onus of proving that is cast upon him on the assumption of the settlement being a voluntary one, I think he has discharged it.\nWhat, then, if this story is true, brought about the insolvency? A perusal of the evidence satisfies me that it was brought about by causes which could not have been foreseen or anticipated when he made the impeached settlement.\nIn the summer of 1909, McGuire Bros. were compelled by the License Commissioners to move their bar from the corner of Bank and Sparks Streets, a great thoroughfare, to the upper side of Bank Street. This change necessitated extensive alterations being made claimed to have cost about $4,000. This, of course, was not, and could not have been, anticipated in November, 1908. To make these necessary changes good paying tenants of theirs were dispossessed and their rentals lost. In the early part of 1910 the fire took place causing further damage to their business and much loss. McGuire states in his evidence that the direct loss in the receipts of the bar from the change compelled by the License Commissioners was 25%. The rentals of the tenants they had to dispossess so as to make room for the new bar amounted to $110 per month, and McGuire says they were not able to get a tenant for the corner they vacated. Then the municipality brought into effect a by-law to reduce the number of licenses in the city and that made it impossible for them to sell out. Reverses began about June, 1909. They struggled from that date under the adverse circumstances I have above stated from the evidence, to meet their obligations until December. Then followed the plaintiffs\u2019 suit and the assignment followed by the landlord\u2019s distress for three months\u2019 advance rent and the sale under the distress with its usual pitiful returns.\nIn all of these facts as stated in evidence, I see nothing to justify the conclusion that the insolvency could have possibly been foreseen in November, 1908. The proper inference is that it was brought about by causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen at that time or for many months afterwards, and so forms an exception to the general rule respecting voluntary conveyances preceding insolvency. It was said that this case was governed by that of Mackay v. Douglas[12]. I do not think so. The broad ground upon which that case was decided is stated by the Vice-Chancellor at page 122 to be that a man who contemplates going into trade cannot on the eve of doing so take the bulk of his property out of the reach of those who may become his creditors in his trading operations. The facts of the two cases are not analogous. McGuire was not like a man \u201cgoing into trade\u201d for the first time when or immediately after he made the settlement. He appears to have been for the greater part of his life in the hotel business, and he did not, as I have shewn, take the bulk of his property out of the reach of his creditors. I think it is a case forming an exception to the principle laid down in Mackay v. Douglas12, an exception explicitly stated by the same learned Justice Malins, V.C., in Crossley v. Elworthy[13], at page 167. In the case of Re Butterworth, ex parte Russell in 1882[14], Jessel M.R. says at page 598:\u2014\nThe principle of Mackay v. Douglas12, and that line of cases, is this, that a man is not entitled to go into a hazardous business, and immediately before doing so settle all his property voluntarily, the object being this: \u201cIf I succeed in business I make a fortune for myself. If I fail, I leave my creditors unpaid. They will bear the loss.\u201d\nI think if that expresses the true principle it would be impossible to bring this case within it. The business he was entering into in Ottawa was the one he had been engaged in all his life. It was not a new business nor was it a hazardous one in the sense in which that word is used by Malins, V.C., in Mackay v. Douglas[15], and by Jessel M.R., in Re Butterworth[16].\nThe settlement impeached did not embrace \u201call of his property\u201d or indeed the larger part of it. It embraced practically that part of the property which the wife had herself in great part built up. It was made by a man who was not insolvent at the time he made it, but became so afterwards from accidents and causes which he neither did nor could have anticipated. It does seem to me to be rather the refinement of irony when the two chief creditors, the Wine Vault Company and the Capital Brewing Company, in order to defeat the claim of the wife and children to a portion of the property which the life\u2019s labours of the former largely created, unite to proclaim a business a \u201chazardous\u201d one which they themselves exist upon and supply with the \u201csinews of war\u201d to keep alive and on a commercial basis.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Divisional Court restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons assigned by the judgment of the learned trial judge, the dissenting judgment in the Divisional Court and the judgments in the Court of Appeal.\nCounsel for appellant quite properly points out that there is an oversight in the first of these in one set of figures necessarily taking into account the Madoc mortgage, and in the next set of calculations not making allowance therefor, but I apprehend the result of these figures did not affect the learned judge\u2019s conclusions at all. The broad features of the case he presents are a voluntary conveyance by a man three months after he had made a fatal mistake in a business venture and had some reason to see it was such as evidenced by his increasing liabilities, and his inability to explain better than he did how he became fifteen months later hopelessly insolvent.\nMaking every allowance for his misfortunes hardly accounts for what happened, save that he had made such a mistake in so venturing.\nLicenses, good will and other such non-exigible assets must be put aside by any man hoping to shew solvency in cases of this kind.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think there is not sufficient ground for impeaching the finding of the learned trial judge that the conveyance was voluntary; but I do not agree that the circumstances justify the conclusion that the necessary effect of the conveyance was to defeat or delay existing creditors. The burden was consequently upon the plaintiffs at the outset to shew that the conveyance was made by the debtor with a view to protecting himself or his family against the consequences of failure in the business into which he had a short time before entered. I think the fact that a collapse did come within a few months after the execution of the conveyance was sufficient to shift the burden to the appellants of shewing that such was not the intent of the transaction. I do not think that burden has been discharged.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It is clearly established, as has been found in the courts below, that the conveyance by the male defendant to his wife was voluntary. The con- siderations now suggested to support it are afterthoughts and purely illusory.\nI am not satisfied that it is an unfair inference from the judgment of the learned trial judge that he reached the conclusion ascribed to him by the dissenting Chief Justice in the Divisional Court and by the unanimous Court of Appeal\u2014in which they expressly concur\u2014that this conveyance was made with the intent of protecting the property transferred from the claims of possible, if not probable, future creditors of the hazardous business in which the defendant John L. McGuire had shortly before embarked. Neither am I convinced that this conclusion is not warranted by the evidence. The appellants have, in my opinion, failed to make a case for disturbing it. Other reasons for the transfer put forward by them do not account for its having been made when and as it was. I agree with the Court of Appeal that this case is governed by the principles on which Mackay v. Douglas[17], approved by the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Russell[18], was decided.\nThe defendants are, however, entitled to a formal rectification of the judgment pronounced by the trial court. The defendant Hattie McGuire had an inchoate dower right in the Madoc property. A conveyance of that property by her to the assignee, as directed in the second paragraph of the judgment, might deprive her of that right. Of course this was not intended and, had attention been drawn on the settlement of the minutes to this possible effect of the conveyance directed by the judgment, provision excepting from its operation Mrs. McGuire\u2019s dower right would certainly have been made. In actions such as this, the relief granted is properly confined to setting aside the impeached conveyance, thus removing it as an obstacle to the creditor\u2019s recovery under executions against their debtor. The first paragraph of the judgment accomplishes this. Moreover, it is inconsistent to declare a conveyance void and to set it aside and then to direct that the grantee under that conveyance shall convey to the assignee for the benefit of the creditors the property of which she has thus been already deprived. The judgment of the trial court should be amended by striking out the second paragraph.\nWith this variation this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Frank B.

An agreement having that effect is void inasmuch as it establishes conditions contrary to the policy of the statute. Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 22 K.B. 58) reversed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Greenshields, in Superior Court chambers, in the District of Montreal, by which the respondent\u2019s petition was granted with costs. The proceedings were commenced by petition to a judge in chambers by the respondent whereby, on his own behalf as well as in his capacity of testamentary executor of the late Ferdinand Paquette, deceased, he claimed the property, goodwill and accessories of a restaurant, including the licence to sell spirituous liquors in connection therewith, whereof the respondent, as curator of the insolvent estate of Joseph Goderre, had taken possession by virtue of a judicial abandonment. These proceedings were instituted under the provisions of articles 875 and 876 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure. The prayer of the petition was granted by Greenshields J. and his decision in favour of the petitioner was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nOn the argument the court raised the question of its jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal, which depended on whether or not the originating petition was or was not a proceeding in a superior court within the provisions of sections 36, 37 and 46 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur E.C. and St. Germain E.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion E.C. and A. Perrault for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (oral).\u2014This appeal must be allowed with costs, reserving to the respondent his right to rank on the estate as a privileged creditor with respect to the amount paid by him in order to\n[Page [Page 475]]\nobtain the transfer and renewal of the licence in question.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by my brother Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is curator of the estate of one Goderre who had been a hotelkeeper in Montreal for some years and up to the time of his judicial abandonment, on the 21st of March, 1910, of his property as an insolvent.\nAs such he held at that date a licence to sell intoxicating liquors. This licence had been issued to him under the provisions of the \u201cQuebec Licence Act,\u201d on the first of May, 1909, for one year.\nThe appellant applied for and got the consent of the Licence Commissioners pursuant to the provisions of the said Act to the transfer to him, as curator, of said licence, and later procured from them, on the first of May following, a renewal of said licence for the next ensuing year from said date.\nThe appellant, as such curator, having taken possession of the business premises and stock-in-trade of the insolvent, was duly proceeding to sell same with said licence by public auction to be held on the 31st May, 1910, when the respondent, on the 26th May, 1910, applied by petition addressed\nto one of the judges of the Superior Court sitting in and for the District of Montreal,\nto have the said curator ordered to turn over to him the said licence and certain stock-in-trade relating to said business.\nThe prayer of the petition was granted by Mr. Justice Greenshields and his order has been upheld by the court of appeal. The appellant seeks a reversal of said judgment.\nThe petition is founded upon articles 875 and 876 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nDuring the argument a question was raised as to whether an appeal would lie to this court from such a judgment.\nSection 46 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d defining the grounds of appeal from the court of final resort in the Province of Quebec, seems comprehensive enough to include the subject-matter in controversy herein which is admitted to be above two thousand dollars in value.\nIt is urged that the proceeding in question was not one taken in the Superior Court, but was a mere chamber motion and, hence, non-appealable.\nThe distinction between a judge in chambers and his sitting as a court is, for many purposes, quite valid.\nThe Code of Civil Procedure (in like manner as procedural legislation does in other provinces on the like subject) declares, by article 24, that the court has the same powers as a judge over matters assigned to the latter by article 71; that the judge can adjourn an application brought before him into the court or vice vers\u00e2, and, by article 72, that a decision of a judge in chambers shall have the same effect as judgments of the court and be subject to appeal and other remedies as against judgments.\nArticle 876 is as follows:\u2014\nAny property not belonging to the debtor, which is in the curator\u2019s possession by virtue of the abandonment, may be recovered by the person thereto entitled, upon a petition to the judge.\nIt would seem as if this remedy had been provided as a specific mode of trial and adjudication relative to the title to property which had passed into the curator\u2019s hands and to which a third party might have made a claim. Its peculiar terms may have a bearing (which I pass for the present) upon the merits of this appeal.\nThe question of our jurisdiction, it is to be observed, does not, having regard to the terms of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d necessarily turn upon the form but upon the substance of the question of whether or not the proceeding has been had in a superior court.\nI think our jurisdiction to hear this appeal is quite as well founded as it was in the case of The North British Canadian Investment Co. v. The Trustees of St. John School District[2], where the question was the right of appeal when an officer under the \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d of the North-West Territories had been directed by a judge to make an entry affecting a title; or the case of The City of Halifax v. Reeves[3], when the proceeding was begun and founded upon a petition to a judge in chambers.\nAs to the merits of the appeal there is nothing, so far as I can see, to be gained by going into many of the questions argued before us. It must be determined by the question of whether or not, having regard to the provisions of the \u201cQuebec Licence Act\u201d (which alone creates thereby such rights of property or otherwise as any one can have in, to or over such licences) the respondent has any such right of property in the licence as to entitle him to the order made directing the curator to transfer it to him.\nNot even the court can have any power or authority directing its curator or any one else to meddle with such a transfer unless given by said Act the power to do so.\nIn 1906, the hotel business in question with the then stock-in-trade, the goodwill, the lease and licence had been transferred by one Thibault to the respondent and a partner named Paquette, since dead but whom he represents, and by them re-transferred to the said Goderre under an instrument which contained what was expressed to be a suspensive condition and is claimed now to have been so effectively such that the respondent and Paquette could, and he now, personally and as representative, can claim that, by reason of default in the terms of the payment of the price of that sale to Goderre, the said licence has reverted to him by reason of the terms of the condition or became his because the said Goderre had so covenanted.\nIt may be observed just here that by reason of the licence only having a yearly existence it is rather difficult to define in legal terms just what the claim is. I, therefore, try to put it thus alternatively, and express something that we are expected to grasp, however elusive it becomes once it is touched or some one tries to touch it.\nHaving regard to the purview of the \u201cLiquor Licence Act\u201d and the provisions thereof specially applicable to the curator of an insolvent estate, I do not think such a contention as is thus set up is maintainable.\nArticle 923 of the said Act is as follows:\u2014\n923. Subject to the provisions of this section as to removals and transfers of licences, and as to voluntary or judicial abandonments made by bon\u00e2 fide insolvents, every licence for the sale of liquor shall be held to be a licence to the person therein named only and for the premises therein described, and shall remain valid only so long as such person continues to be the occupant of the said premises and the owner of the business there carried on.\nIt would puzzle one to frame language more destructive than this of such a claim as respondent sets up. If words mean anything these must mean that the licence was personal and remained valid only so long as the person named continued to be the occupant of the premises and the owner of the business there carried on. The moment he ceased to carry on the business that moment the licence lapsed save in so far as\nthe provisions of this section as to removals and the transfer of licences and as to voluntary or judicial abandonments made by bon\u00e2 fide insolvents\npreserved the licence, and then only in and for the interests of those named in regard to any preservation of it.\nThere is not a sentence or semblance of a provision in the Act making any preservation of such licence subserve the purposes of any such bargain as the respondent relies upon. Indeed, there are provisions distinctly anticipating the lapsing of licences not specifically preserved by the terms of the Act and dealing with the accrual of benefit the public interests or policy may be expected to derive therefrom.\nThis, I most respectfully submit, ends or ought to have ended any pretension on the part of the respondent to invoke the powers of the court or any judge thereof acting under article 876 which prim\u00e2 facie enables only a dealing with property seizable by the sheriff and claimable by some party having a title thereto or right therein of some kind. No court or judge can re-create that which has perished, still less make a valid order which in effect contravenes the plain duty the law in question provides for the doing of, by an officer whose peculiar duty it is to serve the interest of the general creditors.\nBut that is not all; for article 953, sub-section (b), which is specifically directed to cover the cases of transfers referred to in above article 923, provides for a special transfer fee of $75,\nwhen it is granted in consequence of a voluntary or judicial abandonment in a case of bon\u00e2 fide insolvency,\nand, by sub-sections 3 and 4, in the case of the death of a licensee or of a voluntary or judicial abandonment of property on his part, as follows:\u2014\n3. Save in the case of an abandonment of property or of the death of the licensee, no transfer of a licence shall be made until after the expiration of forty days from the date upon which the licence was delivered by the collector of provincial revenue.\n4. In the case of the death of a licensee or of a voluntary or judicial abandonment of property on his part, a delay of thirty days is granted to his heirs or representatives, or to the provisional guardian or the curator of his estate, during which delay the licence continues in force, in order to give them an opportunity to apply for a transfer.\nAnd by sub-section 5 of article 953 the transferee of a licence approved of and duly certified as provided therein is to enjoy the rights which accrued to the original licensee.\nBut in the case of the death of a licensee, or of a judicial abandonment on his part, the municipal council shall give the preference to the purchaser of the stock-in-trade of the licensee\u2019s estate and shall transfer the licence to him or to the person recommended by him \u2014 provided such purchaser or such person so recommended be of good character and repute \u2014 for the same premises or for other premises should the landlord of the deceased or transferror refuse to accept such transferee as his tenant.\nHow can respondent claim to have fallen within the first part of this sub-section or to defeat the second part just quoted? Then article 922 expressly declares such\nlicences shall be granted for one year, or for part of a year only, and shall expire on the first day of May subsequent to their issue.\nThere are other provisions indicating, as in article 924, the qualifications and formalities to be observed to get or hold a licence; and, as in article 940, respecting preference for a particular place; and, as in article 954, giving three months from date of abandonment \u201cfailing which the licence is of no avail\u201d; and, in article 1082, when not a bon\u00e2 fide case of insolvency the general policy of the Act and the purpose of protecting creditors of an insolvent licensee. But nothing is to be found to preserve the rights of persons whose whole scheme was part of a system of trafficking in licences for the direct and incidental profits of such traffic and but a palpable evasion of the said policy of the legislature and its purpose in this enactment to protect creditors of an insolvent.\nHow, for example, when the lease of the premises was got by Goderre for a new term of five years and this lease has thus got beyond respondent\u2019s control, can he claim a transfer without the premises it applies to? True, the landlord may be got to consent, may be pacified or he may have assented to all this, though it does not appear in evidence. But the possibilities are such as to be quite unworkable unless we adopt the theory that a licence once granted is a thing to be bargained about and handed round from hand to hand, just as a horse or other chattel, all of which is not what the Act contemplates.\nThere are also provisions to meet the case of companies getting and dealing with licences through their employee or nominee.\nThese provisions of business convenience, in such cases safeguarded against abuse, shew it never was intended such a bargain or consent as respondent relies upon should be held valid.\nIf it had been the law before that such rights could exist or be created, then there was no need for such a special enactment relative to companies. It was because substitutes or nominees of the capitalist or liquor dealer behind the scene would not be tolerated that this special enactment was made to provide for. Such rights as any one can have in regard to a licence must rest upon the Act and respondent is not one of any such class as the Act gives a right to.\nThe attempt elaborated in respondent\u2019s factum to make out of the several exceptions the Act provides for a rule of law that, hence, the licence is a piece of property, just as any other, is a curiosity in the way of legal argument deserving of notice, but, I respectfully submit, no more need be said than state it.\nThe licence is annual and only good for the year. Some sort of consideration is given relative to parties who may have been for several years holders of a licence for the same place, but that does not help respondent. Moreover, his whole arrangement was such a conflict with the policy of the Act as, in my opinion, to render the whole security illegal. The stock-in-trade claimed was of so little value as to render this branch of the dealing of small consequence herein. No separate claim was urged here on that head.\nWe have pressed upon us the jurisprudence of Quebec on the subject, but the Act, in its main features, is so like what prevails elsewhere we cannot assent thereto and apply other principles of construction elsewhere even if we could find such jurisprudence had been older than shewn herein. The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the petition be dismissed with costs. Of course, respondent is entitled to be recouped his advances to keep the licence alive since the insolvency.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am unable to accede to the suggestion that there should be read into section 37(a) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d words which would restrict its application to cases originating in the Circuit Court or in some other court. That provision dispenses, in cases of the classes therein specified, with the usual requirement that, in order to be appealable to this court the proceeding must originate in a Superior Court. The word \u201ccourt\u201d is not mentioned in clause (a); it does occur in clauses(b) and (d). We have before us the judgment of the highest court of final resort in the Province of Quebec rendered in a judicial proceeding in which the matter in controversy exceeds the value of $2,000. This case, therefore, in my opinion, fulfils the conditions upon which a right of appeal is conferred by section 37.\nThibault, the original owner of the business and licence in question, on the 14th of December, 1906, executed a contract of sale to Messrs. St. Charles and Paquette of his business, stock-in-trade, licence, etc. A special term of the contract was that Thibault would transfer the licence to his vendee\u2019s nominee. Pursuant to that undertaking he transferred the licence to one Goderre, who subsequently became insolvent and made an abandonment under which the appellant, Turgeon, became curator of his estate. The Licence Commissioners approved of the transfer from Thibault to Goderre and the latter thus became the holder of the licence of which several renewals were subsequently issued to him. Concurrently with the transaction between Thibault and St. Charles and Paquette and the transfer of the licence to Groderre an agreement was made with Goderre by St. Charles and Paquette whereby they sold to him the business, stock-in-trade, licence, etc., subject to a suspensive condition in the following terms:\u2014\nFaute par monsieur Goderre d\u2019observer toutes les conditions qu\u2019il a ci-dessus (assum\u00e9es, ou faute par lui de payer, trente jours apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, un seul des versements qu\u2019il s\u2019est ci-dessus engag\u00e9 de payer, messieurs St. Charles et F. Paquette auront le droit de reprendre possession imm\u00e9diate du dit fonds de commerce de restaurant licenci\u00e9, avec accessoires, tel que ci-haut d\u00e9fini, comprenant la licence pour La vente des liqueurs spiritueuses attach\u00e9e au dit fonds de commerce et les renouvellements de cette licence, avec le droit d\u2019avoir telle licence transport\u00e9e au nom de toute personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par eux, et ce, sans \u00eatre tenus de donner aucun avis \u00e0 cette fin \u00e0 monsieur, Goderre, ni d\u2019user d\u2019aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 judiciaire, ni de donner aucune indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 Monsieur Goderre, les sommes d\u2019argent jusqu\u2019alors pay\u00e9es par ce dernier devant demeurer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de messieurs Paquette et St. Charles et de Monsieur Thibault, \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s, \u00e9tant sp\u00e9cialement convenu que le pr\u00e9sent contrait est fait sujet a la condition suspensive que tout ce que c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 ici demeure et demeurera la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de messieurs St. Charles et Paquette jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement pay\u00e9s du prix qui forme la consid\u00e9ration du pr\u00e9sent contrat, ce contrat n\u2019\u00e9tant qu\u2019une promesse de vente et les parties \u00e9tant d\u2019accord pour convenir que l\u2019article 1478 du code civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019aura pas lieu de s\u2019appliquer ici.\nIn my view under these documents St. Charles and Paquette never became owners of the licence in question. They certainly were not at any time the holders of it. Assuming that a licence under the \u201cQuebec Licence Law\u201d is property (I rather think it is not), I am of the opinion that the licence in question and all right of property in it passed directly from Thibault to Groderre. If so, no property in the licence passed from St. Charles and Paquette to Goderre under the contract between them; and, since the suspensive clause in that contract in terms purports to affect only what passed or was transferred by it, the licence would not be subject to that clause. Neither could it \u201cremain\u201d (demeure) the property of St. Charles and Paquette.\nBut if this be too narrow a view to take of the purpose and effect of the two documents of the 14th of December, 1906, and if under the Thibault sale St. Charles and Paquette acquired some right of property in the licence as well as in the other subjects of sale, then, if the agreement between Goderre and St. Charles and Paquette should be construed solely according to what appears to be the expressed intent of the parties and without regard to the nature of any of its subject-matters or any incidents attached to them by law, it would, if valid, probably have the effect of confining the right of Goderre to a mere contingent or precarious right of possession of the several subjects with which it purports to deal \u2014 including the licence \u2014 the entire right of property in them remaining in St. Charles and Paquette pending fulfilment of the suspensive condition as to payment.\nA study of the provisions of the \u201cQuebec Licence Law,\u201d however \u2014 particularly article 923 \u2014 has satisfied me that any property which may exist in a licence in that province is and must remain vested in the holder of the licence, upon whom it confers a personal right or privilege so long as he holds it and is the occupant of the premises and owner of the business in respect of which it issues. Having regard to this essential characteristic of a licence it is inconsistent with the letter and the spirit of the \u201cQuebec Licence Law\u201d that there should be vested in one person the property in a licence held by another under a right intended to be more than merely temporary. The statute (art. 953(4)) specially provides for a short delay in the case of the death of, or voluntary or judicial abandonment of his property by the licensee. Unless, perhaps, pending the carrying out of an assignment intended to become effective practically at once, the law contemplates that the holder of a licence shall be its real owner. If, therefore, upon the only possible construction of the agreement in question, it involves Goderre holding for a term of years a licence of which during the entire period the ownership should be in St. Charles and Paquette, it would, in my opinion, be void as providing for a condition of things entirely contrary to the policy of the licence law. But, ut res magis valeat, I would be inclined to treat the agreement, at all events so far as the licence is concerned, as intended to provide not that the property in it while it was held by Goderre should be vested in St. Charles and Paquette, but that the latter should have a right at any time, on default in payment by Goderre according to the terms of his contract, to retake (reprendre) the licence by employing such means for that purpose as the law provides. I see no difficulty in a construction which involves personal obligation on the part of Goderre, on his making default in payment, to execute, on the demand of St. Charles and Paquette, a formal assignment of the licence, or any other documents requisite and proper to enable the latter to secure a transfer of it to themselves or to their nominee. But I cannot, consistently with the provisions of the licence law, as I appreciate them, admit its validity if the agreement be susceptible only of a construction which involves St. Charles and Paquette having a right of property \u2014 or a jus in re \u2014 in the licence itself while it was held by Goderre.\nI do not wish to be understood as questioning the assignability of a licence or the right of a transferee who can obtain the approval of the commissioners to become its holder. That question is not before us. The agreement under consideration is not a transaction of that kind. On the contrary, if it necessarily means what the respondent contends, it provides that a licence which was and was to remain the property of Messrs. St. Charles and Paquette, Should, nevertheless, be held during its original term and renewals by Goderre. Such a contract is, in my opinion, not possible under the \u201cQuebec Licence Law.\u201d\nWhether St. Charles and Paquette never had any right of property in the licence by virtue of their agreement with Thibault, or whether under their transaction with Goderre he became the owner of it subject to a contractual obligation, on his making default in payment, to re-transfer it to them or to their nominee, the licence was not at the time of Goderre\u2019s insolvency the property of St. Charles and Paquette and it is not now their property\nin the curator\u2019s possession by virtue of the abandonment \u2014\nwhich a judge might, upon petition, order the curator to transfer or deliver to them under article 876 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThat is, as I understand his petition, the remedy which the petitioner sought and the jurisdiction to which he appealed. But if he be entitled to take advantage of what is, perhaps, the broader provision of article 875 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which his counsel invoked at bar, I am still of opinion that he cannot succeed in this proceeding. I am unable to distinguish, on principle, between the property of an insolvent debtor subject to an executory contract, which creates a merely personal obligation to transfer it but does not confer on the obligee a jus in re, and other property of the debtor which passes under his abandonment to his curator for the benefit of his creditors. As against them (art. 1981 C.C.) I know of no ground upon which the obligee under such a personal contract can enforce \u201cspecific performance\u201d (l\u2019ex\u00e9cution) (art. 1065 C.C.) of the obligation by the curator. In this case there appear to be other difficulties in the way of adjudging an execution of the obligation which it is not necessary to discuss.\nI am, for these reasons, of opinion that, as to the liquor licence in question, which was the only matter seriously discussed at bar, this appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and the petition should be dismissed.\nBrodeur J. (dissident). \u2014 L\u2019Intim\u00e9 St. Charles \u00e9tait, en 1906, propri\u00e9taire avec un nomm\u00e9 Paquette d\u2019une licence pour la vente de liqueurs spiritueuses dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Le 14 d\u00e9cembre de cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e (1906) ils ont fait un contrat avec un nomm\u00e9 Goderre par lequel ils lui promettaient de lui transporter un fonds de commerce auquel \u00e9tait attach\u00e9 cette licence, d\u00e8s qu\u2019il leur aurait pay\u00e9 un certain montant comme prix de vente, lequel prix de vente \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 payable par versements.\nLa clause sp\u00e9ciale suivante \u00e9tait incorpor\u00e9e dans l\u2019acte:\u2014\nFaute par Monsieur Goderre d\u2019observer toutes les conditions ci-dessus assum\u00e9es, ou faute par lui de payer, trente jours apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, un seul des versements qu\u2019il s\u2019est ci-dessus engag\u00e9 de payer, Messieurs St. Charles et F. Paquette auront le droit de reprendre possession imm\u00e9diate du dit fonds de commerce de restaurant licenci\u00e9, avec accessoires, tel que ci-haut d\u00e9fini, comprenant la licence pour la vente des liqueurs spiritueuses attach\u00e9e au dit fonds de commerce et les renouvellements de cette licence transport\u00e9e au nom de toute personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par eux, et ce sans \u00eatre tenus de donner aucun avis \u00e0 cette fin \u00e0 Monsieur Goderre, ni d\u2019user d\u2019aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 judiciaire, ni de donner aucune indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 Monsieur Goderre, les sommes d\u2019argent jusque l\u00e0 pay\u00e9es par ce dernier devant demeurer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Messieurs Paquette et Saint-Charles, et de Monsieur Thibault, \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s, \u00e9tant sp\u00e9cialement convenu que le pr\u00e9sent contrat est fait sujet \u00e0 la condition suspensive que tout ce que c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 ici demeure et demeurera la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de messieurs St. Charles et Paquette jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement pay\u00e9s du prix qui forme la consid\u00e9ration du pr\u00e9sent contrat, ce contrat n\u2019\u00e9tant qu\u2019une promesse de vente et les parties \u00e9tant d\u2019accord pour convenir que l\u2019article 1478 du code civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019aura pas lieu de s\u2019appliquer ici.\nEn vertu de cet acte Goderre a pris possession du fonds de commerce, l\u2019a exploit\u00e9 et a obtenu sa licence des autorit\u00e9s provinciales. Cette licence a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e pendant un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es.\nLe 21\u00e8me jour de mars, 1910, Goderre a fait cession de ses biens et l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur. En cette qualit\u00e9 il a pris possession du restaurant y compris la licence qu\u2019il s\u2019est fait transporter. La licence a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale 1910-11 et le paiement pour ce renouvellement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Au mois de mai, 1910, le curateur a annonc\u00e9 en vente la licence en question.\nAlors l\u2019intim\u00e9 (tant personnellement qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de Paquette) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate au juge, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019article 876 C.P.C. et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit enjoint au curateur de ne pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la vente de la licence et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit tenu de signer tous les documents n\u00e9cessaires aux fins de la remettre en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par le curateur dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des cr\u00e9anciers de Goderre, pr\u00e9tendant que cette licence n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 mais doit \u00eatre vendue pour les b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage des cr\u00e9anciers en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nLa question est donc de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vertu de son contrat avec Goderre peut r\u00e9clamer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette licence.\nL\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que St. Charles peut avoir une cr\u00e9ance contre la faillite et peut avoir droit \u00e0 des dommages mais que cette r\u00e9clamation et ces dommages doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s \u201cau mare la livre.\u201d St. Charles r\u00e9pond qu\u2019il est propri\u00e9taire de la licence attach\u00e9e an fonds de commerce, sauf n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 faire approuver son transfert par les autorit\u00e9s charg\u00e9es d\u2019administrer la loi, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas moins un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui comporte avec lui tous les avantages qui en d\u00e9coulent, et notamment celui de pouvoir revendiquer la jouissance exclusive de ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cr\u00e9anciers.\nCette cause est de la plus grande importance vu qu\u2019il y a un tr\u00e8s grand nombre de personnes qui poss\u00e8dent dans d\u00e8s licences et des fonds de commerce de restaurants des int\u00e9r\u00eats analogues \u00e0 ceux en question dans cette cause-ci.\nLa question de savoir si ces contrats \u00e9taient valides est venu d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes reprises devant les tribunaux de la province et notamment dans une cause de Canadian Breweries Co. v. Gari\u00e9py[4]. Cette d\u00e9cision de la cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie par l\u2019honorable juge Tellier dans une cause non rapport\u00e9e, 1908, cour sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, de Gari\u00e9py v. Ghartrand et dans une cause de Labelle et Turgeon jug\u00e9e le 4 octobre, 1910, par l\u2019honorable juge Fortin.\nNous pouvons dire par cons\u00e9quent que la jurisprudence de la province a reconnu la validit\u00e9 de ces transactions et si le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d\u2019intervenir pour modifier la loi depuis, c\u2019est qu\u2019il est satisfait que cette interpr\u00e9tation est correcte et que le syst\u00e8me ne doit pas \u00eatre chang\u00e9.\nLa question s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en France de savoir si les brev\u00eats d\u2019imprimerie, qui \u00e9taient alors absolument personnels et ne pouvaient \u00eatre exploit\u00e9s que par ceux qui en avaient re\u00e7u l\u2019autorisation du gouvernement, \u00e9taient susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contrat et d\u2019engendrer des obligations; et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans une cause rapport\u00e9e dans Dalloz, 1833-2-50, qu\u2019un brev\u00eat d\u2019imprimerie, qui est incessible et personnel, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu \u00e0 une personne avec tout le mat\u00e9riel, cette personne-l\u00e0 ne serait pas venue \u00e0 demander la rescision du contrat parce que le gouvernement aurait refus\u00e9 de confirmer le transfert.\nIl est de principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire que les biens se divisent en biens incorporels et corporels. (Art. 374 C.C.) Le droit du porteur d\u2019une licence est un bien incorporel et il est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9, vendu ou ali\u00e9n\u00e9, et entre les parties la vente est parfaite (art. 1472 C.C.).\nDans le contrat que nous avons \u00e0 examiner Goderre, insolvable, pouvait bien \u00eatre le porteur de la licence aux yeux de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 publique. Aux yeux des commissaires, il l\u2019\u00e9tait virtuellement; mais dans ses relations avec St. Charles, l\u2019intim\u00e9, il est r\u00e9gi par son contrat de 1906. Or, en vertu de ce contrat, St. Charles \u00e9tait le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire de la licence. On a pr\u00e9tendu que la licence future ne pouvait pas \u00eatre susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019art. 1061 C.C. d\u00e9clare cependant que les choses futures peuvent \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019une obligation; et \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1488 C.C. au titre de \u201cLa Vente\u201d il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la vente est valide si le vendeur devient ensuite propri\u00e9taire de la chose. La licence future peut donc faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une obligation et elle pouvait faire \u00e9galement l\u2019objet d\u2019un contrat de vente.\nDans ces circonstances je consid\u00e8re que le contrat fait par Goderre, d\u2019une part, et par St. Charles et Paquette, d\u2019autre part, est un contrat parfaitement valide; que ce contrat fait la loi des parties; et, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait avant la faillite propri\u00e9taire de la licence en question. Il peut donc en revendiquer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cr\u00e9anciers de Goderre; et le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel, qui a reconnu sa pr\u00e9tention, doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nLa question s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de savoir ci cette cour avait juridiction pour entendre le pr\u00e9sent appel. Pour les raisons donn\u00e9es sur ce point par mon confr\u00e8re Anglin je suis d\u2019opinion que nous avons juridiction. Cette cause a d\u2019ailleurs origine devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure et je crois que les articles 36 et 37 de \u201cl\u2019Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame,\u201d interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s l\u2019un par l\u2019autre, nous m\u00e8nent \u00e0 la conclusion que la pr\u00e9sente cause a origine en cour sup\u00e9rieure et est, par cons\u00e9quent, susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre port\u00e9e ici, vu que le montant en litige exc\u00e8de $2,000.\nIl y eut un temps dans Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 on faisait une grande diff\u00e9rence entre la juridiction du juge en chambre et de la cour elle-m\u00eame. Mais par des amendements faits au Code, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions rendues par le juge en chambre ont la m\u00eame force et le m\u00eame effet que si elles \u00e9taient rendues par la cour elle-m\u00eame (art. 72 C.P.C.). A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, en admettant que le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance dans le cas actuel ne serait pas la cour sup\u00e9rieure, alors il ne peut pas y avoir de doute que sous la section 37 de l\u2019acte de la cour supr\u00eame nous aurions juridiction.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gouin, Lemieux, Murphy, Berard & Perrault.\n[1] Q.R. 22 K.B. 58.\n[2] 35 Can.

The carelessness of the plaintiffs in driving across the tracks of a tramway was, in this ease, excused by the reckless conduct of the defendant's motorman in failing to use proper precautions to avoid the consequences of their negligence after he had become aware of it. Judgment appealed from (11 D.L.R. 3; 4 West. W.R. 263) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], whereby, on an equal division of opinion among the judges, the judgment of Beck J. at the trial [2] in favour of the plaintiffs stood affirmed.\nThe action was brought by the respondents to recover damages for injuries to themselves and their lunch-van occasioned by a collision with a city tramcar at a subway-crossing of one of the public streets under the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the City of Calgary. The tramway, operated on the street where the collision occurred, entered the subway from one end about the same time that the plaintiffs' van was passing through the subway from the other end. It was shewn that the plaintiffs had carelessly driven the van across the tracks of the tramway but it also appeared that the motorman who was driving the electric tramcar was able to see the van approaching in the opposite direction and that, by using the appliances on his car promptly, he might have reduced the speed of the car, or brought it to a stop, and thus avoided the accident from which the injuries resulted. At the trial, before Mr. Justice Beck without a jury, the plaintiffs' action was maintained, $1,000 being awarded to Lupo Harnovis and $120 to Dave Hercovish, without costs. On the appeal to the court in banco, on equal division of opinion among the judges, the decision of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiffs was affirmed and his judgment was varied by giving the defendant, appellant, costs up to the date of the trial.\nThe principal grounds urged on the present appeal were that the judgment was against the weight of evidence and that the courts below had erred in holding that the case was governed by the decision in the case of The Halifax Tramway Co. v. Inglis[3].\nD. S. Moffat for the appellant.\nG. H. Ross K.C. appeared for the respondents, but was not called upon by the court for any argument.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred with Duff J.\nIDINGTON J. concurred in the result of the judgment.\nDUFF J.\u2014There was evidence from which the learned trial judge was entitled to find and did find (and I may add that I agree with his finding) that the motorman, when he saw the respondents' van heading across the track, might with the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence have avoided the collision or, at all events, the substantial harm caused by it.\nThe learned judge also took the view that the respondents, when they directed their horse across the street, were sitting in their van carelessly oblivious of the dangers, actual or possible, of the car-track. The view of the learned trial judge was that, although the respondents were in fault to such a degree as would have debarred them from recovering had it not been for the conduct of the motorman after their negligence became apparent, yet (in the circumstances of this case) as the motorman could have avoided the consequences of the respondents' negligence after he became aware of it, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. In a word, the decisive negligence was found by him to have been that of the motorman. I agree with this view and I should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014There was evidence sufficient to support the finding that the determining cause of the accident in this case was the negligence of the defendant's motorman, but for which he might have prevented the collision after he became or should have been aware of the plaintiffs' danger.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J. also concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 11 D.L.R. 3; 4 West.

Upon an appeal by the last mentioned defendant,\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that the judgment sought to be appealed from (23 Man. r. 159) did not finally conclude the action as proceedings still remained to be taken on the reference, consequently, it was not a final judgment within the meaning of section 2(e) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d prior to the amendment by the statute 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 51 (assented to on the 6th of June, 1913), and it was not competent to the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain the appeal. The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co. (19 Can. S.C.R. 434). followed. Ex parte Moore (14 Q.B.D. 627), distinguished; Clarke v. Goodall (44 Can. S.C.R. 284), and The Grown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner (44 Can. S.C.R. 616), referred to. Per Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The amendment of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d by the first section of 3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 51, has not affected whatever right the appellant may have had at the time the judgment was rendered in respect to an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Hyde v. Lindsay (29 Can. S.C.R. 99); Cowen V. Evans (22 Can. S.C.R. 331); Hurtubise v. Desmarteau (19 Can. S.C.R. 562); and Taylor v. The Queen (1 Can. S.C.R. 65), referred to.\nPer Davies J. dissenting.\u2014The judgment in question does not reserve \u201cfurther directions\u201d and comes within the rule and principle determining what are \u201cfinal judgments\u201d laid down in the case of Esc parte Moore (14 Q.B.D. 627).\nMOTION to quash an appeal by the defendant Tena Stephenson from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Metcalfe J., at the trial, by which nonsuit was entered in the action against her, and declaring her liable for the amount of a bond executed by her in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action was on a guaranty by the defendants which had been given to secure the respondent company the indebtedness then existing and the future indebtedness of the Stephenson Furniture Company towards the plaintiffs to the extent of $2,600. The guaranty purported to be signed by the defendants James Albert Stephenson, his wife, Tena Stephenson, and by William Stephenson and Margaret Stephenson, father and mother of James Albert Stephenson. At the trial the defendants moved for a nonsuit which was granted in respect to Tena Stephenson and Margaret Stephenson and judgment was entered against William Stephenson and James A. Stephenson with a reference to the master to take the accounts and ascertain the amount, if any, due by the Stephenson Furniture Company to the plaintiffs.\nBy the judgment now appealed from, rendered on the 17th of March, 1913 (prior to the amendment of sec. 2(e) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d R.S.C. 1906, ch. 139, by the statute 3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 51, defining the words \u201cfinal judgment\u201d) the judgment against James A. Stephenson and William Stephenson was affirmed without variation, but the judgment dismissing the action as against Tena Stephenson was reversed and the action against her maintained for the amount, if any, not exceeding $2,600, which, on a reference to the master to take accounts, etc., should be found to be due to the plaintiffs by the Stephenson Furniture Company. As to Tena Stephenson there was no reserve of further directions in the judgment appealed from.\nGrayson Smith, for the respondents, supported the motion to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment was not final. He cited Clarke v. Goodall[2]; Crown Life Insurance Co. v. Skinner[3]; and The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[4].\nW. L. Scott, contra, distinguished the cases cited in support of the motion, and relied upon Ex parte Moore[5] to shew that the judgment appealed from was a final judgment in regard to Tena Stephenson and that, without any further action by the court, execution could issue against her as soon as any liability was determined upon the master\u2019s report becoming absolute.\nGrayson Smith, for the respondents,\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The motion to quash should be granted. Ex parte Moore[6] has been considered; The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[7] is followed.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014The judgment appealed from adjudged that the judgment allowing a nonsuit as against Tena Stephenson be reversed and that the above respondent company should and do recover judgment against her\nfor the amount, if any, due by the Stephenson Furniture Co, Limited, to them not exceeding the sum of $2,600 (the amount of her guarantee) and that it be referred to the master to take the accounts and ascertain the amount due by the Stephenson Furniture Company to the respondents and that Tena Stephenson, appellant, should and do pay to the plaintiffs, the respondents above, that amount and costs.\nThere was nothing said about \u201cfurther directions.\u201d In my opinion this judgment comes within the rule and principle determining what are \u201cfinal judgments\u201d laid down in the case of Ex parte Moore6, and is not at variance with any of our previous decisions in cases where further directions are reserved.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the motion to quash the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014Of the many decisions going to shew that the judgment herein is not a final judgment within the meaning of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d as it stood when this appeal was taken, the case of The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[8] seems to cover the exact contention set up by Mr. Scott in resisting the motion to quash herein which, it seems to me, must prevail with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014This is not an action in the nature of a suit in equity within section 38(e) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d It is an ordinary common law action to enforce liability on a bond. In order to establish jurisdiction in this court to entertain her appeal, the appellant must successfully maintain that the judgment against which that appeal is taken is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the definition of that term in the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nThat judgment was pronounced on the 17th of March, 1913. Under a series of decisions (Hyde v. Lindsay[9]; Cowen v. Evans[10]; Hurtubise v. Desmarteau[11]; Taylor v. The Queen[12]) it is clear that whatever right of appeal to this court the appellant had when judgment was given against her by the Court of Appeal has not been affected by the subsequent amendment of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d changing the definition of a final judgment, which was assented to on the 6th of June, 1913.\nBut, in answer to the motion to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment against the appellant, Tena Stephenson, is not a final judgment, it is urged that, inasmuch as by that judgment further directions are not reserved and under it execution may issue without any further action by the court, so soon as the amount of the liability has been determined by the master\u2019s report becoming absolute (Man. K.B. Rules, Nos. 683, and 692), this case is distinguishable from such cases as Clarke v. Goodall[13], and The Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[14].\nIn the trial court judgment was awarded against two of the defendants, James Albert Stephenson and William Stephenson, in these terms:\u2014\nAnd it is further ordered and adjudged that the plaintiffs do recover judgment against the defendants James Albert Stephenson and William Stephenson for the amount, if any, due by the Stephenson Furniture Company, Limited, to the plaintiff not exceeding the sum of twenty-six hundred dollars ($2,600), being the amount mentioned in the guarantee sued on herein and that it be referred to the master of this honourable court to take the accounts and ascertain the amount due by the said Stephenson Furniture Company, Limited, to the plaintiff.\nAnd this court doth further order and adjudge that the said James Albert Stephenson and William Stephenson do pay to the plaintiff its costs of this action.\nAnd this court doth further order and adjudge that further directions and the costs of the reference be reserved until after the master shall have made his report.\nOn appeal, that judgment was affirmed without variation. As against Tena Stephenson the action had been dismissed at the trial, but, on appeal, this part of the judgment of the trial judge was reversed and judgment was rendered against Tena Stephenson in the following terms:\u2014\nThat the appellant, the above named plaintiff, should and do recover against the defendant Tena Stephenson for the amount, if any, due by the Stephenson Furniture Company, Limited, to the plaintiff not exceeding the sum of $2,600, and that it be referred to the master of the Court of King\u2019s Bench to take the accounts and ascertain the amount due by the said Stephenson Furniture Company, Limited, to the plaintiff; and that the said Tena Stephenson should and do pay to the plaintiff such amount and the plaintiff\u2019s costs of its action as against her in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and that the said judgment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench be amended accordingly.\nAnd this court did further order and adjudge that the defendant, Tena Stephenson, do and shall pay to the plaintiff its costs of appeal as against her forthwith after taxation.\nIt is difficult to understand why, as a result of the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal, further directions should have been reserved in regard to her co-defendants and not in regard to Tena Stephenson, the liability found in each case being, apparently, the same in every respect. The difference was probably due to mere inadvertence; but that may not safely be assumed.\nI agree with the appellant\u2019s contention that, upon the judgment as entered, execution may issue against her as soon as the master has made his report and it has become confirmed without any further order or direction of the court. Moreover, she is not met with the difficulty which would have presented itself had the judgment in appeal been rendered by the appellate court for Ontario, that, until the amount of the liability is determined there is nothing to shew that it will reach the appealable figure (see Wenger v. Lamont[15]. There is no monetary limitation on the right of appeal in Manitoba cases.\nBut, although it would be eminently unsatisfactory that an appeal should be entertained by this Court from a judgment under which it may be, for aught that appears before us, that nothing will ultimately be found to be due by the appellant (the master is to find the amount of the liability of the principal debtor, if any), I would be disposed to accept her contention that the judgment rendered against her in the Manitoba Court of Appeal is final within such authorities as Ex parte Moore[16]; Re Alexander[17]; Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council[18], and that it would be appealable to this court if \u201cfinal judgment\u201d had not been defined in our statute as it was before the amendment of 1913. The judgment against the appellant is similar to that sometimes rendered in the English King\u2019s Bench Division for an amount to be ascertained by an official referee; see Snow\u2019s Annual Practice, 1913, page 675.\nA similar judgment rendered in the Exchequer Court would be final for the purpose of appeal to this court under section 82 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 140), which provides that\na judgment shall be considered final for the purposes of this section if it determines the rights of the parties, except as to the amount of damages or the amount of liability.\nBut, in contrast to this special provision applicable only to appeals from the Exchequer Court, from which, as a final court, this court is the immediate appellate tribunal, we had, before the recent amendment, a declaration in the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d that in the cases of appeals from the provincial courts, which normally come to this court only after the judgment of the court of first instance has been dealt with by a provincial appellate court, final judgment shall mean\nany judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded. The action against the present appellant is not concluded by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. In that action, the reference proceedings are yet to be taken and it may be that there will be a series of appeals from the findings of the master. Further proceedings in the action are necessary before it can be said to be \u201cconcluded\u201d\u2014 before there will be a judgment in it enforceable against the appellant. I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the judgment against which this appeal is taken is not final within the definition of final judgment in the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d as it stood prior to the recent amendment.\nThe motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, Fullerton, Foley, & Newcombe.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

In 1871 it built its right-of-way fourteen feet wide. In 1892 the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., having acquired the rights of the Woodstock Railway Co., built side tracks adjoining the right-of-way and within the ninety-nine feet. In 1911 the plaintiffs (respondents) brought action for trespass by laying such side tracks on their land.\nThe court below held that there was no presumption that the Woodstock Railway Co. by occupying fourteen feet took possession of the whole ninety-nine feet allowed by its charter; that the injury to plaintiffs\u2019 land was not \u201csustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway\u201d and therefore the limitation of one year for bringing action in sec. 306 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 37) did not apply; and if it did the damage was continuous and plaintiffs could recover damages for six years, which were assessed at $1,200.\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada the appeal was dismissed, unanimously as to the merits but with an equal division on the question of damages, three of their Lordships being of opinion that they were excessive and the case should be sent back for a re-assessment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nHellmuth K.C. and F.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Harvey C.J. at the trial by which the counterclaim of the defendant (respondent) had been dismissed with costs.\nThe action was brought by the appellants for the price of a boiler and attachments and the defendant counterclaimed for damages on account of delay in the shipment of part of the machinery within the time stipulated in the sale-agreement and the unsuitability of other parts for the works in which they were to be used. The trial judge dismissed the counterclaim because of an exemption clause in the agreement providing if for any reason the appellants were \"unable to fill\" the order which the defendant had given for the machinery \"or deliver the goods at the time stated\" that they would not in any way be held responsible for damages, and also because the delay had been caused by failure to deliver a part of the machinery which had not been included in the order. By the judgment appealed from the Supreme Court of Alberta held that as the evidence did not shew inability to deliver the machinery at the time stated the clause did not protect the sellers, and also, that the failure to deliver certain parts of the machinery in question had not been the actual cause of the delay from which the damages claimed had resulted. Simmons J. dissented.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of both parties the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, it was ordered that the appeal should be allowed in part, that the judgment appealed from should be set aside, that the appellants should recover $465.30 on their claim with interest from the 28th of February, 1911, at the rate of 8% per annum on $444, that the defendant should recover on his counterclaim the sum of $200, and the appellants should have leave to enter judgment for the difference between these two sums.

(approving the judgment appealed from)\u2014The directors of a railway company may bind the company by such an agreement in relation to the business of the railway without having special sanction therefor by the shareholders.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of Lemieux J., in the Superior Court, District of Quebec[2], and maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the respondent to recover $4,533.13, being the amount of rebate claimed under an agreement made between him and the directors of the railway company granting him a rebate of one dollar per car, payable every six months during a period of five years from the month of August, 1903, on all car-loads of certain kinds of manufactured lumber shipped by him from his mills and timber limits upon the line of the company\u2019s railway.\nIn the Superior Court, at the trial, the action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Lemieux. This judgment was reversed and the action was maintained, by the judgment now appealed from, on an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. for the appellants.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff, respondent, against the appellant company to recover the sum of $4,533.13. It was brought on a contract made between the parties for the carriage by the company of the respondent plaintiff\u2019s wood and lumber for the term of five years, made in August, 1903, and certain modifications to the same to be found in letters passed between the parties in the months of September and October, 1903. The claim was for a rebate of one dollar per car every six months during the term of the contract on all cars of wood shipped and loaded on the company\u2019s cars by the plaintiff on the company\u2019s line of railway from plaintiff\u2019s mills and limits except on pulpwood, the freight on which was to be net.\nThere was no dispute as to the amount recoverable if the plaintiff had a right to recover at all. The claim was for the rebate payable under the contract on the carriage of the plaintiff\u2019s lumber during the last two years of the contract. The rebate on the first three years the contract was in force had been settled for and paid, but after the 1st of November, 1906, the appellant company refused to pay the rebate, although respondent had shipped and loaded 4,310 cars.\nThere were a number of minor grounds on which the appellants contended that they were not liable to pay the rebate earned under the contract during the last two years of its existence. But the substantial ones urged at bar against the judgment appealed from were that, under the Quebec statute passed in 1906, and which was in force during the two years in question, the rebate contended for amounted to discrimination against other shippers on the same railway and, therefore, violated the statute, and,\u2014secondly, that no tariff of tolls had been approved of in the manner provided for by the Act of 1906.\nIn my judgment these contentions of the appellant company should not be allowed to prevail as against the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nSo far as illegal discrimination constituting\nan unjust advantage over the other shippers on the same railway\nis concerned it is sufficient to say that such discrimination has not been proved. Neither the trial judge nor any of the judges in the court of appeal found that there was such discrimination and, on the facts as I understand them, I think the finding on this point was right. I agree that so far as the statute which was in force at the time of the carriage of the lumber in question was concerned, that is, for the last two years of the contract, it should be held applicable to such carriage, notwithstanding the lumber was carried under a contract entered into before the statute came into force. I see no ground for holding the statute inapplicable to such carriage of goods. The language of the statute is clear and definite and embracing, and covers the carriage of all goods after the statute came into force, whether carried by virtue of a previous contract or not. I agree that no tolls having been approved of by the proper authorities after the coming into force of the Act of 1906 none could, in consequence of the prohibitive provisions of section 6608 (R.S.Q., 1909,) be charged by the company for the carriage of goods on its railway. That section also prohibits the charging of any money for any services as a common carrier except under its provisions.\nThe result was that, in consequence of the legislature having omitted to insert in the Act any provision such as that in the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d\u2014 enabling the company to continue charging the old tolls, or reasonable tolls, until a tariff of tolls under the new Act was approved by the Railway Committee, the company could not legally charge any tolls or money by way of a quantum meruit for the carriage of goods or freight until such tariff of tolls Was approved.\nBut this extraordinary condition of matters did not prevent parties who had goods carried by the railway from voluntarily paying the company fair and reasonable freight for the goods carried. As a matter of common honesty they would do so. And so, in the case under consideration, the respondent continued voluntarily to pay under the contract and agreement he had previously entered into with the company certain agreed freight charges.\nBut these voluntary payments were made on the clear understanding that the rebate claimed in this action should, on the adjustment of the accounts at the end of the year, be returned to the plaintiff, respondent, as provided for in their agreement. As a matter of fact this rebate was credited to him in the company\u2019s books and had been paid in each of the previous three years. So long as this agreed rebate did not constitute discrimination within the meaning of the statute there was nothing illegal in it and, as I have said, all the judges below have held, and I agree with them, that it did not constitute discrimination under the circumstances as proved.\nIt would be against all equity and good conscience to permit the company to receive this voluntary payment made by the plaintiff, respondent, for the carriage of his lumber, a payment made and received conditionally on the understanding and agreement that a specified rebate should be made when the accounts were adjusted, and then lend the aid of the courts to the company in their repudiation of the terms of the agreement under which they received the money and had contracted to make the rebate.\nIf, as I say, the rebate agreed to be made constituted discrimination and violated the statute in force at the time, that would be quite another matter. As it did not, then I think the defence which is purely technical and has no merits whatever fails and the appeal should be dismissed with costs. fixed pursuant to a statute then in force) which respondent had induced appellant\u2019s manager to agree to for a term of five years and which he got until the law was changed.\nSuch arrangements have always been looked upon with suspicion, and the fact that these parties did not put this one in their contract but in a side-arrangement evidenced by a letter shews that they were quite aware of this suspicion and conscious that the law which permitted it, if it did permit it which I much doubt, was unlikely to continue in face of the rising tide of public opinion against it.\nThe Act was changed. I see no reason for the amendment made unless it was to cure this evil. I am, therefore, prepared \u201cto suppress the mischief and advance the remedy\u201d by holding that the moment this amendment now in question became law it became impossible for the appellant legally to continue paying the rebates.\nSometimes the purpose of a statute has been such that it has not been permitted to have retrospective effect in its bearing upon contracts.\nThis statute as amended was intended to be operative without any exception or reservation and to destroy an abuse of which the facts in evidence herein present one of the typical forms.\nHence, there is no room for any such implication as has been sometimes imported by interpretation to save retrospective effects.\nThe formation of the contract alleged in this case was such, and its legality of such dubious character, that such implications might have been difficult, even if the statute had been less express than I read it.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the trial judge\u2019s order of dismissal restored. Duff J.\u2014I concur in dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion the railway company\u2019s undertaking to give the respondent a rebate of $1 a car upon his shipments was an alteration of its duly sanctioned existing tariff of tolls which it was not within its power to effect without the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, which was not obtained.\nUnder the statute of 1888, the company was prohibited from levying or taking any tolls not approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; (sec. 9, art. 5172, R.S.Q.). Tolls could be reduced only by a bylaw so approved (sec. 6); and a by-law altering tolls had no force until so approved (sec. 12). If the case were governed by this legislation I doubt whether the respondent could justify the bargain made with him by the company.\nBut, during the last two years of the term of the contract\u2014 and it is in respect of them that this action was brought\u2014 certain amendments to the statute of 1888, passed in 1906, were in force. In my opinion the legality of the contract\u2014 or rather the right of the parties to claim the benefit of its terms in respect of freight carried after the legislation of 1906 came into force\u2014must be determined by it. What it prohibited and declared to be illegal cannot be enforced merely because it had been provided for by a private agreement made before the statute was passed.\nWhere an Act of Parliament compels a breach of a private contract the contract is impliedly repealed by the Act, so far as the latter extends; or the breach is excused or is considered as not falling within the contract. The intervention of the legislature, in altering the situation of the contracting parties, is analogous to a convulsion of nature against which they, no doubt, may provide; but, if they have not provided, it is generally to be considered as excepted out of the contract. Maxwell on Statutes (12 ed.), p. 632, and cases there cited: West v. Gwynne[3].\nIt is, I think, abundantly clear that such an agreement as that sued upon in this action is forbidden by article 6608, R.S.Q., 1909, enacted by the legislation of 1906. The company is prohibited from charging or collecting tolls not authorized by a by-law duly approved (sec. 1). It is required always to exact the same tolls under circumstances and conditions substantially similar; and any reduction in favour of any person, whether made directly or indirectly, in tolls authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council is forbidden (sec. 2). Alterations in tolls can be made only by by-law sanctioned by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council (art. 6622). The agreement under which the rebate is claimed by the plaintiff in this action was an indirect, if not a direct, alteration in his favour of tolls which had been duly sanctioned. Not having been provided for by a by-law approved by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council it is not binding. Indeed, it cannot be carried out by the company without violating the law.\nWhatever may be thought of the propriety of the appellants\u2019 attitude in this action from an ethical point of view, courts of law are obliged upon grounds of public policy to refuse their aid to the enforcement of contracts which the legislature has forbidden. Mr. Justice Cross would support the agreement on the ground that what the statute forbids is not a nominal but a real reduction in approved tariff rates, and he says that, taking into account the stipulations in favour of the company to which the plaintiff submitted, it has not been proved that the rates charged to the plaintiff were, in money\u2019s worth, different from the tariff rates.\nThe learned judge assumes that the burden of proving that there was such a difference rested on the company. With deference, I cannot assent to that view.\nThe agreement relied on by the plaintiff shewed, on its mere production, & prim\u00e2 facie special reduction in his favour forbidden by the statute. It was, certainly, for him to prove, if that would afford an answer to the defence of illegality, that other considerations to be given by him to the company under the contract equalled \u201cin money\u2019s worth\u201d the reduction in rates which he obtained. That he has not attempted to do and the judgment of the learned trial judge is, at least impliedly, adverse to his contention on this question of fact.\nFor these reasons I would, with respect, allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBrodeur J.\u2014 L\u2019intim\u00e9 a poursuivi l\u2019appelante pour r\u00e9clamer une remise (rebate) d\u2019une piastre par char qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait emgag\u00e9e de lui payer par un contrat du 26 ao\u00fbt, 1903. Ce contrat \u00e9tait pour l\u2019espace de cinq ans et devait se terminer en novembre, 1908. Pendant trois ans la compagnie paya cette remise mais elle n\u00e9gligea de payer pour les deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es quoiqu\u2019elle donn\u00e2t cr\u00e9dit au demandeur dans ses livres. Vers ce temps-l\u00e0 la compagnie passa sous le contr\u00f4le de nouveaux administrateurs qui r\u00e9pudi\u00e8rent le contrat et refus\u00e8rent de payer.\nLa compagnie pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas tenue de remplir son contrat pour trois raisons:\u2014 1. Parce que la remise constitue un avantage ou un privil\u00e8ge injuste;\n2. Parce que la stipulation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec l\u2019autorisation des actionnaires de la compagnie et des autorit\u00e9s publiques;\n3. Parce que Kennedy n\u2019a pas rempli lui-m\u00eame ses obligations en ne faisant pas transporter par l\u2019appelants la quantit\u00e9 de marchandizes qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 de faire.\nI.\nSur la premi\u00e8re objection je vois que le juge instructeur et tous les juges de la cour d\u2019appel sont unanimes \u00e0 dire que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas qu\u2019il y ait eu avantage injuste. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que d\u2019autres exp\u00e9diteurs avaient, comme Kennedy, des tarifs sp\u00e9ciaux, mais que ces taux ne diff\u00e9raient pas mat\u00e9riellement de ceux qu\u2019il avait alors. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par le juge instructeur\nque les taux accord\u00e9s \u00e0 Kennedy ne constituent pas un avantage ni un monopole injuste envers les autres commer\u00e7ants.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 une question de fait que de savoir s\u2019il y avait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou avantage injuste et du moment que les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs sont unanimes il n\u2019y a pas de raison d\u2019intervenir. Voir Paquet v. Dufour[4].\nCette premi\u00e8re objection doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\nII.\nLa loi \u00e9dict\u00e9 que les compagnies de chemin de fer doivent faire approuver leurs taux avant de pouvoir en r\u00e9clamer le montant. Art. 5172, par 9, S.R.Q., 1888, maintenant 6620 S.R.Q., 1909. La section 6623 S.R.Q. de 1909, d\u00e9clare que si la compagnie fait un contrat ill\u00e9gal ou viole les dispositions de la loi ou omet d\u2019accomplir quelques dispositions de la loi quant aux taux, elle est passible d\u2019une amende de $1,000.\nDans le cas actuel le compagnie avait un tarif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement approuv\u00e9 en 1902. Elle juge \u00e0 propos, en 1903, de diminuer ce tarif. Elle avait parfaitement le droit de le faire; elle aurait d\u00fb cependant faire approuver cette r\u00e9duction; mais elle a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de le faire. Elle fait tout de m\u00eame un contrat avec Kennedy par lequel il s\u2019engage de lui donner tout son transport pourvu qu\u2019il jouisse de cette r\u00e9duction de fret. La compagnie n\u00e9glige de faire approuver cette r\u00e9duction dans ses taux et maintenant quand le demandeur, intim\u00e9, demand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ex\u00e9cute son obligation et qu\u2019elle lui rembourse la remise stipul\u00e9e elle se pr\u00e9vaut de sa propre inaction et de sa propre n\u00e9gligence et demande \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de son obligation. C\u2019est une proposition injuste que les tribunaux ne sauraient sanctionner.\nL\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue aussi que la r\u00e9duction n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la compagnie elle-m\u00eame, mais que le contrat n\u2019est que l\u2019\u0153uvre des directeurs.\nLorsque les directeurs d\u2019une compagnie agissent en son nom dans les limites de ses pouvoirs ils sont cens\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoriz\u00e9s. Lindley, Law of Companies, p. 219, dit:\u2014\nIt may be taken as now settled that persons dealing with directors bon\u00e2 fide and without notice of an irregular or improper exercise of their powers are not affected by such irregularity or impropriety.\nIII.\nL\u2019appellante pr\u00e9tend en troisi\u00e8me lieu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 sa part d\u2019obligation en ne faisant pas transporter 3,500 chars de bois par ann\u00e9e.\nNaturellement si l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 cela il y aurait lieu de donner raison \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Mais la correspondance qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite nous r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la compagnie a voulu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019engage\u00e2t ferme de lui faire transporter 3,500 chars et il a positivement refus\u00e9 de contracter une telle obligation. Ce troisi\u00e8me point est donc mal fond\u00e9.\nSur le tout je suis d\u2019opinion de renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschereau, Roy, Canon, Parent & Fitzpatrick.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thompson.\n[1] Q.R. 21 K.B. 85.\n[2] Q.R. 39 S.C. 344.\n[3] (1911) 2 Ch. 1.\n[4] 39 Can.

The following questions were reserved by the trial judge for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.\n\u201cWas I right in holding that there was sufficient corroborative evidence to warrant a conviction?\n\u201cThe defendant was sworn by holding up his right hand without being asked whether he had any objection to being sworn in the regular way.\n\u201cIt was objected that the accused was never sworn, and that he could not be convicted of perjury on evidence so given. \u201cWas I right in holding that he could be convicted on the evidence so given?\u201d\nThe judges of the Court of Appeal were unanimous in answering the first question in the affirmative and it is, therefore, not before the Court on this appeal. On the second question they were equally divided.\nMaddin for the appellant.\nJenks K.C., Deputy Attorney-General, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting as a court for Crown cases reserved.\nThe appellant was convicted of perjury by the judge of the County Court District No. 7.\nThese two questions were reserved for the opinion of the Supreme Court en banc:\u2014\n1. In the circumstances in the reserved case was the trial judge right in holding that there was sufficient corroborative evidence to warrant a conviction?\n2. The defendant having been sworn by holding up his right hand without being asked whether he bad any objection to being sworn in the regular way, was the judge right in holding that he could be convicted on evidence so given?\nThe Supreme Court held unanimously that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, and this appeal is, therefore, limited to the second question as to which the judges of that court were equally divided.\nIt is admitted that the accused appeared as a witness in a proceeding before a competent tribunal and being questioned with respect to a matter material in that proceeding made as part of his evidence an assertion of fact which, for the purpose of this appeal, it must be assumed he then knew to be false. The defence is that at the request of the commissioner the accused took his oath in the more ancient of the two forms known in modern proceedings, \u201cthe adjuratory invocation of the Deity with uplifted hand commonly called the Scotch oath,\u201d no attempt having been previously made to ascertain whether he had any objection to taking the oath in the comparatively modern form by kissing the book. And it is argued that in consequence the false assertion which is the foundation of the charge of perjury was not made upon oath. This defence is apparently based on the assumption that the acknowledged form of oath is that which is administered by kissing the book, and that the oath in the Scotch form can only be taken in exceptional cases, as it were, upon cause shewn.\nWith all deference I cannot see the force of this objection. Both forms are recognized and used in the provincial courts at the option of the witness. In this case, the investigating commissioner asked the accused to raise his hand, which he did without protest, and then repeated to him these words:\u2014\nThe evidence you will give in this inquiry will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God,\nafter which he proceeded to give his evidence. If he did not, in these circumstances take an oath, that is, call God to witness the truth of what he was about to testify to, I am at a loss to understand what these words mean. Having taken the oath in that form without objection, it is an admission that the witness regarded it as binding on his conscience, and that is the object for which the oath was used both in ancient and modern times[2]. To hold otherwise would be to put a premium upon perjury, and as those who take part in the administration of justice are painfully aware, a great amount of false wearing is allowed to go unpunished.\nIt is now admitted to be the absolute right of every person in the English courts to be sworn for every purpose in Scotch form without the use of any book and without any question being asked. It may be open to question whether it is not better as a matter of public policy for our courts and other persons administering oaths to adhere to the time-honoured custom of swearing witnesses upon the Bible or Testament in all cases except those where the witness or party claims to have conscientious objections to swearing in that mode or form.\nBut we think, however that may be, that where no such objection is raised and the oath is taken voluntarily by a person with uplifted hand and calling God to witness the truth of his evidence or statements, it would be alike a mocking of justice and a disregard of the common law as we understand it to allow such a person on an indictment for perjury to escape on the sole ground that he took the oath without being sworn on the Bible or New Testament.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. No costs.\nDavies, Duff and JJ. concurred.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant having been convicted of perjury, two questions were reserved for the Court of Appeal. Of these one having been disposed of unanimously by that court against the contention of appellant, he can only appeal here in respect of the other regarding which that court was divided. That question brought thus before us is stated as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant was sworn by holding up his right hand without being asked whether he had any objection to being sworn in the regular way.\nIt was objected that the accused was never sworn, and that he could not be convicted of perjury on evidence so given.\nWas I right in holding that he could be convicted on the evidence so given?\nThe proceeding out of which the charge arises was an inquiry by a commissioner under and pursuant to chapter 104 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, wherein it admittedly was within the power and duty of the commissioner by virtue of section 4 of the said Act \u201cto require witnesses to give evidence on oath or on solemn affirmation if they are persons entitled to affirm in civil matters.\u201d\nThe commissioner testified at the trial of the appellant, amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\nQ. Was the evidence given under oath? A. I think under oath, although some little question with regard to that has been raised. There was no copy of the Bible used. In a few oases where the copy of the Scripture was not readily available I called the witness to hold up his right hand and went through the formula with the man. It was done in this case.\nQ. Tell what was done? A. I called the witness to raise his right hand and I put this formula to him: \u201cThe evidence you will give in this inquiry will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help your God?\u201d\nQ. And did he raise his right hand? A. He raised his right hand.\nBy the court.\nQ. I suppose, Mr. Duchemin, you determined yourself the manner in which you would swear him? A. Yes, I did not ask any questions.\nThe contention is that appellant so sworn and giving the evidence in respect whereof he has been convicted of perjury, never in law was sworn because the oath was not accompanied by his kissing the Bible or being examined by the commissioner as to his religious belief entitling him to be sworn in the form adopted.\nThe crime of perjury of which he has been convicted and the circumstances under which a person may be convicted thereof, are defined by section 170 and subsequent sections of the Criminal Code:\u2014\nSection 170. Perjury is an assertion * * * made by a witness * * * as part of his evidence upon oath or affirmation * * * such assertion being known to such witness to be false and being intended by him to mislead * * * the person holding the proceedings.\nAnd inasmuch as the appellant in this case signed the evidence when read over to him, I think section 172 may also cover this case. It is as follows:\u2014\n172. Every one is guilty of perjury who\u2014\n(a) having taken or made any oath, affirmation, solemn declaration or affidavit where, by any Act or law in force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or permitted that facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or ascertained by or upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to any such fact, matter or thing.\nWhen we are asked as herein to discard the fundamental principle of giving effect to statutes and to fritter away the plain ordinary meaning of the language used in this one, it is somewhat difficult to treat such a contention seriously.\nThe form now in question herein of \u201ctaking or making the oath\u201d is in law and in fact much older than the usual one of kissing the Bible, much older even than the common law, yet recognized by the common law.\nThis statute was so framed, I think in 1868, as to end, if possible, every frivolous attempt of the perjurer to escape, by way of technicalities and needless subtleties, from the consequences of his misconduct. It was amended by the Criminal Code so as to render it yet more comprehensive and plain.\nIt seems to me to subserve the purposes for which it was enacted and to fit well the case now presented to us.\nThe appellant took or made an oath and by virtue thereof was permitted to testify and if he wilfully and corruptly testified to that which was false, the plain purpose of the enactment is that he should suffer the punishment it awards.\nIt is entirely beside the question to cite cases where in the course of administering justice, men have been found to have taken oaths whereby their impiety or ill instructed consciences might permit them to make a secret mockery of justice, and might lead to their injuring others by speaking falsely; and hence out of regard to the rights of those so injured, the evidence so given has been set aside or treated as null.\nWe are not dealing here with such a question, but with the law which makes such men in any event liable to the punishments the law has provided for the misconduct involved not only in so trifling with the court and the rights of others, but also in so doing, speaking wilfully and corruptly that which was false. In the other case what had been said might have been absolutely true, but had to be treated as non-effective for want of the form of the sanctions the law looked upon as security for truth.\nIt is, I respectfully submit, a mere confusion of thought thus to mix these entirely different things and their consequences.\nAnother confusion of thought is that involved in the argument that is sought to be derived from the modifications of the law which debarred many from testifying in the only form which their consciences permitted them to adopt.\nThe old law debarred such persons often from testifying at all.\nThe law also debarred suitors from putting forward and using such witnesses or others not bound by any oath.\nBut the law in the most barbarous state in which it ever was, never excused him, who despite his incapacity to comply with the law, had taken a form of oath that the court had administered to him, from the consequences of his having wilfully and corruptly violated the pledges he had in any accepted form given the court.\nThe argument founded upon the 16th section of the Criminal Code has, if possible, still less to commend it.\nThere never was in the common law anything to justify or excuse any man for violating so plain a statute as this now in question.\nIt is extremely desirable that men appearing as witnesses in our courts and in such capacity taking any form of oath or making any affirmation, should understand they are, when wilfully and corruptly speaking falsely under any such circumstances, liable to be convicted of perjury, whatever may be their peculiar religious, mental or moral conceptions of the binding effect of the form of oath or affirmation.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The question for determination in this case is whether the defendant took an oath which renders him liable to the penalties of perjury for false testimony given under it. The commissioner before whom the oath was taken was authorized to administer it. Because a copy of the Holy Scriptures was not at hand he administered the oath in what is usually known as the Scotch form\u2014that is, the deponent with uplifted hand called upon Almighty God to witness that he would speak the truth. He was not asked whether he had any conscientious objection to taking the oath in the manner customary at the present day in English courts, nor did he explicitly state that the oath in the form in which he took it was recognized by him as binding upon his conscience.\nProm the short review of forms of oaths in the Encyclop\u00e6dia of the Laws of England, vol. 10, page 103, it would appear that at common law the touching or kissing of the Bible or Testament is not essential to the taking of an oath. In the leading case of Attorney-General v. Bradlaugh[3], where various questions respecting oaths, their binding effect and their forms were carefully considered, Lord Justice Cotton, quoting a passage from the judgment of Martin B., in Miller v. Salomons[4], at page 515, says that that learned judge, after referring to Omychund v. Barker[5] as correctly stating the law, proceeds thus:\u2014\nThe doctrine laid down by the Lord Chancellor and all the other judges was that the essence of an oath was an appeal to a Supreme Being in whose existence the person taking the oath believed, and whom he also believed to be a rewarder of truth and an avenger of falsehood, and that the form of taking an oath was a mere outward act not essential to the oath.\nThe Lord Justice adds:\u2014\nI read that because it shews how, down to the latest times, what was laid-down in Omychund v. Barker5 has been recognized, as we recognize it, as correctly stating what the Law of England is as regards taking an oath. In the same case (at p. 701) Brett M.R. says:\u2014\nIf a person who could take an oath, * * * nevertheless took it in a manner which disregarded the due solemnities of the mode of taking an oath which are appointed in this Act of Parliament, or, if he took the oath, and did not, within the meaning of this Act of Parliament, subscribe the oath; * * * on reflection, I am of opinion that he would be liable to the penalty.\nThe defendant in the present case did that which constitutes \u201cthe essence of an oath\u201d\u2014he called upon Almighty God, in whose existence and divine attributes it is not suggested that he did not believe, to witness the truth of that which he was about to say.\nFor the defendant it is urged that with him rested the option of determining what form of oath he should take\u2014that, unless he elected not to take the oath in the form customary in the English courts and claimed the right to take it in the Scotch form, an oath in that form should not have been administered to him and would not render him liable to the penalty of perjury. If the assent of the witness to the administration of the oath in any form other than that which is customary in the English courts be requisite, I am of the opinion that by taking the oath in the form in which it was tendered to him, making no protest against it but proceeding to give his evidence with the knowledge that it would be accepted and acted upon as testimony given under oath, he sufficiently assented to the oath being administered in the form in which it was, and that he cannot, upon being afterwards charged with perjury, be heard to say that he was not sworn.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 47 N.S.

Rep. 184) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment entered by Morrison J. at the trial, on the verdict of the jury, in favour of the plaintiffs for $5,000 damages and costs.\nThe principal question, on the evidence at the trial, was as to the identification of the defendant's motor-car by which, it was alleged, the deceased, the husband of the plaintiff, Alice Longman, and the father of the infant plaintiffs, had been killed on account of the defendant's negligent driving. The accident happened while deceased was at work on a highway bridge at night and employed there by the Corporation of the City of Vancouver. When submitting the case to the jury the learned trial judge did not address them upon the question of negligence. He said: \"I purposely avoided it because it seems to me that this is entirely a question of identification of that car, and, if you are not satisfied that it was Cottingham's car, of course, there was no possibility of his doing this. There were other cars about that time, and it is for you to say, within what periods, and the situation on the bridge, not ignoring the other circumstances on the bridge of that four-horse rig. If you believe the evidence, then see what you can make of it.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs and awarded them $5,000 damages\u2014$3,000 for the widow and the balance divided among the children. The judgment entered upon this verdict was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nGeorge E. McCrossan for the respondents.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the appellant and without calling upon the respondents for any argument, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014To establish liability it is not necessary, in an action of damages for tort, that there should be an eye-witness to the accident. A series of facts may be proved in evidence from which the jury may reach a conclusion, as to the cause of the mishap, in some respects more satisfactory than if they were obliged to depend upon the deposition of an eye-witness. It has so frequently been held here that one must almost apologize for repeating it, that the function of an appellate court is to consider in each case whether there was evidence before the jury from which they could reasonably draw the conclusion at which they arrived.\nHere the finding of the jury has the approval of the provincial Court of Appeal as well as of the trial judge.\nNothing was said here, nor can I see anything in the factum which would justify us in reversing.\nHaving regard to the principle which I have just stated, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nThere is a fallacy in the argument presented on behalf of the appellant which resides in the proposition stated by his counsel almost in so many words that in a civil action complaining of a tort it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to demonstrate the culpability of the defendant. It ought not to be necessary to controvert so obvious an error. But although seldom put forward in a form so unqualified, this proposition has unquestionably often enough in the past been the tacit assumption upon which the defence in such cases as this has been based and, sometimes, it is to be feared that it has formed the real basis of judicial pronouncements in such actions. The subject of the nature of proof upon which a jury is entitled to act in civil cases was fully discussed in some recent judgments (see Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Griffiths[2], and Jones v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[3], but, notwithstanding these judgments, the error will doubtless survive. The burden resting upon the plaintiff is, of course, to establish facts from which the jury may reasonably draw the inferences necessary to sustain the plaintiff's case. In this case the plaintiffs unquestionably acquitted themselves of this onus.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The only question upon this appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence to enable the jury to infer (otherwise than by a mere guess or conjecture) that it was the defendant's automobile which killed the husband and father of the plaintiffs. In my opinion there was.\nThe appeal, therefore, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion to dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCrossan & Harper.\n[1] 18 B.C.

The application was accepted and a policy issued by him apportioning the insurance upon the three classes of property separately. A loss having occurred, payment was refused on the grounds that the stock was over-valued and the premises improperly described as a dwelling-house whereas, in fact, it was also used as a lodging-house. At the trial it appeared that a portion of the premises was fitted up for lodgers; the plaintiffs testified that. F. inspected the premises before the policy was issued and that they had made no apportionment of the insurance, but left the matter altogether in the hands of F. F. testified that he sent an agent to have the application signed and the apportionment made and that he filled in the figures upon the blanks in the application from the agent's report. The jury found that F. inserted the description of the premises and apportioned the insurance.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (17 B.C. Rep. 517) that the company was affected by F.'s knowledge of the premises and of the property insured; that the questions as to who had made the apportionment was properly left to the jury; that the evidence justified the jury in finding that it had been made by F., and that the insured, therefore, had made no valuation as to the stock or the apportionment thereof and could not have misrepresented its value.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies and Duff JJ.\u2014That the evidence justified the jury in finding that F. had described the premises as a dwelling-house and that the company was bound by his act in doing so.\nPer Davies and Duff.JJ.\u2014A dwelling-house does not lose its character as such from the fact that it is occupied by one or more lodgers.\nHeld, per Duff J.\u2014As, under the conditions of the policy in question, notwithstanding an over-valuation the company would still be liable for a certain proportion of the actual value of the property insured, the policy should not be avoided.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], whereby the judgment entered by Murphy J. at the trial, stood affirmed on an equal division of opinion among the judges in the Court of Appeal.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions in issue on the present appeal are fully referred to in the judgments now reported. At the trial the jury answered the questions submitted to them favourably to the plaintiff and found a verdict in her favour for $940.05. After hearing arguments on objections taken on behalf of the defendants, and upon a motion for the dismissal of the action, the learned trial judge reserved judgment and, subsequently, dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs; his judgment granting a nonsuit is reported at pages 517-519 of the report of the judgment rendered in the court below. On an appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia their Lordships the Chief Justice of British Columbia and Mr. Justice Martin considered that the judgment of the trial judge should be reversed and their Lordships Justices Irving and Galliher were of opinion that the judgment then under appeal should be affirmed. On this division of opinion the judgment of the learned trial judge stood affirmed, and the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. McDonald Mowat for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action on a policy of fire insurance covering certain stock and merchandise, household furniture, etc. There were several defences, but those chiefly relied upon in the Court of Appeal and here have reference to (1) over-valuation, and (2) misrepresentation of the uses to which the premises, in which the property insured was at the time of the application, were put. As to this latter objection I agree with Mr. Justice Duff that the knowledge of the agent was the knowledge of the company; Holdsworth v. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Insurance Co.[2] and the cases there cited.\nThe over-valuation is complained of only with reference to the distribution of the total amount of the insurance over the different classes of property covered by the policy. It is alleged that the insured did not have in hand a stock of merchandise to the value represented. It is not contended that the total value of all the property covered by the risk was misrepresented.\nThe circumstances of the case are quite exceptional. The company is incorporated in the Province of Alberta. The agent, Freeze, who issued the policy, was the manager in the Province of British Columbia, and he had authority to accept risks and to issue policies without consulting the head-office. To the application, which was admittedly signed in blank by the insured to the knowledge of Freeze, the latter attached a certificate intended for the private information of the head-office to the effect that he, the agent and manager of the company, had personally inspected the risk and, after having done so, fixed the cash value of the property insured at the amount of $3,000. The total amount of the insurance applied for was $2,100. It must be accepted as admitted also that the application was signed in blank by the insured to the knowledge of Freeze and that the total amount of the insurance asked for was distributed over the different classes of goods insured in the office of the agent by one of his two employees, his brother or one Howden, presumably on knowledge acquired when the latter visited the premises to get the insurance at the request of Freeze. The insured were foreigners with a limited knowledge of the English language. They say that they went to the office of the agent and that the amount of the insurance was there apportioned without reference to them. How that apportionment was really made does not appear, as neither Howden nor the agent's brother was examined, and an inspection of the document does not tend in any way to clear up this point. It is filled up in lead pencil and the figures which purport to represent the value of the different classes of goods insured appear to have been altered at least twice, if not oftener. As this document has been in the possession of the company ever since it was first filled up and it is now produced and relied upon to defeat this claim, it was incumbent on them to give some explanation of the circumstances under which the figures were altered. In the absence of such evidence I am disposed to believe the plaintiff and her husband, and I am quite satisfied that, on the facts as they state them to have occurred, it would be impossible to hold that Freeze or either one of his two employees acted with respect to the application as the agent of the insured or that there is evidence of misrepresentation by them with respect to the value of the property.\nThe policy provides that the application contains a just and true statement of all the facts, condition, value and risk of the property insured, and that if, in case of loss, the property is found by appraisement or otherwise to have been over-valued, the company shall only be liable, in the absence of fraud, for such proportion of the actual value as the amount insured bears to the value given, not exceeding three-fourths of the allowed cash value.\nThere is no suggestion of fraud here. On the contrary, at the argument, this was entirely repudiated. The only evidence of over-valuation must be extracted from the statement of the appraiser, Rankin, who says that, when he visited the premises after the fire, he came to the conclusion that goods to the value mentioned in the application could not be put into the premises. The jury refused to accept this evidence and I entirely agree in their conclusion.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014In this case the trial judge, on a motion for a nonsuit, reserved the points on which the motion was based, and submitted a number of questions to the jury. The learned judge, afterwards, pursuant to leave reserved, dismissed the action and this judgment was, on appeal, to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, sustained on an equal division of opinion in that court.\nThe grounds on which the learned trial judge dismissed the action were that the premises could not reasonably be regarded as a \"dwelling-house and store\" because the occupiers took in boarders, and the house was a crowded lodging-house, and that there was an over-valuation of the stock of merchandise on the premises. The two judges of the Court of Appeal who sustained the judgment dismissing the action did so on the ground of over-valuation of the stock of merchandise only.\nWith regard to the alleged misdescription of the premises as a dwelling-house, I am not able to concur in the holding that the presence of \"lodgers,\" one or more, on the premises proves that the designation of dwelling-house was such a misdescription as vitiated the policy. A dwelling-house does not cease to be such simply because one or more lodgers are taken in by the occupants and, if the facts as found by the jury on ample evidence of the knowledge on the agent's part of the presence in the house of these lodgers or \"roomers\" at the time the policy was taken out, is considered, this objection must fail.\nThe substantial objection was as to the alleged over-valuation of the groceries in the shop. It is not contended that the total amount insured under the policy on the fixtures, furniture and groceries was an over-valuation, but that the \"apportionment\" of that amount was excessive as regards the stock of groceries.\nThe plaintiff contends that she did not make any valuation of the groceries, but left that expressly to the agent to do and that she did not herself know anything about it or that, in fact, there had been any specific apportionment of the insurance. The jury find that Freeze, the agent, made the apportionment himself, and I think there is ample evidence to sustain that finding. Indeed, it seems to me, although Freeze's evidence is somewhat contradictory and hard to reconcile, that, when the application was signed by Mahomed, at her residence, in the presence of one Howden, who had been sent by Freeze to obtain Mahomed's signature, no apportionment of the amount had been made. That was done subsequently by Freeze in his own office after the application had been signed and brought back to him by his clerk, Howden, and was done by Howden and Freeze themselves. In this view, there was no misrepresentation of values on the part of the applicant at all.\nThe question, therefore, whether Mahomed made or as a fact assisted, in the valuation of the groceries was not one which should have been withdrawn from the jury. Accepting the finding of the jury on this point as justified by the evidence, I am unable to see how the plaintiff can be held guilty of misrepresentation or over-valuation. If she is to be believed, and the jury had a right to believe her and did so, she neither as a fact valued the groceries or, in any way, misrepresented their value. She left that question to the company and their agent apportioned the insurance as he thought best. I do not think that the evidence warrants the conclusion that it was Howden who made the valuation at Mahomed's request. The valuation and apportionment was made and inserted in the application in Freeze's office after the application had been signed and when the applicant was not present. Possibly, Freeze was influenced in making it by the information he received from the clerk, Howden. The latter person was not examined at the trial. Bearing in mind the fact that Freeze was the general agent of the company in and for the Province of British Columbia, and had authority to accept risks and issue policies without consulting the head-office of the company, I have, after reading the evidence, concluded that the submission of the question to the jury, whether Freeze or the plaintiff made the valuation of the groceries complained of, was a proper submission to them. On their finding on this point, which I think there is ample evidence to support, I cannot conclude that the plea of over-valuation or misrepresentation by the plaintiff has been sustained.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment to be entered for the amount claimed, namely, $940.05.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014On the findings of the jury, founded upon evidence which we cannot discard, judgment should have been entered for the plaintiff.\nThe local manager of the respondents did not stand, in this case, on the same footing, in relation to them and the duties to be discharged, as a mere soliciting agent. For our present consideration and purposes, he rather represented the company in the business of settling the contract and signing and issuing the policy, just as the Board of Directors might have stood in relation thereto.\nThe company cannot, therefore, be heard to say that it was either defrauded or warranted against what its manager obviously knew.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout. DUFF J.\u2014There was evidence from which the jury might properly infer, first, that it was the duty of Freeze, as general manager of the company for Vancouver, to inform himself of the value of the property to which the appellant's application related, and, generally, of the nature of the risk, before forwarding the application to the company. Secondly, that the valuation and the apportionment, as they appeared in the application, were, in fact, made either by Freeze himself or by the employees of the company acting under his direction and with his knowledge and sanction. In these circumstances, the defences relied upon by the company disappear.\nFirst, as to the description of the risk. It is impossible, in my judgment, to contend that the word \"dwelling-house\" in its primary meaning necessarily bears a signification which would exclude from the objects denoted by it a \"lodging-house\" of such a character as the appellant's was and, according to the finding of the jury, Freeze knew or ought to have known it to be. That being so, it is our duty to construe the description of the risk in the light of the facts known to Freeze, or, in other words, known to the company: viz., that the property described as a \"dwelling-house\". was a \"lodging-house\" of that character. Bawden v. London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Insurance Co.[3]. And, so construing it, there is, of course, no misdescription of which the respondents are entitled to complain.\nSecondly, as to the alleged over-valuation: the fact being once established that the valuation and apportionment were made by the company, through their general manager at Vancouver, we are entitled, on the authority of the Bawden Case[4] to read the application as if that fact were stated in it. The application contains this passage:\u2014\nIn case of loss, if the property insured is found by appraisement or otherwise to have been over-valued in the survey and description on which the policy is founded, the company shall only be liable, in the absence of fraud, for such proportion of the actual value as the amount insured bears to the value given in such survey or description, not exceeding three-fourths of the allowed cash value at the time of the fire.\nReading this passage, together with such a recital, it appears to me to be impossible to contend that the over-valuation, if there* were any, would have the effect of nullifying the policy.\nI have not examined with care the evidence relating to the value of the property insured, and I desire to express no opinion upon it.\nANGLIN J.\u2014There was evidence upon which a jury might properly find that there had been no misrepresentation by or on behalf of the plaintiff of the value of her stock of meat and groceries.\nIn regard to the misdescription of the premises relied upon by the defendants, assuming it to be such, if it has been sufficiently shewn to have been material (which I doubt), it has been found by the jury that it was known, or should have been known to the defendant company through their agent, Freeze, who inspected the premises for them.\nI agree with Macdonald C.J. and Martin J.A. that there was a proper case for submission to the jury; that there is evidence to support its findings; and that, on them, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the amount of her claim with costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Craig, Bourne & McDonald.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Russell, Russell & Hancox.\n[1] 17 B.C.

The engine driver saw H., at a distance of about 500 feet and whistled several times. H. paid no attention to the danger signals and continued walking in an oblique direction towards the track, and, observing his apparent intention to cross the track and his disregard of the signals, the engine driver then applied the emergency brakes which failed to stop the train in time to avoid the accident by which H. was killed. In an action for damages by his widow and child,\nHeld, that, notwithstanding the fact that deceased was a trespasser and committing a breach of section 408 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, the company was liable because their engine driver neglected to apply the emergency brakes at the time he became aware of the danger of accident when he first noticed deceased attempting to cross the tracks.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which reversed the judgment of nonsuit entered by the trial judge and maintained the plaintiff's action with costs. The circumstances in which the accident, which caused the death of the plaintiff's husband are stated in the head-note.At the trial of the action the jury rendered a general verdict against the company and awarded $6,000 damages ($3,000 to the widow and $3,000 to her infant child. The trial judge then rendered judgment upon a motion for nonsuit which had been made before he allowed the case to go to the jury and dismissed the action on the ground that the only inference to be drawn from the evidence was that deceased had been killed in consequence of his own negligence and unlawful act in attempting to cross the tracks while the train was rapidly approaching and he was a trespasser upon the right-of-way. By the judgment now appealed from, this judgment was set aside and judgment was ordered to be entered in favour of the plaintiff in conformity with the verdict of the jury, on the ground that the company was chargeable with negligence which was the ultimate cause of the accident.\nHellmuth K.C. for the appellants admitted the original negligence of the company in running their train at excessive speed at the place where the accident occurred, but contended that the unlawful course of the deceased in attempting to cross the tracks in the face of the rapidly approaching train, while he was a trespasser there and committing a breach of section 406 of the \"Railway Act\" and also in disregarding the danger signals given by the engine driver, constituted the sole cause of the accident by which he was killed.\nD. G. Macdonell for the respondent was not called upon for any argument, and the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal was dismissed with costs after hearing counsel for the appellants. I have no doubt that whatever may be the negligence which is fairly attributable to the husband of the respondent, it was open to the jury, on the whole evidence, to find as they did that the determining cause of the accident was the failure on the part of the engine-driver to subsequently take the necessary steps to avoid the consequences of that negligence.\nDAVIES and IDINGTON JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed There was evidence from which the jury might conclude properly that the driver of the engine ought to have been aware that the victim of the accident was crossing the track while oblivious of the danger of doing so in time to have averted the accident by applying the emergency brake. In these circumstances, the negligence of the victim is immaterial because it was quite open to the jury to find that that negligence was not a proximate cause of the victim's death as that phrase has been construed and applied in such cases.\nANGLIN J. concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The jury having found that there was negligence on the part of the company appellant and there being in the case evidence that could justify such a verdict, it would be inadvisable for this court to allow this appeal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

VII. c. 32, s. 13.\nBy 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 13, amending section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d no railway train \u201cshall pass over a highway crossing at rail level in any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village at a greater speed than ten miles an hour\u201d unless such crossing is constructed and protected according to special orders and regulations of the Railway Committee or Board of Railway Commissioners or permission is given by the Board. In an action against a railway company for damages on account of injuries received through a train passing over such a crossing at a greater speed than ten miles an hour.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (29 Ont. L.R. 247), that the onus was on the company of proving that the conditions existed which, under the provisions of said section, exempted them from the necessity of limiting the speed of their train to ten miles an hour or that they had the permission of the Board to exceed that limit, and as they had not satisfied that onus the plaintiff\u2019s verdict should stand.\nSub-section 4, of sec. 13, prohibits trains running \u201cover any highway crossing\u201d at more than 10 miles an hour, if at such crossing an accident has happened subsequent to 1st January, 1900, \u201cby a moving train causing bodily injury,\u201d etc., \u201cunless and until\u201d it is protected to the satisfaction of the Board.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The appellant\u2019s action could also be maintained on the ground that the prohibition of sub-section 4 applies to the crossing in question.\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Co. v.

APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nThe facts of the case were not in dispute and are shewn by the above head-note.\nLaidlaw K.C. and E.H. Cleaver for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario ordering a new trial on the ground of misdirection. The main question at issue between the parties below was whether, in the circumstances of this case, sub-section 4 of section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d as now amended by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 13, made it incumbent upon the company to prove that they were exempt from the limitation as to speed which that section imposes. There was a difference of opinion in the lower court. The Chief Justice, dissenting, held that the onus was upon the company and that the appeal should be dismissed. In reaching the same conclusion, I prefer to rely on sub\u2011section 3 of the same section, which was also considered by the majority below. It appears to me after carefully reading the opinion of Mr. Justice Hodgins, that he failed to appreciate the precise point raised in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[2], by which he considered himself bound. In that case, it was held that so long as the railway fences on both sides of the track were maintained and turned in to the guard at the highway crossing, as provided by the Act, the maximum speed of the train was not limited to six miles an hour in passing through a thickly peopled portion of a city, town or village. There was no question raised as to the burden of proof; the railway fences were admitted to be properly constructed as required by the statute.\nAt the time of the accident here, the train was going at about forty miles an hour over a highway crossing at rail level in a thickly peopled portion of a town, and the jury found that the plaintiff when using the crossing was injured by the negligence of the defendants in running their train at that speed. There was no proof that the special requirements of the statute as to construction or permission of the Board had been complied with.\nThe question is, therefore: What is the rate of speed at which a train may pass over a highway crossing at rail level in a thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, in the absence of proof that the special requirements as to construction or permission of the Board provided by sub-section 3 of section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d have been complied with? That section reads:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of sub-section 4 of this section, no train shall pass over any highway crossing at rail level in any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, at greater speed than ten miles an hour, unless such crossing is constructed and thereafter maintained and protected in accordance with the orders, regulations and directions specially issued by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council or of the Board in force with respect to such crossing, or unless permission is given by some regulation or order of the Board. The Board may from time to time fix the speed in any case at any rate it deems proper.\nNothing can be plainer, it seems to me, than the object which Parliament had in view when that sub-section was introduced in amendment of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The history of the legislation and, what is more important, the language used, make it abundantly clear that the purpose was to provide for the greater security of those who are obliged to use the public highway under admittedly dangerous conditions. The sub-section is applicable to \u201chighway crossings at rail level in thickly settled districts\u201d and it provides that at such crossings the speed limit of a train shall not exceed ten miles an hour unless such crossings are constructed and maintained in accordance with the orders and regulations specially issued by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council or of the Board, or unless by special permission of the Board acting presumably with a proper regard for the public safety. The plain and obvious meaning of the section is that at such dangerous places the speed of the train must not exceed ten miles an hour, but that general prohibition is subject to this limitation that such speed may be exceeded by permission of the Board or if provision is otherwise made for the public safety by way of protection. That is to say, the words after \u201cunless\u201d are to be read as a proviso creating an exemption from the general prohibition contained in the first part of the section. If this is the proper construction of the language used, then it follows necessarily that where the statutory provision is departed from, the company must allege and prove by way of justification that they come within the exception (The King v. James[3]). This is made abundantly clear when sub-section 3 is read in conjunction with sub\u2011section 5. The latter fixes the time within which the provisions of sub-section 3 are to be complied with by the company. That is to say, to be exempt from the limitation as to speed the company must within a fixed time make the necessary application to the Board, and unless it is established that the application has been made and granted, the general prohibition governs if an accident occurs under the conditions present here.\nTo hold otherwise would, it seems to me, amount to saying that it was upon the plaintiff to prove in anticipation that the company had no defence under this head. It has been urged that this is merely a negative requirement, but assuming that to be the case, where is the difference between prescribing that a thing shall not be done unless certain precautions are taken as to construction and so forth, and in prescribing that, if that thing be done, the particular precautions shall be taken? This case comes, in my opinion, within the rule laid down in Britannic Merthyr Coal Co. v. David[4], followed in Watkins v. Naval Colliery Co.[5]\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the trial judge properly directed the jury in placing upon the defendants in this action the burden of proving that, in the circumstances, the rate of speed which admittedly exceeded ten miles an hour was not excessive, and that this appeal should be allowed with costs. It follows that the cross-appeal must be dismissed also with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Ontario directing a new trial of the action on the ground of misdirection by the trial judge on both branches of plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nThe plaintiff sued for injuries sustained by him from one of defendant\u2019s trains when passing over a highway crossing at rail level in a thickly populated district at a much higher rate of speed than the ten miles an hour, permitted by sub\u2011section 3 of section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d as amended by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32. A second branch of his case was a claim under sub-section 4 of the same Act for injuries caused by such excessive speed over a \u201chighway crossing\u201d at which \u201can accident had happened subsequent to the first day of January, 1900, by a moving train causing bodily injury or death to a person using such a crossing.\u201d\nThe appellate division held there was misdirection on both branches of appellant\u2019s claim. With respect to the claim under sub-section 4 based upon the happening of a previous accident at the highway crossing in question, I do not find it necessary to express any opinion, as I have reached the conclusion that there was no misdirection by the trial judge on the claim of the plaintiff under sub-section 3, and that the judgment of the trial court on that claim should be restored. I confess I am not quite clear as to the meaning of the judgment of Hodgins J. speaking for the appellate division upon this sub-section 3.\nThe learned judge says that the direction of the trial judge \u201cwas wrong in not qualifying the statement by the exception contained in section 275, that is as to protection and was not warranted by the \u201cRailway Act as interpreted by Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[6].\u201d\nThe judgment in that case was founded upon the admission that the fences of the railway on both sides of the track were maintained and turned into cattle guards at the highway crossing as provided by the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and was to the effect that under such conditions there was no limit placed by the Act upon the speed of the trains when crossing the highway. No question arose as to the onus of proof in that case. The fact of the existence of the fencing was admitted. So far from supporting the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hodgins, that decision in McKay\u2019s Case6 seems to me to be against the learned judge\u2019s conclusion.\nThe only question which appears to me to be open to any doubt with respect to this sub\u2011section 3 is as to which party the onus of proof lies upon. Is a complainant obliged to disprove the existence of the facts which would justify a higher rate of speed than ten miles an hour over level highway crossings in thickly populated districts, or does the onus lie upon the company of justifying a rate of speed in excess of the statutory limit?\nRead in connection with sub-section 5 of the same section 275 which extended the time \u201cto the company\u201d until the 1st of January, 1910, to comply with the provisions of sub-section 3, I cannot doubt that the onus of proof rests upon the company.\nThey must justify a rate of speed exceeding the statutory limit, and as they did not attempt to do so in this case, but admit a speed of 45 or 50 miles which the jury have found as the cause of the accident, and as I do not think the trial judge misdirected them, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the appellate division and the judgment of the trial court restored.\nAs to the cross-appeal, I think the evidence sufficient to uphold the finding of the jury that the plain- tiff exercised reasonable care in approaching the railway line and that such care would not have avoided the accident.\nI would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the judgment in favour of the appellant given at the trial can be sustained under either sub-section 3 or sub-section 4 of section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d as amended by 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 13. The whole of section 13 is as follows:\u2014\nSec. 13. Section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is amended by adding thereto the following sub-sections:\u2014\n3. Subject to the provisions of sub-section 4 of this section no train shall pass over any highway crossing at rail level in any thickly peopled portion of any city, town, or village at a greater speed than ten miles an hour, unless such crossing is constructed and thereafter maintained and protected in accordance with the orders, regulations and directions specially issued by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council or of the Board in force with respect to such crossing or unless permission is given by some regulation or order of the Board. The Board may from time to time fix the speed in any case at any rate that it deems proper.\n4. No train shall pass over any highway crossing at rail level at a greater speed than ten miles an hour if at such crossing an accident has happened subsequent to the first day of January, nineteen hundred, by a moving train causing bodily injury or death to a person using such crossing, unless and until such crossing is protected to the satisfaction of the Board; and no train shall pass over any highway crossing at rail level at a greater speed than ten miles an hour in respect of which crossing an order of the Board has been made to provide protection for the safety and convenience of the public and which order has not been complied with.\n5. The company shall have until the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ten, to comply with the provisions of sub-section 3 of this section.\nFirst, as to sub-section 4: the evidence shewed that at the crossing in question an accident had occurred on the 11th of October, 1910, when one George Lillicrop was injured in the following circumstances:\u2014In broad daylight at about 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the day mentioned Lillicrop, who was driving on the highway between Burlington and Aldershot, and being very near the railway track within the line of the railway fence was warned that a train was coming; there being no chance to turn round, and judging that to be the safest course, he hurried his horse across the track and succeeded in crossing just in time to escape the on-coming train with the result, however, that his horse ran into the ditch and he was thrown out and severely injured. I think that in these circumstances it can be affirmed that \u201can accident has happened by a moving train causing bodily injury to a person using the crossing in question\u201d within the meaning of this sub-section; and that the crossing, therefore, falls within the letter of the description of the class of crossings to which the provisions of the sub-section apply. It is contended, however, and this appears to have been the view taken by the majority of the Court of Appeal, that a term ought to be implied to the effect that the operation of the section is limited to those crossings at which an accident has occurred of which the railway company has had notice or ought to be held to have had notice through its employees. I am unable to find any satisfactory ground upon which such an implication can be based. I do not think we are entitled to speculate as to the theory upon which this legislation proceeds, or to read into it qualifying provisions with the object of causing it to conform to our own notions as to how far a legislature might reasonably be expected to go in measuring the responsibility of railway companies for injuries suffered through accidents at level crossings. The provision in question falls very far short of the point to which some people would go. I do not think we are entitled to assume that if the legislature intended the enactment only to go into effect subject to the qualification suggested it would have failed to express that qualification. In this view of the section the liability of the company is not disputed.\nAs to sub-section 3: It is not denied there was evidence from which the jury might properly find that the crossing in question is situated in a thickly peopled portion of the Village of Burlington; and no evidence was given shewing that the crossing was constructed or maintained and protected in accordance with the orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners or that any permission had been given by the Board for the running of trains at a greater speed than 10 miles an hour over it.\nI think the effect of the sub-section is this: The rule is laid down with regard to crossings situated as the statute describes that the speed of trains over them shall be limited to ten miles an hour. That is the general rule. Exceptions to that rule may, however, arise in two ways. First, there is the case in which the Board of Railway Commissioners make special provision with regard to a particular crossing for its construction, maintenance, and protection. In that case the general rule does not apply. Then there is the other case in which permission is given by the Board for the running of trains at a higher rate of speed. If a railway company alleges that a particular crossing is taken out of the operation of the general rule by reason of falling within one or other of these exceptional classes of cases, then the onus is on the railway company to establish the facts necessary to bring the crossing within the exception. This is so on the simple principle that where a party affirms the existence of a state of facts which is alleged to take his case out of the operation of a general rule, then, generally speaking, the onus is on him to establish that state of facts. The case of The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[7] seems to have been misunderstood. I can find nothing in the decision or in any of the judgments to support the view advanced by the respondents.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Sub-sections 3 and 5 of section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sec. 13, are as follows:\u2014\n13. Section 275 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is amended by adding thereto the following sub\u2011sections:\u2014\n3. Subject to the provisions of sub-section 4 of this section, no train shall pass over any highway crossing at rail level in any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village at a greater speed than ten miles an hour, unless such crossing is constructed and thereafter maintained and protected in accordance with the orders, regulations and directions specially issued by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council or of the Board in force with respect to such crossing, or unless permission is given by some regulation or order of the Board. The Board may from time to time fix the speed in any case at any rate that it deems proper.\n* * *\n5. The company shall have until the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ten, to comply with the provisions of sub-section 3 of this section.\nUpon sufficient evidence the jury at the trial found that the plaintiff was injured by the negligence of the railway company; and, in answer to the question, \u201cWhat did the negligence consist of?\u201d they said, \u201cBy excessive speed through a thickly populated district.\u201d The speed was admittedly about 40 miles an hour and the district was proved to be thickly populated. The accident, as found by the jury, resulted from the defendants\u2019 railway train being driven at this high rate of speed; and it admittedly occurred on a highway crossing in the town of Burlington.\nThe defendants contend that the learned trial judge erred in charging the jury that sub-section 3, above quoted, imposed on them the duty of restricting their speed at the Burlington crossing to ten miles an hour under the circumstances in evidence in this case. No evidence had been given of the existence or non-existence of any\norders, regulations or directions specially issued by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, or of the (Railway) Board in force with respect to (the) crossing\nin question as to its construction or protection, or of any \u201cpermission given by a regulation or order of the Board\u201d to run at a higher speed than 10 miles an hour. The Appellate Division was of the opinion that the direction of the learned judge\nwas wrong in not qualifying the statement by the exception contained in section 275, that is as to protection, and was not warranted by the Railway Act as interpreted in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[8].\nI presume that by this the court meant to hold that the burden of proving that the defendants were not within the exception or exemption created by the concluding clause of sub-section 3 lay upon the plaintiff. Otherwise I am unable to understand the judgment on this branch of the case.\nThe question is one of interpretation of sub-section 3 of section 275, read with, and in the light of, sub-section 5. Sub-section 3 differs materially from the pro- vision considered in the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay8, which limited the speed to\nsix miles an hour unless the track is properly fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act.\nIt was proved that the railway was properly fenced on both sides as required by the Act; and it was, therefore, held that the conditions upon which the rate of speed was limited did not exist. No question arose as to where the onus lay of proving the existence or non-existence of the conditions upon which the statute makes the speed limit inapplicable.\nSub-section 3 of section 275 contemplates an order, regulation or direction as to construction and protection, specially made in respect to the particular crossing either dealing with it individually or as one of a class to which it had been ascertained to belong either by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council or by the Railway Commission. Its operation was suspended by sub-section 5 for a definite period in order to give the company an opportunity to obtain such order, regulation or direction, if none already existed, and to comply with it, or to procure the requisite permission. After the expiry of the period allowed the obligation to limit the speed to ten miles an hour came into force unless such special order, regulation or direction as to protection existed or had been obtained and had been complied with, or permission for a speed exceeding ten miles an hour had been given by some regulation or order of the Railway Board. The sub-section in effect gives permission to run at a rate exceeding ten miles an hour on such order, regulation and direction being procured and complied with, or upon permission being obtained. Legh v. Lillie[9]. The obtaining and compliance with the order, regulation and direction as to construction and protection, or procuring permission for the higher rate of speed is in the nature of a condition precedent, fulfilment of which has to be established before the right to exceed the speed of ten miles an hour arises.\nThe clause of sub-section 3 introduced by the word \u201cunless\u201d creates an exception or exemption from the duty or obligation of limiting speed imposed generally by the earlier clause of the sub-section. \u201cUnless\u201d is an apt word to introduce an exception. Wilson v. Smith[10], at page 1556. It \u201cunloosens\u201d what follows it from what precedes it. Manning, Bowman & Co. v. Keenan[11], at page 57. The question is upon whom rested the burden of proving whether the defendants were or were not within this provision of exception or exemption?\nAlthough as a general rule where a plaintiff relies upon the breach by the defendant of a statutory provision which imposes a duty, but contains an exception, he must allege and shew that the defendant is not within the exception, Spieres v. Parker[12], at page 145; Williams v. The East India Co.[13]; Dwarris on Statutes (Potter ed.), p. 119 (a rule which has been most often enforced in criminal and penal cases; Rex v. Jarvis[14], at page 154; The King v. Jukes[15]; \u201cwhere the subject-matter of the allegation lies peculiarly within the knowledge\u201d of the defendant, while, as a matter of pleading, the plaintiff should allege the negative, Bullen & Leake\u2019s Precedents of Pleading, 3 ed., p. 60, the defendant must adduce the evidence necessary to bring himself within the exemption; and this exception from the general rule is recognized in criminal cases notwithstanding the strong presumption of innocence. Taylor on Evidence, par. 376a; Apothecaries\u2019 Co. v. Bentley[16]; The King v. Turner[17]; Morton v. Copeland[18]; Kent v. Midland Railway Co.[19]; Rex v. Thistlewood[20]; Mahony v. Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway Co.[21], at page 280. It should perhaps be noted that in the statute, 55 Geo. III., ch. 194, sec. 14, dealt with in Apothecaries\u2019 Co. v, Bentley16, the clause of exception is introduced by the word \u201cunless.\u201d If the defendants in the present case had the right to run at a speed exceeding ten miles an hour over the Burlington crossing, they must be presumed to know of the special orders, regulations or directions or permission under which they enjoy that right. Having regard to sub-section 5, the subject-matter of the existence or non-existence of the conditions under which the exception or exemption provided for in sub-section 3 arises, lies peculiarly within their knowledge.\nNo question has been raised either in the provincial courts or in this court as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s pleading. Had objection been taken on that ground any necessary amendment would, no doubt, have been allowed. The burden of proving that such special order, regulation or direction had been made and complied with, or that such permission had been given as sub-section 3 contemplates, rested, I think, upon the defendant company. In that view of the case the direction of the learned trial judge was right, and the judgment for the plaintiff should not have been disturbed.\nIf the contrary view of the construction of sub-section 3 had prevailed the logical result would appear to have been not to order a new trial for misdirection, but to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s action on this branch of his case, unless, as a matter of indulgence, he should have been allowed a new trial to supplement his evidence, because the former trial had proceeded upon a misapprehension as to the effect of sub-section 3.\nThe view which I have taken as to the construction and effect of sub-section 3 renders it unnecessary to consider the questions raised in regard to sub-section 4, as to the kind of previous accident to which that sub-section refers and as to its applicability where neither the railway company nor its officials or servants had knowledge of such previous accident. On these points I express no opinion.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.H.

On the trial it was shewn that the original owners had conveyed the lots to the east and south of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d to different parties, each deed describing it as a street and giving a right of way over it to the grantee. The deeds to P.\u2019s predecessors in title did not give him a similar right of way, but some of these conveyances described it as a street. The deed to one of the predecessors in title of S. had a plan annexed shewing \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as a street fifty feet wide and the grantee was given the right to register said plan. The evidence also established that for 22 years before the action \u201cAncroft Place\u201d had been entered in the assessment rolls as a public street and had not been assessed for taxes and that the city had placed a gas lamp on the end; also, that for over twenty years it had been used by the owners of the lots to the south and east, and from time to time by the owner on the north side, as a means of access to, and egress from, their respective properties. In 1909 the fee in the land in dispute was conveyed to S. who had become owner of the lots to the east and south.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, Duff J. expressing no opinion, that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the land had been dedicated to the public, and accepted by the municipality as a street. Held, further, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the land was not a \u201cway, easement or appurtenance\u201d to the lot to the north \u201cheld, used, occupied and enjoyed, or taken or known, as part and parcel thereof\u201d within the meaning of sec. 12 of \u201cThe Law and Transfer of Property Act,\u201d R.S.O., [1897] ch. 119.\nHeld, also, that, P. had not acquired a right-of-way by a grant implied from the terms of the deeds of the adjoining lots, Duff J. dissenting; nor by prescription, Duff J. expressing no opinion.\nPer DUFF J.\u2014The facts established justify the inference that the original owners (Mr. and Mrs. Patrick) always entertained the design that the strip of land in question should be a street affording access to the adjoining parts of lot 22; that, accordingly, it had been surveyed and laid out as a street, on the ground, in 1884; that the sale to McCully, in 1887, proceeded on the footing that the land purchased by him was bounded to the south by a street and this was one of the elements of value determining the price he paid; that, thereafter, in accordance with the same design, Mrs. P. permitted the successive occupants of the lot bought by McC. to use this strip of land as of right for all the purposes of a street; that these occupants, acting as she intended they should and as the situation, created by her, naturally encouraged them to act, purchased and dealt with it upon the same footing as that upon which the sale to McC. took place: Consequently, the respondent is, on the principle of Piggott v. Stratton (1 DeG. F. & J. 33), as explained in Spicer v. Martin (14 App. Cas. 12), and of Cairncross v. Lorimer (3 Macq. 829); Oliver v. King (8 DeG. M. & G. 110); and Russell v. Watts (10 App. Cas. 590), precluded from disputing the right of the appellant to use \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as a street.\nPer DUFF J.\u2014At the time of the sale to McC. the vendor was precluded from using Rachel Street for any purpose inconsistent with its character as a street and its sole value for her as a \u201cstreet\u201d or \u201cway\u201d was because of the means of access it afforded to the property sold. Its character as a way laid off for the accommodation, inter alia, of that property was palpable to everybody: as a way, therefore, it was as regards the vendor\u2019s interest in it a \u201cway * * * known or taken to be\u201d an adjunct of the property sold and, as such, passed to the purchaser under the provisions of the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act.\u201d\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial[1] in favour of the plaintiff. The essential facts are stated in the above head-note.\nW.N. Tilley and J.D. Montgomery for the appellant. The deed with the surveyor\u2019s plan annexed established \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as a way attached to the lands to the north and 50 Vict. ch. 25 (Ont.) respecting Land Surveyors and Surveys converted it into a public highway. Gooderham v. City of Toronto[2], at page 262. The land in question was a \u201cway, easement or appurtenance\u201d to the lot to the north of it \u201cheld, used, occupied and enjoyed, or taken or known, as part and parcel thereof\u201d within the meaning of \u201cThe Law and Transfer of Property Act,\u201d R.S.O. [1897] ch. 119.\nThe courts below did not give proper effect to the acts of dedication and acceptance proved at the trial and to the above legislation. See Attorney-General v. Antrobus[3], at page 207. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[4].\nLudwig K.C. for the respondent. It is clear that the use of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d was not so necessary to the enjoyment of the land to the north as to pass with the conveyance. See Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 11, sec. 511; Prideaux on Conveyancing (2 ed.), pages 121\u20112; Bell v. Golding[5].\nThere was no proof of intention to dedicate \u201cAncroft Place\u201d to the public and it was not dedicated. See Robertson v. Meyer[6], at page 370, as to the inference from the placing of a gas lamp on the lane.\nAs to user see Webb v. Baldwin[7]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action brought for trespass. The defence was that the plaintiff was not the owner of the lands and premises in question, but on the contrary that the place where the trespass was alleged to have been committed was a public highway. The trial judge found in favour of the plaintiff, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe lane over which the appellant claims a right-of-way is a cul de sac, and eliminating the question of dedication which was not seriously argued, there is, it seems to me, very little difficulty about this case.\nAt the time the appellant\u2019s property was sold to his predecessor in title, McCully, by Rachel Patrick, the latter held as owner all that part of lot No. 22 which had not been previously disposed of to Ellwell, Davis and Henderson, that is to say, she was still the owner of that portion of lot No. 22 or of those portions of that lot known in these proceedings as the McCully property and Ancroft Place. The latter was then burdened with a right-of-way, under the deed referred to, in favour of Davis, Ellwell and Henderson, but admittedly not in favour of the other portion of the same lot subsequently sold to McCully, and now the property of the appellant. Nor is there evidence to shew that, in fact, it was used by the owner or by others with her knowledge and consent as a roadway for the benefit of that adjoining property.\nIt is not easy for me to understand how of two adjoining properties owned and possessed by the same person one could be burdened in favour of the other with an easement of this kind except by some express act of the owner manifesting an intention to impose such a burden. I was much impressed at the argument by the terms of the deed to Henderson. There is no doubt that Mrs. Patrick, at the time that deed was passed, by an excess of precaution reserved to herself the right to give a passage over \u201cAncroft Place,\u201d then her property, to whoever might subsequently buy that portion of lot No. 22 now owned by plaintiff, but she did not exercise that right, presumably because she was not asked to do it by McCully when he bought his property. Further, if a right of way then existed over \u201cAncroft Place\u201d in favour of the balance of lot No. 22, now owned by appellant, why make that reservation? The description contained in McCully\u2019s deed of sale, in my opinion, very clearly excludes \u201cAncroft Place\u201d and, if at that time no right of way existed over it for the benefit of the property he bought, I do not understand where the foundation of the right now asserted can be found.\nThe statute is not intended to create a right, but merely to give effect to some right in existence at the time the deed of conveyance is made. The only easement that passed by virtue of the section of the Act relied on is an easement, \u201cbelonging or in anywise appertaining\u201d to the land conveyed, that is to say, belonging or appertaining to the land at the date of the conveyance. All the judges below have found that no title had, at that time, been acquired by user to a right-of-way over \u201cAncroft Place,\u201d and I cannot find in the evidence anything that would justify me in reversing the two courts below on this question of fact.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The main questions involved in this appeal are, first, whether Helen McCully, the predeces- sor in title of the appellant as grantee under the conveyance from Rachel Patrick, dated 21st November, 1887, acquired a right-of-way over \u201cAncroft Place,\u201d the fee simple title in which was vested in Rachel Patrick. This \u201cAncroft Place,\u201d so called, was a cul-de-sac running off from Sherbourne Street in Toronto and lying immediately south of the lands conveyed as above to Helen McCully. Secondly, whether \u201cAncroft Place\u201d was a public street?\nI agree with the Court of Appeal and the trial judge that there was no reasonable evidence of dedication. I do not think the \u201cPlace\u201d or way in question ever was a thoroughfare. It was merely a cul-de-sac for the convenience of a few property owners abutting on it on the south and east. In the deed given by the former owner, Mrs. Rachel Patrick, to Henderson in 1884 of one of the plots of land to the south and east of this \u201cplace\u201d or \u201cstreet,\u201d there was granted to Henderson and his assigns a right-of-way\nover and upon the said street fifty feet wide in common with the said Rachel Patrick, her heirs and assigns and the persons to whom she or her late husband has already or may hereafter grant any portion of said lot 22 abutting on said street.\nI think the object and purpose of this clause was to place beyond doubt the fact that the right\u2011of-way granted to Henderson was not to be an exclusive one but one to be used in common by him and Mrs. Patrick and those to whom she or her late husband had granted or might grant such a right.\nIt did not reserve to Rachel Patrick any rights over this lane or way which she did not have without it. The fee in the lane was in her. She did not grant Henderson an exclusive right\u2011of\u2011way but one in common with herself, and certain definite other persons her grantees. The clause neither enlarged nor abridged her rights over the lane, and I think the trial judge\u2019s construction of its meaning a sound one and that it meant no more than reserving common rights in the way for those to whom she or her husband had granted or might grant them as grantees of the lands \u201cabutting on the street.\u201d\nThe deed or conveyance to the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, Helen McCully, did not either bound the lands conveyed to her on this \u201cplace,\u201d \u201cstreet,\u201d or \u201clane,\u201d nor did it use any language indicating any connection between the two or any right-of-way as existing or contemplated by the parties between the lands conveyed and the street or lane. The lands conveyed are expressed as being bounded on one side by Maple Avenue, on another side by Sherbourne Street; but \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as a \u201cway,\u201d \u201cstreet,\u201d \u201cplace,\u201d \u201clane\u201d or otherwise is not mentioned or referred to.\nI do not think there is any evidence of a dedication of the way or place to the public or of any acceptance of such a dedication by the municipality.\nMr. Tilley rested his case largely upon the contention that while the deed to Mrs. McCully made no reference to any right-of-way over the street or place which was called, as he said, Rachel Street, and had at one time a board with that name upon it affixed to one of its sides, still the deed must be construed by reference to and along with section 12 of the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act,\u201d R.S.O. ch. 119. His contention was that the deed plus this statute operated to convey to Mrs. McCully a right-of-way over this street, place or lane, as being within the words of the statute a way or easement \u201cheld, used, occupied and enjoyed and taken or known as part or parcel thereof.\u201d\nThe fact that there was a visible road or lane existing along the south side of the lands conveyed to McCully and that access to and from such lands to the lane was at any rate possible and had been at times resorted to and used by the occupiers of these lands was pressed by Mr. Tilley. But these intermittent and casual users established no right and it would be a dangerous construction of the statute to hold that under the proved facts of this case it created and passed such a right-of-way as is contended for. The lane was not established for the benefit of these lands of the appellant. They were bounded by public streets on two sides and of course no way as of \u201cnecessity\u201d could be contended for. In delivering judgment of the court in the case of Watts v. Kelson[8], at page 173, L.J. Mellish cites with approval the following sentence from the unanimous judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Polden v. Bastard[9]:\u2014\nThere is a distinction between easements, such as a right of way or easements used from time to time, and easements of necessity or continuous easements. The cases recognise this distinction, and it is clear law that, upon a severance of tenements, easements used as of necessity, or in their nature continuous, will pass by implication of law without any words of grant; but with regard to easements which are used from time to time only, they do not pass, unless the owner, by appropriate language, shews an intention that they should pass.\nI have read the cases called to our attention on the construction of section 6, sub-section 2, of the English \u201cConveyancing Act,\u201d from which the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act.\u201d R.S.O. ch. 119 is taken. The two sections are substantially alike. The Ontario section reads:\u2014 Every conveyance of land, unless an exception is specially made therein, shall he held and construed to include all * * * ways * * * easements * * * and appurtenances whatsoever, to the lands therein comprised, belonging or in any wise appertaining, or with the same demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed, or taken or known as part or parcel thereof.\nThe cases establish, I think, the question as to whether a claimed way or easement passed or not under and by virtue of the statute to be one of fact to be determined on the circumstances of each case. The question before us is whether before and at the date of the conveyance from Mrs. Patrick to Helen Eliza McCully in 1887 the way in question was a way really and actually used and enjoyed with the property conveyed, or taken or known as part or parcel thereof. If it was so used and enjoyed or taken or known, then it passed to the plaintiffs by the very words of the grant and the Act. In International Tea Stores Co. v. Hobbs[10], Farwell J., at page 172, referring to a decision of Blackburn J. in Kay v. Oxley[11], goes on to say:\u2014\nHe (Blackburn J.) therefore, as I understand him, treats the only relevant question as being: Was the way in fact enjoyed at the date of the conveyance? If so the fact that it was enjoyed under a license which had not been revoked was immaterial. If it had been enjoyed without any license at all for a number of years, although no prescriptive right had been or could have been acquired, still it was in fact enjoyed. It is in each case a question of fact to be determined on the circumstances of the case whether it has, or has not, been enjoyed within the meaning of the statute.\nSee also Brown v. Alabaster[12].\nOn this crucial question the trial judge has, on evidence which seems to me amply sufficient, found against the plaintiff. The appeal court has agreed with that finding; and, concurring with it as I do, I think it disposes of the appeal.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The late Mr. Patrick owned a block of land in the south-east angle of Sherbourne Street and Maple Avenue in Toronto out of the south-east part of which he carved and sold and conveyed two parcels each sixty-six feet wide fronting upon a street fifty feet wide and named by some one after his wife \u201cRachel Street.\u201d\nHe devised the remainder of the block to his wife. She, after his death, conveyed in 1884 to one Henderson, another part of the original block comprising all that remained thereof unsold south of the northerly limit of said Rachel Street and east of the line of the lands her husband had conveyed as stated above and included part therein of what was to have apparently been a continuation of Rachel Street. The terms of this latter conveyance in relation to Rachel Street I will refer to presently.\nThe result was to leave vested in Mrs. Patrick a block of land two hundred and five feet six inches on Maple Avenue by one hundred and forty-seven feet nine inches on Sherbourne Street lying next to and on the said northerly line of Rachel Street.\nShe sold, for $8,000 and conveyed by deed of 21st November, 1887, to Mrs. McCully, this remaining block of land describing it by metes and bounds. The southerly boundary given therein admittedly coincides with the northerly line of Rachel Street.\nThat conveyance made pursuant to the Act respecting short forms of conveyances must be read as if it had incorporated therein the substance of section 12 of the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act\u201d of which the first part thereof is as follows:\u2014\n12(1). Every conveyance of land, unless an exception is specially made therein, shall be held and construed to include all houses, outhouses, edifices, barns, stables, yards, gardens, orchards, commons, trees, woods, underwoods, mounds, fences, hedges, ditches, ways, waters, watercourses, lights, liberties, privileges, easements, profits, commodities, emoluments, hereditaments and appurtenances, whatsoever, to the lands therein comprised, belonging or in any wise appertaining, or with the same demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed, or taken or known as part or parcel thereof.\nThe question raised herein is whether or not that conveyance so read contained a grant of the right-of-way over said part of Rachel Street for the distance of one hundred and thirty-six feet unappropriated by the earlier conveyance to Henderson and leading out to the said Sherbourne Street.\nThe evidence makes it very clear that before and up to the time of the conveyance to Mrs. McCully this space of land was designated as a street by the name first given it of Rachel Street or \u201cAncroft Place\u201d later placarded on the southerly fence bounding same; that it was not assessed but treated by the assessors as a street from and including the year 1887 when first annexed to the city down to the trial hereof; that the lands lying to the south of it conveyed by Patrick as already stated were assessed according to their frontage on Rachel Street or \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as if a public street and Henderson\u2019s was similarly treated; that it was fenced on either side and on the end abutting what was sold to Henderson but not fenced on the Sherbourne Street side; that the appearance thus given it was that of a public street; that from such appearance any person buying the land sold and conveyed, to Mrs. McCully would clearly as- sume it was such or at least a right-of-way giving a rear access to any one purchasing or using said land; that said land sold her was a much more valuable piece of land with such right of access than if it had it not; that Dr. McCully, her husband, in treating for said land was told by the agent of Mrs. Patrick, that \u201cAncroft Place\u201d or Rachel Street was a public street just as its appearance indicated; and that when Mrs. Patrick conveyed to Henderson it was by her deed to him expressly declared said street was \u201cfifty feet wide and ran from Sherbourne Street to the land hereby conveyed,\u201d and provided in the said deed to him as follows:\u2014\nTogether with the free and uninterrupted use and right-of-way at all times in perpetuity to the said James Henderson, his heirs and assigns, and his and their servants, in, over and upon the said street fifty feet wide in common with the said Rachel Patrick, her heirs and assigns and the persons to whom she or her late husband has already or may hereafter grant any part of said lot twenty-two abutting on said street. The said described lands hereby granted and the said street (fifty feet wide) are shewn on the surveyor\u2019s diagram hereunto annexed.\nThe lot twenty-two thus referred to was the block originally owned by Patrick. The only part of it thus left vested in Mrs. Patrick and for and in respect of which her use of this street in common with others was thus provided for, was the land which she three years later conveyed to Mrs. McCully under whom appellant claims.\nIf that is not a reservation and declaration that the right-of-way is \u201cto be held, used, occupied and enjoyed, or\u201d to be \u201ctaken or known as part or parcel thereof,\u201d i.e., of said land for which it was thus expressly reserved, what was it for?\nIt is said she owned the legal estate in the street and hence argued she had no need to reserve any- thing but had it as of right. Many people own the legal estate in a street but their right of travel thereon rests not on such legal estate but on the law and facts constituting it a public highway.\nIt was the incompleteness of the dedication herein that rendered her right to the use thereof in any way doubtful. And if she had happened to give by her several grants, including that to Henderson, rights-of-way to be used by each of these grantees, in common with the others named, over the place, and failed to reserve the like right to herself and said nothing more, then clearly she would have faced the very grave difficulty that these grants of right-of-way to such a specific number of enumerated persons, or a class of persons, in common, might be treated as exclusive of any other. If there had been no right-of-way reserved, then those having in such case a grant of way in common to and for themselves as grantees thereof, might have claimed these as exclusive rights-of-way and restrained any one else using the same place for right-of-way to serve any other property, such as the remainder of the block.\nThis is so common an incident in transactions relative to rights-of-way, or rights-of-way in common, that one is surprised to hear it argued that as of course because she had the legal estate therefor she could grant to some one else an equal privilege and destroy the value of the right-of-way she had granted.\nThe very argument put forward now for respondent rests upon this right of exclusion, or might have been rested thereon to protect those others who alone had rights in common to travel there if none had been reserved to serve the other property. If nothing else had interfered they need not have feared intrusion from any one else.\nIt is by getting a clear conception of what the actual legal position would have been under grants in common limited to only a certain class of persons and the rights springing therefrom, that we get a clear notion of what this reservation meant in law. It is idle to talk of her legal estate, for that would not have entitled her in face of limited grants in common to invade such rights and derogate therefrom by either intruding upon the privacy or cumbering improperly a way confined to a few.\nOf course there are so many indications of a purpose to dedicate to the public this space of ground, that the legal rights I am illustrating by may not be needed to protect appellant. The simple and clear propositions of law involved in this reservation and its consequences under the circumstances ought, however, to suffice.\nIt seems quite clear that this reservation to serve the uses of the land later sold to Mrs. McCully, was well designed in law and enabled Mrs. Patrick to add thereby to the value thereof whilst in her hands and to make of it merchandise, as beyond a shadow of doubt she did. And when her grant to Mrs. McCully is read in light thereof, and all else that appears in the surrounding facts and circumstances, which in every case must be considered if proper effect is to be given to deeds made under said Act, there is no doubt in my mind but that the right of way over \u201cAncroft Place\u201d to serve the land conveyed to Mrs. McCully, passed by that grant. There is also some evidence of an actual user of the space as a right of way to reach a rear en- trance to said lands by means of bars when the lot was used as a pasture field before the grant to Mrs. McCully.\nIf the intention existed as seems pretty evident it did, to dedicate the said land as a public highway, and only failed, if it did fail (as to which I express no opinion) for want of clear acceptance by the public, or authority representing the public, there was at the time of the said grant surely the clear purpose that the right-of-way was to be taken and enjoyed as part of the thing granted unless we are to suppose the people bargaining were bereft of common sense. It was so clearly to the advantage of her selling, to give it and get for it a price nowhere else available, and of her buying, that she should acquire what would be worth to her more than to any person else.\nShe or her successors in title ought not to be made to buy it over again.\nIt is urged the description in the deed being by metes and bounds instead of using the line of Rachel Street or \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as one of the boundaries rebuts the presumption. A glance at the plan shews this was impracticable or inexpedient because the southerly boundary of the land conveyed ran in a straight line past and beyond the limits of \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d\nIf Mrs. Patrick instead of selling the whole block to Mrs. McCully had sold to any one a small rear lot carved out of it and not fronting on either Sherbourne Street or Maple Avenue, but of which the boundary on the south coincided with the north line of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d and no entrance or exit had been provided on either Maple Avenue or Sherbourne Street, and no more had appeared in the deed than in this to Mrs. McCully, and the grantee had been perverse enough to want a way of necessity to either Maple Avenue or Sherbourne Street, instead of using this apparent road Ancroft Place furnished, how would such a grantee be treated by any court hearing him insist on such a way of necessity? Would the court not tell him that it was clear he had a way out by Ancroft Place and could not so insist? Would it not be clear that on the facts this was a way \u201cenjoyed or taken or known as part or parcel\u201d of the land granted him?\nIn every case of this sort the facts must be looked at and the true position inferred therefrom or injustice may be done in many cases.\nThe leading authorities were all cited and if the case is reported they will appear in the report of argument hereof.\nI have examined many of those cited and others, but do not think it necessary to review them. For those, however, who desire to know more accurately than I can express myself what I think should ever guide in such cases, I would refer to the language of Cotton L.J. in Birmingham, Dudley and District Banking Co. v. Ross[13], at foot of page 308 and top of page 309, where he was dealing with a case regarding a question of light and the implied rights of the parties resultant from their dealings. The case may not appear so apposite as others to be found in some of the leading cases, but his language is so expressive of the principle to be adopted in this class of cases that I need not seek elsewhere a means of presenting it. If such must be the view to be taken regarding an implied obligation, how much more so relative to the effect of an express grant carrying what corresponds thereto so far as the language of the statute will fit the facts.\nAlthough much has been urged as to dedication and the case has gone off in that way in the courts below, I do not think it necessary to deal therewith to dispose of the action.\nThe action fails on the merits as to the alleged trespass without disposing of a number of interesting legal questions, and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe appellant is entitled to an injunction as prayed for in his counterclaim restraining the respondent from obstructing or otherwise interfering with the appellant\u2019s user and enjoyment of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d for the purposes of a way.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014There are several grounds upon which I think this appeal ought to be allowed. My views can, I think, be best stated by setting out first in chronological order the more important material facts. The accompanying sketch shows the situation of the appellant\u2019s property. The street marked as \u201c50-foot street\u201d on the sketch is the way which will be hereinafter referred to as Rachel Street or \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d The whole of the property shown in the sketch including the \u201c50-foot street\u201d is comprised in lot 22, as shown upon a plan that, at the commence- ment of the transactions to which I shall have to refer, was registered in the Registry Office of the County of York, as plan No. 329. On this registered plan the \u201c50-foot street\u201d is not shown. In 1874 one Thaddeus Patrick became the owner of lot 22. Although not shown on the plan, this \u201c50-foot street\u201d was then an existing street having defined northerly and southerly limits. On the south side there were two adjoining houses having a common party-wall facing the street. In 1875, Patrick conveyed one of these houses together with a block of land having a frontage of 66 feet on Rachel Street to the Rev. Jos. Ellwell. The northern boundary of the plot of land is described in the conveyance as \u201cthe southern limit of a street 50 feet in width.\u201d In 1882, after the death of Thaddeus Patrick, Rachel Patrick, his widow and devisee, conveyed the adjoining house, together with the plot of land connected with it, to Dr. Davies, and the northerly boundary of this plot is described in the conveyance as \u201cthe southerly limit of a street 50 feet wide.\u201d At that time the street appears to have extended easterly at least to the boundary between the lots 22 and 23. In 1884, it is stated by one of the witnesses that there were stables on the southerly side of the street, at least as far east as that line. At that time (1884), there were ornamental trees following the line of the street on both sides, and there was a well marked waggon track in the centre. Some time prior to the 8th of July, 1884, it does not appear precisely when, a survey of lot 22 was made, and a plan drawn which was attached to a conveyance of part of the lot from Rachel Patrick to James Henderson, that was executed on that date. The accompanying sketch reproduces this plan with the addition of the legends \u201cappellant\u2019s property,\u201d \u201cproperty sold to McCully,\u201d and the dotted line running north and south between Maple Avenue and Rachel Street. The street in question is the subject of various stipulations in this conveyance. It is described as running easterly from Sherbourne to the \u201cland hereinafter conveyed\u201d and as being of the\nfull width of 50 feet measured across said street and at right angles to its northerly and southerly limits.\nThe other provisions relating to it are as follows:\u2014\nTogether with the free and uninterrupted use and right of way at all times in perpetuity to the said James Henderson his heirs or assigns and his and their servants in, over and upon the said street fifty feet wide in common with the said Rachel Patrick her heirs and assigns and the persons to whom she or her late husband has already or may hereafter grant any part of said lot twenty-two abutting on said street. The said described lands hereby granted and the said street (fifty feet wide) are shown on the surveyor\u2019s diagram hereunto annexed.\nTogether with the right at any time after one year from the date hereof to register the plan of sub-division of said lot twenty-two as hereunto annexed and showing when registered the land hereby granted to the said James Henderson and the said fifty feet street and for that purpose to use and sign the name of the said Rachel Patrick and her assigns.\nAnd the said party of the first part hereby further covenants with the said party of the second part that upon any laying out or plotting of said lot twenty-two and upon any plan thereof whether for the purposes of registration or otherwise the said street of the full width of fifty feet shall be laid down and appear as the same is shown on the hereunto annexed diagram. [Page 77]\nIn 1887, the municipal boundaries of Toronto were extended so as to embrace part of the Township of York and thereafter the locality in question came within the limits of St. Paul\u2019s Ward. In the summer of that year lot 22 was for the first time placed upon the municipal assessment rolls of Toronto. Mr. Unwin, a well-known surveyor in Toronto, who was the assessor for St. Paul\u2019s Ward in that year and in each year for 15 years thereafter, gave evidence at the trial. He says that the area included within Rachel Street, as shewn upon the sketch, was laid out upon the ground as a street and was entered by him in the assessment roll as a public street running off Sherbourne Street; that this area was treated as the site of a public highway and as such was not assessed and was not taxed by the municipal authorities down to the time of the trial in 1911. He says, moreover, that the Ellwell, Davies and Henderson properties were assessed as fronting on this street.\nIt was in November, 1887, that the whole of that part of lot 22 situated north of the northerly limit of Rachel Street and of the lands conveyed to Henderson, including what is now the appellant\u2019s property, was sold by Mrs. Patrick. Before going into the details of this transaction it may be noted that by this sale Mrs. Patrick divested herself of all the lands she then held adjoining or in any way communicating with Rachel Street. The purchaser was a Dr. McCully. The conveyance was taken in the name of his wife, but the purchase money was paid by him, and it was he who made the agreement of purchase. Dr. McCully was then living in Toronto, though a few years afterwards, for reasons which he explains in his evidence, he went to the United States. He was examined as a witness at Dallas, Texas, in May, 1911, six months before the trial. It was not suggested in cross-examination that he had any interest which could in any way affect his evidence, and though there was ample time after his examination before the trial to investigate his statements, he was not contradicted in any material particular. He says that, in 1887, he accidentally learned that the Toronto Street Railway Co. was likely to extend its line across the Rosedale Ravine on Sherbourne Street past the property in question. He says he had had his eye on the property since 1884 and that immediately (having ascertained that it was then on the market) he entered into negotiations for the purchase of it. Mrs. Patrick\u2019s agent, through whom he bought the property, was a solicitor practising in Toronto, and McCully says he made it a particular point to ask him whether the road at the south of the property was a street and that he was assured by the agent that it was. He regarded the point as of great importance, he says, because his plan was to divide the property into four 50-foot lots facing Maple Avenue with stables in the rear, having an entrance from Rachel Street. That entrance he considered, he says, enhanced the value of the property by at least $1,000. In the following year he changed his plans, and sold the property en bloc to one James Dickson, a commission merchant in Toronto. Dickson built a house upon it and a stable. He placed a gate on Maple Avenue and another opening on Rachel Street, and the stable could be approached by either entrance. Dickson kept horses in the stable two or three days each week during several years. Sometimes he used the Maple Avenue entrance, sometimes the Rachel Street entrance. One would gather from his evidence that he used the Maple Avenue entrance more frequently during the first two years. Afterwards, the Sherbourne Street bridge having been built in 1890, he used the Rachel Street entrance more frequently. In 1895 he sold the house, retaining the stable, and left Toronto to reside elsewhere. In 1897 the stable was mortgaged, and in 1899, through a sale made under a power contained in the mortgage, the stable became the property of Mrs. Cockburn to whom the house had already been sold. During the four years which elapsed between Dickson\u2019s departure and the purchase of the stable by Mrs. Cockburn, the stable appears to have been occupied during two winters and summers and the Rachel Street entrance was used by the occupants. From 1899 down to 1909 the stable appears to have been let from time to time and during the whole of the period the Rachel Street entrance was made use of by the tenants of the stable as well as for various other purposes connected with the appellant\u2019s property, such for example as the collection of garbage by the municipal scavenging department. In the meantime Henderson had built a house at the end of the street on the property acquired by him from Mrs. Patrick by the deed of 1884. Sidewalks had been laid down, the roadway improved, a gas lamp had been set up in front of Henderson\u2019s gate by the City Fire Department under the authority of the municipal council at the expense of the city; the name Rachel Street had been changed to \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d The present appellant bought the property in 1905 from Mrs. Cockburn and built on it a brick stable with an entrance from Ancroft Place. In the various instruments dealing with the property subsequent to McCully\u2019s conveyance to Dickson, the property was described as fronting on a street. In 1910 the respondent, having in the meantime acquired the Henderson, Ellwell and Davies properties, that is to say, the properties adjoining Ancroft Place with the exception of that owned by the appellant, obtained from Mrs. Patrick a quitclaim of her interest in the site of the street, and then proceeded to block up the entrance to the appellant\u2019s property from \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d\nIn these circumstances the appellant\u2019s title to a right of access to Sherbourne Street by way of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d may be supported, it appears to me, on at least two grounds; first, an express grant of the right, and secondly, I think the conduct of Mrs. Patrick, before and after the sale to McCully, taken together with the circumstances of that transaction, disentitle her and her successor (who is not and does not pretend to be a purchaser for value without notice) from preventing the appellant using Rachel Street as a street affording communication to and from Sherbourne Street with the southern boundary of her property.\nThe facts established justify the inferences that Mrs. Patrick and her late husband always entertained the design that Rachel Street should be a street affording access to the parts of lot 22 adjoining it; that in accordance with that design she had the street surveyed and laid out as a street on the ground in 1884; that the sale to McCully in 1887 proceeded on the footing that the property was bounded on the south by a street and that this circumstance was one of the elements of value which went to determine the price paid by McCully; that thereafter in accordance with the same design Mrs. Patrick permitted the successive occupants of the property bought by McCully to use the street as of right for all the purposes of a street; and that these purchasers acting as she intended they should act and as the situation created by her naturally encouraged them to act, purchased and dealt with this property from time to time upon the same footing upon which the sale to McCully took place.\nThe first point of importance is that Mrs. Patrick in selling to McCully in 1884 dealt with the property sold upon the footing that the area known as Rachel Street was set apart permanently as a street for the accommodation inter alia of the property sold and that she dealt with it in this way deliberately with the object of getting the benefit of this circumstance in the price realized upon the sale.\nI have already pointed out that, by the sale to Henderson in 1884, Mrs. Patrick dispossessed herself of all of lot 22 except that parcel afterwards sold to McCully and Rachel Street. As a result of the stipulation in the conveyance to McCully, Rachel Street became useless to her for any purpose except as affording a means of access to the parcel afterwards sold. Henderson was expressly given the right to use it as a street; the other property owners on the south side already had that right. The street was formally laid out on the ground as such, and a plan was prepared of it which Henderson was given the right to register after the expiration of a year. In no circumstances could this plot be used by her in any manner inconsistent with its destination as a street without the consent of these owners, and if Henderson chose to register the plan, the street would \u201cbe converted into a public highway.\u201d Obviously in a practical sense her interest in Rachel Street consisted solely in the fact that the right to use it as a street gave additional value to the property on the north side which she still owned. In these circumstances it is hardly conceivable that in selling that property she should think of separating the title of that property from the right to use Rachel Street. By doing that she would be denuding the property sold of an obvious and important element of value without retaining anything which would be of any present or probable value to her; because, apart from other considerations, it is obvious that if Henderson, registered the plan, and the street in consequence became a public street, the purchaser would get the benefit of it whether he had paid for that benefit or not. The declaration in the conveyance to Henderson shews that she had this in contemplation at the time the street was laid out in 1884; and her subsequent conduct is hardly consistent with any other view than that she supposed the purchaser of the McCully property had acquired the right to use the street. In face of the declaration in the deed of 1884, it cannot be supposed that Mrs. Patrick was not alive to the advantages of Rachel Street as an accommodation to the property on the north side. Is it conceivable, if on the sale to McCully she deliberately withheld the benefit of this accommodation (and we must imagine this in order to suppose that it was not taken into account as an element in the price), that she would have remained silent and inactive for the 22 years following that sale while the street was being actively enjoyed (for at least 18 out of the 22 years) as an accommodation by McCully\u2019s successors in title?\nI do not think it is conceivable; and I do not think it is consistent with the facts to suppose that the right to use Rachel Street as a means of access to the property sold was not regarded by Mrs. Patrick as one of the elements of value which were represented by the price paid by McCully.\nMrs. Patrick\u2019s intention being that the title to the property afterwards sold to McCully should not be separated from the right to use Rachel Street, but that Rachel Street should be a permanent street for the accommodation inter alia of that property there can, I think, be little doubt that McCully was in fact invited to enter into the purchase (as it was intended by the vendor he should be) on the footing of Rachel Street being of that character; and that he did enter into it upon that footing.\nIn this connection the importance of the fact of Rachel Street having been laid out on the ground as a street has, I think, been overlooked in the court below. The effect of it is shewn by the action of Mr. Unwin, a surveyor of long experience, when he came to assess lot 22 in the summer of 1887. What he saw led him to treat Rachel Street as a public street; and I think the significance of what he did has not been sufficiently attended to. His duty was to assess all land not specifically exempt from taxation. If Rachel Street was not a public street, it was his duty to assess it. On the other hand if it was a public street it was his duty to take that fact into consideration in putting a value upon the property having access to it. There can be no doubt that this was done. This consequence followed from the fact that this public official, who of course knew his duty and who was at the time an experienced surveyor, deliberately concluded from what he saw in 1887 that this street had been laid off as, and in fact was, a public street. In these circumstances, having regard to Mrs. Patrick\u2019s known intention respecting this street, one cannot doubt that her agent was acting entirely in accordance with his duty in answering McCully\u2019s inquiry as McCully says he did or that McCully in view of the visible signs that Rachel Street had been set apart as a street, was entitled to accept the agent\u2019s assurance as he says he did, and to act upon the footing of Rachel Street being in reality that which it appeared to everybody to be.\nIn passing one may notice Mr. Ludwig\u2019s contention that the absence from the deed to McCully of any reference to Rachel Street justifies the inference that McCully asked for a right of way, and that it was refused. Such a supposition is, for the reasons I have already mentioned, altogether untenable and, moreover, it is impossible to suppose that the respondent, who claims through Mrs. Patrick, could not have ascertained who the agent of Mrs. Patrick was and contradicted McCully\u2019s testimony if it was not in accordance with the fact.\nThere are two alternative grounds in my opinion upon which in these circumstances McCully could have maintained his right to use Rachel Street as against Mrs. Patrick.\n1st. The laying out of the property in the manner referred to and the representation of the agent that Rachel Street was a street, might reasonably have led to the belief in the mind of McCully that the street was in fact a public highway. If so, then the vendor would be estopped from denying that it was so in fact.\n2nd. If that was not the belief which the existing circumstances and the agent\u2019s assurance were calcu- lated to create in McCully\u2019s mind, then at least the statement of the agent was in the circumstances calculated, as it was no doubt intended, to convey to McCully an assurance upon which he was entitled to rely that Rachel Street was what it appeared to be, namely, a street laid off as a permanent accommodation for the property he was negotiating for, and it amounted to a representation that the property was being offered for sale on that footing. In the circumstances such a statement so intended would amount to a promise that no obstruction would be placed in the way of the enjoyment of the street by McCuIly or his successor in title binding on the vendor within the principle of Piggott v. Stratton[14], as explained in Spicer v. Martin[15], at page 23. The Statute of Frauds would be no obstacle in the circumstances of this case. It was, of course, argued that such a promise ought to have been expressed in the deed. The same argument was presented in Piggott v. Stratton14 and it is dealt with by Lindley L.J., in Martin v. Spicer[16], at page 12; see also Heilbut, Symons & Co. v. Buckleton[17], at pages 37 and 49.\nThe case in favour of McCully\u2019s successors is still stronger. The effect of the representation conveyed by the conduct of Mrs. Patrick in dealing with the property would be intensified as every year passed by and as Rachel Street continued to be used by the occupants of the property in question under the belief that they were rightfully entitled to the enjoyment of it, and as the property continued to be assessed for taxation purposes upon that assumption. It is argued that there is no evidence shewing Mrs. Patrick to have been aware of this user. That I think is of little, if any, importance in view of the fact that the evidence points so clearly to this user being in accordance with Mrs. Patrick\u2019s own intentions. In these circumstances, the appellant is, I think, entitled to rely upon the principle stated in various forms in Cairncross v. Lorimer[18], by Lord Campbell; in Oliver v. King[19]; in Russell v. Watts[20], at page 613.\nThe appellant\u2019s case, however, does not, in my opinion, rest upon the above considerations alone. The conveyance from Mrs. Patrick to McCully must be construed by reference to section 12, of chapter 119, R.S.O., which is as follows:\u2014\n12.\u2014(1) Every conveyance of land, unless an exception is specially made therein, shall he held and construed to include all houses, out-houses, edifices, barns, stables, yards, gardens, orchards, commons, trees, woods, underwoods, mounds, fences, hedges, ditches, ways, waters, watercourses, light, liberties, privileges, easements, profits, commodities, emoluments, hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever to the lands therein comprised, belonging or in anywise appertaining, or with the same demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed, or taken or known as part or parcel thereof; and if the same purports to convey an estate in fee, also the reversion or reversions, remainder and remainders, yearly and other rents, issues, and profits of the same lands and of every part and parcel thereof, and all the estate, right, title, interest, inheritance, use, trust, property, profit, possession, claim and demand whatsoever, of the grantor, in, to, out of, or upon the same lands, and every part and parcel thereof, with their and every of their appurtenances.\n(2) Except as to conveyances under the former Acts relating to short forms of conveyances, this section applies only to conveyances made after the 1st day of July, 1886.\nFor the purpose of applying this enactment I accept the conclusion of the court below that Rachel Street was not a public highway. It was nevertheless known generally as a \u201cstreet\u201d as the evidence of Mr. Unwin abundantly shews. A \u201cstreet\u201d is of course not merely a way. In popular language it signifies a way having, or intended or expected to have houses on both sides of it. Imperial Dictionary, vo. \u201cStreet.\u201d Mayor of Portsmouth v. Smith[21]; Pound v. Plumpstead Board of Works[22]; Robinson v. Local Board of Barton-Eccles[23], at pages 801 and 809; United States v. Bain[24], and presumptively it is a way for the accommodation of all property adjoining it. The effect of the stipulations in the deeds already referred to was to stamp Rachel Street with that character, and it may be noted that all these deeds would, as a matter of course (as relating to lot 22, and executed by Mrs. Patrick or her husband) be examined by anybody searching the title on behalf of McCully. Mrs. Patrick had by these stipulations disabled herself from using it physically for any purpose inconsistent with its character as a \u201cstreet.\u201d Her interest in it as a \u201cstreet\u201d therefore was the interest she had as the owner of the property sold to McCully as affording a particular means of access to that property. In its character of \u201cstreet\u201d or way, it was, from her point of view, an adjunct of that property and of no other property, and its only value to her in that character was as a right which as an adjunct to that property would increase the selling value of it.\nThe physical situation, moreover, gave it the \u201capparent\u201d character of a street for the accommodation inter alia of that property. It had been laid off on the ground not as a mere private way for the benefit of specific properties, but as a \u201cstreet\u201d with all which that, as already indicated, implies. Its character was obvious as Mr. Unwin\u2019s action and evidence shew; a gateway affording an entrance to the property on the north could not have made that character more obvious.\nIn these circumstances it is impossible to class this accommodation in its relation to the property in question as a \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d or \u201cnon-apparent\u201d accommodation. Its permanent character and its obvious relation to the property were plain to everybody. It seems impossible to hold that the signe apparente was wanting.\nWe are, I think, to apply the above enactment as if the language describing the subjects mentioned were used in the conveyance as descriptive of the subjects intended to be conveyed. So construing it I cannot escape the conclusion that the way in question, as a way, was \u201ctaken and known as part or parcel\u201d of the property conveyed; that, to paraphrase the words of Bowen L.J. in Bayley v. Great Western Rway. Co.[25], at page 453,\ntaking the thing broadly and endeavouring to judge what the intention of the parties as expressed by their language is * * * the grantor intended to give and that\nthe grantee \u201cshould have\u201d the benefit of this way.\nI have not considered the question whether a right-of-way has been established by prescription, nor whether \u201cAncroft Place\u201d is a public highway. In the view expressed above it is unnecessary to pass upon either of these questions.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts of this case are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge[26]. His con- clusion, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the evidence did not establish either dedication of the land in question as a public highway, or the acquisition, by prescriptive title, of an easement over it, appurtenant to the land owned by the defendant, is so clearly right that it is not surprising that the appeal on these grounds was but faintly pressed at Bar.\nOn behalf of the appellant it was urged, however, that the preparing and annexing to the Henderson deed (for accuracy of description) of a surveyor\u2019s sketch, which shews Ancroft Place as a lane or private street, had the effect of making it a public highway by virtue of section 67 of chapter 146, R.S.O., 1877, \u201cThe Surveys Act,\u201d continued in 50 Vict. chapter 25, section 62, and R.S.O. 1897, ch. 181, sec. 39. At the time the Henderson deed was registered the land in question was still in the Township of York and the statutory provision relied on did not then apply to township lands. This land, however, afterwards became part of the city of Toronto and by subsequent legislation the provision of \u201cThe Surveys Act\u201d was extended to townships. R.S.O., 1897, ch. 181, sec. 39. Assuming that, either by reason of the land coming into the city, or because the subsequent amendment extending it to townships should be held to be retroactive (I think it should not, Gooderham v. City of Toronto[27]), this statutory provision would apply to the plan annexed to the Henderson deed, if otherwise within it, I am of the opinion that the legislature did not mean to give to the preparation of surveyors\u2019 sketches such as that in question, made merely to ensure accuracy of description, the effect of dedication as public highways of any private lanes or streets shewn thereon. This ground of appeal, which is not referred to in the judgments below or in the reasons for appeal to the Court of Appeal, and is said to be now taken for the first time, cannot, I think, be maintained.\nBut counsel for the appellant relied most strongly on a provision of the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act,\u201d 50 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 5; R.S.O., 1887, ch. 100, sec. 12. The material parts of this section, as quoted in the appellant\u2019s factum, are as follows:\u2014\nEvery conveyance of land, unless an exception is specially made therein, shall be held and construed to include all * * * ways * * * easements * * * and appurtenances whatsoever, to the lands therein comprised, belonging or in any wise appertaining, or with the same demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed, or taken or known as part or parcel thereof.\nHis counsel contends that this legislation imported into the conveyance from Mrs. Patrick to Helen McCully (21 Nov. 1887), under which the defendant claims, a grant of a right-of-way over the land in question.\nThe whole effect of this statutory provision is that every conveyance to which it applies, unless it contains an express exception, is to be read as if the words set out in the section formed part of the description of the premises conveyed.\nThaddeus Patrick owned the entire lot, No. 22, which comprised the lands lying to the south and east of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d (now the property of the plaintiff), the land lying to the north (now the property of the defendant) and also \u201cAncroft Place\u201d itself. In selling the lands to the south and east he and his wife, who succeeded him in title, gave to their grantees, rights of way over \u201cAncroft Place\u201d to be enjoyed by them and their successors in title in common with the owners of other abutting lands. The last of the conveyances of these lands\u2014that from Mrs. Patrick to Henderson, made in July 1884\u2014contains these clauses, which follow the description of the lands conveyed:\u2014\nTogether with the free and uninterrupted use and right-of-way at all times in perpetuity to the said James Henderson his heirs or assigns and his and their servants in, over and upon the said street fifty feet wide in common with the said Rachel Patrick her heirs and assigns and the persons to whom she or her late husband has already or may hereafter grant any part of said lot twenty-two abutting on said street. The said described lands hereby granted and the said street (fifty feet wide) are shewn on the surveyor\u2019s diagram hereunto annexed.\nTo have and to hold unto the said party of the second part his heirs and assigns to and for his and their sole and only use forever.\nTogether with the right at any time after one year from the date hereof to register the plan of sub-division of said lot twenty-two as hereunto annexed and shewing when registered the land hereby granted to the said James Henderson and the said fifty feet street and for that purpose to use and sign the name of the said Rachel Patrick and her assigns.\nAnd also the following:\u2014\nAnd the said party of the first part hereby further covenants with the said party of the second part that upon any laying out or plotting of said lot twenty-two and upon any plan thereof whether for the purposes of registration or otherwise the said street of the full width of fifty feet shall he laid down and appear as the same is shewn on the hereunto annexed diagram.\nThis latter covenant conferred rights only upon the grantee Henderson and his successors in title to the property conveyed to him. The defendant is not an assignee of it and it is not so annexed to the land to the north of Ancroft Place that the benefit of it would pass by a mere conveyance of that land. Reid v. Bickerstaff[28].\nThe provision authorizing Henderson to register the plan and to use the name of Rachel Patrick and her assigns for that purpose has never been acted upon. The presence of these clauses in the Henderson deed, however, and the special grant to him of a right of way on the fifty-foot \u201cstreet\u201d makes clear the intention of the parties to it that \u201cAncroft Place\u201d should not become a public highway by virtue of what was then being done. As a result of the several deeds to Elwell, Davis and Henderson of the southern and eastern parcels, Mrs. Patrick remained the owner in fee of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d subject to the rights-of-way over it which she and her husband had given to these grantees. The words of reservation in the Henderson grant in favour of Mrs. Patrick and subsequent grantees of the portion of the lot which she still held lying to the north of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d were perhaps inserted ex majori cautel\u00e2 to preclude any possible claim by the grantees of the southern and eastern parts of lot 22 that they had amongst them an exclusive right-of-way over this private street. They probably also expressed Mrs. Patrick\u2019s intention at that time with regard to the northern part of the lot she retained. But they certainly did not in any way bind her to make use of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d for the purposes of ingress and egress in connection with the land which she retained, or to give that right to her subsequent grantee or grantees.\nAs the owner of the fee in \u201cAncroft Place\u201d Mrs. Patrick could not have an easement over it. While she held it and also the adjoining land to the north there could not be in respect of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d\na way, easement or appurtenance (to that adjoining land) belonging or in any wise appertaining, or with the same demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed; nor, in my opinion, could there then be \u201ca way, easement or appurtenance\u201d over \u201cAncroft Place\u201d \u201ctaken or known as part or parcel of\u201d such adjoining lands. Her ownership of the fee in \u201cAncroft Place\u201d was inconsistent with the existence of any such way, easement or appurtenance in connection with adjoining land also owned by her. It might probably be held on that ground alone that the statutory provision invoked by the appellant did not give to the conveyance from Mrs. Patrick to Mrs. McCully the effect of carrying to the latter the right of way which the defendant now claims to be appurtenant to the land which she bought.\nIt should be noted that the Ontario statute does not contain the words \u201cor reputed to appertain\u201d which follow the word \u201cappertaining\u201d in the English \u201cConveyancing Act.\u201d The English statute might well be taken to include so called \u201cquasi-easements\u201d which would not pass under the language of the Ontario Act.\nThe earlier portions of the section of the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act\u201d above quoted clearly do not aid the defendant to substantiate his claim. But he places special reliance on the concluding words \u201ctaken or known as part or parcel thereof,\u201d on an assumption that under them something may pass which is not legally \u201ca way, easement or appurtenance\u201d because exercised over land in which the fee belongs to the owner of the tenement to which such \u201cway, easement or appurtenance,\u201d if it had a legal existence as such, would belong or appertain. The basis of the appellant\u2019s argument, so far as I am able to understand it, is that if the owner of two adjoining parcels of land\u2014A and B\u2014uses parcel B as a means of ingress and egress to and from parcel A, his exercise of that right over parcel B may be regarded as some- thing in the nature of a quasi-easement \u201ctaken or known as part or parcel of\u201d parcel A. Assuming that these latter words imported by the statute are susceptible of such a construction\u2014I think they are not\u2014in order to determine whether they accomplish what the appellant maintains they do it becomes necessary to consider the conditions which obtained on the ground at or before the time Mrs. McCully bought from Mrs. Patrick (and perhaps immediately afterwards), in regard to the existence or user of \u201cAncroft Place\u201d as a means of access to the property now owned by the defendant. International Tea Stores Co. v. Hobbs[29]; Brown v. Alabaster[30].\nDr. McCully says that when he bought for his wife, in 1887, the land now owned by the defendant it was fenced along \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d He says there was a bar or slat gate on the Maple Avenue frontage, but makes no allusion to any opening in the fence along \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d While Mrs. McCully held this land there were no buildings on it. James Dickson, who bought from Mrs. McCully in 1888, says that the south side of the property was then enclosed by a rough rail fence with no entry to \u201cAncroft Place\u201d (then Rachel Street). James Lovack, who built the fence on the north side of Rachel Street in 1876 or 1877 says it was \u201cjust a common fence, straight along, upright boards.\u201d He does not suggest that there was any gate or opening through it to Rachel Street. These witnesses were all called for the defendant. The only witness who speaks of an opening in the fence in question at this period is one White who says he pastured a cow on what is now the defendant\u2019s lot in 1876-7 and again in 1892-3. But White says he never knew the lane or street by any other name than \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d Yet it was called Rachel Street until about 1894. White speaks of the pasture as being \u201cthrough Ancroft Place\u201d\u2014\u201dEast.\u201d He says he pastured in the same field in 1892 as in 1876-7, and he speaks of the pasture field of 1892 as being \u201cat the end of Ancroft Place\u201d\u2014\u201deast of Ancroft Place.\u201d He says when he first pastured there, in 1876-7, the fence was \u201cbroken down.\u201d But in fact the rail fence put up by Lovack was at that time newly built. White\u2019s story that he took a cow in through a gate made of bars or slats in a fence on the north side of Rachel Street in 1876 or 1877 appears to be quite unreliable. It may be that he refers to a later period after Dickson had bought and, in place of the old wooden fence, had erected a wire fence in which he put a gate; or that he went in at the eastern end of Rachel Street through the property afterwards bought by Henderson; or possibly that he went in on the north side, after the fence built by Lovack had become \u201cbroken down,\u201d through some gap made in it by the ravages of time, or possibly by himself as a trespasser. He gives no account of any right which he had to go upon or use this land as a pasture prior to Dickson\u2019s ownership. His evidence is quite insufficient to displace that of Lovack, who built the fence in 1876-7; of McCully, who bought in 1887 and says he was very anxious about the right of access to Rachel Street and that he made many careful inspections of the property before purchasing (neither of whom suggested that there was any gateway in the fence); and of Mr. Dickson, who says that when he bought from McCully in 1888 there was no entry in the fence forming the boundary between the property which he purchased and Rachel Street. The defendant has, in my opinion, failed to shew that at or prior to the time of Mrs. McCully\u2019s purchase (or immediately afterwards, if that would suffice), \u201cAncroft Place\u201d was used as a means of egress and ingress in connection with the land conveyed to her or that there was anything upon the premises to indicate to a purchaser of that land that a right of way over \u201cAncroft Place\u201d would pass with it. Moreover, upon this question of pure fact the appellant is confronted with the adverse findings of the trial judge and the unanimous Court of Appeal. Were the evidence supporting them less clear than it is these findings could not be lightly set aside. The provision of the \u201cLaw and Transfer of Property Act\u201d which the defendant invokes, even if construed as he contends it should be, does not assist him to establish his claim.\nHis counsel placed some reliance on a statement which Dr. McCully says was made to him by the \u201cagent\u201d through whom he bought from Mrs. Patrick, to the effect that Rachel Street was a public highway. The name of the agent is not given and there is no attempt made to shew that it was within the scope of any authority which he may have had from Mrs. Patrick to make such a representation. Dr. McCully says this agent was the solicitor in whose office the transaction was carried out.\nFinally some reliance was placed on the plan annexed to the Henderson deed as creating some sort of equitable estoppel. But there is no evidence that Dr. McCully, or any one acting for him or his wife, ever saw or knew of the existence of that plan. The Henderson deed is not in the chain of title to the property which Mrs. McCully bought and it may well be that her solicitor in searching title, if any such search was made, would not see that deed or the plan annexed to it. There is absolutely nothing to shew that any reliance was placed upon it at the time of the McCully purchase.\nThe description of the land conveyed in the deed from Mrs. Patrick to Mrs. McCully contains no reference to Rachel Street, which is not even given as a boundary of it. Having regard to the anxiety which Dr. McCully says he then felt and manifested as to the availability of Rachel Street as a means of access to his wife\u2019s property, this omission is, to say the least, singular. If it indicates anything, it is that Mrs. Patrick had abandoned any intention she may ever have had of giving to the grantee of the land lying to the north of Rachel Street a right of way over it.\nOn the whole case there does not appear to be any tangible ground on which the defendant can rest a legal claim to a right of way over \u201cAncroft Place.\u201d\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Montgomery, Fleury & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ritchie, Ludwig & Ballantyne.\n[1] 23 Ont.

That the insured in his application concealed a material fact, namely, that he had previously suffered loss by fire in his business. That the action was barred by a condition in the policy requiring it to be brought within six months from the date of the fire. This was a variation from the statutory condition that it must be brought within twelve months.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (29 Ont. L.R. 356) that the evidence established the value of the stock at the time of the fire to be as represented by the insured; that the materiality to the risk of the non-disclosure of a former loss by fire was a question of fact for the judge at the trial who properly held it to be immaterial; and that the question whether or not the variation from the statutory conditions was just and reasonable depended on the circumstances of the case, and the courts below rightly held that it was not.\nHeld, per Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014That the insured having supplied on demand, duplicate copies of the invoices of goods purchased between the last stock-taking and the time of the fire as well as copies of the stock-taking itself, was not obliged to comply with a further demand for invoices of purchases prior to said stock-taking.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the cases were not in dispute. The questions at issue to be decided are stated in the above head-note.\nDuVernet K.C. and Heighington for the appellants. The trial judge should not have held that the non-disclosure of the previous fire was not material to the risk. An insurance company is entitled to knowledge of such a fact in order to refuse the risk if so inclined. See Western Assur. Co. v. Harrison[2]. And evidence of other insurers should not have been admitted. Thames and Mersey Marine Ins. Co v. \u201cGunford\u201d Ship Co.[3], at page 538. As to materiality see also Ionides v. Pender[4]; Gillis v. Canada Fire Assurance Co.[5]\nIn many cases a six months\u2019 limitation of action has been held just and reasonable. See Home Ins. Co. v. Victoria-Montreal Fire Ins. Co.[6], and cases re- ferred to in May on Fire Insurance, ed. of 1900, vol. 2, page 1146.\nRowell K.C. and George Kerr for the respondents, referred to Hartney v. North British Fire Ins. Co.[7]; Prairie City Oil Co. v. Standard Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[8]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the purposes of this appeal the two cases were consolidated.\nThe questions involved relate chiefly to: 1o. the materiality of the misrepresentation of the insured in his application for insurance with respect to a former fire; 2o. the amount and value of the goods insured; 3o. the variation in the policies proscribing legal proceedings after a period of six months.\nThe question of the materiality in a contract of insurance is declared by the Ontario Act (sec. 156, sub-sec. 6) to be a question of fact for the jury, or for the court if there is no jury as in this case, and the learned trial judge found that the representation was not material. On appeal that question was disposed of by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in two paragraphs of his judgment which I adopt and incorporate here as the exact expression of my own views.\nThe circumstances relied on by the learned trial judge for coming to that conclusion are fully stated in his reasons for judgment, and it is unnecessary to repeat them or to say more than that I am unable to say that he erred in so deciding.\nIt may be observed, in view of the importance that counsel for the appellants contended was attached by insurance companies to the information which was sought to be obtained by the question as to the applicant for insurance having had property destroyed by fire, that no such question was asked by the Crown Life Insurance Company. The rule seems to be now well settled that the evidence of underwriters and insurance brokers as to materiality is admissible (17 Halsbury, page 412, No. 805) and the evidence of Messrs. McLean, Curry and Nichols amply justifies the conclusion reached by the trial judge that the misrepresentation was not material.\nI would also refer on this branch of the case to the \u201cMarine Insurance Act\u201d (Imp.), 1906, 6 Edw. VII., ch. 41, sec. 18 (4) and (7).\nTo what the Chief Justice said I would merely add that Mr. DuVernet\u2019s very lucid and frank analysis of the evidence has convinced me that in the answer given to the question as to the other fires there was no lack of bona fides on the part of the assured, but rather a bon\u00e2 fide mistake as to the nature of the information which the question was intended to elicit. If the incident is open to two constructions the court ought to adopt that construction which is most favourable to the assured (Anstey v. British Natural Premium Life Association)[9], and certainly the concurrent findings of the two courts below conclude that question on this appeal. (D. 80, 1, 410; S.V. 81, 1, 223.)\nI am also satisfied on the evidence that the stock-in-trade on hand at the time of the fire exceeded in value the amount of the insurance carried by Jeffrey. He took stock in August, 1910, and I agree with the courts below that the evidence establishes it was well and accurately taken. I attach great importance to the corroborative evidence of the commercial travellers whose business it is to estimate the amount of stock carried by their customers. If the stock list then made is accepted as a safe point of departure, there is very little in dispute as to the amounts of the purchases and sales made from that time up to the date of the fire. Mr. Grant, the appellants\u2019 adjuster, admits, on the assumption that the stock was honestly taken in August, 1910, that there would be on hand in the store at the time of the fire goods of a value substantially in excess of the total amount of insurance. Mr. Gordon, another of the appellants\u2019 adjusters, is of the same opinion. In the presence of such evidence the appeal must fail on that point also.\nThe reasonableness of the variation in the prescription clause is so fully and learnedly discussed in the light of the decided cases by the Chief Justice of Ontario, that it would be mere presumption to attempt to add anything to what he has said. I would merely refer to Home Insurance Co. of New York v. Victoria-Montreal Fire Ins. Co.[10], and Planiol, vol. 2, No. 2158, 3rd ed.\nI would dismiss these appeals with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014These appeals from the judgments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for Ontario were heard together, there being one appeal book only and the defence of both companies appellants to the actions against them being the same.\nThe judgments appealed from affirmed that of the trial judge who heard the case twice and who gave judgment for the plaintiff against each of the defendant companies after the second hearing for the amounts insured by them under their respective policies of insurance with interest and costs of all proceedings subsequent to the time of the delivery of his first judgment on the 2nd January, 1912. Three principal grounds of objection to the judgment appealed from were stated and argued at not unreasonable length.\nThe first ground was the alleged fraudulent valuation of the goods destroyed by the fire; the second, the reasonableness of the variation of statutory condition 22 as to the time allowed for bringing suit against the company for the recovery of claims under the policies; and the third the avoidance of the policy in each company by an alleged misrepresentation in the applications for insurance.\nAs to the first ground, the fraudulent over-valuation of the goods destroyed by the fire, I agree fully with the findings of the learned trial judge, who had the advantage of hearing the case tried before him twice, confirmed by the Appellate Division, that the charge of over-valuation is unfounded.\nThere had been a stock-taking by Jeffrey, the insured and owner of the goods, in the month of August preceding the December fire. The evidence shewed clearly that this stock-taking was participated in by all of the employees of the insured, as well as by Jeffrey himself, that the quantities and values of the goods were taken down at first upon sheets of paper which were handed in by each of the employees to Jeffrey and then by him and one of his assistants copied into three stock books. Before, however, it was so transcribed into these books these stock sheets were seen by the companies\u2019 own agent, Gillespie, who took the applications for the policies sued upon; and he states that the amount of stock as shewn by these original stock sheets was $24,000, or thereabouts.\nThere were, it is true, some conflicting estimates made from general observation of the stock by com- mercial travellers of the value of the goods upon the shelves and in the store as they \u201csized them up,\u201d to use the expression of one of them, after the August stock-taking and before the fire in December. Some of these estimates agreed substantially with the result of the stock\u2011taking while others were much below it.\nI have, as requested by Mr. DuVernet in his argument, gone carefully through all the evidence called to our attention by him on this material question and read much not specially referred to; and the result is that I agree with the findings of the trial judge concurred in by the Appellate Division that \u201cthe stock-taking in August, 1910, was well and accurately done and its results carried honestly and carefully into the three books constituting Exhibit 6,\u201d. and. further, that \u201cat the time of the fire there was in the store approximately $25,000 worth of goods, estimated at cost prices.\u201d\nThese two findings concurred in by the Appellate Division, and upon the correctness of which I cannot find evidence sufficient to cast reasonable doubt, dispose at once of the whole charge of fraudulent overvaluation.\nIf the stock-taking in August was an honest one, as I hold it was, there cannot be any reasonable doubt under the evidence as to the daily sales between then and the date of the fire and the purchases of goods between these dates that the value of the stock at the time of the fire was substantially in excess of $21,000, the total amount of insurance.\nAs to compliance by the assured with the conditions of the policies relating to furnishing proofs of loss, I need only say that I fully agree with the findings of the trial judge concurred in by the Appellate Division that these conditions were fully complied with when on the 17th March, 1911, Jeffrey delivered to the companies, in accordance with their request, copies of the stock-taking in August with duplicate copies of the invoices of all goods purchased between such stock\u2011taking and the date of the fire. I do not think the further demands of the companies for other invoices of purchases before the stock-taking were reasonable and I agree that complete proofs of loss were delivered on that date, 17th March, 1911.\nIn 60 days afterwards the claims became payable. The actions brought before that date were premature, but those brought on December 20th,1911, were in time, on my conclusion with respect to the variation clause as to time.\nThen comes the question of the reasonableness of the variation of the statutory condition absolutely barring every action, suit or proceeding, for the recovery of any claim under the policy \u201cunless commenced within six months after the loss or damage shall have occurred.\u201d\nI concur in the conclusions of law reached by the Appellate Division on this point which is in accordance with the judgment of this court in Eckhardt & Co. v. The Lancashire Ins. Co.[11], that the justice and reasonableness of a variation or addition must be determined upon the circumstances of the case in which it is sought to be applied. Applying that test to the case before us, I have no difficulty in concurring with the trial judge and the Appellate Division that the variation reducing to six months from the happening of the loss the twelve months allowed by the statutory conditions for bringing the action is not reasonable or just.\nThe fire happened on the 25th December, 1910. The original proofs of loss were delivered shortly afterwards. In my opinion, the companies were entitled to demand further proofs of the loss and I think those supplied to them on the 17th March, 1911, complied with the demand to the full extent of the insured\u2019s duty and that the still further proofs demanded of all invoices of goods purchased by him before his stock-taking in August, 1910, from the time he began business, or of duplicates thereof, were not such proofs as he was bound to furnish. If it was held that he was bound to comply with all the companies\u2019 demands in this regard, it is at least doubtful whether he could have satisfactorily furnished them in time to have brought his action within the six months of the variation clause and goes to shew how unreasonable the limitation is.\nThe first action was commenced on the 26th April, 1911, and in my view was, therefore, prematurely brought. The second action was begun on the 20th December, 1911, and was in time if the statutory condition 22 is applicable, but too late if the variation was held reasonable. As I hold the variation clause unreasonable the second action was in time.\nThere remains the question whether the policies were avoided by the negative answer given to the question in the applications for insurance, \u201cHave you ever had any property destroyed by fire?\u201d The fact that the applicant signed the application in blank requesting the agent to fill it up and that the agent did so in accordance with a similar answer in another application to another company given to him by Jeffrey does not enable the applicant to escape the effect of his answer. The answer must be taken to be his own. Nor do I give much weight to Mr. Rowell\u2019s argument rather faintly pressed that although, as a fact, the applicant Jeffrey had suffered a previous fire the loss had been occasioned by smoke from the fire and not by actual contact with the flames or heat. I prefer to base my judgment on the ground that the question of the materiality of the answer made by Jeffrey to the question, though technically and literally inaccurate, was one of fact for the jury, or for the court, if there is no jury, to determine. Would the literal facts, if given truly in the answer, have increased in the judgment of the companies the moral risk and influenced them to refuse the risk? The trial judge decided that under the circumstances the answer was not material. The previous fire, if it could be dignified with that name, was a very small affair and took place years previously not on the premises where the fire in question in this action took place, but amongst some rubbish in the cellar of a building occupied by Jeffrey in another town in which he then carried on his business. There was a good deal of smoke which damaged some goods. The company which had insurance on the goods damaged investigated the facts, paid some $350 for damages and continued on their insurance. The learned trial judge goes fully into the facts and reasons for the conclusion reached by him and the Appellate Division concurs with him. I am not able to say that both courts were wrong.\nThere was a cross appeal by the respondent as to the disposition made of the costs; but in view of the conclusion I have reached as to the first action having been prematurely brought I see no reason to interfere with the disposition made of the costs. The appeal and cross-appeal should both be dismissed, each with costs in this court.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree that the impeached variation from the statutory conditions was not just and reasonable within the meaning of the Act. That is the only point to which it is necessary to refer specifically.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN and BRODEUR JJ. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Heighington, Macklem & Shaver.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Kerr, Bull, Shaw & Montgomery.\n[1] 29 Ont.

The plaintiff bases his claim upon a contract which he alleges he entered into with the defendant and his associate Garnham in the Spring of 1911, by which they agreed that if the plaintiff would assist them in selling certain lands in respect of which they then had a contract of purchase with the British Columbia Government they would remunerate him. The land in question comprises about 7,000 acres in the northern part of British Columbia. These lands had been surveyed by the plaintiff under contract with the Government. In the preceding Autumn the plaintiff, acting for the defendant and his associate, had applied for the purchase of the lands in the names of different persons\u2014 there were ten or twelve parcels in all\u2014nominated by them; and the applications having been accepted he had procured the execution of conveyances by the applicants to the defendant Mcintosh in trust for Garnham and Mcintosh. For this the appellant was paid 25 cents an acre. Later, in the Spring of 1911, according to the plaintiff's story, Mcintosh and Garnham made the further arrangement already mentioned upon which the action was brought.\nIt is perfectly obvious that the scheme entered upon and successfully carried out by Mcintosh and Garnham, through the agency of the plaintiff, was a fraud upon the \"Land Act.\" The conditions upon which surveyed public lands might be purchased, in 1910, were those laid down in sections 34 and 36 of the \"Land Act\" of 1908; and one of those conditions is expressed in sub\u2014section 11 of section 34, in the following words:\u2014\n34.\u2014(11) No person who has given notice that he has applied for permission to purchase lands under the provisions of this section shall be entitled to give notice of his intention to apply for permission to purchase any other lands under the provisions of this section until after he shall have either abandoned his application for permission to purchase or acquired a Crown grant of the lands for which he had previously given notice of his intention to apply for permission to purchase, and shall have obtained a certificate from the Commissioner that he has improved the said land to the extent of three dollars per acre; land which is bona fide cultivated shall be deemed to be improved land, and in other respects section 22 of this Act shall apply: Provided always, that no person shall purchase more than one tract of land, of whatever extent, under this section, until the above\u2014mentioned improvements have been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\nMcIntosh, Garnham and the plaintiff would not, of course, be entitled to purchase, under the provisions of this section, more than three separate tracts of land without having complied with the conditions as to improvements. The plan adopted to evade these provisions was to make a number of applications in the names of the nominees of Mcintosh and Garnham. There can be no question that the real applicants were Mcintosh and Garnham. The scheme was to obtain Crown grants of these lands in violation of the provisions of the statute, although in professed compliance with them, and then sell the lands to purchasers, who, in the ordinary course, would know nothing of the contrivance that had been resorted to. Any agreement entered into for the purpose of carrying out or facilitating the carrying out of this fraud upon the \"Land Act\" would be an agreement which it would be the duty of the courts to refuse to enforce as soon as the character of it should become apparent. The contract set up by the plaintiff under which he agreed to assist in the sale of the lands is necessarily tainted by the character of the scheme as a whole. It follows that the action ought to be dismissed. For these reasons I concur in dismissing the appeal with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014The purchaser who bought the property, on the sale of which the plaintiff claims a commission, was introduced to the defendant and his partner by one Jones, an agent employed by them, to whom they paid the ordinary commission on the sale.\nI fail to find in the record any evidence that the defendant ever agreed with the plaintiff to pay him for assisting in the sale of this property a commission or a remuneration in addition to the 25 cents an acre paid him for procuring the property for the defendant and his partner and furnishing them with reports and information concerning it. Neither do I find evidence of any request from the defendant and his partner, or either of them, that the plaintiff should render the services in respect of which he sues from which, in the circumstances of this case, a promise to pay him for those services should be inferred as a matter of law.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J. concurred with Duff J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St. John & Jackson.\n[1] 3 West.

The bank consented to the sale of the ship, by the liquidator, free from incumbrances at the same time as he sold the other assets of the company by direction of the court. He sold the ship separately and free from incumbrances for $5,000, which was credited, as a special fund, in his accounts. The bank subsequently filed its claim, valuing its security on the ship at $5,000. The purchasers took the ship to sea and it became a total loss. The bank then made claim to the whole of the fund realized on the sale of the ship and their claim was opposed on behalf of the wage lien-holders claiming the right to be paid by priority out of this fund.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (4 West. W.R. 1271; 25 West. L.R. 92; 12 D.L.R. 807) that by its consent to the sale of the ship under direction of the court, free from incumbrances, the bank had assented to the conversion thereof released from its mortgage and that the proceeds of the sale of the ship should be apportioned amongst the creditors in the order and according to the priorities provided by law; consequently it was not entitled to any special charge on the fund realized upon its sale. Held, further, that the rights of the wage-earners holding maritime liens were not affected by the loss of the ship after it had been sold by the liquidator under the order of the court and that they were entitled to recover their claims out of the fund realized upon the sale of the ship in priority to the mortgagee.\n[MEMO.\u2014The court ordered that the rights of the bank, if any, to relief, by way of subrogation or marshalling of securities, should be reserved to be dealt with on further proceedings in the winding-up of the company.]\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal, by the present appellant, from certain orders by Clement J., in the matter of the winding-up of the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company made, respectively, on the 15th, 22nd and 27th of January, 1913.\nA statement of the case is given in the head-note. The orders in respect of which the appeal is asserted are recited in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff, at page 600 of this report.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. The right and title of the bank in the \"Chilco\" was never divested. No \"assignment and delivery\" of the mortgage was required or made pursuant to section 77 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" or at all. The vessel being valued at $5,000, and that being all that could be got for her, the liquidator had no interest in her, but for convenience she was sold with the other assets of the company, the liquidator in selling her acting on behalf of the bank. The $5,000 paid by the purchaser was the money of the bank, and no question of indemnity arose as no claim was made by the seamen under their liens before the loss of the ship, and by her loss the liens ceased to exist.\nThe liquidator has no power to make a sale which would divest the liens of the seamen; he represented the company, not its creditors. See In re Clinton Thresher Co.[2], per Boyd C., and In re Longdendale Cotton Spinning Co.[3], per Jessel M.R., speaking of the rights of a person having a charge by virtue of mortgage against property of a company in liquidation; also 2 Palmer's Company Precedents (10 ed.), p. 385, and Keighly, Maxsted & Co. v. Durant[4].\nAt all events, the seamen could not hold, as they did, their liens upon the ship till she goes down, and then contend that, the security having gone, they would elect to treat the sale as made on their behalf and ask for payment of their liens out of the purchase price. Assuming that they might, before the loss of the ship, have elected to treat the purchase price as representing the ship and enforce their liens then, they cannot do so after the loss of the ship because at the time when they came forward to so enforce their liens they had no liens.\nThe seamen were entitled, to the extent of $3,152.15, to rank as preferred creditors by virtue of section 70 of the \"Winding-up Act\" and the effect of taking the security held by the bank to pay the seamen is that the bank is forced, by reason of the liens, to pay off the preferred creditors, and upon no equitable principle can this enure to the benefit of the general creditors. If the order charging the seamen's wages upon the $5,000 which, but for such wages, would have been paid over to the bank, was correct then the order should have worked out the equitable rights of the bank by subrogating it to the rights of the seamen as preferred creditors.\nAssuming that it is regarded that there was an assignment and delivery of the security to the liquidator within the meaning of section 77 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" and that the liquidator realized such security, the order charging the liens upon the proceeds of the sale and thereby diverting the money which would otherwise have gone to the bank should provide for payment of the $5,000 to the bank out of the general assets.\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the liquidator, respondent. The liquidator has, throughout the proceedings, considered himself as custodian and trustee of the $5,000, proceeds of the sale of the \"Chilco,\" and has been and is prepared to pay it, or any part of it, to whomsoever the court decides to be entitled thereto. The liquidator objects to being joined as a respondent in this appeal; and he is improperly referred to as a respondent, the matter in dispute being a question between the appellant and the class represented by the respondent McInnes; no order has been made joining the liquidator as a party.\nThe ship was sold, with the consent of the court, without incumbrances, the liquidator at that time having no knowledge of the existence of the maritime liens; the claims on that account were presented after the sale and before the loss of the ship. The sale was free from incumbrances as to the purchasers, but the court has held that this did not relieve the proceeds of the sale from being charged with any lien attaching to the ship. With reference to the costs incurred by the proceedings taken by way of appeal in this court and in the lower courts, the liquidator submits that, as the dispute is one between the appellant and the wageearners over a separate fund, these costs should not be borne by the general estate, but out of the separate fund affected; the moneys realized from the sale of the general assets should not be liable for these costs; it would be inequitable to permit these costs to be chargeable against the preferred creditors who are not parties to the dispute, and they have not had an opportunity of appearing in these appeal proceedings.\nChrysler K.C. for the wage-earners, respondents. In the Court of Appeal it was admitted that the wageearners were entitled to a maritime lien on the ship at the time of her sale. The only question now involved is as to priority of the claims of the lien-holders or mortgagees to the $5,000 received from her sale, the price being insufficient to satisfy both claims.\nIf there had been no winding-up order made, and the mortgagees had proceeded under their mortgage, the seamen's lien would have attached to the moneys secured by the sale of the vessel. The \"Hope\"[5]. How can the position of the parties be reversed and the mortgagee secure a priority over the lien of the seamen by electing to participate in the winding-up?\nWhen a company is being wound-up the proper procedure for the master and seamen is to place their claims in the hands of the liquidator, and participate in the winding-up, instead of proceeding in rem. In re Australian Direct Steam Navigation Co.[6], per Jessel M.R., at page 327; In re Rio Grande do Sul Steamship Company[7], per Brett J., at page 285. In an action for winding-up the seamen are entitled to priority over the mortgagees for the proceeds of the sale of a vessel of the company being wound-up. In re The Great Eastern Steamship Co.[8].\nThe lien for wages was not lost by any slight delay there may have been in setting forth the claims and there is no evidence before the court that there was any such delay. Munsen et al. v. The \"Comrade\"[9]. The money realized from the sale of the \"Chilco\" is still in the hands of the liquidator, who is an officer of the court. The \"Chieftain\"[10].\nAs to the contention that the seamen's lien followed the vessel and became extinct when it was wrecked and became a total loss, see Re \"Dawson\"[11].\nThe relationship which the liquidator bears the creditor is that of a trustee. He, without the knowledge or consent of the wage-earners, disposed of the ship, on which they had a maritime lien, for the sum of $5,000, and he is governed by the legal principles controlling a trustee. In re Oriental Inland Steam Company[12], per James L.J., at page 559, and Mellish L.J., at page 560; Lewin on Trusts (12 ed.), 1150, sec. 2; Taylor v. Plumer[13], per Lord Ellenborough, at pages 574 and 575.\nSince the liquidator disposed of the ship, without the knowledge or consent of the wage-earners, and the money received has been kept by him in a separate account, that money is to be considered as the ship itself, and the seamen are entitled to be paid out of that fund in priority to all other claims. Moreover, the ship was sold under an order of the court and, therefore, was free from incumbrance so that no lien could follow the vessel into the hands of the new purchasers.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and DAVIES J. agreed with Duff J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Upon the application of the respondent, assented to by the appellant, in a winding-up proceeding, a vessel was sold free from incumbrances under an order of the court and, as a result thereof, it was taken from where, but for this sale, it should have remained and was totally wrecked.\nThe contention that thereby the rights of those having a lien on that so absolutely sold by order of the court and so dealt with are not only extinguished, but that the benefit of such extinction is to enure entirely to one of the prime movers in such a proceeding involves some strange conception of what law and courts of justice are for.\nYet to give effect to such a contention seems to be the chief if not the sole aim of this appeal.\nIf the appellant had sold by virtue of its mortgage, or by order of a court enforcing it, the absolute property in the vessel, these prior liens would have come out of the purchase money; or if it had been sold subject to such liens it would only have realized so much less.\nBut why need I labour with such a question? The appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons (so far as necessary for his decision) assigned by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, speaking for the majority of the court. The time has not arrived for dealing with any equities the appellant may have as against others (who are not before us) than the lien-holders classed as wage-earners now before us.\nDUFF J.\u2014This is an appeal brought by the Traders Bank of Canada against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of British Columbia dismissing its appeal from three orders of the Honourable Mr. Justice Clement, dated, respectively, the 15th day of January, 1913, the 22nd of January, 1913, and the 27th day of January, 1913.\nThe Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company, Limited, was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and empowered, inter alia, to carry on a general logging, lumbering and transportation business and, in connection with its business, owned and operated a number of river steamships on the inland waters of the province.\nUpon the application of certain creditors the company was, by order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, bearing date the 4th day of January, 1911, ordered to be wound up under the provisions of the \"Winding-up Act,\" R.S.C. ch. 144.\nBy a further order, dated the 23rd of January, 1911, the respondent, Herbert Lockwood, was appointed official liquidator and was directed to call for tenders for the purchase of the assets of the company in liquidation.\nThe assets comprised mill and camp equipment, machinery of various kinds, and certain river steamships, and these were at the time of the winding-up in various places in the neighbourhood of Fort George and Ashcroft. Included in them was the steamship \"Chilco,\" upon which the appellant, the Traders Bank, held a mortgage to secure the sum of $10,000.\nAt the time of the winding-up order the. \"Chilco\" was imbedded in the ice in the Upper Fraser River and there was grave danger of her becoming a total loss when the ice broke up in the Spring of the year.\nPursuant to the order directing the sale of the assets, the liquidator advertised for tenders for the purchase of them, which advertisement included the steamship \"Chilco\" and equipment.\nPursuant to the said advertisement the two material tenders received were:\u2014\n1. A tender for the whole of the assets of the company, at a price of $65,100.\n2. A tender, at the price of $37,500 plus $25,000 and interest (the sum alleged to be due the purchasers on certain mortgages held by them on the assets of the company), making in all $62,500 and interest.\nAfter consultation with the committee of creditors of the company, and on behalf of the liquidator, it was arranged with the agents of the purchasers, John K. McLennan and Allan J. Adamson, that they should offer to purchase separately the steamship \"Chilco\" and equipment, which offer was made by the purchasers, and the liquidator accepted their offer to purchase the steamship for $5,000; thus bringing the total price the purchasers were to pay for the assets of the company, exclusive of book debts, to about the sum of $67,500. The appellant, the Traders Bank, was consulted and approved of the sale of the steamship for the price of $5,000, it being set out in the liquidator's acceptance of the offer of purchase that the liquidator made no guarantee as to the present existence of the steamship \"Chilco.\"\nThe appellant, when asked by the respondent liquidator if it would consent to a sale of the steamer \"Chilco\" for the sum mentioned, gave its consent.\nBy order of the Chief Justice, dated 5th March, 1911, the liquidator was directed to sell the said assets upon the terms of the said offer and acceptance, which sale was carried out as directed, and the separate sum of $ 5,000 was agreed to be paid over by the purchasers to the liquidator for the steamship \"Chilco,\" which sum of $5,000 was duly credited to the company in liquidation.\nAs directed by the court, and in the usual course of the winding-up proceedings, the respondent liquidator advertised for creditors of the company, and the appellant (by its manager in the City of Vancouver, Arthur Romaine Heiter) filed with the liquidator an affidavit, dated 1st April, 1911, whereby the appellant claimed to be a creditor of the company (among other claims) on a demand note for $10,000 and interest, and, further, stated that the appellant held as security for payment of the said note a mortgage on the steamship \"Chilco,\" which the said appellant, the Traders Bank, valued at $5,000.\nThe purchasers took possession of the steamship and, in attempting to take the ship to Quesnel, it was wrecked, on or about the 27th April, 1911, and became a total loss.\nMaritime liens were then advanced by the respondent McInnes and the class of creditors he represents and they claimed preference on the proceeds of the sale of the steamship. The appellant, the Traders Bank, claimed to be entitled absolutely to this $5,000. By order, dated the 26th April, 1911, an inquiry before the district registrar at Vancouver was directed to ascertain, inter alia, what persons had earned wages upon the steamship \"Chilco\" and were still unpaid, the amount of such wages, and how much thereof was earned three months prior to the winding-up of the company.\nBy order, dated the 16th January, 1912, the said inquiry was extended to ascertain, inter alia, what maritime liens there were, if any, affecting the steamship \"Chilco\" at the date of its sale, and whether any and, if so, which of said liens were then and are now chargeable \"upon the proceeds of the sale of the steamship 'Chilco'.\"\nPursuant to these orders the said inquiries were held and the report of the district registrar, dated 9th January, 1913, sets out his findings.\nHis report contained a finding that certain claimants, therein set out, were entitled to maritime liens on the steamship \"Chilco\" at the date of said sale in the amounts set opposite their respective names.\nThe report further contained a finding by the district registrar that \"none of\" the said liens were chargeable upon the proceeds of the sale of the \"Chilco.\"\nThe respondent McInnes moved to vary the said reports and, by an order, dated 15th January, 1913, Mr. Justice Clement varied the said report by striking out the words \"none of,\" and held that the said liens were chargeable upon the proceeds of the sale of the \"Chilco,\" and further directed that the wage-earners be paid the total amount set after their respective names in the report out of the proceeds of the sale of the \"Chilco\" in priority to all other claims. A further order, dated the 22nd January, 1913, to the same effect, included the steamship \"Chilco,\" and, by a further order, dated the 27th January, 1913, the reports were approved, subject to the said orders so varying the reports in part.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from the order of the 15th January, 1913, the order of the 22nd January, 1913, and the order of the 27th January, 1913, and, by judgment, dated the 22nd July, 1913, the Court of Appeal dismissed said appeal. The present appeal is brought from this judgment of the Court of Appeal, by special leave granted in this court, in Chambers, by order dated 16th September, 1913, on the appellant's undertaking to abide by any order as to costs, including costs as between solicitor and client and all other costs which this court may see fit to make.\nI think the appeal fails. The liquidator undoubtedly intended to sell and the purchasers intended to buy the ship free from all incumbrances. The sale must be taken to have been authorized with a view to attain the object for which the winding-up proceedings were initiated, namely, to convert the assets of the company and to apply the proceeds in payment of the creditors according to the order and priority ordained by law. It is upon this hypothesis that any claim of the appellant itself against the proceeds of the sale in specie must rest; and, in consenting to the sale, the appellant must be taken to have assented to the fund being dealt with on this principle; and, on this principle, the superiority of the respondents' claim is indisputable.\nIt is true that the respondents did not, as the bank did, consent to the sale before it took place. It may be assumed that, in the absence of circumstances giving rise to an estoppel, the sale itself would not, ex proprio vigore, pass to the purchaser a title to the ship free from their liens. On the other hand, if immediately after the sale they had attempted to enforce their rights by proceeding against the ship in rem, the court would, unquestionably, on the application of the purchaser, have directed the liquidator to apply the proceeds of the sale in his hands in satisfaction of the liens; and these proceeds being sufficient for the purpose would have restrained the proceedings of the lien-holders.\nThe lien-holders, moreover, might have elected, mero motu, to affirm the sale as passing to the purchaser a title free from incumbrances and to proceed themselves against the fund in the liquidator's hands.\nSuch having been the rights of the parties immediately after the conclusion of the sale, there appears to be no ground for holding that the subsequent loss of the ship in any way prejudiced these rights.\nThat circumstance does not appear to have altered the position of the parties in the least. The bank could not have withdrawn its assent to a sale free from its own mortgage on discovery, after the sale, of the existence of the liens. There is no suggestion that if the existence of the liens had been known prior to the sale any other course would have been taken. It seems impossible, therefore, to support the view that the lien-holders have, through the destruction of the ship, lost their right to elect to proceed against the fund. The rights of the bank, if any, to subrogation, or in respect to the marshalling of securities, do not appear to have been affected by the judgment appealed from; but it is better that this should be formally stated in the order dismissing the appeal. The appeal should be dismissed with costs, and the liquidator should have his costs, as between solicitor and client.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although counsel for the appellant argued on behalf of his client that the case at bar should beregarded as one of the taking over of a security by the liquidator at a valuation, under section 77 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" in answer to a question from the bench, he frankly admitted that he did not himself consider that to be the proper view of it. He was, I think, well advised in making this statement.\nThat being so, I cannot understand how the appellant can successfully maintain that it is entitled to the whole sum of $5,000, received as proceeds of the sale of the \"Chilco\" without any provision being made for the satisfaction of the claims of the wage lienholders, which, admittedly, constituted a charge upon the vessel itself in priority to the appellant's mortgage.\nThe correspondence between the solicitors for the purchasers and the solicitors for the liquidator seems to make it clear that, at least to the extent of $3,500, there was an agreement that this fund should be held subject to the claims of these lien-holders.\nBut, apart from any effect which should be given to that correspondence, it is obvious that the liquidator and the appellant mortgagee would, as vendors, be obliged to indemnify the purchasers against these liens, if they remained unaffected by the sale. If they were extinguished by the sale as charges on the vessel, or became unenforceable by proceedings against it, they attached upon the proceeds of the sale which stood in its stead. In either case, as between the liquidator, representing the estate, and the appellant, the proceeds of the sale of the ship which were in the hands of the liquidator as an officer of the court and subject to equitable administration in the winding-up proceedings, were available to satisfy the claims of the lien-holders as against and in priority to the rights upon them of the appellant. The rights of the parties in regard to this fund were not affected by the subsequent destruction of the \"Chilco.\"\nBut, in default of obtaining the whole sum of $5,000 to the exclusion of the lien-holders, the appellant asked at bar that it should be subrogated to the rights against the general estate of such of the wage lien-holders as should be paid out of this fund, which represents the appellant's security, or that there should be a marshalling of assets and securities in such manner that, to the extent to which it has two securities \u2014 one a lien on the vessel or its proceeds, in which the appellant is interested; and the other a preferential right to payment out of the general assets of the estate, in which the appellant is not interested \u2014 the lien-holders should be required to resort to and exhaust the latter security before availing themselves of the former. As against unsecured and unpreferred creditors, represented here by the liquidator, it may well be that this is the appellant's equitable right. But other secured and preferred creditors were not represented before us and, at all events in the apparent uncertainty which exists as to whether the assets will be sufficient to satisfy claims of this class, we could not determine anything here as against such creditors or which would affect their rights. The appellant did not raise this question in the courts of British Columbia so far as the record shews. The notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal contains no allusion to this aspect of the case. The only matter dealt with in the judgments delivered in that court is the claim of the appellant to entirely exclude the lien-holders from any interest in the fund of $5,000. In rejecting that claim of the appellant the courts below were, I think, clearly right. Counsel for the respondents maintains that this is the only matter which was presented or adjudicated upon and that any right which the appellant may have to marshalling or subrogation will arise at a later stage of the liquidation proceedings and will not be affected by the disposition of this appeal.

A post set in one of these holes was insufficiently sunk or set in position without proper packing to hold it rigidly in the light soil of an embankment. Deceased was sent up the post to attach crossbars which were being hoisted to him by fellow-workmen by means of a block and tackle when, owing to the strain, the post fell causing injuries which resulted in his death. The postholes, as dug by the company, had been accepted by the defendants for the purposes of their contract, but they made no inspection as to their sufficiency, nor did they give instructions in regard to necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their employees engaged in setting up the posts and preparing them for wiring.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (4 West. W.R. 1311; 13 D.L.R. 143; 25 West. L.R. 66) that the failure to sink the postholes to sufficient depth and obtain proper filling to pack the post, and ensure the safety of the employee required to climb it, was personal negligence on the part of the defendants, the consequences of which they could not avoid by pleading that the accident occurred through the fault of a fellow-servant. Per Duff J.\u2014In the circumstances of the case the answers by the jury that the defendants had failed to set the posts at sufficient depth and pack them with sufficiently rigid material involved a finding that there was negligence in these respects imputable to the defendants for which they were personally responsible in an action for damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], by which, on equal division of opinion among the judges, the judgment of Morrison J., entered upon the verdict of the jury at the trial, stood affirmed.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellants. The motion for nonsuit should have prevailed. The point is shortly stated by Irving J. as follows: \"The learned judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury. The accident took place by reason of the negligence of the fellow-workmen not filling in the hole with proper holding material and not excavating to a sufficient depth.\" The defendants themselves were not shewn to be guilty of any negligence. See Gallagher v. Pipe[2]; Cribb v. Kynoch[3]; Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co.[4]; McFarlane v. Gilmour[5].\nThe plaintiff's evidence shewed, as the jury subsequently found, that deceased was a servant in the employ of appellants and, as expressed in the words of Martin J., \"the defendant contracting company agreed with the defendant power company, the owner of the electric line, to set up the poles on the power company's right-of-way in the holes that the power company had dug for them.\" The evidence shews that some of these holes had caved in, and that the fellow-workmen of the deceased were employed on piece-work as he was, they to clear out these holes when necessary and fill in around the poles, when in place. There was no suggestion in plaintiff's case of personal negligence by the appellants, and it was not alleged or attempted to be proved that there was any defect of system in regard to the work, or any failure on their part to provide suitable workmen and materials. The fault, according to plaintiff's case, was in the foreman not seeing that the poles were put deeper in the ground, or as the jury put it, filled with sufficiently rigid material to ensure safety.\nThere was also a further point in support of the motion for nonsuit, viz., that it plainly appears that deceased not only voluntarily incurred the risk of going up a pole which he knew to be insecure, but, in the words of Lord Cairns in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[6] at page 1166, \"that he caused his death by his own folly and recklessness.\" See Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[7], per Lord Halsbury, at page 45; Dominion Iron and Steel Co. v. Day[8]; Quebec and Levis Ferry Co. v. Jess[9]; Canada Foundry Co. v. Mitchell[10], per Killam J., at page 459.\nThe learned trial judge should have given effect to appellants' contention that they were entitled to judgment upon the finding of the jury that the proximate cause of the accident was the failure to set the pole sufficiently deep and to fill the hole with sufficiently rigid material to ensure safety. They have not made findings as to whether this arose from defective system or any personal negligence of these defendants, or whether the same arose from negligence of the workmen engaged in setting the pole and filling the hole. There is no finding upon which judgment could be entered for the plaintiff. Where a jury does not give a general verdict but answers questions such answers, to support a verdict for plaintiff, must clearly shew a cause of action. See Mader v. Halifax Electric Railway Co.[11]. The answers of the jury are in the nature of a special case, and they must disclose what the negligence was. A finding which does not disclose whether the negligence found is personal negligence, or is the negligence of the foreman or workmen, will not answer when the action is brought by the representatives of a workman in common employment with those who did the work, and with the foreman, who is equally a fellow-servant with the other workmen. In the judgment of Martin J. dealing with the matter upon the evidence, instead of upon the findings of the jury, the learned judge's reasoning upon the facts is not sufficient to establish that the jury should have found that the appellants had put the deceased to work in a defective place, and that there was neglect of the primary duty cast upon employers in relation to the safety of their servants. The jury, being the constituted tribunal to determine the facts, a judgment cannot be entered in favour of the plaintiff until they have either found a general verdict in her favour or found facts which clearly shew liability in accordance with legal principles. The respondent cannot recover damages for negligence against appellants in an action brought and continued down to the end against the appellants and an independent incorporated company, the statement of claim alleging that the injuries were sustained in consequence of the joint negligence of the respective defendants, one of whom plaintiff expressly releases from liability. Cocke v. Jennor[12]; Duck v. Mayeu[13], at page 513. It is submitted that respondent cannot in an action of tort against two defendants jointly recover, under a statement of claim alleging only joint liability, a verdict against only one of the defendants. The conduct of respondent's counsel at the trial amounted to a distinct refusal to ask for an amendment. The decision in Longmore v. McArthur[14] does not in any way make against appellant's contention. The statement of claim alleged the joint duty and responsibility and claimed damages against the Vancouver Power Co. and Waugh-Milburn Construction Co. jointly, and the judgment is against the Waugh-Milburn Construction Co. alone.\nD. G. Macdonell for the respondent. The power company had the holes already dug. No inquiry was made as to how they had dug the holes. The appellants did not inspect the quality of the filling; the only instruction they gave their workmen was to put the poles in the holes. The appellants personally accepted the defective holes and the defective filling from the power company. One of them, three days before the accident, saw the pole that had been planted and the quality of the filling, but took no action to secure safety. The appellants, themselves, failed to provide a fit and proper place for deceased to work in. Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[15], pages 424-428. The instrumentalities which the appellants personally provided were defective. The holes in which the poles were to be planted, and the filling which their workmen were to use in planting the poles were defective; the holes in not being dug deep enough, and the filling being of too light a material to hold the poles in position.\nThe course of counsel for plaintiff at the trial was mere discontinuance of the action against one of the defendants for want of evidence to shew liability. It was not a release of a joint tortfeasor.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Lord Watson, in Johnson v. Lindsay[16], at page 382, states the rule with respect to fellow servants, in the following terms:\u2014\nThe immunity extended to masters in case of injuries caused to each other by his servants rests on an implied undertaking by the servants to bear the risks arising from the possible negligence of a fellow servant who has been selected with due care by his master.\nThat is not this case. Here, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Martin in his judgment, it is in substance admitted that the accident resulted from the fact that the hole in which the pole was planted was not of sufficient depth to enable it to be erected safely. The fellow servants of the deceased had no responsibility for that omission or defect. The appellants had taken a contract, as stated in the plea to the action, for the placing of the poles of the Vancouver Power Company in holes already dug by that company, and placing cross-arms and stringing wires upon such poles. In the same statement of defence, it is said that the dangerous or unfit condition of the pole in question was occasioned by the manner in which the hole in which the pole was planted had been dug by the defendants, the Vancouver Power Company. How can the appellants now be heard to lay the blame on the fellow-servants of the deceased ? The latter had no discretion to exercise with respect to the deepening of the holes nor had they authority to make the holes deeper in order that the posts might be more firmly set in them. The appellants had accepted the holes from the Vancouver Power Company as they had been dug by the latter and, in doing so, they impliedly guaranteed that they were sufficient for the purpose. The only direction given their servants was to use such holes so accepted for the purpose of erecting the poles, and not to exercise any discretion with respect to their depth. If by reason of the insufficiency of the holes an accident happened, the responsibility is with the employer who omitted to take the proper precautions in that respect to avoid the accident.\nThe contention that the questions and answers of the jury do not disclose personal negligence attributable to the appellants or to those for whom they were responsible is not made out. The failure on the part of the appellants to provide a hole of sufficient depth, as found by the jury, to plant the poles firmly and safely is negligence for the consequences of which the employers are as clearly responsible as if they had supplied their servants with defective posts or defective apparatus of any kind.\nThe verdict of the jury negatives the defence of contributory negligence and it is not referred to in the judgment below.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The defendant company had a contract to erect electric posts in certain holes which had been dug for the purpose by another contractor and to prepare for the stringing of the electric wires along those posts.\nThe deceased was one of the men employed in placing cross-bars on one of the posts to carry the electric wires, and, while doing so, was fatally injured by the falling of the post. The jury found that the hole for the post was either not sufficiently deep or the packing was insufficient. It was not part of the defendants' contract to sink those holes. Their contract was to erect the posts in the holes sunk by the contractor who had the contract for that work.\nThe post erected would, doubtless, have been found sufficiently safe for the purposes for which it was required after it had the support of the wires strung upon it.\nThe question was, whether the defendants owed a duty to the workmen they employed in the setting up of these posts to see that they were sufficiently supported and strengthened either by providing suitable filling material to put around them in the holes or otherwise, so that the men should not be obliged to incur unduly dangerous risks in climbing the poles and putting the cross-bars for the wires upon them.\nI think the defendants owed such a duty and neglected to fulfil it and that the doctrine of common employment was, under the circumstances, no defence.\nIt is no answer to say that the poles were deeply enough sunk and would be safe enough after the wires were strung and they were strengthened thereby.\nThe question is, were they safe when the unfortunate man was sent aloft to put on the cross-bars? The event shewed they were not, and, in my opinion, it was the employers' duty to provide suitable filling material to ensure safety, or, failing such material, to see that equivalent safe-guards were supplied. Failing in this, the employer cannot invoke the doctrine of common employment to relieve him from liability. Under the facts proved, there was no obligation on the labourers or the foreman either to deepen the hole or to provide other packing or filling than the excavated material lying to their hand.\nThe defendant Waugh, himself, was present a day or two before the accident and saw the conditions and gave his men no special instructions. Ignorance of the actual facts by the defendants is displaced. The accident was the result, as the jury found, of the neglect of duty by the employer and not of the negligence of a fellow workman.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The undertaking of a dangerous work without adequate means of averting the consequences of such dangers as attendant upon its execution, and protecting therefrom those engaged therein, is negligence.\nThat is what the appellant is found by the jury to have been guilty of, and there is, prim\u00e2 facie, evidence to support it.\nThey undertook to set posts in holes which ought to have been, in the view of some men giving evidence, twice as deep as they were to ensure safety. It seems idle to talk of superintendents and foremen, engaged to execute such an inherently dangerous project, being negligent in not so digging new holes and incurring the extra expense of so doing something they were not retained to do as to ensure safety.\nThe same is true of the expense of filling in or setting of the posts though the evidence of what transpired is not so direct but rather affords ground for the mere inference that the foreman and superintendent did exactly what they were expected to do; namely, use such filling-in as nearest to hand, and not expend money on hauling better material from a distance.\nSuch inference, I think, was open to the jury and if, as I think, the correct one, then it is, I respectfully submit, surely absurd to talk of the foreman or superintendent having been negligent, and that negligence the cause of the accident.\nOn such condition of facts and circumstances, it devolved, on the appellant to shew, if it could, that the superintendent or foreman was otherwise instructed and duly furnished with adequate material or means of getting same.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The first ground upon which Mr. Ritchie contends, on behalf of the defendants, who are appealing, that the judgment should be reversed and the action dismissed is that there is no evidence of any breach of duty on the part of the defendants personally. The deceased, Benjamin Slater, was an employee of the appellants who, at the time Slater received the injury that resulted in his death, were engaged in the execution of a contract they had entered into with the Vancouver Power Company for setting and wiring a line of poles on the power company's railway line between Vedder River and New Westminster. Slater was occupied in pursuance of his duty in fastening the cross-arms on the top of one of the poles which had already been set by the employees of the appellants, when the embankment, in which the pole was set, gave way and Slater was carried to the ground by the uprooted pole and fatally injured. The embankment in which the pole was set was a deep fill which at this place consisted of light soil described by some of the witnesses as \"peaty\" and by others as simply \"a bed of ashes.\" The poles had a height of 60 feet. They were set in the steep slope of the embankment. One of the witnesses says that in order to obtain a secure setting it would be necessary in such soil to excavate to a depth of at least 9 feet. The defendant Waugh himself admits that the minimum depth necessary for securing safety would be 7 feet. There is ample evidence that in this fill the poles were placed on holes that had been excavated to a depth of less than 6 feet. The evidence shews also that Slater, being engaged in placing the cross-arms on this pole some time after it had been set, would not be able from such inspection as could be made by him in such circumstances to ascertain whether the pole had been set securely or not. In these circumstances there was, of course, enough to entitle the jury to find that there had been negligence in not excavating to a greater depth before setting up the pole. The question is whether negligence has been brought home to the appellants.\nI think the evidence justifies the conclusion that the defendant, Waugh, was personally implicated in this negligence. The poles were being set, as I have already mentioned, under a contract between the appellants and the Vancouver Power Company. The contract was an oral one. Waugh says that in making the arrangement with the power company he was assured that the holes had already been excavated and that it was understood that these holes were to be accepted, and that his price was fixed upon that basis. He says that if they had found a hole only four feet deep they would doubtless have deepened it before setting the pole. But, he admits that if they found a hole excavated to what he calls a \"reasonable depth,\" six feet, they would not have excavated it further. It was shewn that a contract had been let to a man named Hare, who was one of the witnesses at the trial, to dig a line of post holes for posts of the same character on the other side of the track through this same fill and that although the specification of the contract required holes of 7 feet in depth they were, in fact, excavated only to a depth of 6 feet, and that in that condition they were accepted and the poles were placed in them by the appellants. Waugh, moreover, admits that a few days before the accident took place he walked over this fill. There was a superintendent, Bailey, who was in charge of the execution of the contract for the appellants and there was a foreman named Haines who was in charge of the gang of men who set up the pole in question. No evidence was offered on behalf of the appellants to shew that any instructions had been given to Bailey with regard to the depth to which the poles were to be sunk or with regard to the inspection of the post-holes that had been dug by the power company, or as to any precautions to be taken to secure the stability of the poles with a view to the safety of the men engaged in placing the wires upon them.\nI do not think it would be an unreasonable inference from the evidence I have mentioned, coupled with the lack of evidence as to instructions given by the appellants to Bailey, that the appellants did not consider it to be their duty in the execution of their contract to deepen a hole such as that which occasioned this accident; and that Bailey, the superintendent, was aware that this was the appellants' view. I think, moreover, that the jury might not unreasonably infer that Bailey had no express instructions to do such work for the purpose of securing the safety of workmen engaged in wiring the poles after they had been set up. Whether, moreover, it would be a part of his duty as between him and his employers, in the circumstances, in the absence of instructions would, I am inclined to think, be a question for the jury. However that may be, in all these circumstances the jury were, as it appears to me, entitled to find that a man of Waugh's knowledge and experience, knowing the character of the fill in which the posts were being set, ought to have realized, and if he had exercised any sort of forethought whatever for the safety of his employees, would have realized that exceptional measures would be required for securing the stability of the poles set up in this fill; and that his failure to observe that or his failure to act upon it in giving appropriate instructions was such a want of care as properly casts upon him responsibility for the failure to take such precautions.\nMr. Ritchie's next contention is that the verdict of the jury is insufficient. I am unable to agree with this contention. The jury found the defendants guilty of negligence in two respects:\u2014in failing to set the poles sufficiently deep and in failing to fill the post-holes with sufficiently rigid material. I think this involves a finding that there was negligence in these respects and that that negligence is imputable to the defendants personally.\nThere was a further point made by Mr. Ritchie which, if I understood him correctly, was this. The appellants and the Vancouver Power Company, he said, were charged in the respondent's statement of claim as joint tortfeasors; and he said, the respondents' counsel at the trial having released the Vancouver Power Company, the cause of action against the appellants must be taken to have disappeared on the principle that the release of one joint tortfeasor effects the release of all, because the cause of action is an entirety. This contention cannot be given effect to, in my opinion, because it is perfectly clear that what the respondent's counsel at the trial did was to discontinue the action as against the Vancouver Power Company because the evidence failed to implicate them in the negligence proved and to proceed against the appellants as the persons solely responsible for the injury complained of. It was entirely a question for the trial judge whether that course should or should not be permitted and the appellants' contention fails upon the simple grounds, in my opinion, that on the facts proved the Vancouver Power Company could not be held to be joint tortfeasors with the appellants and, if they could, the respondents at the trial ought not to be taken as releasing the Vancouver Power Company from liability, but simply as discontinuing the action against them. ANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff is the widow of a deceased employee of the defendant company, suing on behalf of herself and his children to recover damages for his death, caused, she avers, by the negligence of the defendants, an incorporated partnership.\nThe facts are not seriously in controversy. A pole erected by the defendants fell while the plaintiff's husband was upon it, engaged in placing cross-bars to carry electric wires, and he sustained fatal injuries. The jury found upon sufficient evidence that the fall of the pole was due to the negligence of the defendants in that\nthey failed to set the pole sufficiently deep and to fill the hole with sufficiently rigid material to ensure safety.\nThe recovery was at common law and the main defence relied upon at bar was \"common employment.\"\nI think that defence is not available under the circumstances of this case. The hole in which the pole was placed was not made by the defendants, but by a contractor who preceded them. It was no part of the work of the defendant company to deepen that hole. They accepted the holes as they had been dug. The evidence does not establish that the inadequacy of the hole in question was due to the fault of a fellow-workman of the deceased. The defendants' contract was to erect the poles in the holes as dug and this appears to have been the instruction which they gave to their men. There is nothing to shew that it was the duty of their foreman to deepen the hole in question or to see that other filling was procured and used if that adjacent to it was unsuitable. The defendants owed to the plaintiff's husband the duty of furnishing him with a reasonably safe place in which to work \u2014 of seeing that the pole which he was required to ascend was securely placed. Notwithstanding the shallow\u2014 ness of the hole, it is claimed that the pole would not have fallen if sufficiently rigid filling had been used. The jury has found that the defendants were at fault in regard to the filling. The circumstances disclose a case of dangerous employment imposing upon the defendants, as masters, the duty to see that proper precautions were taken to ensure their employee's safety. The defendant, Waugh, admits that no inquiry or inspection was made or directed as to the depth of the hole or the quality of the filling. The filling adjacent to the hole in question, having regard to its shallowness, was unsuitable. No instructions were given to procure or use any other filling. The defendants had erected poles on the opposite side of the railway. They knew the character of the soil. The defendant, Waugh, himself passed the place of the accident only three or four days before it occurred. He had an opportunity then of seeing the nature of the ground in which the particular pole in question was placed and of knowing that special care was necessary there as to the depth of the hole and the character of the filling. Yet there were no inquiries; no instructions were given; no inspection was made or directed. Under such circumstances the jury were, I think, justified in finding the defendants liable at common law.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nBRODEUR J. agreed with Anglin J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Senkler, Sparks & Van Horne.\n[1] 4 West W.T. 1311; 13 D.L.R. 143; 25 West.

Les conclusions de la p\u00e9tition sont \u00e9galement irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res, parce qu\u2019elles demandent des choses \u00e9trang\u00e8res au v\u00e9ritable litige entre les parties, et notamment, la d\u00e9qualification de personnes qui ne sont pas en cause;\n\u201c3.

A. D. Morgan for the appellant.\nBelcourt K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. Notice of the petition was inserted in a newspaper and published in the electoral district in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906. eh. 7), and that is all that was required. The rule of practice relied upon by the judge below, competently made, it is quite true, by the judges of the Superior Court in Quebec under the \u201cControverted Elections Act, 1874,\u201d is no longer in force.\nDavies J.\u2014To the election petition in this case several preliminary objections were presented. The learned judge who heard these objections sustained the one complaining that the petition had not been published as required by the \u201cRules of Court\u201d of the Province of Quebec and dismissed the election petition on that ground. These \u201cRules of Court\u201d had been passed some years ago under the then existing \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d and before the Act was remodelled and passed in its present form. It was admitted that the publication complained of complied with the statutory requirements of the existing Act, but that they did not comply with the requirements of the \u201cRules of Court\u201d which it was contended were not inconsistent with the statute, and were consequently still in force. I think, however, they clearly are so inconsistent and that to the extent that they require other and further publications than those required by the statute they are necessarily repealed by it.\nIt was further contended, however, that even if the the ground of want of proper publication, upon which the judge dismissed the petition, was bad, still the judgment should be sustained on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove his status and qualification as a petitioner. I think, however, there is nothing in this objection and that the proper inference from all the evidence is that the petitioner was a qualified voter entitled to present the petition.\nAs to the question of our jurisdiction on appeal, in my judgment, under the case as it came before us, all or any of the preliminary objections not abandoned in the court below and which counsel thought applicable could have been relied upon by the respondent to sustain the judgment dismissing the petition. He was not confined to the reasons given by the judge or to the particular objection which the judge sustained as fatal to the petition.\nThe appeal to this court is from the judgment dismissing the petition, and, while that judgment is based upon one of the preliminary objections only, we have jurisdiction to deal with all of the preliminary objections which were heard before the judge and which are in the record before us, and to finally dispose of them. Any construction of the Act limiting the jurisdiction of this court on appeal to deal with the particular objection allowed or disallowed by the judge below would, I think, be at variance with its true construction and the result in many cases would be to delay the trial of the petition unduly, and possibly to defeat it altogether. The duty of the judge who hears the preliminary objections is either to allow them, or some or one of them, and dismiss the petition; or to dismiss or disallow the objections so that the petition shall go to trial.\nThe section of the Act defining his duties is as follows:\u2014\nSec. 19. Within five days after the service of the petition and the accompanying notice, the respondent may present in writing any preliminary objections or grounds of insufficiency which he has to urge against the petition or the petitioner, or against any further proceeding thereon, and shall, in such case, at the same time, file a copy thereof for the petitioner, and the court shall hear the parties upon such objections and grounds, and shall decide the same in a summary manner.\nIn the case before us there were a great many preliminary objections and the issue joined upon them was that they were one and all bad in fact and in law.\nThat was the issue which came before the trial judge and which he had to dispose of. At the hearing below the defendant confined himself to seven of these objections and the judge rested his judgment upon one of them only, and dismissed the petition.\nThe section giving an appeal to this court from a decision on preliminary objections, reads as follows:\u2014\nAn appeal by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision shall lie to the Supreme Court of. Canada from,\u2014\n(a) the judgment, rule, order or decision on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition: Provided that, unless it is otherwise ordered, an appeal in the last-mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings nor shall it delay the trial of the petition.\nA technical reading of this section might seem to justify a conclusion limiting our jurisdiction on the appeal to the objections the judge below has expressly allowed or disallowed, as the case may be. But a careful reading of the Act satisfies me that such a limited construction of our powers is not correct and that where there are several preliminary objections to an election petition and the judgment of the judge who hears the issue joined on the objections allows one of the objections and dismisses the petition without reference to the others, this court, on appeal, has jurisdiction finally to dispose of all of the objections and of the issue as it came before the judge and give the judgment which under the facts and the law the judge should have given. Whether and in what cases such jurisdiction should be exercised depends, of course, upon the evidence in the record or case in appeal.\nIn this case I think the judge was wrong in dismissing the petition for want of due publication, and I also think that Mr. Belcourt failed to maintain the only other objection he thought it worth while to argue, namely, the want of qualification of the petitioner.\nBut, suppose we should have been of the opinion that the petitioner\u2019s status to file the petition had been disproved \u2014 should we have refused to confirm the judgment dismissing the petition because the judge below did not refer to that want of status as one of his reasons for his judgment? With great respect I think such a refusal would do violence to the spirit and intention of Parliament as expressed in the statute under review.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the preliminary objections disallowed and dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The requirements of section 16 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act,\u201d which is as follows:\u2014\n16. On presentation of the petition the clerk of the court shall send a copy thereof by mail to the returning officer of the electoral district to which the petition relates, and such returning officer shall forthwith publish a notice thereof once in a newspaper published in the district or, if there is no newspaper published in the district, then in a newspaper published in an adjoining district,\nhaving been complied with, I do not think failure to comply with rules framed under the earlier Act which are inconsistent therewith can support the dismissal of the petition herein.\nThe learned trial judge having determined only this one of the several preliminary objections presented, we have no power to consider any other.\nSection 64 of the Act, which is as follows, so far as bearing upon our: jurisdiction:\u2014\n64. An appeal by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from\u2014\n(a) the judgment, rule, order or decision on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition;\nseems conclusive on this point.\nThe appeal should be allowed, but I doubt if costs should be given of what relates to so much of the case as is thus undecided, though appellant should be given the general costs of his appeal relative to the point in which he succeeds.\nDuff J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Bruneau (2nd June, 1913) dismissing the petition given on the hearing on preliminary objections. The judgment was based upon the ground that the petition was not published in accordance with the seventh rule of practice made by the judges of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec under the \u201cControverted Elections Act, 1874\u201d (37 Vict. eh. 10, sec. 44), requiring notice of the petition to be published once in the. Quebec Official Gazette and also in\ntwo numbers of a newspaper in the. English language and two numbers of a newspaper in the French language published in or circulating in the electoral division\nto which the petition relates. It is not disputed that section 16 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 7), was complied with, that is to say, that a notice of the petition appeared in a newspaper published in the district in accordance with the provisions of that section; and the two points for consideration under this head are: 1st, was the rule in question which, it is not disputed, was competently enacted, displaced by the legislation now embodied in the section just referred to? And 2ndly, if, notwithstanding the language of section 16, the rule is still in force, whether non-compliance with that rule by the returning officer is a sufficient ground for dismissing the petition? As to the first question the material statutory provisions are section 20 of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d (B.S.C. 1906, ch. 1), and sections 85 and 86 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act.\u201d For convenience of reference I quote these enactments in full:\u2014\n20. Whenever any Act or enactment is repealed, and other provisions are substituted by way of amendment, revision or consolidation\u2014\n(a) all regulations, orders, ordinances, rules and by-laws made under the repealed Act or enactment shall continue good and valid, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the substituted Act or enactment, until they are annulled and others made in their stead; and,\n(b) any reference in any unrepealed Act, or in any rule, order or regulation made thereunder to such repealed Act or enactment, shall, as regards any subsequent transaction, matter or thing, be held and construed to be a reference to the provisions of the substituted Act or enactment relating to the same subject-matter as such repealed Act or enactment; and, if there is no provision in the substituted Act or enactment relating to the same subject-matter, the repealed Act or enactment shall stand good, and be read and construed as unrepealed in so far, and in so far only, as is necessary to support, maintain or give effect to such unrepealed Act, or such rule, order or regulation made thereunder.\nChapter 7, section 85:\u2014\n85. The judges of the court or a majority of them, may from time to time, make, revoke and alter general rules and orders, for the effectual execution of this Act and of the intention and object thereof, and the regulation of the practice and procedure and costs with respect to election petitions and the trial thereof, and the certifying and reporting thereon.\n2. Any general rules and orders made as aforesaid, and not inconsistent with this Act, shall be deemed to be within the powers conferred by this Act, and shall, while unrevoked, be of the same force as if they were herein enacted; and shall be laid before the House of Commons within three weeks after they are made, if Parliament is then sitting, and if Parliament is not then sitting, within three weeks after the beginning of the next session of Parliament.\n86. Until rules of court have been made by the judges of the court in any province in pursuance of this Act, and so far as such rules do not extend, the principles, practice and rules on which election petitions touching the election of members of the House of Commons in England were on the 26th day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, dealt with, shall be observed so far as consistently with this Act they can be observed by the court and the judges thereof.\nThe construction and effect of these provisions, in so far as relevant to the present point, is not open to dispute. The argument of Mr. Belcourt, who appeared for the respondent, proceeded upon the assumption that the real point at issue must be whether the rule relied upon is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with section 16. With great respect for the learned judge of first instance I do not think the point is doubtful. The rule requires publication in two newspapers, a newspaper in the English language and a newspaper in the French language. The Act requires publication once in a newspaper.\nIf, as is contended, the effect of the rule, which, of course, has the force of statute, is that non-compliance with it nullifies the petitioner\u2019s proceedings, then it appears to me that it must be a rule beyond the authority conferred by sec. 85; for I think it cannot fairly be taken to be within the intendment of that section that, where the Act itself lays down a specific procedure In relation to a given matter, the rule-making authority can prescribe additional proceedings with such a sanction. If the rule is one which could not be made under section 85, it would appear to follow that it is a rule which is not protected by the provisions of section 20 of the \u201cInterpretation Act,\u201d because one cannot suppose the legislature to have contemplated that a rule made prior to the passing of section 16, which would be beyond the present powers of the rule-making authority under section 85, could remain in force notwithstanding the enactment of section 16. It is not to be supposed that the validity of the rules in force at a given time could be affected by the accident of the day when such rules were passed.\nAs to the second question, I think that on this ground also the ruling of the learned judge of first instance ought to be reversed. The publication prescribed by the legislature is, in any judgment, not a forensic proceeding. The duty to publish laid upon the returning officer, doubtless, has its own sanction. Non-compliance with it, in my judgment, cannot, where the petitioner himself is entirely without fault, have the result of causing the petition to lapse.\nOn the hearing of the appeal another point was argued. It was urged by the respondent that the judgment dismissing the petition ought to be sustained on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove his status, according to the rules laid down in the previous decisions of this court. In dealing with this contention the first point to consider is whether we have jurisdiction to entertain it. That question depends upon the construction of section 64 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act.\u201d It is as follows:\n64. An appeal by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from\u2014\n(a) the judgment, rule, order or decision on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition: Provided that, unless it is otherwise ordered, an appeal in the last-mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, nor shall it delay the trial of the petition; and,\n(b) the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judges who have tried such petition.\nIt is argued (and it appeared to me at first sight, that such must be the construction of this section) that an appeal is only given from a decision upon a specific preliminary objection or specific preliminary objections. Where the preliminary objections are disallowed there is, of course, necessarily a decision upon each one of them. Where, on the other hand, as in this case, the petition is dismissed upon the ground that a single specific objection is well taken and ought to be given effect to and the judge has refrained from considering or passing upon any of the other objections, the question whether, in such a case, this court has jurisdiction to consider any objection other than that passed upon may become a point of importance. I think the appeal given by section 64 is not only an appeal from any specific rule or decision, but from the \u201cjudgment rule or order\u201d given by the judge of first instance before whom the hearing on preliminary objections is held.\nIt has been laid down in the judgment of this court more than once that the hearing upon preliminary objections is to be treated as one of the steps in the trial of the petition. Sections 19 and 20 indicate to my mind that it was not within the contemplation of the Act that there should be successive hearings on preliminary objections. The judgment, therefore, dismissing the petition given on the hearing must, I think, be taken to be the judgment concluding that stage of the trial and on appeal from that judgment I think it is not only open to us, but that it is our duty to consider every objection which was before the judge of first instance and which is presented by either party for consideration in this court.\nOn the merits, I think the objection fails. I think there is sufficient evidence and I think the proper inference from the evidence is that the petitioner was properly qualified as a petitioner under the Act.\nAnglin J.\u2014At the close of the argument I entertained no doubt that rule No. 7 of the \u201cRules of Practice\u201d of the Quebec Superior Court for Dominion Controverted Elections, in so far as it requires publication different from and in excess of that prescribed by section 16 of the \u201cDominion Controverted Elections Act,\u201d was superseded and abrogated by that enactment, and that, publication in accordance with the requirements of section 16 having been shewn, the preliminary objection based on want of due publication fails. Had this been the sole question for determination, the appeal might well have been disposed of at the hearing.\nBut the respondent, failing to sustain the judgment in his favour upon this objection, seeks to support it on another, which was presented to the judge of first instance, but was not dealt with by him, namely, that the petitioner had not sufficiently established his status in that he had not proved himself to be a British subject. This objection was heard by the learned judge, but was not adjudicated upon by him, no doubt because he held the objection on the ground of insufficient publication to be well taken and fatal to the petition. The appellant questions the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the objection based on want of status on the ground that the appeal given by section 64 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d is confined to objections upon which judgment has been actually pronounced below. The respondent asserts on the other hand that the appeal is from the judgment dismissing the petition and that it is open to him to support that judgment in this court upon any ground taken before the judge of first instance and upon which he might have pronounced it. The question is important because upon its determination depends the right of respondent to a further hearing before the judge of the Superior Court in order to obtain an adjudication by him on the other preliminary objections taken but not dealt with at the former hearing. If, as counsel for petitioner contends, the respondent cannot support the dismissal of the petition on any objection not adjudicated upon in the Superior Court, he should be entitled to such further hearing, since otherwise he might lose the benefit of a good objection properly taken and pressed, merely because the judge of first instance failed to deal with it under the erroneous impression that it was not necessary for him to do so. On the other hand, if the position taken at bar by his own counsel is correct, the respondent will clearly not be entitled to any such further hearing on preliminary objections.\nSection 64 of the Dominion \u201cControverted Elections Act,\u201d which gives the right to appeal, is as follows:\nAn appeal by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from\u2014 (a) the judgment, rule, order or decision on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to such petition: Provided that, unless it is otherwise ordered, an appeal in the last-mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, nor shall it delay the trial of the petition.\nAt first blush it would almost appear that it was intended to confine the appeal to the particular objection which has been allowed. But the appeal is from the judgment rendered on the objection, not from its allowance. That judgment is the dismissal of the petition. It is a well recognized principle of procedure in ordinary litigation that a party in whose favour judgment is pronounced upon one ground may support that judgment in appeal upon any other ground taken before the court which pronounced it and upon which that court might properly have acted. Unless the statute is conclusive against its application, the maxim ut sit finis litium and the undoubted policy of Parliament that there should be no undue or unnecessary delay in the bringing of election petitions to trial afford cogent arguments why the ordinary principle of curial procedure to which I have alluded should govern the present case.\nSection 19 of the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d makes it abundantly clear that preliminary objections should be speedily dealt with. It appears to contemplate that they should all be disposed of at one hearing. It would, I think, be contrary to the spirit if not to the letter of the Act, that there should be a series of hearings and of appeals on preliminary objections, as might well be the case if they may be disposed of one at a time. Though not as clearly expressed as it might have been, I find nothing in section 64 which constrains me to put upon it a construction which I should deem out of harmony with the other provisions of the statute, and probably contrary to the intention of Parliament. I, therefore, conclude that it is open to the respondent to ask this court on the present appeal to pass upon his objection to the sufficiency of the proof of the petitioner\u2019s status.\nOn the merits I think that objection cannot be sustained. The evidence adduced by the petitioner that his name appeared on the voters\u2019 list furnished for use at the election and that he voted as a deputy returning officer on a certificate obtained after taking the prescribed oath, which was produced and filed, and the certificate of his baptism shewing that he was born at St. Judas, in the County of St. Hyacinthe, in the Province of Quebec, also produced and filed, established the fact that he is a British subject, at all events sufficiently to cast on the respondent the burden of proving the contrary.\nThe respondent did not seek at bar to maintain the judgment in his favour by invoking any other of the preliminary objections which he took below.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the preliminary objections with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une contestation d\u2019\u00e9lection qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e sur l\u2019objection pr\u00e9liminaire que l\u2019officier-rapporteur n\u2019avait pas publi\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition suivant les dispositions d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de pratique de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nPlusieurs autres objections pr\u00e9liminaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e; mais le juge n\u2019a pris en consid\u00e9ration que celle relative \u00e0 la publication de la p\u00e9tition et il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 inutile, vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il en est venu sur ce point, d\u2019examiner et de d\u00e9cider ces autres objections.\nLa r\u00e8gle de pratique relative \u00e0 la publication des p\u00e9titions d\u2019\u00e9lections a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par les juges de la cour sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec, en 1875, et se lit comme suit:\u2014\nL\u2019Officier-Rapporteur publiera toute p\u00e9tition qui lui sera envoy\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 de la section 8 du dit Acte, ainsi que tout autre document qui lui sera envoy\u00e9 pour publication en conformit\u00e9 des dispositions du dit Acte, ou des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles, en d\u00e9livrant copie de telle p\u00e9tition ou de tel document au R\u00e9gistrateur du Bureau d\u2019Enregistrement dans telle Division Electorale; et, s\u2019il y a plus d\u2019un Bureau d\u2019Enregistrement dans telle Division Electorale, il en d\u00e9livrera une copie \u00e0 chaque R\u00e9gistrateur; et, s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun Bureau d\u2019Enregistrement dans la Division Electorale, alors copie sera transmise au S\u00e9cr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier Municipal, le bureau duquel se trouvant dans la dite Division Electorale, sera le plus proche du lieu o\u00f9 la dite \u00e9lection aura eu lieu. Et dans le cas o\u00f9 il ne se trouvera pas, dans la dite Division Electorale, tel R\u00e9gistrateur ou S\u00e9cr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, alors la copie sera transmise \u00e0 quelqu\u2019autre officier public, au choix du dit Officier-rapporteur, qui se trouvera dans la dite Division Electorale, en donnant sans d\u00e9lai un avis pr\u00e9cis de telle publication dans un num\u00e9ro de la Gazette Officielle de Qu\u00e9bec, ainsi que dans deux num\u00e9ros d\u2019un journal en langue anglaise, et dans deux num\u00e9ros d\u2019un journal en langue fran\u00e7aise, publi\u00e9s ou ayant circulation dans telle Division Electorale, si tels journaux il y a, et il sera du devoir de tout tel R\u00e9gistrateur, S\u00e9cr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier ou autre Officier public de permettre \u00e0 toute personne de prendre communication de toute telle p\u00e9tition ou de tout tel document sans exiger pour cela aucun honoraire, et tout document qui sera envoy\u00e9 au Sh\u00e9rif pour publication sert publi\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re ci-dessus d\u00e9crite.\nLe statut sur lequel cette r\u00e8gle de pratique \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e est la loi de 1874 (37 Vict. ch. 10, sec. 8), qui disait:\u2014\nLors de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une p\u00e9tition, le greffier de la cour en transmettra copie par la malle \u00e0 l\u2019officier-rapporteur du district \u00e9lectoral auquel se rapporte la p\u00e9tition d\u2019\u00e9lection, lequel lui donnera de suite publicit\u00e9 dans ce district \u00e9lectoral.\nCette disposition de la loi de 1874 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e en 1891 et remplac\u00e9e par la section suivante:\u2014 Lors de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une p\u00e9tition, le greffier de la cour en transmettra copie par la poste \u00e0 l\u2019officier-rapporteur du district \u00e9lectoral auquel se rapporte la p\u00e9tition, et celui-ci en donnera de suite avis une fois dans un journal publi\u00e9 dans le district, ou, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas publi\u00e9 de journal dans ce district, en faisant ins\u00e9rer cet avis dans un journal publi\u00e9 dans un district voisin.\n2. Cet avis pourra \u00eatre dans la forme suivante: \u201cAvis est par le pr\u00e9sent donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019Acte des \u00e9lection f\u00e9d\u00e9rales contest\u00e9es contre l\u2019\u00e9lection de, \u00e9cuier, comme membre du parlement du Canada, repr\u00e9sentant le district \u00e9lectoral de et (si l\u2019on r\u00e9clame le si\u00e8ge) r\u00e9clamant le si\u00e8ge pour\nDat\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour de 18\nA. B.,\nOfficier-rapporteur.\nCette section de la loi de 1891 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e Verbatim dans les status refondus de 1906 \u00e0 la section 16 du chapter 7.\nL\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que la r\u00e8gle et la nouvelle loi sont incompatibles et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence la r\u00e8gle est par le fait m\u00eame sans effet.\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 dit que le rappel d\u2019une disposition de la loi ne met pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 n\u00e9ant les r\u00e8gles qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en vertu de cette loi si les dispositions sont semblables et ne sont pas incompatibles avec la nouvelle loi. If pr\u00e9tend que dans le cas actuel cette incompatibilit\u00e9 n\u2019existe pas et que les dispositions de la r\u00e8gle sont, par cons\u00e9quent, en force et doivent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que dans les statuts de 1874 on ne disait pas comment la publication d\u2019une p\u00e9tition d\u2019\u00e9lection devait se faire, et alors les juges de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ont cru devoir d\u00e9terminer qu\u2019un avis de la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition devrait \u00eatre publi\u00e9 une fois dans la Gazette Officielle et deux fois dans deux journaux.\nIl est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que la pratique \u00e9tait loin d\u2019\u00eatre la m\u00eame dans toutes les provinces. Cette disposition de la loi de 1874 a d\u00fb donner lieu \u00e0 des inconv\u00e9nients et \u00e0 des incertitudes et alors il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos en 1891 d\u2019amender la loi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise comment la publication devait se faire. Comme nous venons de le voir, la loi pourvoit \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un avis soit publi\u00e9 dans un journal une fois seulement.\nLe droit pour les juges de faire des r\u00e8glements concernant la proc\u00e9dure des p\u00e9titions d\u2019\u00e9lections est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans des termes bien g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Voici, en effet, ces dispositions:\u2014\nLes juges des diff\u00e9rentes cours, dans chaque province respectivement, ou la majorit\u00e9 d\u2019entre eux, peuvent, de temps \u00e0 autre, faire, r\u00e9voquer et modifier les r\u00e8gles et ordres g\u00e9n\u00e9raux mentionn\u00e9s en la pr\u00e9sente loi comme r\u00e8gles de cour pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution efficace de la pr\u00e9sente loi, et de son intention et de son objet, et de toutes r\u00e8gles de pratique, proc\u00e9dures et frais se rattachant aux p\u00e9titions d\u2019\u00e9lection et \u00e0 leur d\u00e9cision, et aux certificates et rapports \u00e0 faire sur ces p\u00e9titions.\n2. Toutes r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et tous ordres g\u00e9n\u00e9raux faits de la mani\u00e8re ci-haut exprim\u00e9e, qui ne sont pas incompatibles avec la pr\u00e9sente loi, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente loi, et ont, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient r\u00e9voqu\u00e9s,\u201d la m\u00eame force que s\u2019ils faisaient partie des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi; et elles doivent \u00eatre soumises \u00e0 la Chambre des Communes dans l\u2019espace de trois semaines apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, si le Parlement est alors en session et, si le Parlement n\u2019est pas en session, dans les trois premi\u00e8res semaines de la session alors prochaine du Parlement. S.R., c. 9, art. 62.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions de cette l\u00e9gislation le rappel d\u2019une loi ne met fin aux r\u00e8gles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en vertu de cette loi que si elles sont incompatibles avec la nouvelle loi. Y avait-il incompatibilit\u00e9 entre la r\u00e8gle de pratique de 1875 et la loi de 1891? Voil\u00e0 la question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nJ\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019ancienne r\u00e8gle de pratique a cess\u00e9 d\u2019avoir force et effet.\nElle d\u00e9terminait, comme nous venons de le voir, la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019officier-rapporteur devait faire conna\u00eetre au public la pr\u00e9sentation des p\u00e9titions d\u2019\u00e9lections Il fallait qu\u2019un avis f\u00fbt donn\u00e9 dans la Gazette Officielle de Qu\u00e9bec et dans deux journaux du district \u00e9lectoral. Le l\u00e9gislateur, par sa loi de 1891, a entrepris lui-m\u00eame de d\u00e9terminer comment et o\u00f9 cette publication devait se faire. Il a voulu, je suppose, mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019incertitude o\u00f9 l\u2019on devait \u00eatre avec la disposition un peu vague de la loi de 1874 et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019avenir l\u2019avis serait publi\u00e9 dans un seul journal du district. Cette l\u00e9gislation formelle rend l\u2019ancienne r\u00e8gle de pratique incompatible et y met fin, du moins en tant que cette publication est concern\u00e9e.\nMaintenant, en supposant que la publication serait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, serait-ce une raison suffisante pour renvoyer la p\u00e9tition? Je ne le crois pas. Ce serait l\u00e0 une informalit\u00e9 qui pourrait \u00eatre purg\u00e9e sur instruction du juge. Il n\u2019y aurait pas lieu alors de renvoyer la p\u00e9tition.\nIl arrive bien souvent que des p\u00e9titions demandent l\u2019annulation de l\u2019\u00e9lection pour irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s commises par l\u2019officier-rapporteur. Serait-ce \u00e0 dire que son d\u00e9faut de publier cet avis devrait entra\u00eener le renvoi de la p\u00e9tition? Poser la question, c\u2019est la r\u00e9soudre.\nLes p\u00e9titions d\u2019\u00e9lections doivent \u00eatre d\u2019ailleurs consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme toute autre action ou proc\u00e9dure devant les tribunaux. Il n\u2019y a pas de raison pour qu\u2019on soit plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re au sujet des informalit\u00e9s qui s\u2019y sont gliss\u00e9es que pour celles qui affectent les actions ordinaires.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion que le jugement a quo est mal fond\u00e9 et qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. A. D. Morgan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P. J. A. Cardin.\n"}

Is section 7 of chapter 15 of the Acts of the Legislature of Alberta of 1912, intituled \u2018An Act to amend the Railway Act\u2019 intra vires of the provincial legislature in its application to railway companies authorized by the Parliament of Canada to construct or operate railways? \u201c2. If the said section be ultra vires of the provincial legislature in its application to such Dominion railway companies, would the section be intra vires if amended by striking out the word \u2018unreasonably\u2019?\n\u201cWould the said section be intra vires if amended to read as follows: (3) The provisions of this section shall extend and apply to the lands of every railway company or person having authority to construct or operate a railway otherwise than under the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta in so far as such lands do not form part of the right-of-way, tracks, terminals, stations, station grounds or lands required for the construction or operation of any railway within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada\u2019?\u201d\nSection 82 of chapter 8 of the statutes of the Province of Alberta, 1907, intituled \u201cThe Railway Act,\u201d is as follows:\u2014\n\u201c82. The company may take possession of, use or occupy any lands belonging to any other railway company, use and enjoy the whole or any portion of the right-of-way, tracks, terminals, stations or station grounds of any other railway company and have and exercise full right and powers to run and operate its trains over and upon any portion or portions of the railway of any other railway company, subject always to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council first obtained or to any order or direction which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make in regard to the exercise, enjoyment or restriction of such powers or privileges.\n\u201c(2) Such approval may be given upon application and notice and after hearing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make such order, give such directions and impose such conditions or duties upon either party as to the said Lieutenant-Governor in Council may appear just or desirable, having due regard for the public and all proper interests and all provisions of the law at any time applicable to the taking of land and their valuation and the compensation therefor and appeals from awards thereon shall apply to such lands and in cases under this section where it becomes necessary for the company to obtain the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada it shall do so in addition to otherwise complying with this section.\u201d\n3. By section 7 of chapter 15 of the statutes of Alberta, 1912, intituled, \u201cAn Act to amend the Railway Act,\u201d the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of Alberta, 1907, is amended by adding thereto the following:\u2014\n\u201c(3) The provisions of this section shall extend and apply to the lands of every railway company or person having authority to construct, or operate a railway otherwise than under the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta in so far as the taking of such lands does not unreasonably interfere with the construction and operation of the railway or railways constructed and operated or being constructed and operated by virtue of or under such other legislative authority.\u201d\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy-Minister of Justice, for the Attorney-General for Canada. The enactment in question may be construed to empower any company or person authorized to construct a railway by the Legislature of Alberta to take possession of, use or occupy any lands belonging to any railway company within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada; to use and enjoy the whole or any portion of the right-of-way, tracks, terminals, stations or station grounds of such Dominion railway, and to have and exercise full right and powers to run and operate trains over and upon any portion or portions of the Dominion railway, subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. It will be observed also that sub-section 2, of section 82, of the Alberta \u201cRailway Act,\u201d contemplates that notice of the application for approval may be given to the Dominion company, and that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, after the hearing, may make such order and give such directions and impose such conditions and duties upon the Dominion company as to him appears just or desirable, having due regard for the public and other interests. It may be observed, moreover, that the provisions of sub-section 3 apply only in so far as the taking of the lands does not unreasonably interfere with the construction and operation of the Dominion railway.\nIt is urged on behalf of the Attorney-General for Canada that sub-section 3 is ultra vires, and that it would remain ultra vires even if its application were still further limited by striking out the word \u201cunreasonably.\u201d The subject-matter of the legislation is Dominion railways Which fall within the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada under section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d This field of legislation is wholly withdrawn from the local legislatures. It is not referable to any class of subjects enumerated in section 92.\nReference is made to the following cases decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council: Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[1]; Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Co.[2]; City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co. of Canada[3]; Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacfiic Railway Co.[4]; L\u2019Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[5]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General of Canada[6]; La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat, Light and Power Co.[7].\nIt is submitted that it is, upon the authorities, abundantly plain that the railway lands of a Dominion Railway company cannot be expropriated by provincial authority or encumbered by works or operations not sanctioned by Parliament. Moreover, the rights completely acquired by companies incorporated by Parliament in the execution of its enumerated powers may be enjoyed unaffected by the operation of any local statute intended to modify or subordinate these rights. The local legislature cannot have the power to take away what Parliament gives. Local powers of expropriation, such as they are, are subordinate to the paramount powers of Parliament.\nS. B. Woods K.C. and O. M. Biggar for the Attorney-General for Alberta. It will be observed that the qualifying words at the end of sub-clause (2) of section 82, of the Alberta \u201cRailway Act,\u201d emphasizes the necessity of the local railway company (by which is meant a railway company incorporated by or under the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta) obtaining the opproval of the Board of Railway Com- missioners for Canada whenever it is by law required to obtain such approval, in addition to taking the necessary steps under the local Act (by which is meant the Alberta \u201cRailway Act\u201d and amendments) to entitle it to acquire such lands or interests in lands as it finds necessary in order to carry out its undertaking.\nThe word \u201cland\u201d or \u201clands\u201d in the local Act is defined as including \u201call real estate, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments of any tenure.\u201d\nIt is submitted that the amendment in question is intra vires of the Legislature of Alberta under section 92, sub-section 10, of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d\nA railway to be constructed from one point in the province to any other point in the same province and not going outside of the provincial boundaries is a local work, and undertaking, and may be authorized to be constructed by a provincial legislature. City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[8]. The power of legislation to authorize the construction of a certain work necessarily carries with it the power to enact such legislation as may be required to prevent the purpose of the grant of such power being defeated, even though, in so legislating, the provincial legislature may interfere with or affect a work authorized to be constructed by the Dominion Parliament. The converse of this principle, namely, that Dominion legislative jurisdiction necessarily extends to such ancillary provisions as may be required to prevent the scheme of a Dominion Act from being defeated, even where such ancillary provisions deal with or encroach upon matters assigned to the provincial legislatures under section 92, has been affirmed by the Privy Council in Gushing v. Dupuy[9]; Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[10]; Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[11]. The Privy Council have also held in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[12], that where a power falls within the legitimate meaning of any class of subjects reserved to the local legislatures by section 92, the control of these bodies is as exclusive, full and absolute as is that of the Dominion Parliament over matters within its jurisdiction. Upon this subject the following appears in Todd\u2019s Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies, (2 ed.), p. 436, in discussing the principal above mentioned with regard to Dominion legislation: \u201cThe converse of this principle has also been maintained by the courts in respect to local legislation upon assigned topics which may appear to trench upon prescribed Dominion jurisdiction.\u201d\nIn Bennett v. The Pharmaceutical Association of the Province of Quebec[13], Chief Justice Dorion states that the court considered it a proper rule of interpretation that the powers given to Parliament or the provincial legislature to legislate on certain subjects included \u201call the incidental subjects of legislation which are necessary to carry on the object which the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d declared should be carried on by that legislature.\u201d See also Ex p. Leveill\u00e9[14]; Reg. v. Mohr[15]; In re Prohibitory Liquor Laws[16]; In re De Veber[17]; Jones v. The Canada Central Railway Co.[18], per Osier J. and per Haggerty C.J. in Reg. v. Wason[19], after referring to Gushing v. Dupuy[20].\nThis principle has been followed to support the provisions of provincial laws dealing with procedure to enforce the penal provisions of provincial acts in a number of decided cases and it is submitted is applicable to the present case. The power of the province to legislate in respect of this subject-matter is not to be restricted or its existence denied, because by some possibility it may be abused or may limit the range which otherwise would be open to the Dominion Parliament. Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[21]; Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. The Receiver-General of New Brunswick[22].\nIt is further submitted that the fact that the Dominion Parliament has power to legislate in respect of Dominion railways in a way analogous to the legislation the subject-matter of this reference, in no way interferes with the competence of the provincial legislature to enact the law in question. Both legislatures are equally supreme within their respective jurisdictions. It is, therefore, submitted, that as, under the terms of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d the right of a province to authorize the construction of a railway line that lies wholly within that province is exclusively within the legislative powers of that province (excepting always the right of the Dominion to authorize the construction of such a work under the provisions of section 92, sub-section 10c, by declaring the same to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces) it follows, that there is necessarily involved in this right the right to so legislate that the work so authorized to be constructed can be carried to completion, and for this purpose to give a railway company authorized by the province to build such a line, the power to acquire either the land or such interests in the land of a Dominion railway company (and whether such land lies between the right-of-way fences of the Dominion railway company or is land owned by it as a land grant or otherwise) as will enable the provincial railway to complete its authorized works.\nIt must necessarily follow that the provincial legislature has power to give to its creature the right to interfere to some extent with a railway brought into existence by the Parliament of Canada because the taking of such land or interests in land under such legislation by the provincial railway must of necessity interfere to some extent with the Dominion railway. So long as such interference is not unreasonable or undue and is only such as is necessarily involved in the acquiring of such land or interests in land (including therein a right-of-way or easement over the land or through the land) the giving of such rights is within the competence of the provincial legislature. Whether the boundary line of provincial power has been exceeded must be determined by the courts in each case where such question is raised, and if upon the determination of such fact it be found that the rights purported to be given under the provisions of the provincial Act do interfere to such an extent with the construction and operation of the Dominion railway as to be unreasonable or undue, then such authority given by provincial legislation will not be effective and will confer no rights upon the recipient of it. The province cannot use its authority to authorize the construction of railways within its boundaries in such a way as to prevent the construction and operation of Dominion railways, nor, conversely, can the Dominion use its authority to authorize the construction and operation of railways so as to prevent the construction and operation of a provincial railway, but each legislative jurisdiction can interfere with the operation of other railways in so far as it may be reasonably necessary to carry out its authority to construct or authorize the construction of a railway within its jurisdiction. Such right or power is, by implication, reserved to each legislative body by the terms of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nThe provision in the local Act, the subject of this reference, is not and cannot be covered by Dominion legislation, and it necessarily follows that unless the legislation that is here attacked is within the competence of the province, a Dominion railway can at any time prevent the construction of a provincial railway, and conversely a provincial railway can prevent the construction of a Dominion railway by merely refusing to negotiate for the right to pass through its properties.\nThere are certain provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d purporting to regulate traffic at the point of crossing of a Dominion and provincial railway. R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, sec. 8 (a); 151 (e) 176 and 227. But even they do not purport to give a Dominion railway company the power to acquire the land of or running rights over the land of a provincial railway company or vice versa: see Preston and Berlin Street Railway Co. v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[23] (May, 1906); but have, apparently, been supported on the ground of public safety and convenience: Re Portage Extension of Red River Valley Railway[24]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Co.[25]; Credit Valley Railway Co. v. Great Western Railway Co.[26]; Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Rway. Co. v. Grand Trunk Rway. Co.; Stanford Junction Case[27]; City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Rway. Co.; York Street Bridge Case[28]. In City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[29] it was held by the Privy Council that the right of Parliament to enact section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d so far as it applied to provincial railways, could not be supported under the general power to legislate regarding the peace, order and good government of Canada insomuch as it trenched upon the provincial power of legislation under sub-section 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. It would appear from this that section 227, so far as it affects provincial railways, is also ultra vires.\nThe effect of striking out the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d in the section in question would be to confine the operation of the provincial statute to the land of Dominion railway companies outside of and other than the land included in the right-of-way fences of the Dominion railway. The legislation of the province is intra vires in this regard. The considerations above referred to apply to the answer to this second question. The lands of Dominion railway companies, outside of the right-of-way fences, are subject to the local law just as much as the lands of any other companies or individuals and there would appear to be no good reason why they should not be subject to this law as well as to such a law, for instance, as the provincial \u201cLand Titles Act.\u201d The taking of such land, or interests therein, does not in any way interfere with the construction or operation of Dominion railways and it could be only upon this ground that the Act would be beyond the competence of the province.\nIt is, therefore, submitted that the answers should be in the affirmative.\nDavies J.\u2014I would answer both questions in the negative, and in doing so would explain that I adopt the construction put by counsel at the argument upon the questions. As I understood counsel, it was agreed that the words \u201clands of the company\u201d in the section we are asked to determine the validity of, meant the right-of-way and the stations and terminals in connection therewith of a railway built under the authority of the Dominion Parliament, and were not intended to refer to or include lands granted by way of subsidy merely and not included in such right-of-way, stations and terminals. The real question, counsel agreed, we were desired to answer was whether the provincial Parliament could so legislate as to force a crossing of a provincial railway over and across a Dominion railway.\nNow, as I read and understand section 82, of chapter 8, of the Act of the Legislature of Alberta, 1907, it was only intended to have application to railways authorized to be constructed by the provincial legislature, and not to railways constructed under authority of the Dominion Parliament. It would seem that the latter sentence of sub-section 3 of section 82 making the approval of the Dominion Board of Railway Commissioners essential in addition to that of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council \u201cwhere it was necessary to obtain the approval of such Board,\u201d was inconsistent with this construction. I accept, however, the explanation of Mr. Woods, counsel for Alberta, that the words in question were inserted in the section by inadvertence or mistake and never should have been there.\nThen we have the legislation of 1912 amending the provincial \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1907 by adding the section respecting the power of the legislature to pass which we are asked. It reads as follows:\u2014\n(3) The provisions of this section shall extend and apply to the lands of every railway company or person having authority to construct or operate a railway otherwise than under the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta in so far as the taking of such lands does not unreasonably interfere with the construction and operation of the railway or railways constructed and, operated or being constructed and operated by virtue of or under such other legislative authority.\nIt refers to railways the construction of which is authorized by the Dominion Parliament and attempts to apply the provisions of the railway legislation of 1907 to such Dominion railways so as to authorize the crossing of such railways by provincial railways.\nI do not think such legislation intra vires of the local legislatures. The exclusive power to legislate with respect to Dominion railways is, by the 29th sub-section of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d conferred upon the Dominion Parliament. It is a \u201cmatter coming within one of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 91,\u201d and being such is\nnot to be deemed to come within those classes of subjects assigned exclusively by that Act to the provincial legislatures.\nThe provincial legislature while having full power to authorize the construction of a local or provincial railway, cannot in so doing either override, interfere with or control or affect the crossing or right of crossing of a Dominion railway by a provincial railway. Legislation respecting the crossing of Dominion railways by provincial railways is exclusively vested in the Dominion Parliament, and being so vested by virtue of one of the enumerated classes of subjects of section 91, is explicitly withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the local legislature.\nThe clause in question would give rise to endless difficulties. As it now stands, it is open to the fatal objection that it would refer to the ordinary courts of the land the determination of the question whether the crossing of a Dominion railway by a provincial railway was an \u201cunreasonable interference\u201d with the Dominion railway\u2019s operations. This is a question which the Dominion Board of Railway Commissioners alone is authorized to deal with and its decision is final.\nBut the omission of the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d would not make the legislation intra vires, as the subject-matter was not one within the jurisdiction of the local legislatures at all, being as I have said, withdrawn from them by the latter part of section 91.\nIt was contended strongly by counsel for the province that not only had the legislature of the province power to authorize the crossing of Dominion railways by provincial ones, but that they had power to authorize the crossing of navigable streams or marine hospital lands or lands reserved for military camps or forts or defence.\nThe argument was logical enough, granting the premises assumed, namely, that the exclusive power to build local railways necessarily involved the power to cross these streams, lands, defence works and Dominion railways.\nBut it omits to take cognizance of the rule so often and necessarily applied by the Judicial Committee in the construction of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d that the enumerated subject-matters of legislation assigned to the Dominion Parliament are not deemed to come within the matters assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures though prim\u00e2 facie they may appear to do so, and the further rule of construction that if there is a common field of legislative action within which Parliament and the legislatures are alike competent to legislate, when Parliament occupies the field and legislates, as it has done with respect to the subject-matter under discussion, under one of the enumerated clauses of section 91, its legislation is supreme and overrides that of the local legislatures.\nIdington J.\u2014We are asked whether or not the Alberta legislature can amend the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of that province, adding to section 82 thereof the following:\u2014\n(3) The provisions of this section shall extend and apply to the lands of every railway company or person having authority to construct, or operate a railway otherwise than under the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta in so far as the taking of such lands does not unreasonably interfere with the construction and operation of the railway or railways constructed and operated or being constructed and operated by virtue of or under such other legislative authority, and if not will striking out the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d therein render the clause intra vires? Any legislative enactment under our federal system, which partitions the entire legislative authority, ought to be approached in the spirit of assuming that the legislature did not intend to exceed its powers; and if an interpretation can reasonably be reached which will bring it within the power assigned the legislature in question, and given operative effect, then that meaning ought to be given it.\nOf course, if the plain language is such that to give it operative effect must necessarily involve doing that which is beyond the power assigned the legislature then the Act must be declared null.\nAgain, the language used is sometimes capable of a double meaning according to the respective surrounding circumstances to which it may be sought to be applied.\nIn such case the court on the one hand must refuse to give such effect to the language as will maintain anything ultra vires the legislature, and on the other give such effect to it as will within the purpose and power of the legislature render it effective.\nThen, again, the subject dealt with may be of that complex character that concurrent legislation on the part of a provincial legislature and Parliament is absolutely needed to effectuate satisfactorily the purpose had in view.\nTo the man accustomed to deal only with the legal product of a single legislature possessing paramount legislative authority over all matters that can be legislatively dealt with, this latter situation seems almost incomprehensible. The situation often exists, must be reckoned with and dealt with accordingly. We must not too readily knock aside a provincial enactment. It may be not only susceptible of use, but be actually needed to give operative effect to the authority of Parliament which in a sense may be paramount in authority and power in relation to what the legislature may be attempting yet not possessed of the entire field. The recent case of the City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[30], relative to the question of through traffic furnishes an illustration of how co-operative legislation by a province might have rendered that of Parliament more effectual, or far-reaching in its results.\nWhen we add to these complexities an ambiguity of expression, too often found in statutes, the task of answering such questions as are now submitted becomes increasingly difficult. And when we add thereto the need not only of considering a few concrete facts such as a single case involves, but also the whole range of possible human activities, in the indefinite field thus submitted for us to pass upon, our native humility and modesty are startled and we are tempted to say we do not know.\nHowever, though I have not by any means exhausted the definition or classification of legislative products likely to arise under our federal system, I have indicated some of the manifold considerations that have to be borne in mind in determining whether or not the above section is worthless or may be made use of either in its present shape or when modified in the way suggested.\nThe subject-matters presented and arguments thereon seem to require I should do so and thus guard or qualify the results to be stated in any answers that can be given to the questions submitted.\nOne difficulty suggested is whether or not the questions should be looked at in light of the fact that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., clearly a Dominion legislative product, subsidised by a land grant partly situated in Alberta, might be affected by the legislation in another way than is involved in the merely crossing of its track by a local railway.\nCounsel seemed to agree that that complicated question ought to be eliminated from the problems before us. But I am not quite sure that they were agreed on any substituted form of question if indeed it was competent for them so to agree. Counsel arguing for the Attorney-General for the Dominion, on whose advice the submission is made, and who is the minister in charge of such a reference, and I incline to think must be treated as if dominus litis in such references as those requiring an advisory opinion, has relieved us so far as he can from answering in a way to touch upon questions relative to lands in said subsidy.\nI am not sure that his waiver would help much were it a reference of a concrete case involving some right as between the Dominion and a province. It is here, however, merely a question wherein it is desired by the government to be advised before vetoing or refraining from vetoing the legislation. It has also been throughout the argument painfully obvious to my mind that if the legislation is ultra vires then it can hurt no one, not even the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., and if it is clearly intra vires it would in such case at least so far as relating to said lands, hardly concern any one else than the Legislature of Alberta.\nIt seemed finally in argument to be, as between parties arguing before us, a question of the right of a provincial railway to cross a Dominion railway by virtue solely of the provincial legislative authority.\nI have not and never had supposed any one else could have had any doubt upon such a point.\nThe Dominion Parliament having by virtue of its exclusive powers over the enumerated subjects in section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d created a corporate power and thereby conferred on one or more persons the power to construct or cause to be constructed a railway, that railway cannot be crossed by any other railway company which with its work is only the product of the somewhat analogous powers given by section 92 to provincial legislatures over \u201clocal works and undertakings.\u201d\nI have considered the elaborate argument addressed to us to the contrary and hope I understand it.\nAs to that parallel drawn between the incidental or necessarily implied powers which have been held to be part and parcel of the power conferred by the powers given the Dominion over the enumerated subjects of section 91 and the supposed need to give vitality to the powers of the provinces over local works and undertakings by means of implying similar incidental and necessarily implied powers in anything to be enacted in order to the carrying into execution of any such provincial powers, I have just this to say.\nI agree the analogy holds good until the attempt to give operative effect to it runs against the exclusive precedent power and its products.\nThe \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d expressly assigns to the Dominion Parliament in and for the purposes of the executing of the powers over the enumerated subjects in section 91 and the exception in section 92, sub-section 10, such exclusive and paramount authority over the subject-matters therein mentioned that when we have regard to the matters of the business in hand as when a railway crossing of a Dominion railway by a provincial railway has to be constructed it is clear that it must be affected either by virtue of concurrent legislative provisions covering all that is necessary to provide for executing such a purpose with due security for the safety of all those concerned in the construction and use of the physical product called a crossing, or by virtue of the power having the exclusive and paramount authority referred to exercising the full power necessary to determine the means of executing such a purpose.\nHaving regard to the nature of the business in hand and the clear language of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d I think the full effect I suggest must be given the predominant or paramount powers I have mentioned. After these powers have been exercised all that the provincial legislature is given must be read as subject thereto.\nThe argument for the proposition that the powers assigned the province must be given such full effect as to enable the local road to accomplish a crossing without relying upon the authority of the Dominion, was attempted to be supported by the recent decision in the Marriage Laws Case[31]. I am disposed to think the point well taken as mere matter of argument put forward for consideration. It is to be observed, however, that the opinion therein was merely advisory and decides nothing and is of no consequence in relation to the interpretation and construction of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d save so far as the reasoning upon which it proceeded when applied to said Act commends itself to those having to deal therewith.\nThen having due regard thereto I am, with great respect, quite unable to understand how any express and exclusive dominating power such as given by the Act to the Dominion despite the so-called exclusive authority subject thereto given the provinces, is ever in any case to be minimized, much less deleted from the Act because of some apparently inconsistent power given the provinces. If need be to discard either, it is the subsequent and subordinate power that must be deleted, as it were, in order to give the precedent and paramount power its full effective operation.\nThe use of the adverb \u201cexclusively\u201d in section 92, and adjective \u201cexclusive\u201d in section 91, unfortunately leads those not examining the whole, to assume each must have the same effect. But the language used when analyzed as it has been so often renders it clear that the general purpose was to subordinate the powers of the legislatures, no matter how it might affect them, to those of Parliament, over the said enumerated subjects.\nThe attempt has been made in many cases to give the subordinate provincial powers such operative effect as the language defining them at first blush might warrant, notwithstanding the precedent dominating power given over the enumerated subjects in the sub-sections of section 91 to the Dominion had not been exercised or at least exhausted or because they had been exercised later than the provincial powers apparently bearing on the same subject.\nThese attempts always failed in the courts of last resort until the Marriage Laws Case[32]. The trend of authority in many cases including some of those cited to us, had run so strongly the other way as to become the subject of adverse criticism on the ground that the powers claimed by the Dominion had been carried further than in fact necessary for the due execution of the particular power involved, and thus needlessly invaded the field assigned the provinces.\nThere is a mass of authority of this kind in the way of decisions in concrete cases, which having binding authority we must observe, despite later merely advisory opinions, even if apparently conflicting, though possibly not.\nThen it is said, pursuing same line of argument relative to the power claimed by the enactment now in question, that the Dominion has not by express enactment taken possession of the field and, therefore, the province has authority to enact, and a line of cases is cited to us which it is urged give expression to such a doctrine. When examined these cases do not support the alleged doctrine. In most of them there is nothing more than that a province may have in the exercise of its power over property and civil rights enacted a law which perhaps has been superseded pro tanto by an enactment of Parliament in the exercise of its exclusive legislative authority over the enumerated subjects in section 91. This has been sometimes expressed as a taking possession by the Dominion of the same field or part of the same field or as overlapping, as it were, in the same field by concurrent legislation. A more accurate mode of expression is that\nsubjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within section 92 may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within section 91.\n(Clement\u2019s Canadian Constitution (2 ed.), page 172, quoting from the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Hodge v. The Queen[33], at page 130.)\nWith great respect I think the metaphor of a supposed field, as it has sometimes been expressed, is not quite accurate, and in other cases the true limits of the respective powers have been, as result of its misapplication, misapprehended. For example: When by virtue of its authority over property and civil rights a legislature has enacted something giving a right of property, and later the Dominion Parliament has in the due exercise of its exclusive powers over bankruptcy enacted something else which of necessity invaded that right of property, it may in doing so disturb apparently existent rights of property and other civil rights. But such rights of property always were held subject to such disturbing power.\nThat part of the field of property and civil rights which Parliament may thus have taken possession of, never had existed in the province. It had only exercised its undoubted power over property and civil rights so far as competent for it to do so, but had never occupied the same field as the expression \u201ctaking possession of the field\u201d so often implies. The bank or Dominion railway company, for example, operate by virtue of the exclusive authority of Parliament. These corporate bodies rest such operations in the field of property and civil rights sometimes solely upon the authority of Parliament in ways that the legislature of a province with all its power over property could not enable, and at other times upon the authority of both Parliament and legislature.\nThe purposes and objects to be attained by each legislative power are the measure by which their respective legislative fields are constituted and they never can be the same field though the physical appearance as result of obedience to the law either may enact, may produce often a semblance that seems to justify the expression.\nGreat confusion of thought often exists because people do not stop to think and discriminate between these exclusive powers of Parliament and the residual power which Parliament has for the \u201cpeace, order and good government of Canada,\u201d but which in its turn is subordinate to the so-called exclusive powers given in section 92 to the provincial legislatures.\nThe gravest error is likely to grow out of this confusion by accustoming the legislative and judicial mind, if I may say so, to look upon the Dominion as possessing a general supervision or superior power over identically the same thing as the province is entitled to deal with, but which it has not save by the indirect means of the veto power over provincial enactments.\nThe notion sometimes prevails that, as of course, the legislation of a province must bend before that of Parliament. It must before the paramount exclusive legislative authority given over specified subjects, but not before what Parliament asserts merely by virtue only of this residual power.\nIn the case of the matter in hand I think there are two answers to the contentions founded on the theory put forward. The Dominion Parliament has, I incline to think, taken possession of the field which I will call the subject of crossing of railways, of which one or more may happen to be a Dominion railway, and has dealt in detail with all the immediate acts involved in carrying out such a purpose, so that in a proper case there should not be a legal difficulty in accomplishing a crossing of such railway as in question.\nBut even if it has not gone quite so far I think its enactment under which one of the railways within its exclusive control has been constructed and is being operated, has in itself such force and effect that a provincial legislature cannot interfere to force by its own unaided act a crossing thereof by one of its own creations.\nIs there then any purpose which the said section submitted herein can subserve? Is there anything on which it can so rest as to be possibly intra vires the legislature?\nIt is quite clear that Parliament has no power to add to a provincial corporation a capacity not already given it. If such a railway company has not been given directly or impliedly the capacity to cross another railway, Parliament cannot give it that capacity except by declaring it a work for the benefit of Canada.\nIn like manner, if as is contended, Parliament has not so dealt with the subject of crossing and there is nothing enabling it and the Dominion railway charter expressly or impliedly disables it from being done, then I conceive it is quite competent for a legislature to pass some such Act as the section in question to be conditional in its operation upon corresponding legislation being duly enacted by Parliament.\nIt does not seem to me that such an enactment need be in very exact terms conditional if it is capable of such use or application.\nIt certainly ought to be held that a legislature is competent to make a tender of such legislative assistance if we are to work out our federal system in all its bearings.\nI must not, however, conceal the fact that I made such a suggestion in the Marriage Laws Case[34], and expressed the view that it was quite competent for Parliament to so act upon or by virtue of its powers therein involved, but in view of the result of that case in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[35] there is room to argue that such a doctrine as I here enunciate and have often laid down has no foundation.\nParliament certainly has the power to aid thus the treating and dealing with other countries. No one ever questioned it in known instances, and surely it is quite competent for it to so deal with the provinces.\nIn fact it has heretofore and until the Marriage Case34 so dealt with them.\nI have no serious difficulty in this case in so holding if the section can be read, as if conditional, for example, upon due leave being got from the Board of Railway Commissioners to render it operative. So far as that may, if possible, be implied the section may be intra vires.\nAs at present advised I do not think the proviso relative to Railway Commissioners at the end of the sub-section which precedes this amending sub-section, is effective for such purpose, or can be imported into this new legislation as if part thereof.\nBut the purpose of the submission as indicated by the possible amendment to the section as proposed and the withdrawal of the possible bearing of the enactment upon the Canadian Pacific Railway lands assigned by virtue of its subsidy, seems to be tentative and, therefore, the liberty extended to us instead of a single affirmative or negative answer, to answer in such a way as to deal with the value of the enactment as giving a right to cross a Dominion railway without the leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, or other means given or to be given by authority of Parliament.\nMy answer, therefore, is that the section as it stands or would stand after striking out the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d would not, without the authority of Parliament or some person or body duly delegated its power in the premises, be effective as giving the right to any provincial railway company to cross a Dominion railway.\nDuff J.\u2014Section 82(2) of chapter 8 of the Alberta statutes of 1907 contains these words:\u2014\nAnd in cases under this section where it becomes necessary for the company to obtain the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada it shall do so in addition to otherwise complying with this section,\nand in view of that clause it may be doubted whether the power conferred upon provincial railway companies by the first sub-section ought not be held to be exercisable in respect of the \u201clands\u201d of Dominion railways only after the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada has pursuant to its lawful powers in that behalf given its approval to the proposed action of the provincial railway company.\nIt may further be doubted whether on the true construction of section 7 of chapter 15 of the Act of 1912 the amendment effected by that enactment is not limited to authorizing the provincial railways with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as well as that of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada to \u201ctake possession of, use or occupy\u201d lands of any Dominion railway company as contradistinguished from \u201cright-of-way tracks, terminal stations or station grounds.\u201d\nIf such be the effect of these enactments they are obviously unobjectionable from a constitutional point of view.\nBoth parties, however, desire us to deal with the question whether provincial legislation can or cannot validly confer upon a provincial railway company compulsory powers for the purpose of enabling it to construct its line across the line of a Dominion railway by way of level crossing and to run its trains over the line when constructed. I think the question must be answered in the negative. It is, of course, impossible to construct a railway across another existing railway in such a way as to form a level crossing without altering in some degree the physical structure of the works of the existing railway.\nLegislation authorizing such action on the part of a provincial railway company and requiring the Dominion railway company to submit to such alteration of the structure of its works, and to the passing of the trains of the provincial railways across its line, in so far as it is merely permissive or facultative, is legislation strictly relating to the provincial railway and if it stopped there would as such be within the powers of a provincial legislature. But in so far as it affects to confer authority upon or compulsory powers as against the Dominion company it is legislation relating to a Dominion railway as such. In that respect it is legislation of a character that the Dominion alone has power to enact. Some of the powers of the Dominion in respect of Dominion railways are (it could hardly be disputed) exclusive powers. In Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[36], at page 372, Lord Watson said:\u2014\nThe \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d whilst it gives the legislative control of the appellants\u2019 railway qu\u00e2 railway to the Parliament of the Dominion, does not declare that the railway shall cease to be part of the provinces in which it is situated, or that it shall, in other respects, be exempted from the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. Accordingly, the Parliament of Canada has, in the opinion of their Lordships, exclusive right to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair, and alteration of the railway, and for its management, and to dictate the constitution and powers of the company; but it is, inter alia, reserved to the provincial parliament to impose direct taxation upon those portions of it which are within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes. It was obviously in the contemplation of the Act of 1867 that the \u201crailway legislation,\u201d strictly so called, applicable to those lines which were placed under its charge should belong to the Dominion Parliament. It, therefore, appears to their Lordships that any attempt by the Legisature of Quebec to regulate by enactment, whether described as municipal or not, the structure of a ditch forming part of the appellant company\u2019s authorized works would be legislation in excess of its powers.\nLegislation, therefore, authorizing the altering for railway purposes of the structure of the works of a Dominion railway, and the running of trains over the works as altered is legislation upon a subject which as subject-matter for legislation necessarily falls within the field exclusively assigned to the Dominion.\nThe works dealt with by section 92 (10) are, as Lord Atkinson observed in the judgment in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[37], \u201cthings not services.\u201d Some of them at all events (railways and telegraph lines, for example,) are things of such a character that for many purposes they must be treated as entireties. The observations of his Lordship in the judgment just mentioned suggest that as far as possible they should be so regarded when considered as subject-matter of legislation. In that view it seems to follow that when you have an existing Dominion railway all matters relating to the physical interference with the works of that railway or the management of the railway should be regarded as wholly withdrawn from provincial authority. Fisheries Case[38], at page 715; Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Co.[39], at page 628. Questions of a similar character may arise when a projected Dominion railway is to cross a provincial railway. What compulsory powers the Dominion is entitled to exercise in such a case over the provincial railway in respect of the crossing and matters incidental thereto without assuming complete jurisdiction over the provincial railway by declaring it to be \u201ca work for the general advantage of Canada,\u201d is a subject which does not require discussion here.\nThere are two further observations:\u2014\n1. In the view I have just expressed (namely, that legislation such as that under consideration conferring authority upon a provincial railway to alter for railway purposes the physical structure of the works of a Dominion railway without the consent of the Dominion railway company or the sanction of the Dominion Parliament and all legislation relating to the management of such a railway is legislation upon a subject which since it necessarily falls within the subject of Dominion railways can only be enacted by the Dominion) no question of the so-called doctrines of \u201coverlapping powers\u201d and \u201cnecessarily incidental powers\u201d can arise; and the points raised during the able discussion of those subjects by counsel of Alberta do not require consideration.\n2. As is shewn by Lord Watson\u2019s judgment in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[40] (and, indeed, it must be obvious when we consider the numerous cases in which jurisdiction over the railway of a provincial company has been assumed by the Dominion by declaring the railway to be a work for the general advantage of Canada after the company had received a large land subsidy from the province,) the fact that exclusive jurisdiction in relation to a Dominion railway, as railway, is vested in the Dominion is not incompatible with the possession by the province of some authority over the Dominion railway company as land owner; how far in legislating for a provincial railway the province has authority to confer compulsory powers as against a Dominion railway company as land owner is a question upon which I express no opinion.\nAnglin J. agreed with Davies J.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014We are asked by this reference to declare whether section 7 of chapter 15 of the Act of the Legislature of Alberta of 1912 is intra vires.\nThe Legislature of Alberta passed in 1907 a \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and section 82 of that Act provided: \u2014\nThe company may take possession of, use or occupy any lands belonging to any other railway company, use and enjoy the whole or any portion of the right-of-way, tracks, terminals, stations or station grounds of any other railway company and have and exercise full right and powers to run and operate its trains over and upon any portion or portions of the railway of any other railway company, subject always to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council first obtained or to any order or direction which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make in regard to the exercise, enjoyment or restriction of such powers or privileges.\n(2) Such approval may be given upon application and notice and after hearing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make such order, give such directions and impose such conditions and duties upon either party as to the said Lieutenant-Governor in Council may appear just or desirable, having due regard for the public and all proper interests and all provisions of the law at any time applicable to the taking of land and their valuation and the compensation therefor and appeals from awards thereon shall apply to such lands and in cases under this section where it becomes necessary for the company to obtain the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada it shall do so in addition to otherwise complying with this section.\nIt seems to me that the legislation had in view not only the crossing of provincial railways, but also of federal railways because of the reference therein to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. But the definition in the Act of the word \u201ccompany\u201d made it somewhat doubtful whether the above quoted provisions would apply to federal railways and a new sub-section was added in 1912 by chapter 15, section 7, which reads as follows:\u2014\n(3) The provisions of this section shall extend and apply to the lands of every railway company or person having authority to construct or operate a railway otherwise than under the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta in so far as the taking of such lands does not unreasonably interfere with the construction and operation of the railway or railways constructed and operated or being constructed and operated by virtue of or under such legislative authority.\nBy the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d sub-section 10 of section 92, the provincial legislature may exclusively make laws in regard to local works and undertakings.\nA railway built within the boundaries of a province is subject to the legislative control of that province. The corporate powers of such a railway company, its rights and obligations are essentially under such legislative control.\nIts power to build a line from one point to another is granted by the provincial legislature and the provincial legislature alone can give such authority. If in its course the railway comes in contact with federal works it may be subject to some federal regulations, but the enabling power to cross those federal undertakings rests essentially with the province.\nA provincial railway may have to cross a navigable river. Navigation is under the legislative authority of the federal Parliament and laws have been passed by that Parliament as to the manner in which bridges could be put on those rivers (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 115). In such a case the provincial railway will be required to follow the federal regulations, but the right to build a bridge shall have to be granted to the company by the local legislature.\nThe legislation, the constitutionality of which is contested, deals with the crossing of railways.\nIn the case of two provincial railways the executive authority of the province is empowered to deal with the matter, to give its approval and impose such conditions as it may appear just or desirable having due regard for the public interests. In the case of the crossing of a federal railway the provincial railway is still bound to obtain the approval of the provincial government; but, as I read the statute, that provincial railway will also require the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada which is the federal authority having executive and judicial control over federal railways.\nThe power conferred by the legislation upon the provincial railway to cross a provincial or federal railway is such an enabling power as was within the legislative authority of a provincial legislature.\nThe claim that the federal Parliament is the only authority that could give such enabling power is unfounded, because the provincial railway company could not construct its line through or over or below a federal railway, unless the federal authorities would be willing to pass the necessary legislation. The powers then granted by sub-section 10 of section 92 of \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d would become illusory. The enabling power rests with the provincial authority and a regulative power recognized by the provincial legislation may be exercised by the federal authorities.\nThe crossing of railways is of constant occurrence. The provincial legislature in creating local railway companies have the power to confer upon them as an incident of their legislative authority in the matter the right to cross any other railway, local or federal. But that must be done, of course, without interfering unreasonably with the construction or operation of the other railway. It is precisely what the legislation has provided for in this case.\nBut there is more. The legislature far from encroaching upon federal legislative or executive authority has enacted that where it becomes necessary for the company to obtain the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada it shall do so. There is in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d a legislation regarding the crossing of provincial railways by federal railways. It may be doubtful whether such legislation was within the power of the federal authority, but then concurrent legislation was advisable and it is what was done. The Act in question provides for enabling and concurrent legislation that was within the legislative authority of the Province of Alberta.\nFor those reasons I would answer that section 7 of chapter 15 of the Act of the Legislature of Alberta, in 1912, is intra vires.\n[1] [1899] A.C. 367.\n[2] [1899] A.C. 626.\n[3] [1905] A.C. 52.\n[4] [1906] A.C. 204, at p. 210.\n[5] L.R. 6 P.C. 31, at p. 37.\n[6] [1907] A.C. 65.\n[7] [1909] A.C. 194.\n[8] 43 Can.

VII., c. 32\u2014\u201cB.N.A. Act, 1867,\u201d s. 92, item 10.\nOn an application by the City of Vancouver, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada authorized the Corporation of the City of Vancouver to construct overhead bridges across the tracks of a Dominion railway company, which had been laid down during the years 1909 and 1910 on certain streets in the city, and ordered that a portion of the cost of construction of two of these bridges and of the depression of the tracks at the crossings thereof by the Dominion railway should be borne by a tramway company which derived its powers through provincial legislation and an agreement with the city pursuant to such legislation under which it operated its tramways upon these streets. By the agreement the tramway company became entitled to use the city streets with reciprocal obligations by the city and the company respecting their grading, repair and maintenance, and it was provided that the city should receive a share of the gross earnings of the tramway company. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the order of the Board:\u2014 Held, Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, in virtue of sections 81(a), 59, 237, and 238 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, as amended by chapter 32 of 8 & 9 Edw. VII., the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada had jurisdiction to determine the \u201cinterested parties\u201d in respect of the proposed works and to direct what proportion of the cost thereof should be borne by each of them. The City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ((1908) A.C. 54); Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours ((1899) A.C. 367); City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. (37 Can. S.C.R. 232); County of Carleton v. City of Ottawa (41 Can. S.C.R. 552), and Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and York (25 Out. App. R. 65), followed.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ., dissenting.\u2014(1) The Parliament of Canada, when it assumes jurisdiction, under the provisions of item 10 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d in respect of a provincial railway, qu\u00e2 railway, must assume such jurisdiction over the work or undertaking \u201cas an integer.\u201d (2) The order of the Board cannot be sustained as being made in the exercise of the Dominion power of taxation. (3) As there is no Dominion interest concerned in the provisions of the order under appeal, and the Dominion Parliament has no power to compel the provincial company to assume the burden of the cost of the proposed works, or any portion thereof, the Board of Railway Commissioners had no jurisdiction to assess a proportion of their cost upon the tramway company. (4) The cases cited above must be distinguished as they do not sustain, as a valid exercise of ancillary power by Dominion authority, any enactment professing to control a provincial railway company.\n(Note.\u2014Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted on 14th July, 1913.)\nAPPEAL from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, dated on the 14th of October, 1912, in so far as it directs the appellants to pay a proportion of the cost of overhead crossings at the intersections of the tracks of their tramway by Hastings and Harris Streets, in the City of Vancouver, B.C., upon the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction to order the appellants to pay any part of the cost of such works.\nThe order appealed from is recited in full in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff, at page 108 of this report.\nR. A. Pringle K.C. and E. Lafleur K.C. for the appellants. Upon the true construction of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and of sections 91 and 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d the Board had no jurisdiction over the electric tramway of the appellants, the appellant company being a provincial corporation, operating a provincial tramway only in the City of Vancouver, and having no connection with any railway or tramway outside the Province of British Columbia, and not subject to the provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act,\u201d nor to the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe first point to be considered is whether or not that Act of itself gives jurisdiction in such a case as the present. Section 8 reads as follows: \u201cEvery railway, steam or electric street railway or tramway, the construction or operation of which is authorized by special Act of the legislature of any province, and which connects with or crosses or may hereafter connect with or cross any railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall, although not declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, be subject to the provisions of this Act relating to (a) the connection or crossing of one railway or tramway with or by another, so far as concerns the aforesaid connection or crossing.\u201d We note particularly the definite distinction made between \u201ca railway connected with or crossing any railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada,\u201d and, \u201ca railway declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada,\u201d shewing that, in the mind of the legislature, a railway which connects with a railway having a Dominion charter does not by reason of such connection become a railway declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. Section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d should be limited in its application to such provincial railways as connect, either directly or indirectly, with lines extending beyond the limits of the province, and in view of the provisions of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d it could not have been the intention to subject provincial lines, having no such connection, to the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d The Act must be interpreted as dealing with matters properly subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and it would be contrary to the spirit of the Act to make it apply to purely provincial undertakings.\nThe Board had no jurisdiction under sections 237 and 238 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d as amended by chapter 32 of 8 & 9 Edw. VII., sec. 5, or under any other section of said Act, to order the appellants to pay any proportion of the cost of the bridges referred to in the order.\nWe crave leave to refer to the following authorities: Montreal Street Railway Co. v. The City of Montreal[1]; Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[2], at p. 360; City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[3]; Maxwell\u2019s Interpretation of Statutes (4 ed.), pp. 163, 211; Colquhoun v. Heddon[4]; Merritton Crossing Case[5]; Duthie v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[6].\nAndrew Haydon, for respondents, the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway and Navigation Company. We do not admit that the portion of the cost of constructing the crossings referred to in the order complained of is equitable as against us, and consider that a larger portion of the cost of construction should have been apportioned to be paid by the British Columbia Electric Railway Co.\nIn The City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[7], it was held that sections 187 and 188 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888 were intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. These sections were reproduced in the Act of 1903 as sections 186 and 187. In the consolidation, chapter 37, R.S.C., 1906, section 186 appears somewhat more in detail as section 237, and section 187 appears as section 238. Both of these sections were repealed and new sections, considerably amplified but having the same objects in view, were re-enacted in 1909, by chapter 32 of 8 & 9 Edw. VII. Consequently it is not now open to the appellants to contend that these sections are ultra vires. See, also, Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General of Canada[8]; The City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[9]. An important feature in the latter case is that the judgment only purports to deal with subsection (b) of section 8, and it is stated that upon the other sub-sections it is unnecessary to express an opinion. It is submitted that sub-section (a) of section 8 is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. The federal legislation in connection with this matter is as follows: \u201cRailway Act,\u201d 51 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 4; amended by 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 23, sec. 1; and the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d 1903, 3 Edw. VII., ch. 58, sec. 7.\nThe control over the physical crossing should rest In some one body; that body cannot be the legislature of the province. The safety of the public travelling on a federal line of railway is of importance. The difficulties referred to in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Montreal Street Railway Case[10], arising out of dual control, do not exist in the present case. If the Parliament of Canada has not control over the matter of crossings, it would he possible for a provincial line, by building across the proposed route of a federal line, to prevent the construction of the federal line connecting one province with another. It necessarily follows from the fact that Parliament is given power to authorize the construction of lines connecting one province with another, that it must have complete jurisdiction over the matter of ordering such crossings, and, as incidental thereto, the making of orders for protection and safety of the public at such crossings.\nFor the purpose of carrying out the building of a federal railway, Parliament is empowered to take provincial lands. Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11].\nJ. G. Hay for respondent, the City of Vancouver. The decision of the Board in respect to all questions of law and fact cannot now be considered; their decision thereon is final; James Bay Railway Co. v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[12]. The order complained of is intra vires and is justified under sections 8(a), 59(2), 237(2) (3), and 238 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The Dominion had authority to make these enactments, and also the amendment effected by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, secs, 4 and 5, such legislation being necessary to carry out the ancillary control germane to the subject: City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[13], at p. 346; Cushing v. Dupuy[14]; Tennant v. Union Bank[15]; Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and County and Township of York[16], at p. 72; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[17]; City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[18], per Girouard J., at p. 238, Davies J., at pp. 240, 241, 243, and 244, Idington J., at p. 248; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General of Canada[19]; City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[20], per Collins L.J., at p. 58; City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[21], per Idington J., at pp. 213 and 215 to 217; Duff J., at pp. 227, 230, 231 and 232; Girouard J., at p. 200; Anglin J., at pp. 237 to 246 and the cases there exhaustively collected and quoted; also the same case on appeal to Privy Council13, at p. 346. While it was held that sub-section (b) of section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d was ultra vires, no such decision was given as to sub-section (a) and the subject matters of the two provisions are dissimilar. In the present case there is no attempt to interfere with or regulate the affairs of the appellants qu\u00e2 railway, but it is ordered to pay a certain proportion of cost in like manner as if it had been any other kind of a corporate body or any natural person.\nThe appellant cannot escape because of being incorporated by or exercising powers given by a provincial legislature. If such an argument were sound the city or any municipality or joint-stock company created by and under the exclusive legislative control of the provincial legislature could escape liability, and municipalities have time and again been held liable in just such cases as the present. Re Canadian Pacific Railway Company and County and Township of York[22], at p. 570; City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[23], at p. 244; City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[24]; County of Carleton v. City of Ottawa[25]; MacMurchy and Denison \u201cRailway Law of Canada\u201d (2 ed.), p. 27. If such an argument were sound the present \u201cRailway Act\u201d would be practically unworkable and useless in very many respects.\nEven if section 8(a) were alone relied on, the present case is one of \u201cconnection or crossing.\u201d That for the protection of the crossing it is necessary to elevate the appellants\u2019 tracks and the city streets for some distance on each side of the actual point of contact of the tracks can surely make no difference. That is a matter entirely for the Board to determine. By section 59 the Board may order any \u201cperson\u201d interested to pay the cost or a portion thereof. The appellant is a \u201cperson\u201d interested. By section 34, sub-section (20): \u201cPerson\u201d includes any body corporate and politic. City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.23, at p. 242; City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.24, at p. 59. On the evidence there is no doubt that the appellants are not only interested, but directly benefited by the proposed work, and the Board so found.\nUnder sub-section (3) of section 238 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d as amended by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sec. 4, power is not limited to persons \u201cinterested,\u201d but is extended to any municipality \u201cor other corporation or person.\u201d The provisions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888 (secs. 187 and 188), under which many of the cases in point have been decided, limited the power to \u201cany person interested.\u201d The decision of the Board as to whether or not the appellant is a person or party interested is one of fact which cannot be interfered with. Even if it is not a question in fact the Board\u2019s decision is still conclusive and binding and cannot be reviewed on this appeal. \u201cRailway Act,\u201d sec. 26, sub-sec.

Hay for respondent,\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the Board had jurisdiction to hear the application and give the relief asked for by the municipality with respect to the highway bridge and to assess the cost upon the parties interested.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. agreed with Anglin J.\nIdington J.\u2014It seems to me quite clear that the Board had jurisdiction to make the order complained of. Unless we hold that a local railway company concerned in a crossing of a Dominion railway is something superior to and more sacred than a mere municipal corporation, the principle applicable to the case is completely covered by authority.\nThere was a railway constructed by the Dominion railway company now in question before the change in the law which section 238a of the Act brought about, and a part of it across the streets in question so that we must look at the law as decided relative to the older railways.\nEvery \u201cperson interested\u201d had been theretofore held liable to contribute. Municipal corporations were held to be liable. It dawned at last on some part of the stupid public when the doctrine was pushed rather far, that railway companies, like others, ought to furnish the expenses of averting the dangers they had created.\nBut even then section 238a was the utmost Parliament could see its way to give in way of relief from such a state of things.\nIt seems idle to say it can be relied on for relief herein against an old railway simply by reason of its needing new sidings.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the foregoing I have had the privilege of reading my brother Duff\u2019s opinion and may be permitted to add that, though I cannot see my way to distinguishing between a municipality having jurisdiction over a street and a street railway company running over a street, yet I never have been able to understand how making others pay for their right-of-way and incidental protection against the dangers they have created, or may create, is a necessarily incidental part of the powers of Parliament over a certain class of railways. In my dissenting judgment in the case of City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[32], at pages 244 et seq., I tried to shew that it never had been so intended originally, and if the words used could be held wide enough it was not intra vires Parliament to so enact. The recoil, from the mode of treatment of the power of Parliament which prevailed in that and other cases, came in the Montreal Street Railway Case[33]. And section 238a above referred to, seems to indicate a railway can be built and run without such powers. Then, if so, wherein is the incidental necessity for pretending to exercise such a power? Unless necessarily incidental to efficient exercise of the power Parliament has it not, and seems by section 238a to have written the condemnation of such an exercise of power. However, until the courts above pass further I must, as I view the results of the appeals thereto, bow to and follow what seems to me the principle thereof.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. from an order made by the Board of Railway Commissioners, dated the 14th October, 1912, which is as follows:\u2014\nORDER OF BOARD.\nOrder No. 17,840.\nMonday, the 14th day of October, A.D. 1912.\nH.

Cartwright,\nSec. of Board of Raihoay\nCommissioners for Canada.\nOttawa, Oct. 25th, 1912. There are several grounds of appeal. It will be convenient first to consider the contention that the order in question is so far as it professes to direct the appellants to pay a portion of the cost of the overhead bridges which the municipality is thereby authorized to construct is an order which the Parliament of Canada could not empower the Board of Railway Commissioners to make. The Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway is a railway originally authorized by the Legislature of British Columbia, but afterwards declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada and thereby brought under the jurisdiction of Parliament. The British Columbia Electric Railway Co., which I shall refer to as the Electric Company, is a company which under an Act of the Legislature of British Columbia has power to operate an electric railway in Vancouver upon obtaining the consent of the municipality, and the Electric Company and the municipality respectively are authorized to enter into an agreement respecting the grading and maintenance of the highways through and upon which the electric railway runs. I shall have to refer in the course of this judgment to some of the terms of the agreement entered into pursuant to this authority. Prior to 1909 the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway Co., which I shall call the Dominion Company, had constructed a line to the City of Vancouver and had a passenger and freight station there. Some time during the year 1909 (the exact date does not appear) this company laid down a line from False Creek, where its station was, northerly to the south shore of Burrard Inlet. This line was constructed under authority of an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners made in the month of May, 1907. It crossed Harris and Hastings Streets (running east and west), two of the streets referred to in the order under appeal. At the time the order of May, 1907, was made, the Electric Company had constructed its railway on Harris Street, that is to say, it had laid down on that street a single track, but had no tracks on Hastings Street. When the Dominion Company laid down its line across these streets in 1909, the Electric Company had in the meantime constructed a second track on Harris Street and had also laid down a track on Hastings Street, but it seems that this track had not yet been connected with their city railway system. In the year 1910 (6th Sept.), on the application of the Dominion Company, an order was made by the Board authorizing it to construct two additional industrial tracks from False Creek to Burrard Inlet alongside and parallel to the track laid in 1909 and crossing, of course, the streets already referred to. This application was opposed by the Municipality of Vancouver and by the Electric Company, and the order contains a clause in the following words:\u2014\nThat owing to the low-lying nature of the ground through which the said tracks were run and the probable necessity in future of carrying the said streets or some of them over the said tracks, all questions relating to the separation of grades and the distribution of the cost thereof are hereby reserved.\nThe order under appeal was made upon the application of the municipality; and the circumstances in which that application came to be made were clearly stated to the Board by Alderman Baxter. There is no dispute whatever about the facts. In 1912 the Municipal Council of Vancouver decided to put permanent pavements on four streets running east and west (two of which were Harris and Hastings Streets) which were crossed by the three tracks of the Dominion company already mentioned. As was anticipated by the Board in 1909, it was thought that the streets at the place where these tracks crossed were too low and it was Considered desirable to elevate the grade of the streets. It was accordingly decided to construct, with the leave of the Board, overhead bridges carrying the highways over these tracks. A by-law was passed by the Council authorizing the construction of these bridges, but on being submitted to the ratepayers was not confirmed as the law of British Columbia required. It was then determined by the Council to apply first to the Board for leave to construct the bridges and for an order apportioning the cost between the Dominion Company and the municipality and then to propose another by-law authorizing the municipality to carry out the scheme as sanctioned by the Board. Mr. Baxter\u2019s statement makes it quite clear that the occasion for the application arose from the necessity of determining the permanent grade of these four streets. It was a question, he said, whether on the one hand, the grade was to be elevated, or on the other, the grade was to be made to conform to the grade of the railway tracks and level crossings established. It was necessary to have the matter disposed of because people were applying for permits to build upon these streets and these could not be granted owing to the inability of the municipality to give the grade of the streets. The Council preferred the former of the two alternative courses because, as Mr. Baxter put it, they recognized that the street grades were too low and must eventually be raised.\nThe application to the Board then was an application made pursuant to the reservation contained in the order of 1909 to authorize the municipality to construct bridges across the Dominion Company\u2019s tracks (if the municipality, by the ratepayers, should approve the proposals of the council in respect of the grades of these streets), and to declare the respective proportions of the cost of the bridges to be paid by the Dominion Company and the municipality.\nIt will be observed also that the order made was a permissive order leaving it to the discretion of the municipality whether the bridges should be built or not. The order is not an order directing precautionary measures to be taken for the public protection against the dangers of a railway crossing. The tracks in question are for the transport of freight only to and from the company\u2019s dock on the harbour front. The statement by Mr. MacNeil, for the Dominion Company, which was not questioned at all, was that there would not be more than two \u201cmovements\u201d of freight in each twenty-four hours on these tracks, and that if necessary these \u201cmovements\u201d could all take place at night. The real scope, purpose and effect of this order is that it gives permission to the municipality to put into effect, if it sees fit, the Council\u2019s proposals to carry these highways over the railway as a necessary part of a design to elevate the grades of the streets; the protection which may incidentally be afforded was not in any sense the object nor was the necessity of it the ground of the order.\nIt is convenient, I think, to put the question I am now considering in this form:\u2014Could the Parliament of Canada have validly passed, as part of an Act authorizing the construction of the Dominion railway, an enactment having the identical scope, purpose and effect of this order in so far as it levies a part of the cost of constructing these bridges upon the Electric Company?\nThe only ground upon which such legislation could be sustained would be that it was legislation in execution of the Dominion powers in relation to a Dominion railway.\nI think such legislation would not be legislation relating to the Dominion railway, but legislation relating to the Electric Company and its rights in the matter of running its cars on the streets of the municipality.\nLooking at the matter broadly, the order seems in relation to each of these highways to be an order requiring the Electric Company to contribute to the cost of the construction of a bridge as part of a municipal highway and the justification of the order appears from the judgment of the Assistant Chief Commissioner to be that when the bridge is constructed the Electric Company will have the right to use it and that the construction of the bridge will enable that company to work its railway more efficiently, more economically and with increased security against injuries to its passengers through accident. An order which on such grounds requires the Electric Company to contribute to the cost of constructing or improving a highway of the municipality, if and when the municipality decides to construct or improve it, seems to be an order in substance and in truth dealing with the Electric Company in its relations with the municipality; and none the less so that in order to construct the work the leave of the Dominion must be obtained because of the fact that the highway crosses a Dominion railway. In so far as the order authorizes the highway to cross the railway it is, of course, a proper exercise of authority in relation to the Dominion railway; so also in so far as it casts upon the Dominion Company a part of the cost of works made necessary by the fact that its railway is there and in so far also as it requires the approval of the bridge by the engineer of the Commission. But the direction that the Electric Company shall pay for the advantages it will gain from this change by reason of the fact that it has under the law the right to use the highway in its altered condition is a direction which deals with a different subject-matter altogether. Indeed, it may be noted that even if the order were an order directing the construction of these bridges as a measure of public safety, the matter of the terms on which the local railway is to be entitled to use them would just as clearly be a matter exclusively of local interest outside the purview of the Dominion power relating to railways.\nThe argument in support of the Dominion jurisdiction is that the power to pass such legislation is necessarily incidental to the power to make laws in relation to all matter comprised within the subject-matter \u2014 Dominion railways.\nThis proposition is said to be established by certain decisions of the Privy Council and of this court. These decisions I shall consider in detail and at present it is sufficient to say that there is no decision involving the question of the extent or the existence of any power in the Dominion (as incidental to its control of Dominion railways) to assess against a provincial railway company the cost of works made necessary by the construction of a Dominion railway across a municipal highway and there is no decision upon the question whether the Dominion has power to assess the cost of works constructed by a municipality against a provincial railway company benefited by such works merely because such works are so situated with reference to a Dominion railway that the municipality must get the leave of Dominion for executing them.\nThe provisions of the B.N.A. Act with which we are immediately concerned are sections 91(29) and, 92(10).\nBy these provisions local railways wholly within the limits of a single province and not declared to be for the general advantage of Canada come within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the province. That does not mean, of course, that such railways in respect of matters which are not properly comprehended within the subject-matter of railways, but which really fall within Dominion jurisdiction under some other head of section 91 are exempt from the authority of the Parliament of Canada. If a provincial railway company is about to make a negotiable instrument or to deal with a bank, it must do so subject to the Dominion law relating to negotiable instruments and banking. Such railways as railways, however (in respect, that is to say, of all matters that are subject-matter of \u201crailway legislation strictly so called\u201d), so long as the Dominion does not assume jurisdiction in the manner provided for by the Act, are primarily under the exclusive jurisdiction of the local legislatures. The works and undertakings dealt with by these sections are as Lord Atkinson explains in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[34], \u201cphysical things, not services\u201d; and they are things of a special character. Railways, telegraph lines and like works from the practical point of view must for some purposes be regarded as entireties, and the law recognizes that by treating them so in many instances. The \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d seems to treat them so in these provisions as subjects of legislative jurisdiction. The framers of the Act recognized that the national interest might require the taking over of local works by the Dominion and the Act provides for that, but the Dominion, when it assumes jurisdiction, must assume jurisdiction of the work or undertaking as a whole. Primarily then the effect of the provisions of the Act with regard to a railway which is local in the sense mentioned is that, in its character of railway, it is \u201cas an integer,\u201d to use Lord Watson\u2019s phrase in Redfield v. Corporation of Wickham[35], under the exclusive control of the province until the Dominion assumes jurisdiction in the manner provided for. After that it passes in the same character under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion.\nIn Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonseconrs[36], speaking of the extent of the control over Dominion railways committed to Dominion by these provisions, at page 372 Lord Watson says:\nAccordingly, the Parliament of Canada has, in the opinion of their Lordships, exclusive right to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair, and alteration of the railway, and for its management, and to dictate the constitution and powers of the company; * * *. It was obviously in the contemplation of the Act of 1867 that the \u201crailway legislation,\u201d strictly so called, applicable to those lines which were placed under its charge should belong to the Dominion Parliament.\nIt cannot, I think, he doubted that, primarily, the jurisdiction committed to the province by these provisions in regard to local railways is as extensive as the jurisdiction thus described. And the considerations I have already referred to appear to me to be quite sufficient to shew that the order in its application to the Electric Company is an order in relation to a matter falling strictly within the subject of \u201clocal works and undertakings\u201d assigned to the province by section 92 (10).\nIt cannot, therefore, be and is not contended that the order appealed from in so far as it professes to levy a contribution upon the Electric Company is\nlegislation falling strictly within any of the classes specially enumerated in section 91\nin the sense in which those words are used by Lord Herschell in the Fisheries Case[37], at page 715.\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to observe in passing that the order obviously cannot be sustained as made in exercise of the Dominion power of taxation.\nIt is contended, however, and this is, no doubt, the ground upon which this order must be sustained, if it can be sustained at all, that there is vested in the Dominion Parliament in addition to its authority to enact railway legislation strictly so called in relation to the subject of Dominion railways a power to pass laws which though not legislation of that character would be suitable ancillary provisions to a Dominion railway law; and it is further contended that such ancillary legislation may be legislation relating to a provincial railway and of such a character that from a provincial point of view it would properly be described as \u201crailway legislation strictly so called.\u201d I do not think it is necessary for the purpose of this appeal to pass upon the question whether such legislation is competent to the Dominion, without a formal assumption by the Dominion of exclusive jurisdiction over the provincial railway in the manner provided for by the Act. There is no doubt something to be said for the opposite view.\nWhere by reason of the relative physical situation of a Dominion railway and a provincial railway or other circumstances legislation strictly relating to the Dominion railway in its operation necessarily and incidentally affects a provincial railway it may be assumed that the Dominion legislation would be unobjectionable from the constitutional point of view. But once you pass beyond that and admit there is (in the absence of an assumption of complete jurisdiction) vested in the Dominion authority to pass legislation which relates to a provincial railway as such or to a provincial railway company as railway company, and which, admittedly is not legislation relating strictly to a Dominion railway you are obviously in difficulties in assigning limits to the jurisdiction.\nIf the proposed action of the Dominion respecting the provincial line appears to the provincial legislature or the provincial body charged generally with administrative responsibility in relation to the provincial line in the holiest exercise of its judgment to be so impracticable in a business sense or so incompatible with the objects of the undertaking that it ought not to be agreed to, it does not seem wholly extravagant to say that from the provincial point of view it would be unreasonable to force the proposal upon the province against its will; in other words, that from the provincial point of view on any such question of reasonableness the province is the final judge. Then, if the necessities of the case from the Dominion point of view require that the Dominion view shall prevail against the provincial, the question may be asked:\u2014Have we not reached the stage at which the Act contemplates the assumption by the Dominion of complete jurisdiction?\nThe other alternatives are that the Dominion is in all cases the final judge of the necessity of its own intervention\u2014an alternative which, I think, is negatived by the decision of the Privy Council in the City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[38]; or that when such a conflict arises it rests with the courts in each case to determine whether the particular enactment in so far as it relates to the provincial railway or the provincial railway company is one that is so essential to the effective exercise of Dominion legislative authority relating to Dominion railways (under the provisions quoted above) that power to pass it must be taken to have been conferred by the grant of that authority. I assume for the purpose of deciding the question before us that in some degree some such power is comprehended within that authority; limited by the necessity above indicated of the existence of which, when it is disputed, the courts must in the last resort be the judges.\nIn this view then in every case in which a conflict does arise the point for determination must be whether there exists such a necessity for the power to pass the particular enactment in question as essential to the effective exercise of the Dominion authority as to justify the inference that the power has been conferred. The City of Montreal v. The Montreal Street Railway Co.38, at pages 342-345. I do not think the order before us satisfies this test.\nIn applying this test one should not lose sight of the fact that there is no case in which a Dominion enactment professing to control a provincial railway or a provincial railway company as such has been sustained as a valid exercise of the ancillary power now contended for. There is only one case in which such an enactment has been considered and in that case (City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[39]) the Dominion legislation was held to be ultra vires.\nIt may further be observed that\u2014if we except cases dealing with matters that have been considered to fall prima facie within item 13 of section 92, (\u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d) or item 16 of section 92, (matters mere local or private within the province)\u2014I do not think there is any case in which it has been held that legislation by the Dominion (which was admittedly in relation to a matter not falling strictly within the enumerated subjects of section 91 and which at the same time admittedly related to a matter falling within one of the enumerated subjects of section 92) was legislation which could validly be enacted as ancillary to the exercise of the powers conferred by section 91. It has, of course, been pointed out frequently that you cannot proceed a step in such matters as bankruptcy and banking without directly altering the general law relating to property and civil rights; and matters which from a provincial point of view are \u201cmerely local and private\u201d may, from the Dominion point of view, cease to be so and assume Dominion importance by reason of their relation to matters which have become subjects of legislation under section 91. On the other hand, in the argument on the Fisheries Case[40], Lord Watson said:\u2014\nIf you except the liquor question, and I do not wish to re-open discussion about that with regard to the cases at the present moment, because some parts of them are not entirely satisfactory to my own mind, and I have a difficulty in reconciling them; but, apart from that, there is no warrant for saying that both may act effectively, except in this case there is one exception, the general law of the province relating to property and civil rights is subject-matter of legislation by the provincial legislature; and that general law, applicable to property and civil rights, governs a great many cases in which by section 91 exclusive power is given to the Dominion Government; but until that legislation is enacted the general law rules. Bankruptcy is an illustration.\nI am not quoting this observation of Lord Watson\u2019s (made arguendo) as an authority on the construction of section 91. I quote it merely as a statement of fact shewing the state of the decisions in 1898, the year in which the observation was made.\nI wish to emphasize the fact that up to the present time the only cases in which the courts have sustained the attempt on the part of the Dominion to exercise an ancillary overriding power have been cases in which the legislation regarded from the provincial point of view would be considered to be legislation dealing with a subject-matter falling within the classes of subjects included in No. 13 or No. 16 of section 92; and to suggest that when it is proposed to exercise such a paramount subsidiary power in relation to matters clearly falling within other classes specifically mentioned in that section great care ought to be observed in order to ascertain whether the Dominion has really been invested with the authority it claims to possess.\nI venture to think with great respect that the point of view from which those two sections ought to be regarded is indicated in the following passage in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons[41], pp. 108 and 109:\u2014\nIt is obvious that in some cases where this apparent conflict exists, the legislature could not have intended that the powers exclusively assigned to the provincial legislature should be absorbed in those given to the Dominion Parliament. Take as one instance the subject \u201cmarriage and divorce,\u201d contained in the enumeration of subjects in section 91; it is evident that solemnization of marriage would come within this general description; yet \u201csolemnization of marriage in the province\u201d is enumerated among the classes of subjects in section 92, and no one can doubt, notwithstanding the general language of section 91, that this subject is still within the exclusive authority of the legislatures of the provinces. So \u201cthe raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\u201d is enumerated among the classes of subjects in section 91; but, though the description is sufficiently large and general to include \u201cdirect taxation within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes,\u201d assigned to the provincial legislatures by section 92, it obviously could not have been intended that, in this instance also, the general power should override the particular one. With regard to certain classes of subjects, therefore, generally described in section 91, legislative power may reside as to some matters falling within the general description of these subjects in the legislatures of the provinces. In these cases it is the duty of the courts, however difficult it may be, to ascertain in what degree, and to what extent, authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each legislature, and to define in the particular case before them the limits of their respective powers. It could not have been the intention that a conflict should exist; and, in order to prevent such a result, the two sections must be read together, and the language of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified, by that of the other. In this way it may, in most cases, be found possible to arrive at a reasonable and practicable construction of the language of the sections, so as to reconcile the respective powers they contain, and give effect to all of them. In performing this difficult duty, it will be a wise course for those on whom it is thrown, to decide each case which arises as best they can, without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nSince the decision in the Parsons Case41 the necessity of attending to the provisions of section 92 in ascertaining the limits of the enumerated powers conferred by section 91, has been illustrated in the following cases: In Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[42], it was necessary to consider the scope of the Dominion authority in relation to \u201cAliens and naturalization\u201d in its bearing upon matters falling within the first of the articles of section 92 which invests the provinces with exclusive authority over the constitution of the provincial governments \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act.\u201d In City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[43], already referred to, the Dominion authority relating to Dominion railways had to be interpreted in its bearing upon the subject of provincial railways. In the Marriage Reference Case[44], the limits of Dominion authority in relation to \u201cMarriage and Divorce\u201d, had to be considered with reference to the jurisdiction conferred upon the provinces in relation to \u201cThe solemnization of Marriage.\u201d In Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[45], Lord Watson pointed out that the exclusive character of the Dominion authority over a Dominion railway, qua railway, does not exclude the power of the province to subject that part of it lying within the boundaries of the province to provincial taxation.\nIn the matter of railways the Imperial Legislature while conferring exclusive jurisdiction upon the Dominion in respect of certain classes of railways has, in the same breath, so to speak, declared that exclusive jurisdiction with respect to local railways is vested in the province. It seems to be pre-eminently a case (especially in view of the power conferred upon the Dominion by pursuing the course prescribed by the Act to assume complete jurisdiction over local works and undertakings) in which for interpreting and definning the scope of the Dominion authority reference should be had to the terms in which authority in respect of railways is conferred upon the province.\nAssuming, therefore, that there may be circumstances in which the Dominion possesses an overriding ancillary jurisdiction to legislate for a provincial railway as such, it is necessary \u2014 in determining the scope of the ancillary power and whether in any particular instance the circumstances have arisen which justify the exercise of it, \u2014 to decide that question in light of the facts that plenary legislative jurisdiction respecting the provincial railway has been specifically conferred upon the province; and that from the provincial point of view it is the province which was intended to be the final judge as to the desirability of any proposed legislation relating to the provincial railway.\nIt is to be noted that unity of control in respect of the management of the provincial railway and the constitution and powers of the company qu\u00e2 railway company is not less important than unity of control in respect of the construction, alteration and repair of the railway itself. In the case of a street railway, for example, such matters as the control of rates, the compensation by way of division of receipts or otherwise to be paid by the company to the municipality or the province for the enjoyment of its privileges; the mutual rights and obligations of the company and the municipality in respect of the use, construction, maintenance and repair of highways and the incidence as between the company and the municipality of the cost of works required for the protection of the public; all these matters one would expect to find assigned as subjects of legislative jurisdiction to the same legislative authority. See City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[46], at pages 57 and 59.\nIn considering whether the order under appeal can be sustained as made in exercise of some ancillary power vested in the Dominion I wish to emphasize these features of the particular question before us. 1st. It seems to me to be quite clear that the Dominion would have no power to compel the municipality to do the specific things authorized by this order.\nThe Dominion authority might (what has not been done in this instance) determine that considerations of public safety arising out of the presence of the Dominion railway required that after a given date the highways in question and the Dominion railway should no longer cross each other by level crossings. The Dominion authority might also determine that in the event of the highways being carried over the railway by viaducts a stated portion of the cost should be borne by the Dominion company. But the question whether on the one hand the municipality should undertake the works necessary to carry the highway over the railway under the conditions laid down by the Dominion authority or whether in the alternative the highways should be closed would be a purely local question the determination of which is committed absolutely to the provincial authorities, that is to say, to the provincial legislature in the last resort, and it is impossible to see on what ground it can be pretended that the Dominion could be concerned in such a question as a matter affecting its control of Dominion railways. Assume, for example, that the ratepayers of Vancouver had refused to give the sanction of their approval to the scheme proposed by the Municipal Council. While the Dominion might stop the highway traffic over the Dominion railway until appropriate arrangements should be made I do not suppose it would be contended that it could force the municipality, against the express provisions of the provincial law governing the municipality as such, to construct the bridges in question. If in the local interest it were necessary that the bridges should be constructed then it is entirely in the hands of the provincial legislature in the last resort to compel the muncipality to act. So with regard to the Electric Company. The provincial authorities (in the last resort the provincial legislature) have full power to compel the Electric Company to act reasonably in relation to all interests concerned.\n2nd. No Dominion interest is concerned in the provision of the order to which exception is taken.\nI do not repeat what I have already said upon the point that the subject-matter the Board is dealing with in the order against the Electric Company is the subject of the reciprocal rights and obligations of the municipality and the Electric Company in respect of the use of the municipal highways. In respect of the construction of these bridges, the separation of grades having been decided upon, the only matters of Dominion concern from the point of view of the Dominion in exercising control of Dominion railways are these;\u2014the convenience of the bridge in relation to the working of the railway; the sufficiency of the bridge for the support of the highway traffic which may concern the safety of the public in relation to the railway as well as the safety of the railway; and the proportion of the cost of construction and maintenance which ought to be contributed by the Dominion company as being an expenditure necessitated by the presence of the railway.\nThese matters being disposed of what Dominion interest remains to be provided for? In determining the proportion of cost to be assessed against the Dominion Company the Dominion authority may, of course, properly consider the fact that the bridges are to be used by a provincial railway in pursuit of a presumably profitable business; but that proportion being fixed how can the exercise of authority over Dominion railways be affected by the distribution of cost as between the municipality and the Electric Company? What necessity can there be for interposition in such matters by the Dominion railway authority?\nOne more relevant consideration appears to be as indicated in the judgment in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[47], that the matter of the reciprocal rights and obligations of the Electric Company and the municipality is essentially a local and not a Dominion matter. The equities as between these local bodies in respect of the Incidence of the cost of these viaducts cannot be fairly appraised without regard to their mutual obligations in respect of other matters; their relations must in any adequate view of them for the purpose of adjusting such equities be looked at as a whole. It is the local legislature or the appropriate local administrative body, which can best deal with these relations in their entirety. It must be observed that the power contended for is a paramount power and if this order is valid there could be no constitutional objection to a like order in face of express legislative\u201d enactment by the province to the contrary. I conclude that, if the point were to be determined on principle, apart from decided cases, the possession by the Dominion of the authority contended for is not essential to enable the Dominion to exercise its powers in relation to Dominion railways;\nI come now to the decisions. The proposition said to be established by them is this:\u2014ancillary authority is committed to the Dominion in relation to Dominion railways to adjust the burden of the cost of any work authorized or required by the Dominion railway authority in connection with the construction or operation of a Dominion railway among the persons, companies, and municipalities \u201cinterested in\u201d or \u201caffected by\u201d such work. That is the formula which is said to be deducible from the decided cases. The formula leaves something to be desired in point of precision. Nobody disputes, of course, that there must be some limit upon this power which is ascribed to the Dominion as incidental to its authority respecting railways. The expressions \u201cinterested in\u201d and \u201caffected by\u201d seem altogether too vague to furnish a reliable test for determining that limit. Then who is to decide the question whether a given person or company is \u201cinterested in\u201d or \u201caffected by\u201d a given work? The suggestion appears to be that the question is to be determined finally as a question of fact by the Dominion railway authority. But in the absence of some governing principle by which the railway authority is to be guided it seems that in this view the whole matter is left at large and that the formula is worthless. The limit of the overriding jurisdiction of the Dominion in respect of a provincial railway as such cannot finally depend upon the view of a Dominion railway authority as to what in the particular circumstances is reasonable or equitable. When the cases relied upon are examined it seems to be perfectly plain that no such principle, if principle it can be called, is established by them. The three cases cited are: City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[48]; The Carleton County Case[49], and the City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[50]. The first observation to be made upon these cases is that in none of them did any question arise as to the existence or the limits of an Overriding jurisdiction in the Dominion in respect of provincial railways. In none of them was a provincial railway company concerned. There are some observations in the judgments delivered in the first and second cases (which were decisions of this court) of a very general character; but those observations in so far as they are material must he taken to have been superseded by the judgment of Lord Atkinson speaking on behalf of the Privy Council in the City of Montreal v. The Montreal Street Railway Co.[51]. The decision of the City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.50 was a decision of the Privy Council. The dispute was a dispute between the municipality of Toronto and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. The municipality had applied to the Railway Committee of the Privy Council for an order requiring the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to erect gates and keep a watchman at a place where the railway crossed one of the municipal streets, and as a measure of public safety the order was made; part of the cost of maintenance being assessed upon the municipality. After paying the contribution as directed for several years, the municipality disputed the authority of the Railway Committee in respect of that part of the order. Before the Privy Council the order was impeached as an interference with the matter of civil rights in the province, and it was sustained.\nWith regard to this decision it may be observed: 1st. That the application to the Railway Committee was made by the municipality. As having control of highways the municipality would be certainly acting within its powers in requesting the Railway Committee to take action to compel the railway company to provide for the protection of the public and in submitting itself to such conditions as those imposed upon it in that case.\n2ndly. It is one thing to say (where a highway crosses a railway or a railway crosses a highway by a level crossing), that it is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion as ancillary to its authority to make laws in relation to the railway to prescribe regulations with regard to the use of that part of the highway which is traversed by the railway with the object of securing the common safety of the public and the railway, or to require the municipality, consistently with the law governing the powers of the municipality, to concur with the railway company in taking measures for such common safety so long as the highway is used by the public; it is another thing to say that the grade of the highway being separated from the grade of the railway, the highway being carried over the railway, and all proper measures having been taken to secure the sufficiency of the highway, to support the highway traffic \u2014 it is another thing to say that in such circumstances it is within the province of the Dominion to regulate the traffic on the highway or to prescribe conditions (not aimed at the security of the public in relation to the railway or of the railway as affected by the presence of the highway), under which any particular kind of traffic shall be allowed to pass over it.\nI cannot escape the conclusion that once the highway has been carried across the railway by means of overhead bridges and all conditions have been observed which the Dominion in the exercise of its discretion requires to be observed for securing the safety and efficiency of railway operation as it is or may be affected by the bridges and the safety of the public in using the highway as affected by the presence of the Dominion railway, then the matter of the regulation of highway traffic and of the terms as to tolls or otherwise upon which any particular class of traffic is permitted is purely a matter of local concern.\nAs to the position of the Electric Company I will only add to what I have already said, a reference to the fact that the agreement between the municipality and that company which, as I have already mentioned, both parties were empowered to enter into by an Act of the British Columbia Legislature, declares the terms and conditions upon which the Electric Company is entitled to use the municipal streets and the reciprocal obligations of the municipality and the company respecting the grading, repair and maintenance of those streets. There is also, as may be observed, a provision according to which the municipality shares in the gross receipts of the company. Their Lordships in the Privy Council, in passing Upon City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[52], had not before them any question touching the power of the Dominion with regard to a matter of a nature so purely local as the rights of the electric company and the municipality inter se respecting the use of the municipal streets. Their Lordships treated the question before them as a question of how far, the ancillary powers of the Dominion in relation to railways might extend to matters which prima facie would fall within the heading \u201cproperty and civil rights within the province.\u201d I think their Lordships\u2019 decision ought not to be treated as furnishing any principle governing the question which arises here.\nIn applying their Lordships\u2019 judgment to the determination of such a question it ought to be interpreted in the light of the subsequent judgment in the City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[53] and for the reasons already given upon the principles established by that judgment I do not think the order can be sustained.\nThere is another ground upon which the appeal ought, in my judgment, to succeed. Section 6 of the Act of 19.09 is as follows:\u2014\n6. The said Act is amended by inserting the following section immediately after section 238 thereof:\u2014\n238a. In any case where a railway is constructed after the passing of this Act, the company shall; at its own cost and expense (unless and except as otherwise provided by agreement, approved of by the Board, between the company and a municipal or other corporation or person), provide, subject to the order of the Board, all protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of any crossing of a highway by the railway.\nI have mentioned that the order in question was really made pursuant to leave given on the application of the Dominion railway, company to cross the highway with its two, industrial tracks in, 1910. The enactment above quoted seems, therefore, to apply to the tracks laid down in 1910. On the evidence it is doubtful whether the line built in 1909 was laid down before or after the passing of the Act of that year.\nI cannot read section 6 as having no application to tracks such as those constructed in 1910. Each of these tracks was literally a \u201crailway\u201d; and the term \u201crailway,\u201d as defined by the interpretation section, includes such tracks. I think the enactment referred to applies to every \u201crailway\u201d in the broadest sense constructed across a highway after the passing of the Act.\nThe Board\u2019 had, therefore, no power to assess against the municipality or the Electric Company any part of the cost of works made necessary in consequence of the construction of the tracks of 1910; and since it is obvious the Electric Company and the municipality are (as they were intended by the Board to be) both charged by the order with part of the expenditure necessitated by the presence of these tracks, which included by the express terms of the order the cost of depressing the tracks, I think the order cannot be sustained.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant contests the validity of an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners on the grounds that (a) the \u201cRailway Act\u201d does not purport to authorize it; and (b), if it does, Federal legislation authorizing the making of such an order against the appellant, a provincial railway company, is ultra vires.\nOn the latter point the case is, I think, concluded against the appellant by such authorities as the City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[54]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[55]; City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[56]; County of Carleton v. City of Ottawa[57], and Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and The County of York[58], at page 72.\nOn the former point I think it clear, apart from any difficulty presented by section 238a, enacted in 1909, that Parliament intended by sections 8(a), 59 and 237 and 238 (as amended by 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32) of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37) to confer jurisdiction on the Railway Board to determine who are \u201cinterested persons\u201d and shall contribute as such to the cost of crossing-works and to distribute amongst them the burden of such cost.\nWhen before the Board, the present appellant did not invoke or direct attention to section 238a, and the hearing would appear to have proceeded on the assumption that that provision did not apply. Nor was leave to appeal to this court granted in respect of any point which arises under it.\nAlthough it would seem that two side-lines of the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway, crossed by one or both of the bridges in question, were constructed after the enactment of section 238a, there is no evidence that the main line of that railway was not built before section 238a was enacted. There are statements in the record which indicate that it was; and, nothing appearing to the contrary, this appeal should, I think, be dealt with on that assumption.\nThe crossing of the highway by the main line of the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway prior to the enactment of section 238a would give the Board jurisdiction to order the appellant company to bear a portion of the cost of the crossing-works\u2019, and there is nothing to warrant an inference that the protection of a bridge-crossing was not rendered necessary by, and ordered on account of, the traffic on the main line of the, railway. Neither is, there anything to shew that the amount which the appellant will he required to pay is any greater by reason of the existence of the two sidelines subsequently, built (if, indeed, such an increase would warrant interference with the order on jurisdictional grounds); and I know of no reason why anything should be assumed in favour of the appellant which might adversely affect the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.

VII., c. 27. The Alberta statute of 1906, 6 Edw. VII., eh. 27, provides that no action shall lie to recover any commission for services in connection with the sale of land except upon a contract therefor in writing signed by the person sought to be charged or by his agent thereunto authorized in writing. C. by duly signed memorandum authorized H. to sell a section and a half of land, containing 960 acres, at the named price of $35 per acre, and to pay him a commission on the sale at the rate of 5%. In attempting to make a sale H. introduced T. to C. and, after they three had inspected the land together, T. made an offer to C. to purchase the section alone at $40 per acre provided certain other property should be taken in exchange as part payment. This proposition was accepted by C. and he sold the section alone to T. on those terms.\nHeld, that the sale effected was an entirely new contract which was in no manner referable to the written agreement respecting commission on a sale for a price in money and, as there had been no written contract respecting remuneration to the broker in respect of the transaction which took place he could not recover compensation for the services rendered by him either by way of commission or as quantum meruit.\nThe judgment appealed from (9 D.L.R. 381; 3 West. W.R. 923) was reversed, Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The broker should be held strictly to the terms of the written agreement which was drafted by himself; it did not constitute a general authority to sell the lands therein described; he could not, therefore, recover remuneration for his services by way of commission as therein provided. Nevertheless, as such use was made of the introduction of the purchaser that the broker was prevented effecting a sale according to the terms of his agreement, the conduct of the principal in that respect entitled the agent to recover compensation by way of quantum meruit.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014The broker had, under the agreement, a general authority for the sale of the lands for which he found and introduced the purchaser: therefore, he should not be denied compensation for his services on account of the conduct of the owner in carrying out the sale on terms different from those to which he had been restricted by the agreement.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Simmons J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe case is stated in the head-note and the questions at issue on the appeal are mentioned in the judgments now reported.\nBennett K.C. for the appellant.\nHellmuth K.C. and G. H. Ross K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE. \u2014 The plaintiff alleges an agreement in writing whereby the defendant undertook to pay him five per cent. commission on the selling price of a piece of land described as section 3, and the west half of section 11, township 20, range 28, west of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta. The agreement produced gives the defendant general authority to sell the property and earn his commission; but, taken as a whole and construed with reference to the surrounding circumstances, it constitutes a limited mandate to sell a certain area of land of a defined acreage at a fixed price per acre and on terms of payment stipulated for in advance by the owner in view of his then financial necessities. Any departure from all or any of these special terms would amount to the creation of a new contract which would require to be in writing.\nThe plaintiff, fully aware of the difficulties of his position, attempted to amend the statement of claim by setting up an alternative right to compensation for introducing a buyer to the appellant \"in pursuance of the said agreement.\" It is impossible for me to understand how it can be said that the exchange on which the respondent seeks to recover his commission can be construed to have been made \"in pursuance of the agreement\" or can in any way be referable thereto. After Twohey, the intending purchaser, visited the ranch with the plaintiff, Herron, and decided not to buy it, he made a direct offer to Como, the defendant, to acquire in exchange for another property a portion of the farm at a valuation per acre different from that stated in the listing contract. That offer for an object and consideration different from those covered by the contract declared upon was accepted by the defendant the next day in the absence of the plaintiff. Here is the way the respondent in his evidence describes what happened.\nQ. Now, after going over the ranch that day, what did you do?\nA. Mr. Twohey asked Mr. Como if he would sell the section without the half section and Mr. Como said, \"Yes.\" Mr. Twohey said: \"What price would you put on the section itself ?\" and Mr. Como replied: \"$40 an acre.\"\nQ. After you had this discussion you returned to Calgary ?\nA. Yes, and Mr. Como said he' Would come to Calgary on the following Monday morning.\nQ. And did he come to Calgary on the following Monday morning ?\nA. Yes, he did.\nQ. Did you see him ?\nA. He came to my house and I hitched up my rig and shewed him Mr. Wright's property and Mr. Twohey's property.\nQ. What property ?\nA. Mr. Wright's property that I had been talking to him about before, and Mr. Twohey's property in Mount Royal.\nQ. Well, then, what did you do next ?\nA. He looked through the house and seemed quite pleased with it. Mrs. Twohey took him through every room up stairs and downstairs and down to the basement and everywhere. Then he came back and Mr. Twohey and myself and him talked about the deal and the deal was finally closed up on the 28th of May.\nQ. How do you know that ?\nA. It was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon I was called out to my ranch here on the telephone and had a sick mare and I got a veterinary surgeon and went out. Then, as soon as I came back, I suppose about four o'clock in the afternoon, I met Mr. Twohey and he told me.\nQ. Did you see Mr. Como at all ?\nA. Yes, that evening.\nQ. Did you have any conversation with him ?\nA. They both told me they had closed the deal.\nThis is entirely a new contract, as I have said before, which is not in any way referable to the one declared upon and cannot be enforced unless 'evidenced by a document in writing, and there is no such evidence forthcoming. See section 1, chapter 27, Statutes of Alberta, 1906.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014The Legislature of Alberta in 1906, enacted as follows:\u2014\n1. No action shall be brought whereby to charge any person either by commission or otherwise, for services rendered in connection with the sale of any land, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest therein unless the contract upon which recovery is sought in such action or some note or memorandum thereof is in writing signed by the party sought to be charged or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorized in writing.\nThe appellant signed a contract with respondent pursuant thereto of which the material part is as follows:\u2014\nIn the event of your selling the property described on the opposite side of this card, I agree to pay W. S. Herron a commission of 5%, and in consideration of your advertising and pushing same, I agree to list exclusively with you for a period of a month.\nThe land described consisted of a 'section and a half.\nThe appellant exchanged one section thereof with a third person (who was, I assume, introduced by respondent) for some equity in land in Calgary. Half a section remained undisposed of.\nI cannot conceive how, in face of the statute, the respondent can found, on such facts, an action on this contract for commission only accruing to him, as the express terms of the contract specify, on a sale of the whole land.\nThe statute substantially adopts the language used in the Statute of Frauds, which it has been held time and again as the authorities collected in Leake on Contracts (4 ed.), pages 565 to 567 shew, do not permit any verbal variation or waiver of terms the Act requires to be in writing, as foundation for an action at law thereupon.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs. DUFF J. (dissenting) \u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. My view of the case will be best understood after a statement of the material facts. The appellant was the owner of two parcels of land (a section and an adjoining half-section) near Calgary which he desired to sell; and in May, 1912, he employed the respondent as agent to dispose of this property and signed what is called a listing agreement in the following terms:\u2014\nIn the event of your selling the property described on the opposite side of this card, I agree to pay W. S. Herron a commission of 5%, and in consideration of your advertising and pushing same, I agree to list exclusively with you for a period of a month.\nSignature of owner: Capt. G. Como.\nAddress: High River.\nOn the back of this document there appeared a description of both the section and half-section in question and certain terms of sale. Shortly after this document was signed the respondent introduced to the appellant, a Mr. Twohey, who was the owner of some property in Calgary which he desired to exchange for farm property. Twohey in company with the respondent visited the appellant's property, where the appellant resided, and inspected it. Finding that the quality of the soil of the half-section was not to his liking he asked the appellant if he was ready to sell the section alone, and the appellant immediately informed him that he would sell it at the price of $40 an acre.\nAfter some further negotiations an agreement was entered into between the appellant and Twohey by which Twohey's property was to be exchanged for the appellant's, the former being valued at the price of $15,000 and appellant being allowed for his property $40 an acre. The effect of this transaction was that it became practically impossible to sell the half-section. That was admitted by the appellant at the trial; was, indeed, put forward by him as one of the grounds on which he justified his refusal to pay the respondent his commission. In his statement of claim the respondent demanded commission under the listing agreement at the rate of 5% upon a purchase price for the section exchanged calculated at $40 an acre. At the trial an application was made upon notice for leave to amend the statement of claim by adding a statement of the facts already referred to, an allegation that the appellant had accepted the plaintiff's services and a claim to be remunerated for services as upon a quantum meruit. The application to amend was opposed on the ground that chapter 27 of the Alberta statutes of 1906 was a bar to any claim based upon the allegation in the amendment and the appellant offered, in the alternative, an amendment of his defence, in the event of the respondent's amendment being allowed, by which, among other things, he denied that he had accepted the respondent's services. The learned trial judge reserved his decision upon the application until, as he said, he should \"see what the evidence disclosed.\" There was a good deal of discussion during the course of the trial touching the admissibility of evidence under the claim of quantum meruit, but the learned judge appears to have admitted the evidence as if the amendment had been made. We were informed on the hearing of the appeal that eventually the learned trial judge refused to allow the amendment, presumably on the ground taken by the appellant that the Alberta statute above referred to would be a bar to a recovery on the basis of the allegations the respondent proposed to add to his claim. The learned trial judge held the respondent entitled to recovery on the ground that the employment under the 'listing (agreement above mentioned was a \"general employment\" in the sense in which Lord Watson used that phrase in Toulmin v. Millar[2]; in other words, that the agreement on its true construction provides for the payment of commission to the respondent upon any sale or other disposition of any part of the lands referred to, to a person introduced by the respondent. On the whole I am inclined to think that this construction of the agreement cannot be maintained. It is not the most natural reading of it; and one must not leave out of consideration the fact that the agreement was drawn up by an agent whose business was that of land-selling, and who was accustomed to framing and entering into such contracts, I think that in the circumstances, the agent must be held to the strictis-simum jus so far as concerns the construction of the words employed by him.\nBut there is another ground upon which I think the respondent was entitled to recover. There can be no question that when an owner has entered into a contract of this description (in which the agent has contracted expressly to use his best efforts for the sale of the property in consideration of receiving a commission upon introducing the purchaser) the owner undertakes an obligation not to interfere with and frustrate the agent's efforts. If the agent introduces a purchaser who is prepared to enter into negotiations for the purchase of the property, the owner would be acting in contravention of the obligations of his contract if he were to take advantage of the agent's ser- vices to enter into some arrangement with the person introduced, whereby it should become impossible for the agent to earn his commission under the terms of his contract of employment. In this ease the owner did take advantage of the agent's services by entering into a contract with the person introduced, the result of which was that the term of the contract requiring the sale of the whole property as a condition of the respondent's right to commission became impossible of performance \u2014 impossible, that is to say, in a business sense because impracticable. Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Co.[3]: The principle applies which was laid down by Willes J., in Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee, etc, Co.[4], and quoted with approval by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Bnrchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[5], at page 626:\u2014\nI apprehend that wherever money is to be paid by one man to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay is liable to the party who is to receive the money if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that he should receive it.\nIn such a case the agent is clearly entitled to recover compensation for his services. The only point to be considered in this connection is whether there is anything in the Alberta statute already referred to barring such recovery. It seems to me to be clear that there is not. The foundation of the agent's right to recover in such a case is the contract of employment. The principal's conduct preventing a performance of the condition prescribed by the contract has the effect in law of precluding him from insisting upon the performance of that condition, and entitles the agent to recover compensation for his services as services rendered at the request of the principal; the request being evidenced by the written contract of employment. See precedent, Bullen & Leake, \"Precedents of Pleadings\" (6 ed.), page 328. The only objection to this view that I can think of is that the arrangement with Twohey was assented to by the respondent and consequently the appellant's conduct in entering into it cannot be said to have been wrongful as against him. The answer to that is this: Prima facie the principal's conduct gives the agent a right to recover against him remuneration for his services. If the principal relies upon the conduct of the agent as an assent justifying his own conduct, then since this assent is to be implied from the conduct of the parties, he must accept all the implications to which this conduct gives rise. It would be ridiculous to suggest that the agent by his conduct must be taken to have assented to the appellant entering into the arrangement with Twohey except upon the terms that he should be paid for his services in introducing Twohey. Then the appellant cannot blow hot and cold, and he cannot be permitted to take advantage of the respondent's implied assent as an answer to the respondent's action without observing the conditions also implied. The appellant cannot, therefore, set up the respondent's conduct in answer to the respondent's claim to recover for his services on a quantum meruit.\nAs to the amount the respondent is entitled to recover, I think if the appellant desires it, there should be a reference to ascertain the amount, the cost of the appeal to be paid by the appellant, the costs of the reference and further directions to be reserved.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This action is brought upon a written contract by which the defendant agreed to pay a commission of 5% for a sale for a money price, of which a substantial part should be payable in cash, of a defined property. The transaction in respect of which commission is claimed was a disposal of part only of the property mentioned in the written contract not for a money price, but in exchange for another property. It was not a performance of the terms on which, under the written contract, the commission was to be payable. In order to succeed the plaintiff must prove a substantial variation in the terms of the written contract on which he sues. He must shew the substitution of another consideration for that upon which the defendant undertook in writing to pay the commission. That is in effect setting up a new contract. But if it should be regarded as a case of variation, that variation is in a most material element and, if made, was in parol. Under the Alberta statute, 6 Edw. VII., ch. 27, an agent, in my opinion, cannot recover upon a contract so varied.\nThe action is not framed and was not tried either as an action for damages for breach of the provision in the written contract for an exclusive listing, or as an action to recover upon a quantum meruit on the basis of an implied contract to remunerate the plaintiff for his services in consideration of his relinquishing his rights, if any, under the written contract, and in my opinion if any such cause of action exists it should not now be dealt with here.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the full court of Alberta and the action should be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J. (Dissenting).\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed. The law in Alberta states that:\u2014\nNo action shall be brought whereby to charge any person either by commission or otherwise, for services rendered in connection with the sale of any land, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest therein unless the contract upon which recovery is sought in such action or some note or memorandum thereof is in writing signed by the party sought to be charged or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorized in writing.\nThat is a new provision in the law and a very wise one if we may judge by the great number of cases that come before us concerning commissions claimed by real estate agents. The contract of sale of lands could not give rise to any right of action, except when it is in writing. Now the provisions of the 'Statute are extended to cover the relations between principal and agent.\nIn this case the memorandum proves conclusively that the respondent had authority to act as agent of the appellant. The respondent began to perform his duties as such agent and found an intending purchaser. He could not by himself conclude the contract of sale, because in the instructions which he had received from his employer, some conditions of the purchase price had to be determined and agreed upon by him. But the real estate agent in this case found a purchaser whom he put in relation with his principal. The vendor and the intending purchaser carried out negotiations, and as a result a sale was made of the lot in question. Now, if the vendor has found it advisable to make a sale on conditions different from those he had mentioned to the agent, he is, all the same, responsible for the services rendered to him by his agent. The services rendered by the agent give rise to a right of action on his part. His contract of agency is established and proved and it certainly entitles him to claim for the services rendered. Lord Watson in the case of Toulmin v. Millar[6], at page 97, discusses in the following terms the effect of a contract similar to the one in this case:\u2014\nWhen a proprietor, with a view of selling his estate, goes to an agent and requests him to find a purchaser, naming at the same time the sum which he is willing to accept, that will constitute a general employment; and should the estate be eventually sold to a purchaser introduced by the agent, the latter will be entitled to his commission, although the price paid should be less than the sum named at the time the employment was given. The mention of a specific sum prevents the agent from selling for a lower price without the consent of his employer; but it is given merely as the basis of future negotiations, leaving the actual price to be settled in the course of these negotiations.\nFor these reasons I would be of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 9 D.L.R. 381; 3 West.

In doing so he fell into the hold, his body struck his foreman (who was there in the discharge of his duties) and caused injuries which resulted in the death of the foreman. There was evidence to shew that the rules, which required labourers to use the companion-way, instead of the hatchway by which the labourer had attempted to descend had been habitually disregarded. The jury found that the defendants were at fault \u201cin not having taken the necessary precautions to enforce their rules,\u201d judgment went for the plaintiff, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review.\nHeld, that there was evidence to support the finding of the jury and, consequently, their verdict should not be disturbed on appeal.\nQu\u00e6re, per Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014Whether or not the course of judicial decisions in the Province of Quebec has adopted the principle that, in a case like the present, an employer is subject to liability derived from the law alone, and departed from the rule of the Roman Civil Law that there is no liability without fault.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014The exception, in article 1054 C.C., relieving parents, tutors, curators, schoolmasters and artisans from liability, in cases where it is established that they could not prevent the act which caused injury, does not apply to employers. APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Archibald in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal by which, upon the findings of the jury, judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff, personally and as tutrix to her minor children, for the sum of $5,000 with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are shortly stated in the head-note and the questions raised on the appeal are mentioned in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Aylmer for the appellants.\nPariseault and Rh\u00e9aume for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action brought by the widow and minor children of the late Cyrille Fournier to recover damages caused by his death when in the employment of the defendants on board the SS. \u201cKastala\u201d in the harbour of Montreal.\nSome objections were taken to the form of the proceedings which were, in my opinion, satisfactorily disposed of in the provincial courts. (Ruest v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[1].) They are pressed here merely as affecting costs.\nThe accident to the deceased was the result of the negligence of a fellow-servant whilst acting in contravention of the rules laid down for his guidance by the owners of the ship.\nThe main defence is that all reasonable precautions were taken by the defendants to protect their employees against the negligence complained of, and, if the instructions, which were undoubtedly given, had been followed in this instance the accident to the deceased, admittedly, could not have happened. It is also urged that the deceased was himself a person in authority, charged as such with the duty of enforcing the rules, and that his failure in that regard was the cause of the accident.\nThe reply is that, in view of the transient nature of the employment and frequent changes in the \u201cpersonnel,\u201d greater vigilance should have been exercised by the general foreman, Sullivan, and the general superintendent, Duncan, who alone had power to hire and discharge the men and to enforce the rules prohibiting the use of the means adopted by Thibert to descend from the upper to the main deck, which Avas the cause of the accident.\nIt appears on the evidence that the accident happened when Thibert was returning to his work on the main deck, and that he would not be subject to the control of the deceased until he reached that place.\nThe point raised is certainly not free from difficulty, and, were it not for the findings of the jury, the question might be before us for solution as to the extent to which the French law of Quebec has de-parted from the classic rule governing civil responsibility since the days of Rome that there is no liability without fault, to adopt the principle that the employer, in a case like this, is subject to a liability derived from the law alone.\nI would be disposed to hold, if I were trying the case, that proper rules and regulations were made by the owners of the \u201cKastala\u201d to provide for the safety of their men, and a reasonable attempt was made to enforce them, but there is evidence both ways and that issue was fairly enough put to the jury of merchants and traders who found unanimously that the necessary precautions to enforce the rules and regulations were not taken by those in authority. It was for the jury to say whether and how far the evidence was to be believed. (G\u00e9rard, Torts ou D\u00e9lits Civils, page 201). I am, therefore, to confirm, but solely and exclusively on the ground that the injury to the deceased was found by the jury, on sufficient evidence, to have been caused by the fault of Thibert who was, at the time, under the control of the legal owners of the ship, at the loading of which both the deceased and Thibert were employed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014There is evidence upon which the jury could properly reach the conclusion they did in answering the main question settled and submitted for their consideration. I see no reason for granting a new trial.\nIf there has been error or oversight in relation to some of the numerous defendants toeing in fact and law answerable for the damages, that is a mere detail which can only affect the question of costs, for it is admitted a sufficient number of those named as defendants are of such financial substance as to answer the judgment herein.\nThe question of such costs also must be comparatively unimportant for they all seem to have joined in the defences set up as if they were equally liable with others.\nBeing a mere matter of costs, we should not, if we observe precedents of this court, interfere.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Thibert, whose fall caused the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband, was, at the time, an employee of the defendants, or some of them. He had been absent from the vessel on which he was engaged for purposes of his own. When the fall happened, he was returning to his work by a route forbidden by a rule of his employers. Although on the vessel and under pay, and, therefore, under the defendants\u2019 control within the purview of the first paragraph of article 1054 of the Civil Code, he had not reached the place where the work for which he was engaged was to be done. It may toe that, at the critical moment, he would have been \u201cin the course of his employment,\u201d within, the meaning of that phrase as defined in certain authorities, but I should doubt whether he was \u201cin the performance of the work for which he was employed\u201d within the purview of the concluding paragraph of article 1054 of the Civil Code. That question, however, I find it unnecessary to determine.\nThibert\u2019s fall was caused by his own fault in using a prohibited means of descending from the upper to the main deck. The question presented for determination is whether the defendants have \u201cfailed to establish that they were unable to prevent the act which caused the damage.\u2019 (Art. 1054 C.C., para. 6.) The finding of the jury that the defendants were negligent in \u201cnot having taken the necessary precautions to enforce their rules,\u201d read in the light of the charge, in effect means that by taking proper care the defendants could have \u201cprevented the act which caused the damage\u201d viz., Thibert\u2019s attempt to descend by this dangerous route. There was evidence to warrant such a finding\u2014 evidence that the men were in the habit of using the route which Thibert took. He himself says that he descended as he was accustomed to descend. The son of the deceased, Fournier, says that there were two methods of going down, and that the men went down as Thibert did as often as by the other route. Another witness, Marrier, says that they often went down as Thibert did. Albert Gagnon, J. B. Lefebvre and George Sarrazin also say that some of the men went down by the forbidden route. This practice was or should have been known to the persons in charge on behalf of the defendants if there was proper supervision. There was evidence, therefore, to justify an inference that they had not taken effective means to check it. It follows that the finding that the defendants had failed to enforce their rules is sufficiently supported.\nThe jury negatived the responsibility of the deceased, Fournier, for Thibert\u2019s wrongful act. While I entertain some doubt as to the correctness of this finding, I am not so clearly satisfied that it is erroneous that I would feel justified in setting it aside\u2014 especially in view of its confirmation by the Court of Review.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un accident du travail qui, ayant eu lieu le 5 juin, 1907, ne tombe pas, par cons\u00e9quent, sous les dispositions de la loi de 1909, mais est r\u00e9gi enti\u00e8rement par. le code civil.\nLe verdict du jury a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu faute de la part des d\u00e9fendeurs, appelants, en ce qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre leurs r\u00e8glements \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution. Ce verdict a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par le juge instructeur et la cour de revision a unanimement confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Il n\u2019y a donc pas de difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la question de fait.\nD\u2019ailleurs, en examinant toute la preuve, je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le jury pouvait raisonnablement rendre ce verdict (art. 501 C.P.C.); et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y aurait pas lieu de ce chef d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nM. Lafleur, dans sa plaidoirie, a assimil\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre a celle du p\u00e8re et il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que si le ma\u00eetre peut prouver qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage alors il n\u2019est pas tenu de payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nL\u2019article 1054 du code civil \u00e9tablit au contraire que la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre ne peut pas \u00eatre restreinte de cette mani\u00e8re et qu\u2019elle est, par cons\u00e9quent, plus \u00e9tendue que celle du p\u00e8re.\nVoici l\u2019article:\u2014\nElle (la personne capable de discerner le bien du mal) est responsable non seulement du dommage qu\u2019elle cause par sa propre faute, mais encore de celui caus\u00e9 par la faute de ceux dont elle a le contr\u00f4le, et par les choses qu\u2019elle a sous sa garde;\nLe p\u00e8re, et apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, la m\u00e8re, sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs enfants mineurs;\nLes tuteurs sont \u00e9galement responsable pour leurs pupilles;\nLes curateurs ou autres ayant l\u00e9galement la garde des insens\u00e9s, pour le dommage caus\u00e9 par ces derniers;\nL\u2019instituteur et l\u2019artisan, pour le dommage caus\u00e9 par ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves ou apprentis, pendant qu\u2019ils sont sous sa surveillance;\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus a lieu seulement lorsque la personne qui y est assujettie ne peut prouver qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage;\nLes ma\u00eetres et les commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s?\nComme on le voit \u00e0 la lecture de cet article, les p\u00e8res, les tuteurs, les instituteurs, les curateurs, les artisans peuvent bien se lib\u00e9rer en \u00e9tablissant l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher le fait dommageable. Mais les ma\u00eetres et les commettants ne sauraient se soustraire \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de leurs domestiques ou de leurs ouvriers en se retranchant derri\u00e8re cette m\u00eame impossibilit\u00e9,\nPothier, o\u00f9 nous avons puis\u00e9 les principes de notre article 1054 sur cette mati\u00e8re a, dans son Trait\u00e9 des Obligations, au no. 121, fait la distinction entre la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre et celle des autres; et il disait:\nOn rende aussi les ma\u00eetres responsables du tort caus\u00e9 par les d\u00e9lits et les quasi-d\u00e9lits de leurs serviteurs ou ouvriers qu\u2019ils emploient \u00e0 quelque service. Ils le sont m\u00eame dans le cas auquel il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en leur pouvoir d\u2019emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit, lorsque les d\u00e9lits ou quasi-d\u00e9lits sont commis par les dits serviteurs ou ouvriers dans l\u2019exercice des fonctions auxquelles ils sont employ\u00e9s par leurs ma\u00eetres, quoiqu\u2019en l\u2019absence de leurs ma\u00eetres; ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour rendre les ma\u00eetres attentifs \u00e0 ne se servir que de bons domestiques.\nLe code Napol\u00e9on (art. 1384) d\u00e9clarait en termes assez a peu pr\u00e9cis que la responsabilit\u00e9 des p\u00e8res et m\u00e8res, des instituteurs et des artisans cesse quand ils \u201cprouvent qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui donne lieu, \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9,\u201d et il gardait le silence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ma\u00eetres et commettants.\nMalgr\u00e9 ce silence de la loi fran\u00e7aise une divergence d\u2019opinion s\u2019est \u00e9tablie entre les auteurs; les uns disant que la responsabilit\u00e9 cesse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ma\u00eetres comme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des p\u00e8res, s\u2019ils prouvent qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui y donne lieu; d\u2019autres, au contraire, disent que les ma\u00eetres ne peuvent jamais argumenter de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 ils pr\u00e9tendraient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher le dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs ouvriers dans les fonctions auxquelles ils les ont employ\u00e9s. Notre code, dans l\u2019article 1054, s\u2019est \u00e9videmment rang\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re opinion. Il ne doit donc pas y avoir de doute dans notre loi que cette exemption de responsabilit\u00e9 quant aux p\u00e8res, instituteurs et artisans ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par les ma\u00eetres.\nMais on dit dans la cause actuelle; Le ma\u00eetre n\u2019est pas responsable de l\u2019accident parce que Thibert, l\u2019ouvrier qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u201cdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\u201d auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9.\nIl est en preuve que cet ouvrier qui \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 au chargement d\u2019un navire avait profit\u00e9 d\u2019une suspension des travaux pour quelques instants afin d\u2019aller prendre quelques verres de iboisson dans un restaurant voisin. Quand il est revenu pour reprendre son ouvrage, au lieu de passer par un escalier qui communiquait d\u2019un pont \u00e0 l\u2019autre du navire, il est descendu par l\u2019\u00e9coutille et ayant perdu prise il est tomb\u00e9 sur Fournier qui \u00e9tait dans le fonds de cale. Fournier est mort des suites de cette chute de Thibert et sa femme et ses enfants poursuivent ses ma\u00eetres en dommages.\nLes dommages caus\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre non seulement dans le cas o\u00f9 ces pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutent ce qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 command\u00e9 mais aussi dans le cas o\u00fb ils ont agi par imprudence ou maladresse. On a pens\u00e9 d\u2019abord que la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre \u00e9tait la sanction du mauvais choix qu\u2019il avait fait en prerumt l\u2019auteur du dommage \u00e0 son service, mais la jurisprudence fonde la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9galement sur le fait que le ma\u00eetre doit diriger ses employ\u00e9s, leur donner des ordres et des instructions sur la mani\u00e8re de remplir leurs fonctions (Dalloz, 1887-1-225).\nAinsi, par example, une. soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu responsable d\u2019un faux commis par son employ\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pu commettre l\u2019acte pr\u00e9judiciable qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de l\u2019imprudence ou du d\u00e9faut de surveillance de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. (Dalloz, 1887-1-37.)\nLe serviteur dans la maison de son ma\u00eetre, \u00e9tant r\u00e9put\u00e9 agir dans les fonctions auxquelles il est employ\u00e9, le ma\u00eetre est responsable des dommages r\u00e9sultant de tous faits commis chez lui par ce serviteur sans qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre admis \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019il les avait d\u00e9fendus, ni qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en son pouvoir de les emp\u00eacher. Cour de Cass.; Dalloz, 1860-1-518; Sachet, vol. ler, no. 347; Pand. Fr. 1908-1-414; Dalloz, 1902-1-273; Dalloz 1902-2-404.\nLe m\u00eame principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis en Angleterre dans des circonstances analogues \u00e0 celles que nous relevons dans cette cause-ci. Robertson v. Allan Bros, and Co., en 1908[2], o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 du bateau \u00e9tait all\u00e9 \u00e0 terre pour ses propres affaires, il remontait \u00e0 bord du vaisseau sur une planche, contrairement aux ordres qu\u2019il avait et, en glissant de cette planche sur le pont, il est tomb\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9coutille; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette homme \u00e9tait dans \u201cl\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\u201d\nNous savons cependant que, sur ces questions de responsabilit\u00e9, la loi anglaise est bien plus favorable au ma\u00eetre que notre code civil.\nLes derniers d\u00e9cisions fran\u00e7aises sont \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le ma\u00eetre est responsable du fait de son serviteur quand l\u2019acte g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de la faute a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par le serviteur, soit dans l\u2019exercice, soit \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de l\u2019exercice, de ces fonctions. Dalloz, 1894-2-296; 1897-2-172; 1898-2-511; 1899-2-104. Thibert \u00e9tait donc dans le cas actual dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions et il a engag\u00e9 par sa faute la responsabilit\u00e9 de ses ma\u00eetres.\nLes appelants pr\u00e9tendent que l\u2019action contre eux devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e parce que les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 poursuivi d\u2019autres personnes pour le m\u00eame accident et ils invoquent l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 1056 qui d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il,\nne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule et m\u00eame action pour tous ceux qui ont droit \u00e2 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nCette pr\u00e9tention ne saurait \u00eatre maintenue. L\u2019article 1056 d\u00e9termine que si une perisonne d\u00e9c\u00e8de \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un accident sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9 son conjoint et ses enfants ont un droit de poursuite.\nEn principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral les cr\u00e9anciers d\u2019une obligation peuvent exercer leurs droit seuls ou en m\u00eame temps que leurs co-cr\u00e9anciers.

On default in payment as provided, a notice was given in the terms mentioned, but only to one of the purchasers, an extension of time was applied for and refused and, after thirty days from the time of the notice the vendor re-entered. Five days later the purchasers tendered the balance unpaid, which was refused by the vendor on the grounds that no conveyance was tendered for execution and that the purchasers had abandoned the agreement. Two weeks later the purchasers sued for specific performance.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (18 B.C. Rep. 271), that the clause making time of the essence of the contract had reference not to the gale dates, but to the time mentioned in the notice; that the notice as given did not comply with the condition of the agreement requiring notice to all of the purchasers, and that, in the circumstances of the case, there were not such laches chargeable against the purchasers as would amount to abandonment of their rights under the agreement or deprive them of their remedy of specific performance. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Gregory J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nBy agreement for sale and purchase, dated the 6th day of December, 1910, the defendant (respondent) agreed to sell and the plaintiffs (appellants) agreed to purchase certain lands in the City of Victoria for $1,600 of which $800 was paid in cash, and the balance was payable in two equal instalments of $400 each on the 6th day of June, 1911, and the 6th day of December, 1911. Neither of these payments was made on the due date, and on the 27th of March, 1912, the defendant sent a notice demanding payment and purporting to cancel the agreement of sale, and to forfeit the moneys paid should the default continue after the expiration of thirty days from the date of the notice. This notice was alleged to be given in accordance with the clause in the agreement providing for such cancellation and forfeiture, and setting out that the notice might be well and sufficiently given if \"mailed at Victoria, B.C., Post Office, under registered cover addressed as follows,\" * * * but the blank space in the printed form was not filled in. A few days later, the plaintiff asked defendant for an extension of time, but this was refused, and on 10th May, 1912 the defendant entered into possession of the lands. On the 15th May, 1912, the plaintiffs offered the defendant the sum of $900, but no conveyance was tendered therewith for execution. The defendant refused to receive this sum on the grounds stated in the head-note.\nThe learned trial judge held that the notice of cancellation was sufficiently given, and that the plain- tiffs had practically abandoned their purchase and were not in any case entitled to specific performance. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia, in upholding this decision, held further that no sufficient tender was made inasmuch as no conveyance was tendered for execution.\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the appellants.\nR.A. Pringle K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff. I would venture merely to add that the clause in the agreement belongs to that class of resolutive conditions known in the civil law as une clause commissoire. The difficulty in this case has arisen out of the fact that the agreement has been construed below as containing a resolutive condition pure and simple. The difference between the two with respect to the rights of the parties under the agreement is neatly expressed by Aubry & Rau, vol. 4, page 83 (4 ed.):\u2014\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et sauf ce qui va \u00eatre dit sur le pacte commissoire, la condition r\u00e9solutoire op\u00e8re de plein droit, d\u00e8s I'instant o\u00f9 elle se trouve accomplie, sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de faire prononcer la r\u00e9solution en justice. Le pacte commissoire est la clause par laqu-elle les parties conviennent que le contrat sera r\u00e9solu si I'une ou l'autre d'entre elles ne satisfait point aux obligations qu'il lui impose. Cette clause est toujours sousentendue dans les contrats parfaitement synallagmatiques. A la difference des autres conditions r\u00e9solutoires, qui op\u00e8rent de plein droit, le pacte commissoire ne produit, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, son effet qu'en vertu du jugement qui declare la convention r\u00e9solue. Le juge, saisi de la demande en r\u00e9solution, n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de la prononcer; il peut accorder au d\u00e9fendeur un delai pour I'ex\u00e9cution de ses engagements.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed and the decree for specific performance as prayed for granted. I do not think the notice in case of default in making the payments stipulated for, expressly provided for in the agreement of purchase, was given and there was not, consequently, the continuing default in making the purchase payments which the agreement expressly provided would nullify it and operate as a forfeiture of previous payments.\nThe only remaining reason advanced for refusing the relief asked for was that the circumstances were not such as justified the court in granting this special relief. I differ from the courts below on this point also and cannot see anything on the facts as proved which should preclude the plaintiffs from obtaining the relief they ask.\nOne-half of the purchase money was paid at the time of the purchase. The notice called for by the agreement to be served upon the purchasers in the event of their failing punctually to make payment of the balance of the purchase money, and thus evidencing the vendors' determination to avoid the agreement and the rights of the purchasers under it, was not given. The evidence does not shew an intention on the purchasers' part to abandon their rights under the agreement and no evidence was given of any facts which, in my judgment, ought to deprive the complainants of the special relief prayed for.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The term of this contract making time of the essence thereof is so coupled with a specific mode of enforcing it, as to form a necessary part thereof. This specification though somewhat imperfect may be so construed as to give it some effect, but any such possible construction has not been so fol- lowed by the steps taken as to be in conformity therewith. The contract must, therefore, be looked at as an ordinary contract of sale and purchase, destitute of any provision relative to time being of the essence of the contract.\nSo treated the mere default for a few months (where not a mere deposit but half the purchase money had been already paid), in payment of the two instalments to be made later does not constitute sufficient ground for refusing specific performance.\nNo case has been cited to us, and I venture to think none can be found, resting merely upon the like default, as in law depriving a vendee, under such circumstances, of his right to specific performance in face of his tender of the balance due.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gregory, who dismissed the appellants' action for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of land made between the respondent and the appellants on the 10th of December, 1910. The purchase price was $1,600 of which $800 was paid at the time of the execution of the agreement, and the residue was to be paid in two equal instalments; one on the 11th of June, 1911, and the other on the 11th of December, in the same year. In February of 1911, the vendees, the appellants, assigned the benefit of this agreement to one Lim Bang, at the price of $2,500, receiving in cash $1,700 at the time of the assignment and an undertaking to pay on the days respectively appointed for the making of the deferred payments, under the appellants' agreement for purchase. This last agreement contained the clause in the following terms:\u2014\nAnd it is expressly agreed that time is to be considered the essence of this agreement, and unless the payments above mentioned are punctually made at the time and in the manner above mentioned, and as often as any default shall happen in making such payment, the vendor, his heirs or assigns, may give to the purchasers, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, thirty days' notice in writing demanding payment thereof, and in case any such default shall continue, these presents shall at the expiration of any such notice be null and void and of no effect, and the vendor shall be at liberty to re-possess, or re-sell and convey the said lands to any purchaser as if these presents had not been made, and all the moneys paid hereunder shall be absolutely forfeited to the vendor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns. The said notice shall be well and sufficiently given if delivered to the purchasers, their heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, or mailed at Victoria, B.C., Post Office, under registered cover addressed as follows:\u2014\nThe appellants having made default in meeting the deferred payments provided for in their agreement, on the 26th of March, 1912, the respondent caused a notice to be sent by registered letter addressed to the appellants demanding payment of the overdue instalment and stating that in default of payment within thirty days from the date of the notice the agreement would be null and void and all moneys already paid thereunder forfeited. The appellant, Bark-Fong, was then in China. On the 15th of May following, the appellants tendered the amount overdue which the respondent refused to accept. On the 27th of the same month, the appellants sued for specific performance. In the statement of defence the respondent set up the appellants' default, the forfeiture clause in the agreement as quoted above, the notice of the 26th March, 1912, and, further, alleged that the respondent, on the 10th of May, 1912, \"took re-possession of the lands in question\" and had been in possession ever since. At the trial the respondent was given leave to add a further defence to the effect that the appellants by their neglect to make the deferred payments had \"abandoned and repudiated the said agreement.\"\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action. He held first that notice had been sufficiently given under the forfeiture clause above set out and, by implication, that the appellants' rights had thereby terminated. He also held that the default in respect of the deferred payments disentitled them to specific performance. In the Court of Appeal, Irving and Martin JJ. agreed with the learned trial judge on this latter ground. Mr. Justice Galliher appears to have taken the view that the appellants were not entitled to succeed owing to the absence of a proper tender of the purchase money or of a conveyance.\nI am unable to agree with the view of this case which has been taken in the courts below. I think the steps taken by the respondent with a view to terminate the agreement under the forfeiture clause were not effectual for that purpose; and that if they had been effectual the appellants would be entitled to relief against forfeiture. I think there is no ground for the suggestion that the respondent did exercise or intend to exercise any right that he may have had to terminate the agreement (on the ground that the appellants' conduct constituted a repudiation of their obligations under it) except the right given him by the forfeiture clause. I have also come to the conclusion that the appellants' conduct was not such as to disentitle them to specific performance.\nThat the contract was not terminated by the con- duct of the parties amounting to mutual abandonment of the contract, as Cotton L.J. called it, in Mills v. Haywood[2], at page 202, is very clear. Assuming that the appellants' default was such conduct as would have entitled the respondent to say to them \"you, by your conduct have declared your intention of not carrying out the contract and I shall treat the contract, therefore, as rescinded,\" it is quite plain that that is not the course the respondent took. On the contrary he says that on several occasions prior to the giving of the notice in March, 1912, he requested the appellants to fulfil their agreement. The notice itself recognizes the agreement as a subsisting contract and demands performance of it. The appellant, no doubt, by that notice does declare his intention to terminate the contract, but to terminate it, not as in exercise of any rights he might have had under the general law, but only in exercise of his rights under the forfeiture clause. He declares his intention to forfeit the moneys already paid. If he had terminated the contract under the general law it is questionable whether he could have retained those moneys. The law upon this point is perhaps not quite settled, but the respondent's notice makes it quite clear that he intended to run no risk of being obliged to refund the moneys he had received. That the vendor's rights under the forfeiture clause were not effectually exercised seems to me equally clear. The notice of the 26th of March was received by two of the appellants. One method of giving the notice is, according to the terms of the contract delivery to the purchasers; and that, I think, is the only method authorized by the contract. The subsequent clause (\"mailed at Vic- toria, B.C.\") is obviously incomplete and ought to be disregarded. It was argued that the appellants were engaged as partners in a common adventure and that service of notice on one would consequently be service on all. I do not think it is necessary to consider whether in the circumstances the appellants ought to be held to be partners in the purchase and sale of the property in question. I think it is immaterial. The agreement does not treat them as partners. It is an agreement between Thos. Cooper on the one band, and three individuals as purchasers on the other, and I entertain no doubt, that the agreement contemplated delivery of the notice to each one of these individuals. But, quite apart from that, assuming notice had been properly given, I am quite clear that the appellants are entitled to relief from the forfeiture. The clause is clearly a penalty clause, that is to say, it is a provision intended to secure punctual payment, and that being so, on general principles of equity the appellants are entitled to relief upon coming into court and offering to perform the obligations of which the clause was intended to secure performance, unless they are precluded from obtaining such relief by some conduct which makes it inequitable that such relief should be granted. If the vendee, relying upon the effect of this clause, had made a sale of the lands or had rented them to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser or lessee or in some other way dealt with that property so that it would be impossible to restore the parties to their former positions, then any relief which the court could give might be of only a very limited character. But nothing of the kind has occurred in this case.\nThe question remains whether the appellants have lost their right by reason of laches. The general prin- ciple is stated in Fry on Specific Performance, at page 539:\u2014\nThe Court of Chancery was at one time inclined to neglect all consideration of time in the specific performance of contracts for sale, not only as an original ingredient in them, but as affecting them by way of laches. But it is now clearly established that the delay of either party in not performing its terms on his part, or in not prosecuting his right to the interference of the court by the institution of an action, or, lastly, in not diligently prosecuting his action, when instituted, may constitute such laches as will disentitle him to the aid of the court, and so amount, for the purpose of specific performance, to an abandonment on his part of the contract.\nThe delay in commencing the action, that is to say, the lapse of the seventeen days between the 10th of May, when the respondent announced his refusal to carry out the contract, and the 27th May, when the action started, is not important, nor was there any delay in the prosecution of the action. The point which has to be considered is whether the delay of the appellants in the payment of the purchase price disentitled them to specific performance. The doctrine of laches, it has been frequently said, is not a technical doctrine, and in order to constitute a defence there must be such a change of position as would make it inequitable to require the defendant to carry out the contract or the delay must be of such a character as to justify the inference that the plaintiffs intended to abandon their rights under the contract or otherwise to make it unjust to grant specific performance. It cannot be said that anything has occurred which makes it inequitable that the respondent should be called upon to perform his contract; the only change suggested is that the property has risen in value. In the special circumstances of this case I do not see why that should be regarded as a ground for thinking it is unfair that the defendant should be held to his contract. Nor do I think that the circumstances in evidence justify the conclusion that the appellants intended to abandon their rights under the contract. The appellants had paid $800 on the purchase price. They had assigned the benefit of their agreement and had made a profit of $900. It may be that two of them were people of no substance but Bark-Fong, at all events, appears to have been a man of means, and the abandonment of their contract without the consent of Lim Bang might have exposed them to a liability to refund the moneys they had received. The delay is not really difficult to explain when one considers the circumstances. They did undoubtedly expect that Lim Bang, the assignee of the agreement, would, in performance of his contract, provide them with funds for making the payments under their own purchase. The appellants were in posession of the property which was perfectly good security for the amount due to the vendor; and it was not until March, 1912, when the value of the property was rising, that he began seriously to press for payment. He then gave a notice demanding payment within thirty days. That notice constituted an admission that there was a subsisting contract and an admission, indeed, that until the end of the period mentioned the contract would not be at an end, and I think in the words of Malins V.-C., in McMurray v. Spicer[3], that this notice excludes all the anterior time in the computation of delay. I do not think that their conduct from that time forward can be imputed to them for laches. They communicated with Bark-Fong, who was in China, who appears to have acted with all reasonable diligence; and I think, in view of the previous acquiescence of the respondent and of all the circumstances, it would be applying to these appellants an unduly rigorous standard if we should interpret their conduct during this period as demonstrating an intention on their part of not performing the obligations of the agreement or as shewing such a want of diligence as to make it just to withhold the remedy of specific performance.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Under a written agreement the plaintiffs, on the 6th of December, 1910, became purchasers from the defendant of a property in the City of Victoria, for the sum of $1,600, of which One-half was paid in cash, and the balance was made payable with interest at 7% ; $400 on the 6th June, 1911, and $400 on the 6th December, 1911. By a special provision in the agreement the vendor reserved the right on any default in payment to rescind the contract and forfeit whatever part of the purchase money had been already paid by giving to the purchasers and their assigns thirty days' notice in writing demanding payment, at the expiration of which, the default continuing, the contract should be null and void and the moneys paid thereunder forfeited. At the outset of the paragraph containing this power time is declared to be \"of the essence of this agreement.\" On the 24th February, 1911, the plaintiffs re-sold the land, receiving from their sub-vendee all his purchase money except $800. This sum he undertook to pay, with interest at 7%, at the dates and in the manner stipulated for in the plaintiffs' agreement with the defendant.\nDefault was made in payment of the instalment of $400 and interest due in June, 1911. The defendant made some oral demands for payment from one of the three purchasers, but it is not clear upon the record whether these demands were made before or after the second instalment fell due. The default continuing and the second instalment also being overdue, the defendant on the 26th of March, 1912, caused to be mailed a notice addressed to the three purchasers demanding payment and purporting to be given under the special provision of the contract above mentioned. This notice was received by one of the purchasers who informed his co-purchaser, who was in Victoria, of its receipt. The third purchaser, who was in China, was then written to by one of his co-purchasers to come back at once. It does not appear that he was informed of the notice. No attempt was made to give notice to the assign or sub-purchaser, although the defendant had been informed of the sub-sale. The purchaser who had received the notice called on the defendant on the 27th of March, and explained the absence of one of the purchasers in China and says he asked for more time to make the payment demanded, which was refused. In his plea the defendant says he re-took possession of the property on the 10th of May, 1912. On the 15th of May one of the purchasers tendered to the defendant in his solicitor's office the sum of $900, which was rejected. The sufficiency of this tender is not objected to except on the ground that it was not accompanied by tender of a conveyance for execution.\nThis action for specific performance followed. The defendant pleaded default and laches, rescission by notice, and failure to tender a conveyance. By amendment at the trial he added a plea of abandonment of the contract by the plaintiffs. The learned trial judge found that the notice had been sufficiently given under the special clause providing for rescission and forfeiture and also sustained the plea of abandonment. In appeal Irving J.A. agreed with the trial judge; Martin J.A. thought the notice insufficient, but held the case was not one for specific performance on the authority of Wallace v. Hesslein[4] ; Galliher J.A. relied solely on the failure to tender conveyance, expressing no opinion as to the sufficiency of the notice given.\nNo doubt the intention of the parties when making the agreement was to provide for the giving, by post, of the notice demanding payment. It was also no doubt a mere accident that this provision of the contract was not complete, a material item in it being left blank. Personal service on the three purchasers, and on their assign, was the alternative method provided for giving notice of the demand in writing. The terms upon which a vendor is given such a contractual right of rescission and forfeiture must be strictly observed. Marriott v. Mills (unreported). Although he had not complied with the terms, the vendor, under the notice thus served on but one purchaser, proceeded to enforce the provision of the contract for rescission and forfeiture. His action, in my opinion, is clearly not justifiable under it.\nFailing to establish compliance with the special contractual provision he now attempts to assert some right either to rescind by his own act on the purchasers' default or to have rescission decreed by the court. In his pleading he does not put the case in this way, relying apparently upon the sufficiency of his notice given to only one of the three purchasers, and the continued default, to effect rescission under the special provision of the contract. By that very notice the vendor recognized the agreement as subsisting up to the 26th of April. He did not actually proceed to act upon the footing of rescission until the 10th of May, when he says in his pleading he re-took possession. The purchasers had paid One-half of the purchase money and they made tender of the balance on the 15th of May. Under these circumstances I do not think they had incurred the extreme penalty of forfeiture and rescission; but, if they had, the recent decision of the Judicial Committee in Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands, Limited[5], establishes that they are entitled to relief. In that case and in the recent Ontario case of Boyd v. Richards[6], as in the case now before us, the provision for rescission and forfeiture was in the nature of a condition subsequent or of defeasance \u2014not a condition precedent, as I, at all events, thought the condition dealt, with in Labelle v. O'Connor[7], relied on by counsel for the respondent, was.\nIt may not be amiss to note in passing that in the judgment in the Kilmer Case[8], at page 322, it is said of Re Dagenham Dock Company[9], on the authority of which the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Kilmer Case[10] proceeds:\u2014\nthat was a case like this of forfeiture claimed under the letter of the agreement and a cross-action for specific performance.\nA study of the report of the Dagenham Case[11], which came up on a motion by way of appeal from a decision of the Master of the Rolls refusing to order delivery up of certain lands to the applicants, who were vendors asserting forfeiture, does not disclose the pendency of any cross-action for specific performance. The right to that relief is not referred to in the judgment. No doubt that case is a very strong authority in favour of the right of the present appellants, under the circumstances in evidence, to relief from the penalty of rescission and forfeiture. But their right to specific performance involves other considerations.\nThe principal grounds relied upon at bar in support of the defendant's right to have the court decree rescission and forfeiture, and in answer to the plaintiffs' claim for specific performance, were an alleged abandonment by the plaintiffs of their contractual rights, and their laches.\nThe testimony in my opinion fails to shew anything in the nature of abandonment or any facts from which an intention to abandon can fairly be inferred. The payment of One-half of the purchase money in cash and the provision in the re-sale agreement for payment of the balance by the sub-purchaser at the time and in the amounts called for by the plaintiffs' agreement with the defendant; Wing-On's request for time when the defendant demanded payment; and the tender of the balance of the purchase money and interest on the 15th of May are scarcely consistent with an intention to abandon. In the light of the testimony as to the reasons given for the default, the mere delay in payment, the sole ground averred in this plea, put upon the record only by amendment at the trial, will not support it. In Wallace v. Hesslein[12], the court, perhaps, took what may appear to be an extreme view of the duty of a purchaser who claims specific performance to shew that he has always been \"ready, prompt and eager to complete.\" But that decision really rested on the ground that the purchaser had abandoned his contract as was evidenced by his declaration made to the vendor that he would be unable to carry it out. In the present case, as already indicated, the circumstances rebut an intention to abandon.\nCourts of equity have never formulated a hard and fast rule of universal application that any fixed period of delay in payment of purchase money will afford any insuperable bar to the relief of specific performance. Whether his default disentitles the purchaser to that relief always depends upon the circumstances, and it is a question to be determined in each case, as a matter of judicial discretion, whether under the circumstances the default has been such that it would be unjust and inequitable to enforce the contract specifically.\nIn the present case it is in the very clause providing for rescission by the vendor upon thirty days' notice to the purchasers, to be given after default, that time is declared to be of the essence of the agreement. It is clear that this stipulation as to time was intended to apply not to mere default in payment at the dates provided in the contract, but only to failure to pay within thirty days after a valid notice, in conformity with the provision for rescission, had been duly given. See Webb v. Hughes[13]. That notice was never given. The abortive attempt to give it serves to shew that the vendor himself did not treat time as of the essence in regard to the dates for payment fixed by the contract. At all events until he gave the notice of the 27th of March, and probably until, as he says in his statement of defence, he re-took possession on the 10th of May, he may fairly be regarded, if not as acquiescing in the purchaser's delay in payment, at least as not insisting upon any rights which that delay gave him. The entire delay in the present case was less than a year; the delay after notice to the only purchaser who was notified was forty-nine days; and only five days elapsed between the re-taking of possession alleged by the defendant and the tender to him of the balance of the purchase money on the 15th of May. The right to specific performance has been held not to have been lost by much longer delays. See cases cited in Fry on Specific Performance (5 ed.), page 541. In the Dagenham Case[14], if it should be regarded, as it seems to have been in the Kilmer Case[15], as an authority on the question of specific performance, the delay in payment was for over three years. In the present case it is obvious that any injury suffered by the vendor will be fully compensated by payment of interest. Under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, and having regard to the terms of the contract, I do not think that specific performance should be refused on the ground of laches.\nAs to the failure to tender a conveyance for execution, the attitude taken by the defendant in his defence makes it quite clear that such a tender if made would have been useless. Tender of the purchase money \u2014 the really material thing to evidence the plaintiffs' readiness and willingness to complete the contract \u2014 was sufficiently made. It was rejected not on the ground that it was unaccompanied by a tender of a conveyance for execution, but on the ground that the contract had been rescinded. That would amount to a waiver of the tender of a conveyance.\nOn the whole case I am, with respect, of the opinion that, in the sound exercise of judicial discretion, specific performance should not be refused.

The plaintiff recovered judgment for the specific amount claimed and he was also awarded an annuity of $247.50, which might be subject to revision, under the statute. The capitalized value of the annuity would, probably, amount to a sum exceeding $2,000, the appealable limitation fixed by section 46(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139.\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances of the case, it did not appear that the demande amounted to the sum or value or two thousand dollars, within the meaning of section 46(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d and, consequently, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.

The question raised is not free from difficulty, but, after careful consideration of the Act and of the jurisprudence of this court, I have come to the conclusion that the motion must be granted.\nThe dispute between the parties to this litigation is with respect to the right of the plaintiff to compensation for injuries measured by the terms of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d of the Province of Quebec, and the question is: Does the thing in controversy amount to the sum of $2,000? (See section 46(c), \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d)\nThe compensation payable to an injured workman, under the Act, takes the form, in the case of permanent incapacity, of an annual \u201crent\u201d or pension which continues during his life; but, as its amount is subject to revision (see section 26 of the Act), it cannot be said to be a life rent within the ordinary meaning of that term (Planiol, vol. 1, nos. 2251 and 2783). The quantum of the rent is determined by the extent to which the earning power of the plaintiff has been reduced as the result of the injury received. That is the basis of the compensation, so that, if his earning power improves at any time within four years after judgment rendered (sec. 26), the amount of compensation awarded is liable to be reduced on cause shewn, a and, if that earning power is restored, the right to compensation ceases altogether. There is this other element of contingency to be considered\u2014 the uncertainty of human life\u2014 and, in the present case, on the medical evidence, I gather that the expectation of life is very short.\nIt is true that the Act (9 Edw. VII., eh. 66) provides, by section 2 (c), that the capital of the \u201crent\u201d shall not, except in the case mentioned in article 5, exceed $2,000. This does not mean that the employer is entitled, on payment of that sum, to escape his liability. The purpose of the statute, following the principle of the French Act, is to introduce periodical payments in lieu of a capital payment so as to protect the workman and the employer. The combined effect of sections 2(c) and 9 is to enable the workman to demand, as soon as his permanent incapacity to work is ascertained, that the \u201crent\u201d payable to him shall be capitalized and that the capital which will produce this \u201crent\u201d\u2014 reduced to $2,000 if it exceeds that sum\u2014 shall be paid not to himself, but to an insurance company. It is to be observed also that there is grave doubt as to whether it can be said that the permanent incapacity to work can be ascertained until the four years period, during which the amount of the pension is subject to revision, has expired. In any event, it is only when this option is exercised that any \u201ccapital of the rent\u201d comes into existence. That being the measure and the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s right, is it possible for us to say that there is in controversy between the parties a thing which has a value realizable in money to the extent of $2,000? I fail entirely to see how a right, the existence of which is dependent upon so many contingencies and which, under the terms of the statute is intended to provide the workman with a pension payable quarterly only so long as his physical condition as affected by the injury is such as to justify its payment, can be said to have any commercial value at all. It is not a thing which is in commercio, more particularly in view of those provisions of the statute which make the pension inalienable, not seizable (sec. 12), and subject to revision by the court as above stated.\nThe practice of this court in cases arising in Quebec seems to be against our jurisdiction. In Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[1], Taschereau J., speaking for the court, said:\u2014\nIt is settled law that neither the probative force of the judgment nor its collateral effects, nor any contingent loss that a party may suffer by reason of a judgment are to be taken into consideration when our jurisdiction depends upon the pecuniary amount.\nIn Talbot v. Guilmartin[2], the relief asked for included a condemnation to pay $18,000, money alleged to have come into the hands of the appellant, and, notwithstanding, the court refused to entertain the appeal. The last case is La Compagnie d\u2019Aqueduc de la Jeune Lorette v. Verrett[3], in which it was held that this court was without jurisdiction. In that case the plaintiff asked for a declaration that certain rights and privileges to construct an aqueduct were exclusive. The value of those rights was shewn, on affidavit, to far exceed the appealable amount. On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that we are without jurisdiction because, as the Chief Justice said, in Macdonald v. Galivan[4], \u201cthere is no direct claim for a definite sum of $2,000,\u201d or as the Chief Justice said, in Lapointe v. The Montreal Police Benevolent and Pension Society[5], the \u201cvalue of the demand is a contingent one depending upon his life.\u201d\nIt may be that I have been influenced in reaching this conclusion by the fact that the Quebec \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d specially limits appeals (see section 22), and to allow an appeal here in a case like this would be contrary to the spirit of the Act. In any event, in case of doubt, the question should be resolved against jurisdiction. Interest reipublic\u0153 ut sit finis litium.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014Our jurisdiction to hear this appeal is challenged by a motion to quash on the ground that the \u201cmatter in controversy\u201d does not \u201camount to the sum or value of $2,000\u201d within section 46 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nThe action was one brought by a workman against his employer under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d of Quebec, R.S.Q., 1909, art. 7321 et seq.\nThe claim of the plaintiff was to recover $450 for one-half year\u2019s earnings during incapacity to earn wages before action and also for a life rent or indemnity of $337 per annum.\nThe judgment awarded the plaintiff a life rent of $247.50 per annum to commence on the 24th December, 1911.\nThe capitalized value of this life rent or annuity at 3% would amount to $8.266; at 4% to $6,175; at 5% to $4,940; and at 6% to $4,116.66; and if such capitalized value can be taken to be directly involved in this case as a matter in controversy between the parties no doubt could exist as to our jurisdiction.\nWhile in the ordinary case of a life rent or annuity its value would be simple of calculation, in cases such as this its continuance would be subject to so many contingencies that its value would be difficult, if not impossible, for an appeal court to determine. That value would depend largely upon the condition and state of health in which the injuries of the annuitant arising from the accident left him. The ordinary annuity tables, owing to the contingencies arising from the condition and state of health of the workman, might be quite inapplicable and the difficulties of placing an estimate upon its value almost insuperable.\nThe evidence in the record of the case we have now before us affords an excellent illustration of these difficulties; and if we were driven to estimate the value of the life-rent from this evidence we might well conclude that the case is not within our jurisdiction.\nThe two medical men examined as experts differed on some material points. Dr. De Martigny\u2019s opinion was that as the result of the accident two surgical operations were necessary, one to cut off one of the workman\u2019s legs very high up near the thigh and the other to cut off one of his arms. Dr. Archibald did not concur in this view so far as the arm was concerned.\nFor us, as an appeal court, to attempt to determine the contingencies of life or death which might follow one or both of these operations so as to estimate the value of the life-rent and determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal is a course which, I feel certain, our \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d never contemplated as one of our duties. Lapointe v. Montreal Police Benefit Pension Society[6]. It seems to me, however, that the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d relieves us of all these difficulties and establishes the value of the life-rent for us. Article 7329 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909) reads as follows:\u2014\nAs soon as the permanent incapacity to work is ascertained, or in case of death of the person injured within one month from the date of the agreement between the employer and the parties interested, or if there be no agreement, within one month from the date of the final judgment condemning him to pay the same, the employer shall pay the amount of the compensation to the person injured or his representatives, or, as the case may be, and at the option of the person injured or of his representatives, shall pay the capital of the rent to an insurance company designated for that purpose by order in council. 9 Edw. VII. ch. 66, sec. 9.\nThat section confers upon the injured workman, who has obtained judgment for a life-rent, the right to demand payment of\nthe capital of the rent to an insurance company designated by order in council\nand imposes upon the employer the obligation to make the payment of such capital when demanded.\nThat being so, it appears to me that the capitalized amount of the life-rent awarded the workman is a matter in controversy in this action directly flowing from the judgment awarding the life-rent itself; and it being declared by art. 7322, sub-sec. 2, that the capital shall not exceed $2,000, in cases such as this, that amount at least is in controversy.\nThe \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d of Quebec by imposing the obligation upon the employer of paying over the capital representing the life-rent to a company as security, in part at least, for the payment of the life-rent to the workman has put a statutory value for that purpose upon the life-rent.\nIn my opinion such a correlative right and obligation arising directly from and being a direct consequence of the judgment awarding the life-rent gives us jurisdiction in cases where such capitalized value is not less than $2,000, which it obviously is not in this case.\nThe statute does not release the defendant from its obligation to pay the life-rent adjudged to the plaintiff, but capitalizes it at an arbitrary maximum limit of $2,000. It confers upon the plaintiff the right within one month from the date of the final judgment to compel\npayment of the capital of the life rent (not exceeding $2,000) to an insurance company.\nIn the case now before us that maximum limit would obviously be the sum which the plaintiff had a right to demand should be paid and which the defendants were bound to pay over. Unless, therefore, we are prepared to say that we could enter upon a consideration of the contingencies or possibilities under which that $2,000 might be reduced it seems to me the appeal is within our jurisdiction.\nIdington J. concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nDuff J.\u2014The question to be determined on this application is whether or not we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under section 46 (c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d; in other words, whether in the suit out of which this appeal arises\nthe matter in controversy * * * amounts to the sum or value of $2,000.\nThe effect of the accident from which the respondent suffered was to produce \u201can absolute and permanent incapacity\u201d within the meaning of article 7322 (a) of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, and the respondent, therefore, became entitled to a \u201crent\u201d for life equal to 50% of his yearly wages, subject to any question which might arise under article 7322(2), R.S.Q., 1909, and to the contingency of \u201crevision\u201d under article 7346. The respondent, moreover, is entitled, at his option, under article 7329, R.S.Q., 1909, to require the appellants to pay the capital of the \u201crent\u201d to an insurance company \u201cdesignated for that purpose by order-in-council.\u201d\nIt seems to be manifestly impossible to say that the amount \u201cdemanded\u201d by the respondent in his action was equal to the sum of $2,000. The respondent \u201cdemanded\u201d a judgment entitling him to a life-annuity which, in the aggregate, might or might not amount to that sum. I think that is not sufficient to bring the case within the first alternative of sub-section (c) of section 46 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nAs to the second alternative ground of jurisdiction, under that sub-section, I am inclined to think that \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d can only \u201camount to * * * the value of $2,000,\u201d within the meaning of the words to be construed, when the plaintiff is claiming something other than the mere payment of money. That seems to foe the more natural construction, and it was, moreover, the view which was taken by this court, apparently, in Lapointe v. The Montreal Police Benevolent and Pension Society[7]. Assuming, however, that in this case \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d ought to be regarded as the right claimed by the plaintiff to be paid the statutory annuity subject to the statutory incidents and conditions (and that the case, consequently, is covered by the sub-section in question, if the value of that right can be said to amount to $2,000), I think the appellants still fail because there are no grounds before us justifying the conclusion that the right claimed and established has a value equal to that sum. Unfortunately the accident has left the respondent\u2019s expectation of life in a state of very grave uncertainty, and not only has no attempt been made to put a capital value upon the right established by the judgment he has recovered, but it would seem that any attempt to do so could hardly, in the circumstances, be expected to result in any conclusion sufficiently definite to serve as a guide for the purposes of this application.\nCounsel for the appellants rested exclusively upon the provision of article 7322(2), arguing that this enactment was a statutory declaration as to the value of the annuity when the incapacity is permanent. I am afraid I cannot follow this contention. There is nothing whatever to indicate that, in fact, the legislature had in mind any such object in framing this provision; in any case, it would still be our duty to apply section 46(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d according to the proper construction of the words used by the Parliament of Canada, and we should be obliged to hold that our jurisdiction, under that provision, only arises when \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d is, in fact, shewn to amount to \u201cthe sum or value of $2,000.\u201d The requirement imposed by article 7329, R.S.Q., 1909, by which the employer comes under an obligation to pay the capital of the \u201crent\u201d to an insurance company, does not help the appellants. It may be open to dispute whether, on the one hand, this article contemplates that the incidence of the obligation established by the judgment shall fall thenceforth upon the insurance company exclusively (the employer being relieved and the amount to be paid being determined\nby arrangement between the employer and the insurance company) or, on the other hand, the sum here required to be paid to the insurance company is merely intended to stand as security for the due performance by the employer of his obligation. Whichever view be taken of the effect of the article it can give no help to the appellants on this application. If the moneys paid are intended to stand as security only, then it seems plain that such an obligation to provide security, as a right incidental to the judgment, can afford no final criterion for determining the value of the matter in controversy in the proceedings leading up to the judgment. If, on the other hand, it is to be regarded as the purchase price of an annuity to be paid to the plaintiff by the insurance company, we have no means before us of ascertaining, with any degree of certainty, the amount of it; and until, at all events, the sum has been actually determined by payment, the attempt to ascertain the probable amount of it, in effect, resolves itself into an attempt to appraise the value of the plaintiff\u2019s right with all the attendant difficulties already indicated. Anglin J.\u2014Our jurisdiction in this appeal depends upon whether the matter in controversy, according to the plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the R.S.Q., 1909, arts. 7321 et seq., amounts to the sum or value of $2,000 (\u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d sec. 46).\nExcept the decision in the case of Lapointe v. Montreal Police Benefit Pension Society[8], I know of no authority binding on this court which requires us to hold that where the plaintiff\u2019s right to an annuity or pension is the subject of litigation, the value of the matter in controversy is to be deemed limited to the amount of the first annual payment. There are dicta of some judges\u2019 susceptible of such an interpretation, to be found in cases in which the actual claim in the action was limited to a single instalment of a periodical payment. But these cases are so obviously distinguishable that reference to them is unnecessary. In such cases it is the settled jurisprudence of this court that jurisdiction will not be entertained, although the effect of the judgment in appeal may be to determine the rights of the parties in regard to payments which, in the aggregate, must amount to a sum greater than $2,000. Although it is on the authority of such cases that the Lapointe8 decision is based, under the doctrine of stare decisis I bow to its authority, but, if free to do so, I would respectfully decline to follow it. An ordinary annuity or pension has a market value capable of ascertainment and that value is the amount in controversy where the judgment in the action determines directly the right to the entire annuity or pension and all future payments thereof are exigible by process issued under such judgment. The Lapointe Case[9], however, is not decisive of the question of jurisdiction now before us.\nIn the present case, as is pointed out by my Lord, the Chief Justice, we are not dealing with an ordinary annuity. The pension, or the \u201crent\u201d as the statute terms it, awarded by the judgment is inalienable and its amount is subject to revision during the ensuing four years and to reduction if the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity should increase. (Art. 7346.) The evidence of Dr. de Martigny discloses that the plaintiff may have to undergo one or perhaps two serious and perilous operations in the near future. It is not unreasonable to assume that in determining the amount of the compensation awarded this view of the situation was accepted. There is no evidence before us of the plaintiff\u2019s expectation of life. In the peculiar circumstances of this case it would probably be very difficult to obtain testimony, and it would seem to be extremely unlikely, that reliable actuarial evidence could be procured that the annuity or pension claimed by the plaintiff, if awarded as claimed, would have a value of not less than $2,000. Upon that aspect of the ease, quite apart from the authority of the Lapointe9 decision, I would not be prepared to affirm jurisdiction.\nThe matter in controversy, however, is to be regarded from the point of view of the defendants as well as from that of the plaintiff. It is true that in extent the plaintiff\u2019s right and the defendants\u2019 responsibility are correlative; but the real value of the matter in controversy may perhaps be better appreciated if regarded from the point of view of the liability imposed upon the defendants, who are seeking to appeal. Under art. 7329 the defendants may, at the option of the plaintiff, be required to\nPay the capital of the rent to an insurance company designated for that purpose by order in council.\nIt is this feature of the present case which distinguishes it from Lapointe v. Montreal Police Benefit and Pension Society[10]. By sub-section 2 of art. 7322 it is provided that:\u2014\nThe capital of the rents shall not, however, in any case except in the case mentioned in art. 7325, exceed $2,000.\nThe present case is not within art. 7325.\nAs a direct result of the judgment in many cases under the Act, the defendants may be required to pay to an insurance company a sum of $2,000.\nIt has been suggested that this sum is to be paid merely by way of security; that it remains the property of the defendants to be repaid to them when the rent ceases; and that payment of it does not relieve them from their liability to pay the rent itself. If that be the purpose and effect of the payment of the capital to an insurance company, there is, no doubt, much to be said in favour of the view that the capital so payable is not the real matter in controversy between the parties, but only something incidental to the claim and judgment, which does not confer jurisdiction. Talbot.v. Guilmartin[11]. As at present advised, I am, with respect, unable to take that view of the legislation. Nowhere in the Act is it stated that the capital of the rent to be paid to the insurance company, under art. 7329, is to stand merely as security. On the contracy by art. 7331 provision is made for determining the conditions upon which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may authorize insurance companies \u201cto pay the said rents in virtue of this sub-section.\u201d And, by article 7340, it is provided that the compensation shall be secured by a privilege upon the defendant\u2019s property\nso long as the sum necessary to procure the required rent has not been paid to an insurance company.\nIn view of these provisions of the statute the purpose of the payment of the capital of the \u201crent\u201d provided for by art. 7329 seems to me to be not the giving of security for the continued payment of the rent itself by the defendants, but the purchase or procuring for the plaintiff, from an authorized insurance company, of a pension or annuity equal in amount to the compensation to which the judgment entitles him. Subject to a possible right of refund pro tanto in the event of a revision of the compensation under art. 7346, the capital, when paid to the insurance company, would, in the view which I suggest, cease to be the property of the defendants and become the property of the insurance company, which would, thereafter, assume the sole liability for the rent. If this were not intended, but the real purpose were merely the giving of security for the future payment of the rent by the defendants, I find it difficult to understand why an insurance company should be selected as the depositary. If as a direct result of the judgment, therefore, the defendants would be liable, at the plaintiff\u2019s option, to pay a sum of $2,000, I would be prepared to hold that they might appeal to this court. From their point of view, in that case, their liability to pay a sum of $2,000 would be a real matter in controversy in the action. But it is not, in the present case, necessary to determine what is the proper construction of the Quebec legislation, and as the question was not argued, it is not desirable to do so.\nOn the view of the statute to which I am at present inclined, the $2,000 is a maximum and it was not intended to require the defendant to pay that sum in every case regardless of the physical condition or the state of health of the plaintiff. In many cases in which an annuity larger than that awarded to the present plaintiff is given, the nature of the injuries sustained or the delicate health of the injured person would enable the defendant to procure am insurance company to undertake his obligation for a sum less than $2,000. No doubt it is the policy of the Government to authorize a sufficient number of insurance companies to deal in these \u201crents\u201d to secure to defendants the benefit of real competition. To determine what capital sum a defendant would be required to pay under the statute, in order to procure for the plaintiff a \u201crent\u201d from an insurance company, would necessitate the giving of evidence on which a finding of the plaintiff\u2019s expectation of life under all the circumstances of the case could properly be based, and actuarial testimony of the market value of his annuity based upon such expectation. The contingency of revision would also have to be taken into account. I cannot think that the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d contemplates our entering upon such an inquiry to determine jurisdiction. But if it does, we have not the necessary evidence in the present case. Upon the material before us it is not possible to say what is the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s annuity; it is not possible to say what sum the defendants might be required to pay as capital of the rent to an insurance company under art. 7329. It is, therefore, not established that the matter in controversy amounts to the sum or value of $2,000.\nFor these reasons I concur in granting the motion to quash this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Meredith, Macpherson, Hague & Rolden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Vipond & Vipond.\n[1] 32 Can.

Miller (46 Can. S.C.R. 45), held that the respondent was entitled to recover the full value of the standing timber destroyed. All evidence bearing upon the question of respondent's interest was omitted in printing the case on appeal and the point was not taken in the Court of Appeal or in the appellant's factum on the present appeal. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Schmidt v. Miller was, subsequently, reversed on appeal to the Privy Council, and the point was raised upon the hearing of the present appeal that the respondent's damages should be reduced in consequence of his limited interest in the timber destroyed.\nHeld, that, in these circumstances, the contention in respect to the pre-emptor's limited interest in the property destroyed (the evidence bearing upon it having been omitted from the appeal case) was not open for consideration in the Supreme Court of Canada. The court refused to disturb findings of the trial judge, based upon sufficient evidence, or the assessment of damages made by him as limited by section 298 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37. The judgment appealed from (12 D.L.R. 425) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Clement J., at the trial, by which the actions of the plaintiffs, respectively, were maintained with costs.\nThe actions affected by this appeal were brought, respectively, by the five respondents, claiming damages for the destruction of timber growing upon their lands, in East Kootenay, B.C., by fire alleged to have originated from a locomotive engine of the appellant company. The trial judge found that the fire had been caused by sparks from an engine operated by the company on their line of railway, which passed the locality where the fire took place, shortly before the fire was observed; he also found that the engine was equipped with proper modern appliances, and he awarded damages in favour of the plaintiffs, respectively, aggregating $4,500, according to the limitation provided by section 298 of the \"Railway Act,\" ch. 37, R.S.C., 1906. This decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe issues raised on the appeal are sufficiently set out in the judgments now reported.\nHellmuth K.C. for the appellants.\nTravers Lewis K.C. and A. B. MacDonald for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. The plaintiff had a right of action although the quantum of damages might depend on the character of his title. (See ch. 129, sec. 132, R.S.B.C.) Also Dinan v. Brealcey[2]. Could that question be raised on this record? I am very doubtful. (See Hamelin v. Bannerman[3].)\nThe origin of the fire is fixed by the witness Anderson beyond dispute. The material elements of fact from which the inference of negligence was drawn were: an unusually hot Summer and a consequently parched surface in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway track. The engine went by the place at which the fire was first seen at ten minutes to two in the afternoon, when there was no fire. Ten minutes afterwards the fire was seen by Anderson, and five minutes later by the engineer of the next train. I think the fair inference was drawn by the judge and we should not interfere. Vide Smith v. London and Southwestern Railway Co.[4].\nDAVIES J.\u2014In my opinion the finding that the sparks which escaped from the appellants' engine which passed the locality at a quarter to two o'clock were the cause of the fire which subsequently destroyed the property of the plaintiff was a reasonable inference from the facts proved and was not, as contended, mere conjecture. The evidence of Anderson, the foreman of the company's fire brigade, and that of Johnson and Cummings as to the place where and when the fire was first seen, its size at that time, and the kind and condition of the woods and debris among which it started, the time when the train passed the spot before Anderson reached it, the absence of any proof whatever that any campers, fishermen or others were on that day seen in the vicinity combine to convince me that there was sufficient proof to enable such a reasonable inference to be drawn and to exclude any other fair inference.\nI think, as a pre-emptor, the plaintiff, Kerr, had a right of action against the defendants for damages for the property burned upon his pre-emption. As to the quantum of such damages, we have not the evidence before, us to pass judgment upon.\u2014 It is not in the record.\u2014 We cannot say that the amount allowed was clearly excessive.\nThe concurring judgment of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal should not be disturbed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014When a plaintiff complaining of the destruction of property by a fire started by a railway-locomotive proves that the fire in question was not apparent to any one there present until after the locomotive charged with being the cause thereof had passed the place of the fire's origin, and immediately, or within half-an-hour thereafter, the fire is discovered to have been but recently started within a hundred feet or so of the railway track so run over, and no other cause thereof is visible, a prim\u00e2 facie case has been established which must be met by something more than idle suggestion or guesses about the effect of the ordinary currents of the wind in collision or conflict with the current created by the speed of the train and that radiating from the smoke-stack; or the possibilities from the pipe ashes of a possible hunter, where no one hunted, or of the cigarettes or matches of a possible fisherman, where there were no fish, or other imaginary causes of the fire. Nor is such a cause of action so proven to be defeated by the adoption by the railway company of \"modern and efficient appliances.\"\nIn such latter case and in the absence of being guilty of any negligence the company complained of is absolved from any greater liability than five thousand dollars.\nI think the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal appreciated the evidence and applied the law correctly in this regard.\nWe are asked now, though no such ground was taken in the appeal below and it is not even mentioned in the appellants' factum, to entertain an appeal in regard to respondent Kerr's damages because he is only a resident pre-emptor.\nHe sued as such and claimed damages accordingly.\n'The learned trial judge, as well as the parties, proceeded throughout upon the basis of the party entitled to recover having his damages assessed according to the value of the timber destroyed on his land.\nKerr, being in occupation of 'his land and in good standing as pre-emptor, clearly was entitled to most substantial damages for the destruction of the timber. Whether the mere speculative chance that he might fail to complete his purchase or not should affect or lessen the claim for full value of the timber never entered the minds of any of those concerned at the trial.\nSuch a view or possibility should not be entertained now after all that has transpired.\nThe alleged reversal of this court in the recent case of the National Trust Co. v. Miller[5], apparently relied upon by the learned trial judge, does not affect the matter of such a claim as, I assume, the plaintiff here sets up by his pleadings. For my part, in that case, I happened to dissent from the majority, yet pointed out the possibility of a claim being so founded even by the owner of a licensed location.\nI agree with the learned trial judge, the pre-emptor in good standing and in possession stands on much higher ground, and I think 'his claim in such case can fall little below that of an absolute owner; at all events, so near to that as to render it necessary to have raised the distinction at the trial.\nI may point out he is given, by section 132 of the \"Crown Lands Act,\" an action for trespass as if absolutely seized of the land, indicating how extensive the rights are which 'he holds in relation to the timber on the land.\nIn my view, it is not necessary to pursue the inquiry further and determine exactly how far his contract, read in light of this section, might carry the respondent, though this is not an action for trespass.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think there is sufficient evidence to support the inference drawn by the learned trial judge as to the origin of the fire.\nA point is raised by Mr. Hellmuth as to the damages. Kerr appears to have held his land as a preemption under the British Columbia \"Land Act.\" The learned trial judge upon the authority of the judgment of this court in Schmidt v. Miller[6], held that Kerr was entitled to the value of the timber destroyed; in other words the learned trial judge held that the decision in question involved the proposition that where standing timber is destroyed or taken away through or by a wrongful act, the person who is in possession of the land upon which the timber stands is entitled to recover the full value of it from the wrongdoer, notwithstanding the fact that he has only a limited interest in the timber, such, for example, as a non-exclusive right to make use of it for a limited purpose. Assuming that to be the proper interpretation of the decision of this court in that case, the proposition cannot, I think, in view of the decision of the Privy Council reversing the judgment of this court, any longer be maintained. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that, subject to the special provisions of section 298 of the \"Railway Act,\" a plaintiff in the position, of Kerr is entitled to recover the actual loss suffered by him through the destruction of timber on his pre-emption; in other words, he is entitled to recover the value of his interest in the timber destroyed.\nSection 132 of the British Columbia \"Land Act\" applies only to actions for \"the recovery of possession\" and actions of \"trespass.\" Kerr's action was not an action falling within either description unless \"trespass\" should be construed as including \"trespass on the case.\" Further, it may be doubted whether section 132 deals with the measure of damages; and if so there would still remain the question whether or not the plaintiff's rights under section 298 of the \"Railway Act\" could properly be measured by the extent of his rights under the \"Land Act.\"\nIt is unnecessary to pass upon this question of the effect of the provisions of the \"Land Act\" because, in my opinion, the point is not open to the appellant. The point was not raised in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and all evidence bearing upon the question of the value of Kerr's interest in the timber was excluded from the appeal book; it was mentioned in this court for the first time on the oral argument. As a general rule an appellant is entitled, no doubt, to bring before this court for the first time a point of law not raised at an earlier stage when all material necessary for the full examination of the point is before the court and the respondent has not been prejudiced by the course taken by the appellant. McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[7], at page 666. I concur, however, with the view of the majority of the court that, in the circumstances of this case, the contention Mr. Hell\u2014muth now seeks to advance must be taken to have been abandoned.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014There was ample evidence of facts upon which, without conjecture, but by what was not an unreasonable inference, the jury could properly find that the fire in question in this action was caused by the defendants' locomotive.\nUnder the authority of Hamelin v. Bannerman[8] I would be disposed to preclude the appellants from raising the question here as to the quantum of the interest of the respondent Kerr, that question not having been presented by him in the Court of Appeal or in his factum. Apparently, because no issue of this kind was to be presented, the evidence bearing on it was omitted from the record in the Court of Appeal and is not now before us. The question at the trial appears to have been not whether, because of his limited interest as a pre-emptor in the timber which was destroyed, the quantum of the plaintiff's recovery should be restricted, but whether he had any right of action or re- covery at all. Under section 123 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, chapter 129, the plaintiff, Kerr, as a pre-emptor, had a right of action against the defendants. It may be that the quantum of the damages to which he was entitled would be substantially less than if he had full ownership of the land which was burned or of the timber upon it; but, without the evidence which has been omitted from the record, we are not in a position to determine the proper quantum, or to say that the amount allowed is clearly excessive.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action by different persons who claim damages from a railway company under section 298 of the \"Railway Act.\"\nUnder the provisions of that section, if damages are caused to lands by fire started by a railway locomotive, the company shall be liable for such damages, whether there is negligence or not.\nThe plaintiffs had to prove that the fire had been set by a locomotive of the company defendant. It is a question of fact about which the trial judge and the judges of the Court of Appeal are unanimous. It would not do for us to reach a different conclusion than the one reached unanimously by the courts below. The jurisprudence of this court is to the effect that the finding of a trial judge, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, should not be disturbed.\nNow, as to one of the plaintiffs, it is argued that he was not the owner of the property destroyed by the fire, but simply a licensee under the provisions of the \"Crown Lands Act\" of British Columbia. That question does not seem to have been discussed before the Court of Appeal. We have been informed by counsel at bar that all the evidence in relation to that feature of the case was not printed by consent of the parties. The only inference to be drawn from that is that the parties were satisfied with the judgment of the Supreme Court of the province in that regard. It would not be fair to the parties to pass judgment on that issue that seems to have been abandoned.\nIn those Circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

Sup. Ct. Rules, O. 58, r. 4\u2014New trial.\nOn the defence of \"volens,\" in an action for damages by an employee on account of injuries sustained in the course of his employment, the question which has to be considered is whether the plaintiff agreed that, if injury should befall him, the risk was to be his and not his master's. Smith v. Baker & Sons ([1891] A.C. 325) referred to.\nIn an action to recover damages for injuries sustained by the engineman in charge of the company's steam-shovel in use on the construction of their works, questions were submitted to the jury to which they gave answers negativing contributory negligence by the plaintiff and finding the company negligent in failing to provide a guard on part of the gearing and in leaving it uncovered, but they did not answer one of the questions submitted to them, viz.: \"Did the plaintiff know and appreciate the risk and danger and did he voluntarily encounter them?\" The defence resting upon this issue was duly presented at the trial and evidence submitted to support it.\nHeld, that, although the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, under Order 58, rule 4, of the \"Supreme Court Rules, 1906,\" has power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made in the trial court, and to make such further or other order as the case in appeal may require, nevertheless, it should not undertake the functions of a jury where it may be reasonably open to them to come to more than one conclusion on the evidence. Therefore, in the circumstances of the present case, there should be an order for a new trial to have the issue of volens decided. Paquin v. Beauclerk ([1906] A.C. 148) and Skeate v. Slaters (30 Times L.R. 290), referred to.\nJudgment appealed from reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment entered by Morrison J., at the trial, on the findings of the jury, in favour of the plaintiff, and dismissing the action with costs.\nThe plaintiff was engineman in charge of a steamshovel in use by the company on works of construction on their line of railway, which was being removed under its own power from one part of the line to another. While the machinery was in motion, he attempted to lubricate a portion of the gearing which was uncovered and not protected by guard-rails. In doing this he entered a narrow passage in a stooping posture and, in backing out from the lubricator, he was caught in the gearing and severely injured.\nOn the trial evidence was adduced to show that the plaintiff had been employed on the machine for a long time, that he was fully aware of the danger to be incurred in approaching the lubricator while the machinery was in motion, that he had made no request to have it protected and that he had carelessly gone into the dangerous position and assumed the risk at a time when it was not necessary to do the work in which he was engaged at the time of the accident. The jury made answers to some of the questions, as stated, in the head-note, but did not give any answer to the question on the issue of volens, which had been the principal defence of the defendants. Upon the answers returned by the jury, the trial judge entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff for $5,000, the amount of the damages assessed by the jury. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia, by the judgment now appealed from, set aside the trial judgment and dismissed the action with costs. In the court below, the present respondents contended that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence, and that he knew and appreciated and voluntarily accepted the risk of performing the work in close proximity to the unguarded gear in which, in consequence of his own carelessness, he was injured.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nHellmuth K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014It is admitted that the proximate cause of the accident out of which the plaintiff's claim arises was the defective gear of the steam-shovel on which he was put to work. That defect consisted in the failure of the defendants to provide a proper guard for the gear, and, in consequence, there was a prim\u00e2 facie liability on their part. Among other defences it was urged that the plaintiff assumed the risk incident to the use of the defective machinery.\nThe maxim volenti non fit injuria has its origin in the Roman Law. (Nulla est injuria qua in volentem fiat,\" Dig. 47, 10, 1, 5.) In the restricted sense in which it is sought to apply it here, that maxim has disappeared from the civil law on the very sound principle that it is contrary to public order to permit a master to relieve himself by express or implied contract of the legal duty to provide adequate appliances, to maintain them in a proper condition and, generally, to conduct his business in such a way as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. \"La S\u00e9curit\u00e9 des personnes est d'ordre public.\" Arts. 13, 1057, 1080, Civil Code of Quebec; Planiol, Revue Critique, 1888, Exam. Doctr., at page 286; Hue., 8, page 571, No. 431, and references. In the English common law, as I understand it, the maxim is gradually receiving a more limited application. In any event, it is quite permissible to say that it was more rigorously applied against the workman in Thomas v. Quatermaine[1], than in Smith v. Baker & Sons[2], and Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[3]. In the first case the Court of Appeal took upon themselves to decide that the plaintiff was deprived of any cause of action because volenti non fit injuria. Since Smith v. Baker & Sons[4] it is a question of fact for the jury whether the workman by express or implied agreement undertook to suffer harm or run the risk of it.\nIn the case at bar there was a positive duty upon the defendants not to create or permit the continued existence of the particular source of danger and it was for them to prove affirmatively that the plaintiff had by express or implied agreement taken upon himself the risk of injury resulting from that breach of duty. That issue was squarely raised at the trial on the evidence and the appropriate question was put to the jury but remained unanswered because, presumably, of the very pardonable, if erroneous, assumption that the defence of volens was merged in that of contributory negligence which the jury negatived.\nIn these circumstances, having regard to the law of British Columbia, I would have been disposed to decide the issue of volens here, but I defer to the better opinion of Mr. Justice Duff, in whose conclusions I concur.\nDAVIES J;\u2014I will not dissent from the disposition of this appeal proposed by my colleagues, though I acquiescence in it with difficulty and doubt.\nI think it better, as there is to be a new trial on the question of volens, not to enter upon any discussion of the facts and circumstances out of which my doubts and difficulties arise as these facts will be submitted to a jury on the new trial.\nIt is not on the legal question that my difficulties arise, but on its application to the facts as proved, and the further fact that, while the jury did not pass upon the question of volens, it was open, under the law of British Columbia, as I understand it, for the appellate court to do so, and I find great difficulty in acceding to the reversal of the unanimous judgment of that court on the question.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The case of the Canada Foundry Co. v. Mitchell[5], seems to have been overlooked by the Court of Appeal. It seems to me that this court in that case decided, though not in terms yet in principle, that a verdict of the jury must be had in order to exonerate the employer by reason of the employee having voluntarily assumed the risk incident to his employment.\nThe facts in that case seem to me quite as plain as in this calling upon the employee to determine for himself the risk he ran.\nThe case, as it appeared in this court, is imperfectly reported. But in the report in 3 Ont. W.R. 907, the answers of the jury to questions 12 and 13 are reported as follows:\u2014\n12. That deceased knew and fully appreciated the risk he ran in doing the work with the appliances which were used;\n13. That he did not voluntarily incur the risk, but was working under protest. I have looked at the appeal case on file in this court to see if there was anything in that to explain the grounds of this answer to question No. 13, and am unable to find any personal protest on the part of the injured man and assume, therefore, that the answer was founded merely upon the inference that he had, rather than quit his employment, submitted to the risk he ran. It seems to have been merely an inference of a mental protest overborne by his circumstances. This court there felt bound by the verdict of the jury.\nI, therefore, conclude that it must be taken that the question is one for the jury in almost any conceivable case save the one of an express contract and one that must be submitted to the jury.\nIndeed, it seems to me that they are in such cases much more fitted to draw the correct inference than any tribunal of lawyers, where training leaves them in a measure unable to realize to the full just what the ordinary workman's appreciation of his condition and will must have been in any such given case, short of express contract evidencing it.\nI might distinguish this case from that which I cite by relying upon the length of time the workman had to ponder over and decide. I do not think such distinctions are productive of a sound administration of justice. And I think, moreover, that there is a gross fallacy in the argument founded on the length of time that the workman had served under the conditions in question.\nEach day he escaped from the danger he was running, instead of tending to enable him to appreciate the true nature of the risk he ran, lessened his appreciation of it.\nIt must be possible in such cases by an extreme care beyond the ordinary care used, and bound to be used, to escape injury. That extreme care he is likely to apply at first, but may become unable to continue it on every occasion.\nIt is the difference between this necessity for extreme care, which the law does not impose on him, and the ordinary care that the ordinary man will use in his daily work and he is bound to use, which he must appreciate yet may not be able fully to do so together with the consequential results.\nIn the last analysis it is the long average chance he takes and must appreciate that is to be determined and willed by him if the rule of law is to be adhered to that is involved in the doctrine.\nI think the jury must determine that as best they can according to the manifold circumstances arising in each case.\nThe jury's omission to answer the question was the fault of the respondent in not insisting upon an answer.\nFor the jury said they had answered the questions, yet counsel did not call attention to this omission.\nI do not think the verdict rendered can be treated as a general verdict which might have covered the case.\nI think, therefore, the appeal must be allowed and a new trial had, and costs as appear in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff.\nDUFF J.\u2014On further reflection I have come to the conclusion that the view of the Court of Appeal, which was the view I was inclined to take at the close of the argument, cannot be supported. For reasons I shall presently mention, I think there ought to be a new trial and, as in duty bound, I shall, therefore, refer to the facts only in so far as it may be absolutely necessary to do so in order to explain my reasons for differing from the Court of Appeal.\nThe maxim volenti non fit injuria indicates a principle of wide and various application in the English law. In relation to questions between employer and the employed, Lord Watson said in Smith v. Baker & Sons[6], at page 355, the maxim as now used generally imports\nthat the workman had either expressly or by implication agreed to take upon himself the risks attendant upon the particular work which he was engaged to perform and from which he has suffered injury. The question which has most frequently to be considered is not whether he voluntarily and rashly exposed himself to injury, but whether he agreed that, if injury should befall him, the risk was to be his and not his master's.\nAn instance of the application of the principle would be the doctrine of common employment if the exposition of that doctrine in Priestly v. Fowler[7] contains the true account of it.\nWhere the principle is resorted to for affording a way of escape from liability by an employer, who has not performed his prima facie duty to make reasonable provision for the safety of his employee, the question to be determined is a question of fact and the employer must show, to use the language of Lindley L.J. in Yarmouth v. France[8], quoted with approval by Lord Halsbury in Smith v. Baker & Sons[9], at page 337,\nas a fact that the workman agreed to incur a particular danger or voluntarily exposed himself to it. For the purpose of this appeal it may be taken as settled that there was negligent default for which the defendants would be responsible (unless the defences I am about to mention could be made good) in failing to provide a proper guard for the machinery in which the plaintiff received his injuries. The defence of common employment was pleaded, but not relied upon at the trial where it was not disputed that (in the event of the other defences specifically relied upon failing) appellants were answerable for the absence of such a guard. The defences to be considered are two. The first was that the operation of regulating the lubricator on the engine of which the plaintiff was in charge was one which could be efficiently performed at a time when the machinery in question was not in motion and, consequently, in perfect safety; and that, in performing this operation while the machinery was in motion, the plaintiff rashly and unnecessarily exposed himself to the danger of being injured as he was. This defence was really presented to the jury as contributory negligence and, doubtless, was dealt with by them as such. Without saying more, it seems to me to be quite indisputable that there was evidence upon which the jury might properly find for the plaintiff on this issue. The other substantial defence was that the plaintiff entered upon his employment and continued in it for two years with full knowledge of the danger arising from the absence of proper safeguards; and that his conduct in this respect was such as to preclude him from complaining of what otherwise might have been the actionable default of the defendants in not providing such safeguards.\nIt is to this defence that the Court of Appeal gave effect in dismissing the action. Before coming to the facts, first let me note again the exact legal ground upon which the defence rests.\nThe jury ought to be able to affirm that he, the employee, consented to the particular thing being done which would involve the risk and that he consented to take the risk upon himself. Lord Halsbury in Smith v. Baker[10], at page 338.\nThe question to be considered is: \"Whether he agreed that, if injury should befall him, the risk was to be his and not his master's?\" (Lord Watson, in Smith v. Baker & Sons[11].)\nIn Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[12], Lord Justice A. L. Smith says, at page 344, that the defence summarized by the maxim volenti non fit injuria is that the employee has\ncontracted or consented or undertaken to run the risk of the defect\nfrom which the accident arose. In the same case Lord Justice Romer says that in order to escape liability the master must show that the servant \"has taken upon himself the risk without precautions.\"\nThere was no evidence of express consent or agreement on the part of the plaintiff, and the question for the jury, therefore, was whether in all the circumstances the conduct of the plaintiff amounted to such consent. It was argued by Mr. Taylor that this is a question upon which the jury alone is competent to pass; in other words, that where consent is to be inferred from a course of conduct the employer must, in order to make good this defence, obtain a verdict from a jury or other primary tribunal of fact affirming it. I am quite unable to agree with this contention. There are, undoubtedly, expressions in text\u2014books and judgments which seem to give some countenance to it; but it appears to me to be entirely opposed to principle. By the law of British Columbia, the Court of Appeal in that province has jurisdiction to find upon a relevant question of fact (before it on appeal) in the absence of a finding by a jury or against such a finding where the evidence is of such a character that only one view can reasonably be taken of the effect of that evidence.\nThe power given by O. 58, r. 4,\nto draw inferences of fact * * * and to make such further or other order as the case may require,\nenables the Court of Appeal to give judgment for one of the parties in circumstances in which the court of first instance would be powerless, as, for instance, where (there being some evidence for the jury) the only course open to the trial judge would be to give effect to the verdict; while, in the Court of Appeal, judgment might be given for the defendant if the court is satisfied that it has all the evidence before it that could be obtained and no reasonable view of that evidence could justify a verdict for the plaintiff.\nThis jurisdiction is one which, of course, ought to be and, no doubt, always will be exercised both sparingly and cautiously; Paquin v. Beauclerk[13], at page 161; and Skeate v. Slaters[14].\nThe important thing to remember is that the question for the jury is whether there was, in fact, consent; while the question for the court is whether the acts from which it is argued consent ought to be inferred are reasonably capable of any other interpretation. In passing upon this last mentioned ques- tion judicial opinions given in relation to particular states of fact may be valuable as illustrations, but the question whether a particular conclusion is the only reasonably possible inference from a given state of facts is a question of law in the sense only that it is a question for the court; it is a question for the solution of which (in the very nature of things) the law itself can afford no rule of universal application.\nIt was argued by Mr. Hellmuth, on the authority of Clarke v. Holmes[15], and Woodley v. Metropolitan District Railway Co.[16], that, since, according to the plaintiff's own admissions, he entered upon his employment with a full appreciation of the danger occasioned by the lack of a guard and of the risk of injury arising therefrom and, as was contended, according to his own admission, with notice that his employers would not correct the defect, the appellant must be taken to have consented to his assumption of the risk as a term of his employment. I do not think it is necessary to examine the cases referred to minutely. When those cases were decided the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria had not undergone the elaborate examination to which it was afterwards subjected by the Law Lords in Smith v. Baker & Sons[17], and I think that in so far as any argument founded upon the earlier cases is inconsistent with the doctrine laid down in Smith v. Baker & Sons[18], as explained in Williams v. Birmingham Battery Metal Co.[19], and in Canada Foundry Co. v. Mitchell[20], that argument ought to be rejected. In Williams' Case[21], it is expressly stated by Romer L.J., at page 345, that the circumstance that the servant has entered: into or continued in his employment with knowledge of the risk and of the absence of precautions is important, but not necessarily conclusive against him; and that statement of the law was adopted by this court in Canada Foundry Co. v. Mitchell[22].\nWhether the circumstances in any particular case amount to consent must depend upon the facts of that particular case looked at as a whole; and, considering the facts of this case as a whole, I cannot agree that the construction of them adopted by the Court of Appeal is the only construction they will reasonably bear.\nI think, however, the respondents are entitled to a new trial on the ground that their plea volenti non fit injuria was not passed upon by the jury.\nAs to costs the appellant should have the costs of the appeal to this court; and, with respect to the costs of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, the respondents are entitled to the costs of a successful motion for a new trial on the ground just mentioned, while the appellant is entitled to the costs attributable solely to the controversy raised by the respondents contention in the Court of Appeal that the action ought to be dismissed on the ground that the issue in question was conclusively determined in their favour by the evidence. The costs of the abortive trial should abide the event of the new trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversing the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing this action on the ground that the plaintiff was volens, that is, that he had undertaken to assume the risk of the defect in the defendants' machinery which was the cause of his being injured.\nAt the trial the jury found the defendants guilty of negligence in not having had a guard placed on the gear of the steam-shovel on which the plaintiff worked, and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury; and they assessed the damages at $5,000.\nTo the fourth question, put at the instance of counsel for the defendants,\nDid the plaintiff know and appreciate the risk and danger and did he voluntarily encounter them?\nthe jury did not give an answer.\nThe plaintiff had been working for five years and four months on the steamshovel on which he was injured, for the first three years in a subordinate capacity, and for the last two years and four months as engineer in charge. He says the machine was always in the same condition, and that his predecessor had asked that the gear be guarded, but that nothing was done. The following questions and answers are taken from the plaintiff's evidence.\nQ. You always understood the importance of avoiding that gear?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Well, what happened this time that you did not avoid it?\nA. Well, I was avoiding the clearance, I thought I was avoiding it; I am sure I was avoiding it. I knew how dangerous it was.\nContributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff was negatived by the jury, and their finding on that issue cannot be successfully attacked.\nFor the plaintiff it is urged that upon the findings as we have them he is entitled to judgment, notwithstanding the failure of the jury to answer the fourth question. For the defendants it is contended that upon the plaintiff's admission that he knew and appreciated the risk from the absence of the gear, the only reasonable inference is that he was volens and that the action should, therefore, be dismissed.\nHad the defence of volens not been fought out at the trial\u2014 had the issue upon it not been clearly presented to the jury, I think the plaintiff's contention should have prevailed and the judgment in his favour should have been restored. But that issue was clearly presented at the trial and formed the subject of a specific question. It is impossible to say that the jury intended to deal with it either when they negatived contributory negligence or when they found negligence on the part of the defendants. Neither is it possible to maintain that the verdict should be taken to be a \"general verdict\" for the plaintiff. There is no finding upon the issue of volens. Without undertaking the functions of the jury we cannot make such a finding. I am, therefore, of opinion that, not withstanding the power conferred on the Court of Appeal for British Columbia to supplement the findings of a jury, which we may exercise, judgment should not be entered for the plaintiff.\nOn the other hand, although it is clear that the plaintiff knew of the defect and, perhaps, also sufficiently clear that he fully appreciated the danger to which it exposed him, mere knowledge and appreciation of the danger does not conclusively establish that he contracted or consented or undertook to run the risk and to exonerate his employer from liability for any injury it might cause. As Lord Watson said, in Smith v. Baker & Sons[23]:\u2014 When, as is most commonly the case, his acceptance or non\u2014acceptance of the risk is left to implication, the workman cannot reasonably be held to have undertaken it unless he knew of its existence and appreciated or had the means of appreciating its danger. But, assuming he did so, I am unable to accede to the suggestion that the mere fact of his continuing in his work with such knowledge and appreciation will in every ease imply his acceptance.\nAs put by Lord Halsbury:\u2014\nIn order to defeat a plaintiff's right by the application of the maxim relied on, who would otherwise be entitled to recover, the jury ought to be able to affirm that he consented to take the risk upon himself.\nThe same view is expressed by Romer L.J. in Williams v. The Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[24]:\nThe circumstance that the servant has entered into or continued in his employment with knowledge of the risk and absence of precaution is important, but not necessarily conclusive against him;\nand, as put by A. L. Smith L.J. in the same case:\u2014\nthat the mere knowledge of the risk does not necessarily involve consent to undertake the risk has now, beyond question, been settled by the House of Lords.\nThese authorities make it clear that, assuming the plaintiff's knowledge and appreciation of the risk which he incurred to have been fully established, it was still open for a jury to consider whether, having regard to the \"nature of the risk and the workman's connection with it\" and the other circumstances of this case, it should be inferred that he \"contracted or consented or undertook to run that risk\" and to exonerate his employer from liability in connection with it.\nThe fourth question as propounded to the jury in the present case is open to some criticism as to its form. But, in the absence of an answer to it, the burden of obtaining which was upon the defendants, the judgment dismissing the action cannot be maintained. The jury having failed to determine a vital issue, with which it was within their province to deal, the only course open is to order a new trial.\nInasmuch as the defendants have come here to sustain the judgment dismissing the action, the plaintiff's appeal should be allowed with costs. The costs in the Court of Appeal and of the abortive trial should be dealt with as indicated by my brother Duff.\nBRODEUR J. agreed with Duff J.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Grant.

Section 4 of the \"Partnership Act,\" R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 175, provides rules for determining partnership and, by sub\u2014secs. 2 and 3, declares that the sharing of gross profits does not, of itself, create a partnership, that the receipt of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence of a partnership, that the receipt of such share or of a payment varying with the profits does not, of itself, make the person receiving the same a partner, and that a contract to remunerate a servant by a share of the profits does not, of itself, make him a partner. The plaintiff, an employee of the defendant, by the terms of his engagement was to receive as remuneration for his services a one-half share of the profits of defendant's business and conversations took place regarding an arrangement whereby plaintiff might have a \"share in the business,\" but no definite agreement was made. Plaintiff, claiming to have become a partner, wrote a letter to defendant asserting that he had an undivided interest in the business and asking him to execute articles of partnership. Defendant replied to this letter in an evasive and temporarizing manner and the business continued to be conducted without any change. Later on, the defendant served upon the plaintiff a notice of dissolution of partnership and, in the notice as well as in the correspondence, made use of the word \"partnership\" in referring to the relations between them. Held, reversing the judgment appealed from (18 B.C. Rep. 230) that, under the statutes referred to, the onus was upon the plaintiff to show that he had been admitted as a partner in the business in the strict legal sense and that the indefinite use of the term \"partnership\" in the correspondence and notice did not, in the circumstances, amount to evidence of an agreement that there should be a partnership.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial[2], and maintaining the plaintiff's action.\nThe plaintiff's action sought a declaration of partnership, in the circumstances stated in the head-note. The learned trial judge held, on the evidence, that, as a matter of fact, the defendant had not agreed to admit the plaintiff as a partner in his business and dismissed the action with costs. By the judgment appealed from the action was maintained; it was held that the defendant's correspondence and the notice of dissolution amounted to an admission of an existing partnership, and the usual accounts and inquiries were directed.\nLafleur K.C. and R. M. MacDonald for the appellant. We submit that the judgment of the learned trial judge was right, and that no agreement constituting a partnership had ever been arrived at between the parties. The respondent submitted terms in the document he had prepared, but they were never assented to, and the appellant plainly stated that he would not assent to them. On the terms proposed by respondent, one-half of the capital and assets which the appellant had in the business would have been handed over to the respondent, who never put a dollar of capital into the business. The verbal and only agreement between the parties was that the respondent was to receive remuneration by percentage of profits. The terms of any further arrangement were left to future settlement; there can be no completed vinculum juris until terms have been agreed upon. Blackwoods, Ltd. v. Canadian Northern Rway. Co.[3], at page 103.\nThe terms of an alleged agreement must be certain for the court must know what it is to enforce: Taylor v. Brewer[4]; Pearce v. Watts[5]. A final acceptance of terms must be distinguished from a preliminary negotiation as the basis for a formal agreement which alone is to be binding. Reference to a proposed formal document is not conclusive: Rossiter v. Miller[6] ; Winn v. Bull[7]. To found estoppel, a representation must be of an existing fact, not of a mere intention: 13 Halsbury, \"Laws of England,\" p. 377. Such a representation must be clean and unambiguous: 13 Halsbury, \"Laws of England,\" p. 379. Such representation must not be induced by the party complaining: 13 Halsbury, \"Laws of England,\" p. 381. It is necessary to estoppel by representation that, in acting upon it, the party to whom it was made should have altered his position to his prejudice: 13 Halsbury, \"Laws of England,\" pp. 383, 384.\nAs respondent was an employee remunerated by an interest in the profits, the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the \"Master and Servant Act,\" R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 153, are applicable, and his arrangement is to be deemed to be within the provisions of the Act, unless \"this may otherwise be inferred.\"\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondent. The evidence shows that during 1910 it was definitely arranged that partnership should be entered into for 1911 and that a definite partnership agreement was entered into in 1911, which is sustained by the appellant's actions and conduct; by the evidence and by all the surrounding circumstances; also by statements which the appellant had prepared at the time, which statements would be inconsistent with any other condition.\nThe evidence concerning the months of June to September, 1912, contained in the letters of the appellant, his telegrams, his notice of dissolution of partnership given under the \"Partnership Act,\" and his admission to the manager of the Seattle agency of Libby, MacNeill & Libby, together with the evidence of the respondent, shows conclusively that a partnership existed from January 1st, 1911. The evidence on discovery of the appellant is consistent only with the existence of a partnership. See \"Partnership Act,\" ch. 175, R.S.B.C. 1911, sec. 4.\nThe evidence, moreover, is sufficient to meet the requirements of the \"Master and Servant Act,\" R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 153, sec. 3; it is explicit and direct and conclusively supports the partnership arrangement.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Both parties agree that, previous to 1911, they stood towards one another in the relation of master and servant. It is also admitted that, at the end of 1910, a new agreement was made applicable to the coming year. The dispute is as to the terms and legal effect of that agreement. The appellant says that it was made merely for the purpose of increasing the share in the profits which the respondent had been receiving out of the business as his remuneration for services rendered, that is to say, it was merely intended to modify the then existing agreement which was, undoubtedly, one of profit-sharing. On the other hand, the respondent submits that the relation of master and servant ceased at the end of 1910, and that he then became a partner in the business on the basis of a half-interest in the profits and that, with respect to the capital, stock-in-trade, etc., the appellant became a creditor of the new firm. The burden of proof was on the plaintiff and I do not think that he has satisfied it. Where there is doubt the conduct of the parties at the time is the best evidence of their intentions; especially when the version of the respondent involves a fundamental change in the relations of the parties.\nIn fact, no change was made in the management of the business or in the relations of the parties towards one another or towards their clerks; no new books of account were opened; the bank account was kept in the same way; cheques, drafts and notes were signed in the old name by the respondent as attorney and not as a partner. In fact, the conduct of the parties at the time corroborates entirely the appellant's position.\nI will add nothing to what my brother Duff says as to the two letters relied upon in the Court of Appeal. He conclusively establishes that, read in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, their probative effect is of little value. Neither party was very disingenuous and, in that respect, honours are easy between them.\nI would maintain the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think that the learned trial judge correctly interpreted the language and conduct of these parties and defined their relations founded thereupon and applied the appropriate remedy for such relief as respondent was and is entitled to.\nWith great respect, I do not think the correspondence relied upon by the Court of Appeal can, when read in light of the acts of the parties both before and after the same, justify the variation of the trial judgment.\nThe word \"partnership\" is capable of many meanings and we ought not to fix upon it, as used by these parties, the one legal technical meaning it may bear when obviously the parties have not reached that stage in their protracted negotiations, where such technical meaning would represent their understanding.\nThe appeal should be allowed here and below, and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014It is a little important in considering this appeal to note what the foundation of the respondent's claim exactly is. The claim is based upon an oral contract of partnership alleged to have been made between the appellant and the respondent in the latter part of the year 1910 under which, accord- ing to the respondent, the two parties actually carried on business under the name of H. Donkin & Co. from the 1st of January, 1911, until the 21st of September, 1912. The learned trial judge found that no such partnership existed. His judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal, which held that certain correspondence which passed between the parties in January and February, 1912, contained an admission by the appellant of the existence of the partnership alleged by the respondent of such weight as to dispense with the necessity of considering the oral evidence upon which the judgment of the learned trial judge was founded. Reading this correspondence in light of the conduct of the parties, especially the conduct of the respondents, I am not able to agree with the conclusion at which the Court of Appeal arrived touching the effect of it, and I think, after an examination of the evidence as a whole, that there is no sufficient ground for disturbing the findings of the learned trial judge, but that, on the other hand, the evidence preponderates in favour of his view.\nPrior to the year 1910, the respondent had been for some years in the employ of the appellant, who had been carrying on business in Vancouver under the name of H. Donkin & Co. The respondent was first remunerated by a salary alone, but later received a share of the profits as well. The agreement, as he now alleges, made in 1910, was to the effect that a partnership was formed between himself and the appellant to take over the business, including all the assets of H. Donkin & Co., and carry on that business during the year 1911 without change in the firm name, the partners sharing the profits equally. There was, he says, a valuation of the assets of H. Donkin & Co., and it was a part of the arrangement that the appellant was to be paid from these assets according to this valuation. The appellant denies that any agreement for partnership was entered into. He admits that a fresh agreement was made in 1910; he says it was limited to a single point, viz., that, beginning with the 1st of January, 1911, the appellant should receive half the net profits of the business as his remuneration. Disher's status as an employee was, he says, to remain unchanged.\nThere is a good deal in the evidence, no doubt, to show, and I think it is probable, that Disher proposed to the appellant that he should be admitted as a partner in the strict sense, that is to say, that he should cease to be an employee and become joint owner of the business with Donkin. I think it is also likely that Donkin did not expect to retain Disher permanently in association with him without ultimately effecting some re-adjustment of their relations by which Disher should become entitled to a proprietary interest in the business. There is no doubt that the question of partnership in this sense was considered by Donkin. He appears, however, to have found it very difficult to overcome his objection (a very substantial one in the circumstances) that, Disher being engaged extensively in speculations, the suggested arrangement might expose the business to disorganization at the instance of Disher's creditors in the event of his speculations proving unfortunate. He had under consideration apparently an alternative plan of incorporating a company to take over the business.\nThe learned trial judge, as I have already said, ac\u2014 cepted the appellant's evidence upon these points. The correspondence which influenced the judgment of the Court of Appeal, does not appear to me to be inconsistent with the view of the learned trial judge that Donkin had not assented to Disher's proposal that he should be admitted to the status of a partner. On the contrary Donkin's letter of the 12th of February, upon which the learned Chief Justice based his conclusion, appears to me to fit in with the theory that Donkin had not yielded to Disher's efforts to induce him to make the proposed change better than with the alternative theory that more than a year before Disher had become owner of a half\u2014interest in the business and that, during the intervening period, they had been carrying on that business together as partners. On the latter hypothesis there are many things in Donkin's letter which would be both unmeaning and foolish. Then if we consider the conduct of Disher himself, it does not appear to be that of a person who had been recognized as having the status of a partner in this concern for more than a year. If his situation had been such as he describes, he would not, I think, have waited until Donkin had actually left Vancouver with the expectation of being absent several months before insisting that he should be recognized as a partner in the firm's dealings with their bankers or that the terms of the partnership should be definitely reduced to writing. Donkin's letter of the 12th of February ought to have apprised him of the fact that Donkin was not recognizing him as co-proprietor of the business and yet there is no answer to that letter and, on Donkin's return to Vancouver, not a word is addressed to him by Disher on the subject. One ought, perhaps, to note the use of the word \"partnership\" in Donkin's letter of the 12th of February. I entirely agree with the learned trial judge that the term \"partnership\" is often loosely used as descriptive of such arrangements as that which Donkin admits he had with Disher. But the letter appears to me to make it abundantly clear that, in using the term, Donkin had no idea that he was employing a word which implied co-proprietorship. I see no reason to disagree with the view of the learned trial judge that Disher was not deceived by the use of this phraseology. It is perhaps needless to refer to the point taken, not very seriously I thought, by Mr. Taylor that by force of the provisions of the British Columbia \"Partnership Act,\" section 4, chapter 175,\n(1911) R.S.B.C., the arrangement with regard to profits is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the existence of partnership. These provisions of the \"Partnership Act\" must be read with section 3, chapter 153, R.S.B.C. (1911), \"Master and Servant Act,\" which plainly enacts that, in the circumstances existing in this case, the onus rests upon the employee who alleges that he has been admitted as a partner in the strict sense.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Upon conflicting evidence the learned trial judge found that the arrangement made between the parties to this action, about the end of the year 1910, was not a partnership, but an agreement whereby the plaintiff, while remaining an employee of the defendant, should for the future be entitled to receive, as his remuneration, a 50% share in the profits of the defendant's business instead of the salary of $1,200 a year and a 10% share of the profits, which he had theretofore been paid. That conclusion was reversed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal solely on the ground that a letter written by the defendant, in reply to a letter sent him by the plaintiff asserting that he \"had an undivided half-interest\" and asking the defendant to execute partnership articles, affords convincing evidence of \"a partnership such as the plaintiff alleges,\" because, instead of writing a \"frank, fair letter\" denying that \"there was any partnership,\" the defendant wrote a \"temporizing\" and \"indefinite\" reply. Far from being able to find in the letter so much relied upon conclusive proof of the partnership alleged by the plaintiff, giving due weight to the circumstances under which it was written, I am, with respect, of opinion that it affords no evidence of any real value against the defendant. He was then en route to the Orient on a trip of several months' duration. He had already travelled from Vancouver to Montreal. He had left the care of his business in the hands of the plaintiff, who had a comprehensive power of attorney. It was of vital importance to him at that moment that the plaintiff should not be antagonized, as he probably would have been, by such a distinct and emphatic repudiation of his partnership pretensions as the learned appellate judges seem to have thought it was the defendant's paramount duty to have made.\nThe arrangement now claimed by the plaintiff is in itself improbable. That provided for in the document which he had prepared and to which he sought to procure the defendant's signature on the eve of his departure differed very materially from what he now asserts to have been the agreement. That document provided for an arrangement still more improbable. The conduct of the plaintiff in obtaining, in January, 1912, a written opinion from his own solicitors as to the liability of one partner and his share in the partnership property for the debts of the other partner, and procuring a confirmation of that opinion from the defendant's solicitors for the purpose of satisfying the defendant is scarcely consistent with their having been a concluded agreement for partnership in December, 1910, or January, 1911, as he now asserts. The fact that no partnership books or accounts were opened, although the plaintiff claims that the partnership was in operation for over a year, is also significant. The sending by the defendant to the plaintiff contemporaneously of two notices, one terminating the partnership, the other dismissing the plaintiff as an employee, was merely a precautionary measure and affords no evidence for or against the pretensions of either party. Apart from the letter of the defendant the case depends upon a weighing of conflicting oral testimony in the light of the circumstances. The learned trial judge would appear to have thought the defendant a more credible and reliable witness than the plaintiff and did not find in the rest of the evidence enough to turn the scale in the plaintiff's favour.\nWe are in precisely the same position as the learned judges of the Court of Appeal were to determine what inferences should be drawn from what the defendant wrote. I gather from their opinions that, but for this letter, they would not have differed from the conclusion reached by Morrison J. on the oral testimony. It is, therefore, with less than usual reluctance that I would reverse the judgment in appeal and restore that of the trial judge, with which on the whole case I agree. The appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014We have to decide whether there was a partnership between the parties; or whether their relations were those of master and servant. The plaintiff, respondent, claims that he was a partner and the appellant on the contrary says that the respondent was entitled to a share in the profits of his business, and that he was not a partner in the ordinary sense of the word.\nFor some years previous to the 1st of January, 1911, the respondent was in the appellant's employ as salesman. At first his services were paid on straight salary, but later he got also a share of 10% and of 20% in the profits of the business. It was later on agreed that from the 1st of January, 1911, he would get 50% of the profits.\nThe appellant, who was doing business under the firm name of H. Donkin & Co., as a commission agent, had not a very large capital invested in his trade and he did not require also much money to run his affairs; but in order that the business should become the property of the two parties it was necessary that the capital invested should be determined and that the new partner should either acquire a share of that capital or should invest a similar amount or that some other agreement should be made to put them both on the same footing.\nEven in assuming that the agreement reached by the parties was in the nature of a partnership, it was necessary that there should be an agreement as to the contribution of each of them to the partnership. The respondent stated under oath that no contribution was to be put in by him, but that the capital then invested in the business by the appellant should stay and that he would be creditor for the amount that was to be ascertained as being the capital invested. No figure, however, is agreed upon. In the course of the year 1912, the respondent had a partnership agreement prepared by his solicitors and the capital that was fixed at $40,000 was declared to belong to the two alleged partners. It was never agreed as to what should be done with regard to the contribution of each party and specially as to the disposal of the capital invested in the firm business of the respondent.\nBut the appellant denies entirely the respondent's statement that they reached an agreement as to a contract of partnership. Their minds never met as to the contribution and as to the amount thereof and how it would be. The evidence is conflicting on those points and the story as given by the appellant was accepted by the trial judge.\nIt is true that in some letters and another document the appellant used the word \"partnership\" to qualify their relations. But he had in his mind the share profit arrangement agreed upon and he never pretended to be sure that such a word would cover their agreement or not. We should take the agreement as it has been proved and established and the evidence does disclose simply a profit-sharing arrangement that the appellant is willing to carry out.\nThe \"Master and Servant Act,\" R.S.B.C. (1911), ch. 153, enacts in sections 3 and 4 the following:\u2014\nIt shall be lawful in any trade, calling, business, or employment for an agreement to be entered into between the workman, servant, or other person employed and the master or employer, by which agreement a defined share in the annual or other net profits or pro- ceeds of the trade or business carried on by such master or employer may be allotted and paid to such workman, servant or person employed, in lieu of or in addition to his salary, wages or other remuneration; and such agreement shall not create any relation in the nature of a partnership, or any rights or liabilities of co-partners, any rule of law to the contrary notwithstanding; and any person in whose favour such agreement is made shall have no right to examine into the accounts, or interfere in any way in the management or concerns of the trade, calling or business in which he is employed under the said agreement or otherwise; and any periodical or other statement or return by the employer of the net profits or proceeds of the said trade, calling, business or employment on which he declares and appropriates the share of profits payable under the said agreement shall be final and conclusive between the parties thereto, and all persons claiming under them respectively, and shall not be impeachable upon any ground whatever.\nEvery agreement of the nature mentioned in the last preceding section shall be deemed to be within the provisions of this Act unless it purports to be excepted therefrom, or this may otherwise be inferred.\nThere is then, under the provisions of those sections, a presumption that an employee who receives as remuneration a share in the profits is not a partner. The relations of partners in such a case are not to be inferred from the fact that the employee gets such a remuneration. Of course, that presumption can be destroyed if a formal agreement to the contrary is proved. But in this case there never was such an agreement. That is the finding of the trial judge and we should accept it.\nFor those reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacNeill, Bird, MacDonald & Darling.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\n[1] 18 B.C.

George (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1913: November 3, 4, 10.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nSale of lands\u2014Agreement to pay commission\u2014Named price\u2014Introduction by agent\u2014General retainer\u2014Sale at lower price\u2014Right of action\u2014Alberta statute, 6 Edw. VII., c. 27, s. 1. The Alberta statute, 6 Edw. VII. ch. 27, respecting sales of real estate, denies recovery by action, for services rendered in connection with such sales by way of commission or otherwise, unless upon a memorandum in writing signed by or on behalf of the person to be charged. In a letter to the plaintiff, signed by the defendant, the latter agreed to sell a hotel for $40,000 and added, \"I will pay you 5% commission on purchase price.\" Defendant subsequently, sold the property to a purchaser introduced by the plaintiff for $34,000.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (10 D.L.R. 498; 4 West. W.R. 83), that \"purchase price,\" as used in the letter, had reference to any price for which a sale might be made, and that, construed in connection with the conduct of the parties, the memorandum was sufficient, under the statute, to entitle the plaintiff to recover a commission at the rate mentioned for his services in regard to the sale made at the reduced price to the purchaser introduced by him. Toulmin v. Millar (58 L.T. 96), and Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries ([1910] A.C. 614), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Beck J., at the trial[2], maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs. The circumstances of the case are sufficiently set out in the head-note.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. and J. Leslie Jennison K.C. for the appellant.\nMatthew Wilson K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion in this case that, on the facts in evidence, the trial judge was fully justified in the conclusion that the purchaser was found by George and that the appellants availed themselves of his services in that regard and also that the contract as to the commission of 5% subsisted up to the time the bargain was finally closed.\nUnder the terms of the agreement the respondent was entitled to his commission on the purchase price which the vendor ultimately agreed to accept. The sum of $40,000 is mentioned, as Lord Watson says in the case of Toulmin v. Millar[3], merely as a basis of negotiations.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The language of the agreement is somewhat ambiguous but, in view of the conduct of the parties under it, I think the construction put upon the words \"purchase price\" as meaning the actual price or sum at which the property was sold, one which can fairly be accepted as that within the contemplation of both parties when the memorandum was signed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the document signed by the appellant and relied upon by the respondent was not a mere option to him to buy or sell at only $40,000, but a general retainer enlisting his services to sell the property in question for either said sum or such other sum as appellant accepted.\nIt is capable of such construction and of being read as the court of appeal has read it.\nSuch doubt as we might possibly have from its ambiguity has been settled by the conduct of the parties.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014Interpreting the memorandum in question by the light of the subsequent conduct of the parties (which one is entitled to do, because it is impossible to say that the memorandum is capable of only one necessarily exclusive construction) I think the respondent's agency was a general agency within the meaning of Lord Watson's language in Toulmin v. Millar[4], and that he is, consequently, entitled to recover. See Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[5], at page 626.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The trial judge expressly accepted the evidence of the plaintiff. On his evidence he found that the plaintiff had introduced the purchaser and brought about the sale. Those findings of fact are sufficiently supported.\nOn the interpretation of the contract I agree with the courts, of Alberta.\nThe plaintiff earned his commission and he had a sufficient memorandum of his contract to meet the requirements of the Alberta statute.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta confirming unanimously the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe version of the facts, as given by the plaintiff, respondent, having been accepted by the two courts below, it would be contrary to the jurisprudence of this court to find differently.\nThe appellant had given the respondent a letter that he would sell his property for $40,000, and had undertaken in that letter to pay him \"5% commission on purchase price.\"\nThe respondent found a purchaser, put him in communication with the appellant, and the result was that the property was sold for $34,000. He is now suing for his commission on that sale. The appellant contends that he was bound to the payment of a commission on a sale of $40,000 and that, as no sale at that price was made he owes nothing.\nIt is to be noted that the agreement provided for a commission not on the $40,000, but on the purchase price. The introduction of a purchaser who was willing to enter into negotiations and who closed later with the appellant entitled the plaintiff to recover. The obligation of the plaintiff was not to find a purchaser at a certain figure; but he was entitled to a commission on the purchase price and this case is within the words of Lord Watson, in the House of Lords, in the case of Toulmin v. Millar[6], where he says:\u2014 When a proprietor with a view of selling his estate goes to an agent and requests him to find a purchaser, naming, at the same time, the sum which he is willing to accept, that will constitute a general employment; and should the estate be eventually sold to a purchaser introduced by the agent, the latter will be entitled to his commission, although the price paid should be less than the sum named at the time the employment was given. The mention of a specific sum prevents the agent from selling for a lower price without the consent of his employer; but it is given merely as the basis of future negotiations, leaving the actual price to be settled in the course of those negotiations.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 10 D.L.R. 498; 4 West.

N. Tilley for the appellants.\nCohen for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in an action for damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff while travelling as a passenger in a tramcar car of the defendants. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is based upon the allegation that her injuries were the consequences of a fall caused by the negligence of the motorman or conductor of the car which was started suddenly after having been brought to a stop to enable her to get off.\nThe plaintiff and one Winkler are the only witnesses who testify to the occurrence. At the close of the evidence for the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant company submitted there was no evidence of negligence. It appears that the plaintiff rang the bell as a signal for the car to stop at the corner of Bushnell street. Having failed, presumably, to attract the attention of the conductor or motorman, the car proceeded at high speed in the direction of Gunnell street when the plaintiff rang the bell a second time to manifest her desire to alight at that street. As the car was slowing down, plaintiff left her seat and moved in the direction of the door. When she reached that place the car was stopped; she says,\nmy right foot I put on the first step and after that I do not remember anything.\nThe witness Winkler deposed that he heard a woman\u2019s scream and ran to the scene of the accident, where he found the plaintiff lying on the road covered with blood and apparently dead. The car in which the plaintiff had been a passenger was seen to be in motion proceeding on its journey a very short distance ahead.\nThe question is: In these facts was there evidence enough of an apparent cause to leave the case for the decision of the jury?\nThe point is not free from difficulty, but I am of opinion that, in the circumstances, the trial judge was justified in leaving it to the jury to say whether the company being under a duty to stop the car in answer to her signal for a sufficient time to allow the plaintiff to alight, the inference of negligence should be drawn.\nIt is to be assumed that if proper care is used by the company a passenger may alight in safety from a tram-car, and, in the circumstances of this case, there is a rule of evidence which calls upon the carrier in the first instance to exonerate itself by negativing negligence.\nIf there was doubt on the evidence of the plaintiff and Winkler, the conduct of the officials of the company at the time of the accident may have served to turn the scale. The plaintiff was undoubtedly a passenger on the car and in attempting to alight the accident occurred, and there is further evidence in the record. The rules of the company required that in cases of accidents the motorman and conductor should render assistance and make a report of the occurrence. They did neither, and the reasonable presumption is that their omission in that respect was due to the fact that the accident must have happened without their knowledge. The jury would be justified in taking this circumstance into account when considering the probabilities of plaintiff\u2019s theory that she was thrown from the step by a violent jerk when the car was started suddenly by the officials in ignorance of the position in which she then was.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The question we have to determine is whether there was evidence to justify the findings of the jury with respect to the fact that the car had stopped when the plaintiff attempted to alight from it and had negligently started again and thrown her to the ground before she had alighted.\nOn the first point we have the positive evidence of the plaintiff that the car had stopped, with an apparently clear and connected statement of the circumstances leading up to the stoppage. The only possible doubt as to the correctness of her statements arises from the rather uncertain and doubtful evidence of the only other witness called who speaks of the fact of the stoppage of the car. The jury surely had the right to accept the clear and unqualified statement of Mrs. Schwartz on the point.\nThen, as to the finding of the negligent starting of the car having been the cause of her falling or being thrown to the pavement, Mrs. Schwartz frankly states that the shock she received from her fall completely destroyed or benumbed her memory of the facts immediately connected with her falling and that she could recall nothing which happened from the moment she attempted to step from the car till after her recovery from the shock caused by her fall to the pavement.\nThe company, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, moved for a nonsuit and that being refused did not call any witnesses. The question is whether, in the absence of direct evidence on this point of negligence, there should have been a nonsuit, or whether it was open to the jury to draw as a fair and reasonable inference from such facts as had been proved that the car had stopped and had started negligently, causing the plaintiff\u2019s fall.\nThere were decisions given by this court before that of the Judicial Committee in the case of McArthur v. The Dominion Cartridge Company[2], to the effect that positive evidence of specific negligence causing the injuries complained of must toe given to enable an injured person to recover damages. Since that decision, however, this court has followed the rule or principle there laid down, namely, that where the circumstances are such that positive and direct evidence on specific negligence cannot be given it is open to a jury, if the facts as proved are sufficient, to find such negligence as a fair reasonable inference from those facts. It was upon that rule we decided the case of The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer[3], and many cases since then.\nNow, in the case before us, what have we had proved? First, the high speed at which the car was moving and its stoppage after the second signal from the plaintiff to permit her to alight. Secondly, the passenger\u2019s progress during the slowing-down of the car towards the door of exit and, on the stoppage, her attempt to step to the ground, in which attempt she either fell from, as is suggested by the appellants, a sudden attack of vertigo, or, as found by the jury, was thrown down by the sudden, negligent starting of the car. There was no evidence whatever of any negligence on the passenger\u2019s part or facts proved from which a fair inference of negligence could be drawn. Thirdly, the fact that the car rapidly moved on its way after stopping without those controlling it presumably having knowledge of the accident.\nIt is inconceivable that with such knowledge the car should have been allowed to proceed and no aid or assistance tendered the injured passenger left lying on or alongside of the car track. The presumption of ignorance of the accident on the part of the car-men is overwhelming; especially when considered in light of the fact that another car was following very close after them. They probably thought the passenger had safely alighted.\nUnder those circumstances, and without any other suggested possible inference than that the violent fall to the pavement might have been caused by a sudden attack of vertigo, I have no difficulty in concluding that the finding of the jury has a preponderating weight in its favour, because it is the more fair and reasonable inference from the proved facts. The other suggested inferences seem to me rather to be classed as conjectures than fair inferences.\nA jury cannot, of course, select as between equally probable and fair inferences one which they prefer. It is essential that their finding should not only be fair and reasonable, but that it should be of preponderating weight over other possible inferences.\nIdington J,\u2014This appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think there is evidence in support of the verdict. It is no part of my duty to say whether I think it is right or not.\nAnglin J.\u2014The sole question raised upon this appeal is whether there was evidence sufficient to warrant the finding of the jury that the plaintiff fell from the step of the defendants\u2019 car, as she was in the course of alighting from it at a proper stopping place and, while it was stationary, and their inference that this was due to the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants in improperly starting the car before the plaintiff had reached the ground. From the plaintiff herself we have direct evidence that the car had stopped (the jury was entitled to disregard the evidence given by Winkler, if it is really in conflict with that of the plaintiff on this point), that she was in course of alighting and had one foot on the first step and the other either on the platform or in the air on its way to the second step. At that point her knowledge of what occurred ceased. That she fell violently to the ground is undisputed. That the company\u2019s servants in charge of the car from which she fell were ignorant of her fall is an irresistible inference from the fact that they proceeded on their way leaving her lying seriously injured on the ground, unless we are to assume on their part a callousness and disregard of the company\u2019s rules almost incredible. A moment or two later she is found lying dangerously near the track, so much so that the conductor of a following car moved her body out of the way. According to her evidence the plaintiff was proceeding to alight with care. There is no evidence to warrant any suggestion of vertigo, fainting, tripping or being run down by a passing vehicle as the cause of her fall and injuries. The inference that her fall was caused, as the jury have found, is not only fair and reasonable; it seems to be the most probable inference that could be drawn from all the facts. The negligence involved in starting a car from which a passenger is properly alighting before ascertaining that she has reached the ground is indisputable. The appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The only question is whether the jury could from the facts established infer that the street railway company is guilty of negligence.\nThe plaintiff, respondent, Mrs. Schwartz, was alighting from a street car of the company defendant. She states in her evidence that she rang the bell to stop the car; that the car stopped, and that she started to alight from the car, and she states, moreover, that from that moment until some days afterwards when she found herself on a hospital bed with serious injuries as a result of her fall oh the street, she was unconscious.\nThe jury returned a verdict that the employees caused the car to start-when the plaintiff was proceeding to alight.\nThe company did not find it advisable to bring those employees to testify that they had given to that lady all the time necessary to safely alight.\nThat lady fell on account of her fainting or on account of the starting of the car before she alighted. The accident is necessarily due to one of those circumstances. The jury could draw the inferences from all the circumstances of the case that the company was negligent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Moran, Anderson & Guy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Crichton, McClure & Cohen.\n[1] 23 Man.

Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 22 K.B. 97) reversed.\nOwing to suspicions aroused by the exposure of the insolvent\u2019s methods of business, a creditor who had deposited money with him for investment in anticipation of obtaining large profits through his operations on the stock market by urgent demands secured re-payment of the sums so deposited together with a large amount of alleged profits on the day preceding that on which the insolvent absconded.\nHeld, that, as the creditor must be deemed to have had knowledge of the insolvent circumstances of the debtor at the time of the payment, the curator to the abandoned estate of the insolvent, was entitled to recover back the amount so paid, under the provisions of article 1036 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada.\nThe judgment appealed from (Q.R. 22 K.B. 97) in its result affirming the judgment at the trial (Q.R. 41 S.C. 155) was reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Greenshields J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiffs, who are the curators appointed to the abandoned estate of one Charles D. Sheldon, an insolvent, brought the action to recover back, as part of the insolvent\u2019s estate, the sum of $13,743, which had been paid by the insolvent to the defendant on the day previous to that on which he absconded. Sheldon had carried on business, in Montreal, as an investment broker, the defendant being one of his customers who, as such, had, previous to the 10th of September, 1910, deposited for investment by him certain sums of money aggregating $7,102 for the purpose of sharing in profits made or supposed to be made in stock transactions by Sheldon. On 30th September, 1910, Sheldon\u2019s books of account shewed the amount of $13,743 to the credit of the defendant, being the amount of the deposits which had been made by the defendant within some months previously together with profits accrued upon investments alleged to have been made in the purchase and sale of fluctuating stocks. In the circumstances mentioned in the head-note the defendant obtained from Sheldon the payment of the amount so shewn as standing at his credit, after banking hours, on the 10th of October, 1910, the eve of the day of Sheldon\u2019s departure from Montreal for an unknown destination. By their action the plaintiffs claimed the amount thus paid to the defendant on the ground that it was a preferential and illegal payment to the prejudice of all the other creditors of the insolvent and had been made at a time when Sheldon\u2019s insolvency was notorious and known of the defendant. The defendant pleaded good faith and that, at the time of the payment, he be lived that the profits he received had been earned through the investment of his money, and that Sheldon was solvent at the time he made the payment. In the Superior Court Mr. Justice Greenshields dismissed the action on the ground that the evidence did not shew that the defendant was aware of Sheldon\u2019s insolvency at the time he received payment. By the judgment appealed from, the Court of King\u2019s Bench held that this view was erroneous, but refused to reverse the order dismissing the action because recovery of the amount so paid was denied by article 1927 of the Civil Code on account of the transactions between the defendant and Sheldon being in their nature gaming contracts.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAtwater K.C. and Chauvin K.C. for the appellants.\nC. H. Stephens K.C. and A. Maillot for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I do not think we are called upon in this case to inquire into the nature of the agreement made between the defendant and Sheldon with respect to the investment by the latter of the funds entrusted to him. That it was either illicit or immoral is not absolutely free from doubt, and I am not at all sure that the defendant could not have enforced her claim against Sheldon for money had and received. Vide S.V. 1913,1,285 (cas d\u2019un mandataire charge d\u2019employer une somme d\u2019argent en jouant aux courses) S.V. 1912,2, sup, 422 (cas d\u2019un g\u00e9rant de cercle refusant de rendre ses comptes). It must also be observed that if this were a suit arising out of that agreement, the position of the plaintiff would be different from that of either of the parties to it. I quote the following \u201cconsid\u00e9rant\u201d from a judgment of the Court of Appeal at Paris:\u2014\nVainement on all\u00e9guerait, pour \u00e9carter la demande en restitution, la r\u00e8gle \u201cnemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans,\u201d alors que la demande en restitution est form\u00e9e non par la parties qui a pris part \u00e0 la convention, mais par son liquidateur judiciaire, agissant au nom de la masse des cr\u00e9anciers, qui n\u2019ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la convention illicite. (S.V. 1905,2,206.)\nBut those interesting questions do not arise here. This action is brought by the plaintiff as curator to the insolvent estate of Sheldon under the instructions of the court, not to enforce the contract which the defendant made with Sheldon, but to recover a sum of money alleged to have been paid to the defendant by Sheldon in fraud of the general creditors of the latter now represented by the plaintiff.\nThis is an action sui generis entirely distinct and independent of any claim which Sheldon might have had against the defendant. It arises not out of the agreement or arrangements which they may have entered into or out of any claim accruing to Sheldon by reason of the payment hereinafter referred to. It takes its rise in the fraud which it is alleged Sheldon practised on his creditors when he parted with the money. Planiol describes the origin and nature of the action so clearly that I will be pardoned this quotation from his \u201cDroit Civil\u201d (vol. 2, No. 319 (5 ed.)):\u2014\nS\u2019il (le d\u00e9biteur) commet une fraude, s\u2019il cherche \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre son actif pour \u00e9viter de payer ses dettes, sa conduite fait na\u00eetre, au profit du cr\u00e9ancier, une action nouvelle, distincte de la premi\u00e8re ( under art. 1031, C.C.), car la fraude est un d\u00e9lit civil, et comme telle elle a la force de produire une obligation qui a pour objet la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9. Le cr\u00e9ancier arm\u00e9 d\u00e8s lors d\u2019une action sp\u00e9ciale, cesse de subir l\u2019effet de l\u2019acte frauduleux. Aussi dit-on que le d\u00e9biteur qui agit par fraude cesse de repr\u00e9senter ses cr\u00e9anciers, langage un peu \u00e9nigmatique, qui d\u00e9signe simplement la possibilit\u00e9 pour les cr\u00e9anciers de se soustraire aux effects d\u2019un acte d\u00e9termin\u00e9.\nThe sole question here is: Can an action be maintained on the facts proved in this record. Those which are relevant to the issue are few and undisputed. On the 10th of October, 1910, when it is admitted he was hopelessly insolvent, Sheldon paid the respondent, after office hours, the sum of $13,738. This sum represented $7,102, capital invested with Sheldon by the defendant at different times during the preceding months, and $7,836, profits alleged to have been earned on that investment. The night of that same day Sheldon fled the country, leaving behind him creditors whose claims, in the aggregate, amounted to over $2,000,000. They included not only the business customers, but also trade creditors from whom he had bought his household supplies, carriages, horses, etc. Sheldon\u2019s assets at that time were estimated at about $19,951.29; there is, therefore, no doubt as to the fact of his insolvency.\nThe circumstances surrounding the payment, the subsequent flight, the fact that defendant\u2019s son and a former employee of her husband were in Sheldon\u2019s service, the press campaign in which Sheldon\u2019s financial methods were vigorously attacked, all combine to convince me that the defendant had good reason to know, when she received the money, that Sheldon was insolvent. I entirely agree with Mr. Justice Cross when he says, that there is reason to say that the respondent should be held to have known that Sheldon was insolvent when he paid the money,\nand with Mr. Justice Gervais, who, referring to the finding of the trial judge that the defendant was ignorant of Sheldon\u2019s financial condition, said:\u2014\nL\u2019on peut avoir des doutes sur l\u2019exactitude du motif de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nAssuming, therefore, that we have those facts proved: 1. The insolvency of Sheldon; 2. The knowledge of that insolvency by the defendant when the money was paid to her; 3. The appointment of the plaintiff as curator to the estate of the insolvent; 4. The authority of the court to bring this action in the interest of the mass of the creditors\u2014 what is the law applicable? If the question was not unnecessarily complicated by the issue as to the nature of the agreement between Sheldon and Mrs. Mathews, could there be any doubt about the right of the plaintiff to succeed in this action? I submit that the point would not be arguable (art. 1032 et seq. C.C.), and I am at a loss to understand how the issue between the parties can be, when properly understood, affected by the fact that the original transaction between Sheldon and Mrs. Mathews may have been either illicit or illegal as alleged. Let us apply this test: assuming that there had been no abandonment of property, then any one of Sheldon\u2019s creditors might have brought this action under article 1032 C.C., and if taken by one of those who had furnished Sheldon supplies for his household, could the defence of \u201cnemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans\u201d be set up against that creditor? How could that maxim be made to apply in such a case? What would be the \u201cturpitudo\u201d chargeable against that creditor or how could article 1927 C.C., relied on in appeal, be held to be a defence to an action to impeach the payment made to Mrs. Mathews by Sheldon in fraud of the rights of that creditor? As I said before, that would be an \u201cactio pauliana oblique,\u201d i.e., an action which is given to creditors to obtain the revocation of the acts done by their debtor in fraud of their rights (Planiol, vol. 2, No. 296 in fine), and not an action for the recovery of money under a gaming contract or a bet, as the judges in appeal have assumed this action to be. If the objection relied on below could be set up against a creditor of Sheldon, how can it avail against the curator, an officer of the court\nwho exercises all the rights of action of the debtor and all the actions possessed by the mass of the creditors\n(877, C.P.Q.), including, of course, the trade creditors? It is said by one of the judges below\nthat the curator to an abandonment in insolvency is an officer of the Superior Court and should not be required to act as \u201ccroupier\u201d to the patrons of a gaming house.\nThat is undoubtedly a very pretty sentiment. The question at issue is not, however, one of ethics or propriety to be solved in a court of honour. It is a question of law which courts of justice must decide in accordance with what I submit with all deference are settled legal principles. The money sued for, when collected, will be distributed under the eye of the court among the general body of creditors as their interests may appear. The question of the right to share in the fund as well as all priorities will then be settled. For the moment we are called upon purely and simply to say whether by the payment to Mrs. Mathews, or as a result of it, the general creditors of Sheldon, who are represented by the plaintiff, have been prejudiced; or in other words: Was the payment complained of made by the insolvent debtor to a creditor knowing his insolvency? If, as argued here, the contract between Mrs. Mathews and Sheldon was so tainted with illegality that no action could be brought upon it, then the payment by Sheldon must be deemed to have been gratuitous and, in that case, it is presumed to have been made with intent to defraud and the amount is recoverable at the suit of any creditor at least to the extent of his interest (1034 C.C.). If in the other alternative Mrs. Mathews\u2019 claim was legal and enforceable at law, then the payment complained of was made by an insolvent to a creditor who, as found by the Court of Appeal, must have known of the insolvency; in which case it is deemed to have been made with intent to defraud and is voidable under article 1036 C.C. So that if the position of the curator is that of a creditor of the insolvent who was not a party to the illegal agreement, his right to recover in either alternative is undoubted.\nIt is important, therefore, to clearly state again the nature of this proceeding. The action is taken by the curator. By the fact of his appointment he entered into possession of the whole estate of the insolvent (870 C.P.Q.), and is subject to the summary jurisdiction of the court ( 875 C.P.Q.). He exercises all the rights of action of the debtor and all the actions possessed by the mass of the creditors (877 C.P.Q.) and the sums realized are distributed under the eye of the court (880 and 881 C.P.Q.). It is specially important to observe in a case like this that the curator represents not only the debtor, but also the mass of the creditors, for this very obvious reason. If the curator represented only the insolvent debtor, then he would be obliged to rely on article 1031 C.C., in which case ail the pleas available in an action taken by the a debtor himself might be raised, such as \u201cin pari caus\u00e2 turpitudinis cessat repetitio\u201d or \u201cin pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis\u201d or, again, the defence under article 1927 C.C. But when the action is brought as in this case under both articles 1031 and 1032 the issues are different and the legal principles applicable are well settled. If the payment complained of prejudiced the other creditors in that it decreased the estate of their insolvent debtor diminishing pro tanto their security and it is proved that the payee knew, when she received the money, that the payer was insolvent, that payment is deemed to have been made with intent to defraud, in which case the recipient of the money may be compelled to restore the amount received for the benefit of the creditors of the insolvent according to their respective rights (1036 C.C.).\nThat the curator as representing the creditors may invoke both articles 1031 and 1032 C.C. in support of their claim can no longer be doubted.\nUn cr\u00e9ancier peut exercer cumulativement l\u2019action de l\u2019article H66 et celle de l\u2019article 1167. En vertu de la premi\u00e8re action, il peut exercer les droits de son d\u00e9biteur, mais il se voit opposer les d\u00e9sistements, renonciations de celui-ci. Aussi peut-il \u00e0 ce moment les attaquer par l\u2019action Paulienne s\u2019il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019ils sont frauduleux. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019a jug\u00e9 la Cour de Lyon, le 8 dec., 1908; Gaz. Pal., 17-18 janv., 1909; v. de m\u00eame Trib. de Nantes, 12 juill., 1906, Gaz. Pal., 1906.2.366.\nThis appeal should be allowed and the action maintained with costs, Idington J.\u2014I agree with the learned judges in appeal upon the monstrous absurdity of any sane person of intelligence believing that at man could go on for years or even for months, making as an investment broker twenty-five to forty per cent. monthly profits on money given him for investment.\nI, however, do not see my way to found upon such facts as before us the inevitable conclusion that all the creditors of such a man were gamblers, or that all their claims are founded upon that or some other consideration tainted with illegality.\nNo such defence is set up in the pleading. Nor was any such case made by the evidence.\nIt is no violent presumption to suppose that the curator may in fact represent honest creditors regarding whose claims no such imputation can be made.\nAnd such as I take it must be the legal presumption on behalf of the curator herein till the contrary is shewn.\nIf there are claims made upon the estate by creditors who cannot, by reason of their contracts being founded on some illegality, recover in law, future inquiries must determine any questions so raised.\nIt seems to me that the only questions herein respecting which there can be any doubt are whether or not respondent\u2019s receipt of $13,743, from Sheldon, can be said to have fallen within the meaning of either articles 1034, 1035 or 1036 of the Code.\nThe incredible suggestion that Sheldon was making for respondent and his wife and others trusting him such enormous profits as alleged renders it easier to impute knowledge of his insolvency to respondent or his wife than might be possible in the case of an ordinary business. It only needed very ordinary business intelligence to comprehend that such distribution of alleged profits must end in insolvency, and that within a very limited time.\nPeople possessed of such intelligence must inevitably have been on the lookout for the bursting of such a financial bubble.\nAnd when such a course of dealing, having gone on for months, was publicly assailed and had become the subject of discussion in leading newspapers, the collapse was at hand.\nThe condition of mind of the respondent\u2019s wife on the 9th and 10th of October\u2014the eve of Sheldon\u2019s flight \u2014indicating such a desperate determination to obtain the money in question is betrayed in too many ways to permit of our attributing it to anything else than a deep conviction that disaster awaited her venture, and that the only hope of rescue was to get the money on that evening, the 10th of October. The cashing of his cheque could not await the next morning. And when nearly eight thousand dollars of this money was supposed to be the result of a few months of fabulous profits to make up which somebody else must certainly be robbed, I need not multiply harsh words to describe such a transaction. As to the part of it covering such mythical profits it might, if it had stood alone, have fallen within art. 1034. Therefore, I must hold that when joined to the rest of the transaction such connection of the obviously illegal with the otherwise possibly legal has, if nothing else has done so, stamped the entire transaction as illegal and void within art. 1036.\nThe kind of knowledge meant therein is not literally a stock-taking of a man\u2019s assets as means of payment, but the conviction that if that were done it would demonstrate insolvency, and sooner than face that issue the person possessed of such conviction has decided to take all chances and get ahead of fellow creditors.\nIt is not necessary to follow in detail the many circumstances which, added to the inherent nature of the transactions in this peculiar case, demonstrate such belief as irresistibly the equivalent of actual knowledge directly proven.\nThe insolvency seems abundantly proven. And the suggestion that the estate of the insolvent had not been deprived in fact of the sum in question was not part of the defence in pleading or otherwise.\nWhatever merits in law might be found in such a contention if it had been so gone into and the securities given proved worthless, is something I need form no opinion upon.\nThe prim\u00e2 facie case is entirely the other way. I think the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout, and judgment given the appellant as prayed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Article 1036 of the Civil Code is as follows:\u2014\n1036. Every payment by an insolvent debtor to a creditor knowing his insolvency, is deemed to be made with intent to defraud, and the creditor may be compelled to restore the amount or thing received or the value thereof, for the benefit of the creditors according to their respective rights.\nThe principal question presented by this appeal as I view it is the question whether or not the payment made by Sheldon to the respondent through his wife was \u201ca payment by an insolvent debtor to a creditor knowing his insolvency,\u201d within the meaning of this article. As to the insolvency of Sheldon whatever plausible suggestions might be made as to possible defences by Sheldon in answer to the claims of his clients, so-called, there was undeniably a strong prim\u00e2 facie case of insolvency to which no solid or even substantial answer has been made.\nThe real controversy concerns the allegation which the appellant must make good that the payment was made to a creditor \u201cknowing of\u201d Sheldon\u2019s \u201cinsolvency.\u201d Did the respondent or his wife \u201cknow of\u201d Sheldon\u2019s insolvency within the meaning to be attributed to those words in this article? The question is not, as it appears to me, whether the respondent ought to have known in the sense that persons of reasonable judgment in his situation, or in the situation of his wife would have known of Sheldon\u2019s position, but whether in fact that was or was not the state of mind of one or other of them at the time the payment was made. The tribunal passing upon the question must be able to reach the conclusion upon the evidence before it that the state of mind denoted by \u201cknowledge\u201d in this connection, did in fact exist. The first point to consider is, what is meant by \u201cknowledge\u201d here? One may perhaps be permitted to observe at the outset that there is, of course, no sort of warrant for introducing here ideas drawn from the English doctrine of \u201cnotice\u201d according to which knowledge of a state of facts may in certain circumstances be imputed to one, although everybody admits that in point of fact one was quite ignorant of it. It may be observed, however, that the terms \u201cknow\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d are very elastic terms, capable of a broad range of signification varying with the context and the subject-matter in connection with which they are employed. And one, of course, must not, if it can be avoided, give to such phrases a meaning which, in practice, would frustrate the purpose of the enactment in which they occur. Without further analysis and without attempting to lay down or even suggest n rule of anything like of universal application I think that where you have a belief on the part of the creditor that insolvency exists and that belief is founded on facts which to a person ordinarily conversant with affairs would point to insolvency there you have a state of facts which constitutes knowledge within the meaning of this article. Ex hypothesi in every case in which the question arises, of course, there is insolvency in fact. I am not prepared to say that given insolvency in fact the additional fact that the creditor entertained a suspicion or strong conviction that such was the state of affairs without any objective of grounds for that conviction would in itself be sufficient to bring the case within the article. But I think that where you have such a belief based upon solid objective grounds then the case is made out.\nIn the present case there is ample evidence to shew that none of these elements was wanting. I will not go into the evidence in detail, but I think the natural inference from what was done by the respondent\u2019s wife is that she was actuated by a very pressing sense of the fact that the least delay would be fraught with signal risk of the loss of her husband\u2019s money; and in view of all the facts in evidence I think that is the proper inference. As in my conclusion upon this question of fact I am differing from the opinion of the learned trial judge, I think it is right to point out first, neither the respondent nor the respondent\u2019s wife, although called as witnesses, made any direct statement as to the state of their knowledge or suspicions touching Sheldon\u2019s affairs. Secondly, this question, though a question of fact, turns upon the proper inference to be drawn upon the facts proved and the answer to be given to it would not, in my view of those inferences, in any material degree, be affected by any opinion that one might have formed as to the credibility of the witnesses who gave evidence at the trial. Thirdly, the judgment of the learned trial judge which I have considered with care, and of which I desire to speak with the greatest respect, seems to me to be open to the observation that the learned judge has not given sufficient weight to the circumstance that the respondent was a man of affairs and that the character and circumstances of Sheldon\u2019s operations may be taken in absence of some explanation by him to have marked them, for a man of his experience (I think 1 am putting it very moderately) as both irregular and extremely hazardous. I think, with respect, that the learned trial judge has fallen into some error in failing to give sufficient weight to this circumstance in interpreting the subsequent conduct of the parties.\nOn this question of fact the Court of Appeal appears also to have been unable to accept the conclusion of the learned trial judge, but held the appellant to be barred from recovery by the provisions of article 1927 C.C. As I understand the view of the Court of Appeal touching the application of that article it is this: the persons who entrusted their money to Sheldon were partners with him in a series of gambling transactions, and all parties must be presumed, in view of the facts, to have contemplated transactions forbidden by the law. Then it is said that according to article 1927 C.C. (the moneys in question having been paid to the respondent as moneys to which he was entitled as the profits arising from operations including such transactions) the recovery of these moneys is barred by the express language of the article in question. With great respect I have been unable to convince myself that the reasoning upon which the Court of King\u2019s Bench proceeded is sufficient to support their conclusion. The nullity with which a payment to which article 1036 C.C. applies is affected by the rule embodied in that article rests upon the fraud upon the rights of creditors which the payment made in such circumstances is presumed to involve; and the right of recovery given by the article is shewn by the express words of it to be primarily, at all events, a right conferred in the interests and for the benefit of the creditors who have thereby been wronged. It would appear, therefore (assuming Sheldon himself to have been disabled from recovering the moneys paid by reason of the provision of article 1927 C.C.) that this circumstance would not necessarily be conclusive against the claims of creditors under article 1036 C.C. Indeed, if I am right in my construction of the view taken by the Court of Appeal (assuming the hypothesis upon which that view is founded to be correct, viz., that the moneys in question were paid to the respondent as profits arising out of illegal transactions in which he was a partner) it would appear to be susceptible of plausible argument that the claim of the curator could be sustained under article 1034 C.C. If, indeed, it had been shewn that the nature of Sheldon\u2019s transactions and of his relations with those who entrusted their money to him was such as to disentitle any of them to sustain any claim against him in a court of law in respect of their transactions with him, then a totally different question might have arisen, viz., the question whether in truth Sheldon was insolvent, within the meaning of article 1036 C.C., at the time the payment under consideration was made. But to support such a conclusion it would be necessary to go far beyond anything justified by the record before us, and I do not understand the Court of Appeal to have put their judgment on any such ground.\nFor these reasons, I think the curator was entitled to succeed in his action and that the appeal ought to be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree with the view apparently taken by the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that enough was established in evidence to raise a presumption that the defendant\u2019s wife believed that Sheldon was insolvent when she obtained the money in question from him. As he was in fact insolvent, that belief, in my opinion, constituted knowledge of his insolvency within the meaning of article 1036 C.C. But, with respect, I cannot accept the conclusion reached by the learned appellate judges that the plaintiff\u2019s action is barred by article 1927 C.C.\nHis right as curator is to recover all the property of the insolvent debtor, including what he has alienated in fraud of his creditors. Money paid gratuitously by an insolvent is deemed to have been paid in fraud of creditors (art. 1034 C.C.). This applies to the sum of $7,841, fictitious profits\u201d paid to the defendant\u2019s wife, which would, therefore, be recoverable without proof of the knowledge required by article 1036 C.C., under which the balance of $5,942, paid to recoup, moneys deposited with Sheldon by the defendant, is claimed.\nThe curator represents the creditors as well as the insolvent debtor. But I cannot think that his right to get in the assets of the insolvent estate depends upon the enforceability of the claims of any or of all of the insolvent\u2019s creditors. At all events, in the absence of conclusive proof that no creditor of the insolvent estate has an enforceable claim, the curator\u2019s right to recover in this action cannot be questioned. Assuming that the claims of all the business creditors of Sheldon should fall within the bar of article 1927 C.C. (something which may not be assumed, but must be proved as against each creditor when he seeks to enforce his claim) the claims of his other creditors would have to be met and the expenses of the curatorship provided for. There is no evidence that Sheldon had not creditors other than the customers of his business; and that again may not be assumed. It may be that on the distribution of the estate many or all of the claims of the \u201cclients\u201d of the insolvent will turn out to be so tainted with the vice, of gaming that article 1927 C.C. will preclude their recovery. But the time for considering such questions is when the period arrives for determining who are entitled to share in the distribution of the estate\u2014 not before it is realized.\nIt should also be noted that the defence of gaming is not even hinted at in the defendant\u2019s plea.\nNo other defence to the curator\u2019s claim has been suggested.\nI would, therefore, allow the plaintiff\u2019s appeal with costs in this court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench and would direct judgment for the amount of his claim also with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action Paulienne institu\u00e9e par le curateur aux biens de l\u2019insolvable Sheldon par laquelle il demande l\u2019annulation d\u2019un paiement fait par ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la veille du jour o\u00f9 Sheldon a laiss\u00e9 le pays.\nSheldon a eu pendant un temps beaucoup de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 convaincre un certain public que, par des sp\u00e9culations dont il avait seul le secret, il pourrait r\u00e9aliser des profits fabuleux sur les sommes qu\u2019on voudrait lui confier. Ses op\u00e9rations dur\u00e8rent pendant quelques mois, lorsqu\u2019un jour des journaux s\u2019avis\u00e8rent de le d\u00e9noncer et de publier que tout cela devait n\u00e9cessairement se terminer par un d\u00e9sastre. Cette campagne de presse naturellement affecta sa position financi\u00e8re et plusieurs de ses d\u00e9posants se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour retirer leur argent. Il parut faire face pendant quelques jours assez facilement \u00e0 l\u2019orage.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019un de ces d\u00e9posants. Dans le cours de la semaine qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 10 octobre, 1910, il fut appel\u00e9 par ses affaires en dehors de Montr\u00e9al. Sa femme, qui \u00e9tait au courant de ses relations avec Sheldon, alarm\u00e9e de cette campagne de presse qui se poursuivait avec plus de vigueur que jamais contre Sheldon, se pr\u00e9senta \u00e0 son bureau le 10 octobre, 1910, pour retirer l\u2019argent de son mari. Elle avait un fils employ\u00e9 chez Sheldon et il y avait aussi l\u00e0 parmi les employ\u00e9s un ancien commis de son mari, un nomm\u00e9 Hunton.\nElle s\u2019adressa au commis Hunton qui pr\u00e9para un ch\u00e8que pour la faire signer par Sheldon mais comme elle \u00e9tait \u00e9nerv\u00e9e ou indispos\u00e9e et que Sheldon \u00e9tait alors absent, elle est all\u00e9e pendant quelque temps se reposer au bureau de son mari, qui se trouvait dans les environs. Elle revint plus tard et Sheldon lui aurait alors promis, suivant elle, d\u2019envoyer son ch\u00e8que par son fils.\nPeu satisfaite de cette promesse, elle s\u2019est adress\u00e9e, \u00e0 un ami, M. Cooper, et revint avec ce dernier un peu apr\u00e8s deux heures dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. L\u00e0 Sheldon lui donna un ch\u00e8que dat\u00e9 du lendemain sur Garand & Terroux, banquiers priv\u00e9s de Montr\u00e9al.\nLe ch\u00e8que fut pris par Mde. Mathews; mais apr\u00e8s avoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte du bureau avec M. Cooper elle est rentr\u00e9e de nouveau.\nAlors Sheldon partit avec Mde. Mathews et M. Cooper pour aller voir ses banquiers, Garand & Terroux. Il fit un arrangement avec eux et Garand & Terroux donn\u00e8rent alors, un ch\u00e8que qui fut accept\u00e9 par Mde. Mathews. Quelques heures apr\u00e8s, Sheldon remettait entre les mains de Garand & Terroux des valeurs au montant de cent trente et quelques mille piastres.\nLe lendemain Sheldon avait pris la fuite et laiss\u00e9 un d\u00e9ficit \u00e9norme. Ses dettes se seraient mont\u00e9es \u00e0 au-del\u00e0 de deux millions, tandis que son actif repr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s vingt et quelques mille piastres.\nIl s\u2019agit de savoir si ce paiement fait par Sheldon \u00e0 Mde. Mathews, dans les circonstances que je viens de relater, constitue un paiement frauduleux.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l\u2019Honorable Juge Greenshields, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas lieu d\u2019annuler ce paiement parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tabli que Mathews connaissait alors l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 de Sheldon.\nLa Cour d\u2019Appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019opinion que la connaissance de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e; l\u2019honorable juge Cross dit ceci:\u2014\nThere is reason to say that the respondent should be held to have known that Sheldon was insolvent when he paid the money, and that the defence is, consequently, unfounded.\nmais que le curateur ne pouvait pas exercer d\u2019action pour recouvrer le montant qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une dette de jeu; et qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019article 1927 du code civil,\nIl n\u2019y a pas d\u2019action pour le recouvrement de deniers ou autres choses en vertu d\u2019un contrat de jeu ou d\u2019un pari; mais si les deniers ou les choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par la parties qui a perdu, ils ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019y a\u00eet preuve de fraude.\nApr\u00e8s avoir lu la preuve, je suis d\u2019opinion que Sheldon \u00e9tait insolvable lorsqu\u2019il a fait le paiement en question et que Mathews et sa femme qui agissait en son nom connaissaient son insolvabilit\u00e9.\nCette connaissance de l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 de Sheldon r\u00e9sulte de plusieurs circonstances. Il est assez \u00e9trange cependant qu\u2019on n\u2019ait pas demand\u00e9 directement \u00e0 Mde. Mathews, lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin, si elle connaissait ou non cette insolvabilit\u00e9. Mais je suppose qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9, comme cela se fait d\u2019ailleurs souvent dans des circonstances semblables, qu\u2019elle n\u2019en connaissait rien.\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, quels sont les faits? Voici un homme dont les op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient d\u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la presse depuis plusieurs jours. Il avait, il est vrai, r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces attaques; mais la nature de ses r\u00e9ponses avait \u00e9branl\u00e9 la confiance du public. On repr\u00e9sentait dans les journaux que ses op\u00e9rations devaient n\u00e9cessairement conduire au d\u00e9sastre, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible qu\u2019il p\u00fbt payer les profits consid\u00e9rables qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tendait et qu\u2019un de ces jours les d\u00e9posants seraient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 perdre l\u2019argent qu\u2019ils auraient plac\u00e9 l\u00e0. Cette femme a \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment affect\u00e9e par ces d\u00e9nonciations; elle d\u00e9clarait le samedi, le 8 octobre, que si elle vivait jusqu\u2019au lundi (sachant qu\u2019aucune op\u00e9ration ne pouvait se faire le dimanche) elle irait certainement chercher son argent.\nNous la trouvons le lundi suivant au bureau de Sheldon; nous la voyons insister pour \u00eatre pay\u00e9e; on veut la faire temporiser mais elle revient \u00e0 la charge \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises. On lui donne en d\u00e9finitive un ch\u00e8que payable le lendemain. Elle n\u2019est pas satisfaite de cela; il lui faut son argent de suite. On la m\u00e8ne chez les banquiers priv\u00e9s sur qui le ch\u00e8que est tir\u00e9; et, chose singuli\u00e8re, elle accepte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence le ch\u00e8que de ces banquiers priv\u00e9s \u00e0 celui de Sheldon.\nMaintenant il ne faut pas oublier qu\u2019elle avait l\u00e0 dans le bureau un ami dans la personne de Hunton, un ancien employ\u00e9 de son mari. Elle avait aussi son fils qui devait n\u00e9cessairement conna\u00eetre quelque peu la situation financi\u00e8re de Sheldon et les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles il \u00e9tait en butte.\nMais laissons de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la connaissance qu\u2019elle pouvait avoir acquise par ces deux personnes. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle avait perdu confiance dans la solvabilit\u00e9 de Sheldon et la pr\u00e9somption raisonnable \u00e0 tirer de toutes les circonstances c\u2019est qu\u2019elle connaissait son insolvabilit\u00e9.\nMaintenant la Cour d\u2019Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait une dette de jeu pour laquelle il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Examinons ce point.\nJe ne crois pas qu\u2019on puisse traiter de contrat de jeu les relations de Mathews et de Sheldon; mais en supposant m\u00eame que ce serait une dette de jeu que le failli a pay\u00e9, est-ce que l\u2019action Paulienne ne comp\u00e8te pas aux cr\u00e9anciers, ou \u00e0 leur repr\u00e9sentant, le curateur, dans ce cas-l\u00e0? Je suppose pour un instant le cas d\u2019un d\u00e9biteur insolvable qui a une dette de jeu et une dette l\u00e9gitime et qui paie ces deux dettes-l\u00e0 \u00e0 des cr\u00e9anciers qui connaissent son insolvabilit\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute que sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 1036 C.C. le paiement de la dette l\u00e9gitime doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9 et le cr\u00e9ancier peut \u00eatre forc\u00e9 de remettre la chose re\u00e7u. Serait-ce \u00e0 dire que le paiement de la dette de jeu ne serait pas susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre soumis \u00e0 l\u2019action r\u00e9vocatoire de la part des autres cr\u00e9anciers? Il me semble que poser la question c\u2019est la r\u00e9soudre.\nSi le cr\u00e9ancier l\u00e9gitime est expos\u00e9 \u00e0 voir annuler son paiement, il doit en \u00eatre de m\u00eame du cr\u00e9ancier dont la dette repose sur une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9; autrement ce serait le cr\u00e9ancier ill\u00e9gitime qui serait plus favoris\u00e9 que le cr\u00e9ancier l\u00e9gitime.\nL\u2019article du code civil qui prohibe l\u2019action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition dans le cas d\u2019une dette de jeu ne dit pas que l\u2019action Paulienne par les cr\u00e9anciers du d\u00e9biteur ne peut pas \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e. Je vois que la Cour d\u2019Appel a confondu ces deux actions qui sont r\u00e9gies par des principes diff\u00e9rents.\nLe d\u00e9biteur qui a fait un paiement ne peut pas lui-m\u00eame r\u00e9clamer l\u2019argent qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9, m\u00eame si en faisant ce paiement il a fraud\u00e9 ses cr\u00e9anciers. Il ne peut pas non plus r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l\u2019argent qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 pour une dette de jeu. Mais si en payant sa dette de jeu ou en acquittant ses cr\u00e9ances l\u00e9gitimes il \u00e9tait insolvable \u00e0 la connaissance de ceux qui ont re\u00e7u ces paiements, alors ses autres cr\u00e9anciers et le curateur \u00e0 la faillite peuvent, sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 1036, non pas exercer l\u2019action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, mais prendre une action Paulienne pour faire annuler ses paiements et en faire rentrer le montant dans la masse pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de tous les cr\u00e9anciers.\nJe suis donc d\u2019opinion que l\u2019appel est bien fond\u00e9 et qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chauvin, Baker & Walker.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott & David.\n[1] Q.R. 22 K.B. 97.\n[2] Q.R. 41 S.C. 155.\n"}

The defendant claimed that the wood was cut on his own land. Each party claimed title through allotment on the foundation of the township and by subsequent Crown grants.\nThe trial judge held that the plaintiff\u2019s case depended on the properties overlapping and he could only succeed by establishing priority of title. He held as to this that the original party from whom the defendant claimed had an allotment possession before plaintiff\u2019s title originated and the allotment was confirmed by a township grant in 1784 and by a Crown grant in 1800, the latter reciting his possession for more than twenty years previous. The Supreme Court en banc reversed the judgment at the trial, holding that on the evidence plaintiff\u2019s title was prior and defendant\u2019s grant in 1800 derogated from it.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada after hearing counsel for each party and reserving judgment allowed the appeal and restored the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nMellish K.C and Matheson K.C. for the appellant.\nPaton K.C. for the respondent.\n[1] 46 N.S.
