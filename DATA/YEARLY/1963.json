Ltd. v. Ace Lumber Ltd., [1963] S.C.R. 110\nDate: 1963-01-22\nThe Clarkson Company Limited, Trustee in Bankruptcy of L. Di Cecco Company Limited, and the Sisters of St. Joseph for the Diocese of Toronto in Upper Canada (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nAce Lumber Limited and Danford Lumber Company Limited, carrying on business under the firm name of Cadillac Lumber (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1962: November 29, 30; 1963: January 22.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMechanics\u2019 liens\u2014Construction equipment supplied on rental basis\u2014Whether liens created in respect of rentals charged\u2014The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. I960, c. 283, s. 5.\nA subcontractor, engaged to erect form work for concrete floors, columns and other portions of specific buildings on lands owned by the Sisters of St. Joseph, contracted with A Ltd. and D Ltd. for the rental of certain construction equipment. The subcontractor later became bankrupt, and, in a mechanics\u2019 lien action, A Ltd. and D Ltd. filed claims in respect of the rentals charged for the said equipment. These claims were rejected by the master but were allowed on appeal to the Court of Appeal by a majority decision. An appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nWhile The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 233, may merit a liberal interpretation with respect to the rights it confers upon those to whom it applies, it must be given a strict interpretation in determining whether any lien claimant is a person to whom a lien is given by it.\nThe submission that the price of the rental of the equipment was the proper subject\u2011matter of a lien within the meaning of s. 5 of the Act on the ground that such rental constituted \u201cthe performance of a service\u201d in respect of the constructing and erecting of the buildings in question, or alternatively, that it constituted the furnishing of materials used in the construction and erection thereof, was rejected. As the equipment was neither furnished for the purpose of being incorporated nor incorporated into the finished structure of the buildings and as it was not consumed in the construction process, it could not be said to have been \u201cmaterial\u201d furnished \u201cto be used in the constructing or erecting of the building\u201d within the meaning of the section. Also, the lien created by s. 5(1) in respect of \u201cmaterials\u201d furnished was a lien for the \u201cprice of\u201d such \u201cmaterials\u201d. This was a different thing from the price of the rental of materials and it was illogical to suppose that the legislature intended to create a lien for the \u201cprice\u201d of the materials in favour of a person who never parted with title to them, who supplied them on the understanding that they would be returned and to whom they were in fact returned. The word \u201cperforms\u201d in s. 5 was to be taken as connoting some active participation in the performance of the service on the part of the lien claimant. Having regard to the rule of construction applicable in the circumstances, the respondents, by merely making their equipment available at a fixed rental, could not be said to be persons who performed any service upon or in respect of the building within the meaning of the section.\nTimber Structures v. C.W.S. Grinding & Machine Works, 229 P. 2d 623, referred to; Crowell Bros. Ltd. v. Maritime Minerals Ltd. et al. (1940), 15 M.P.R. 39, approved.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from the report of Bristow, Master, in a mechanics\u2019 lien action. Appeal allowed.\nC.A. Thompson, Q.C., and J.W. Craig, for the defendants, appellants.\nR.E. Shibley and J.W. McCutcheon, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 (Kelly J.A. dissenting) allowing the mechanics\u2019 lien claims asserted in this action by Acrow (Canada) Limited (hereinafter referred to as Acrow) and Dell Construction Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as Dell) in the sums of $10,380.29 and $20,632.59 respectively, being the price of the renting of certain construction equipment to L. Di Cecco Company Limited for the purpose of facilitating the carrying out by the latter company of a subcontract to erect form work for concrete floors, columns and other portions of certain buildings known as the House of Providence, situate on lands owned by the Sisters ofSt. Joseph.\nThe facts are not in dispute and it is apparent that title to the equipment in question remained in Acrow and Dell respectively, that it was for the most part delivered to the job by the Di Cecco Company and was always returned by that company or its trustees in bankruptcy after use. All of the equipment in question was furnished to the Di Cecco Company on a straight rental basis and no personnel of either Acrow or Dell were employed in connection with its installation or employment. The determination of this appeal depends upon the true construction to be placed upon s. 5 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 233, and specifically upon whether that section is to be so construed as to create a lien in respect of the rentals charged for the said equipment by the two lien claimants.\nThe material provisions of s. 5 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act read as follows:\n(1) Unless he signs an express agreement to the contrary\u2026any person who performs any work or service upon or in respect of, or places or furnishes any materials to be used in the making, constructing, erecting, fitting, altering, improving or repairing of any\u2026building. for any owner, contractor, or subcontractor, by virtue thereof has a lien for the price of the work, service or materials upon the estate or interest of the owner in the. building\u2026and appurtenances and the land occupied thereby or enjoyed therewith, or upon or in respect of which the work or service is performed, or upon which the materials are placed or furnished to be used,. and the placing or furnishing of the materials to be used upon the land or such other place in the immediate vicinity of the land designated by the owner or his agent is good and sufficient delivery for the purpose of this Act,\u2026\n(2) The lien given by subsection 1 attaches to the land as therein set out where the materials delivered to be used are incorporated into the buildings\u2026on the land, notwithstanding that the materials may not have been delivered in strict accordance with subsection 1.\nIt was submitted on behalf of the respondents in this Court as it had been in the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the price of the rental of the said equipment was the proper subject\u2011matter of a lien within the meaning of this section on the ground that such rental constituted \u201cthe performance of a service\u201d in respect of the constructing and erecting of the buildings in question, or alternatively, that it constituted the furnishing of materials used in the construction and erection thereof.\nAll the judges of the Court of Appeal agreed with Roach J.A. that as the equipment here in question was neither furnished for the purpose of being incorporated nor incorporated into the finished structure of the buildings and as it was not consumed in the construction process, it could not be said to have been \u201cmaterial\u201d furnished \u201cto be used in the constructing or erecting of the building\u201d within the meaning of the said s. 5. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of Mr. Justice Roach in this regard. As that learned judge has also observed, the lien created by s. 5(1) in respect of \u201cmaterials\u201d furnished is a lien for the \u201cprice of\u201d such \u201cmaterials\u201d. This is a different thing from the price of the rental of materials and it would appear to me that it would be illogical to suppose that the legislature intended to create a lien for the \u201cprice\u201d of the materials themselves in favour of a person who never parted with title to them, who supplied them on the understanding that they would be returned and to whom they were in fact returned.\nThe respondents\u2019 contention that the rental of this equipment constituted the \u201cperformance of a service\u201d within the meaning of the said s. 5 was however upheld by the Court of Appeal and Roach J.A., in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of that Court, having expressed the view that the phrase \u201cwork or service\u201d as employed in that section is disjunctive and that \u201cthe \u2018performance of service\u2019 must therefore mean the doing of something exclusive of \u2018work\u2019 or the placing or furnishing of materials to be used etcetera that enhances the value of the land\u201d, went on to say that:\nThe words \u201cperformance of service\u201d may not be the most apt words that the legislature could have used to express its intention, but in the context in which they have been used I think their meaning is sufficiently plain. They must be given a meaning consistent with the spirit of the Act. In the context in which they have been used I interpret them as meaning to supply aid or an essential need in the construction process.\nAfter observing that the employment of the form of equipment supplied by the lien claimants was essential to the modern type of construction involved in the contract in question and that until recent years the function performed by that equipment involved the fabrication of forms on the job, the labour and material for which had the protection and security of the Act, Mr. Justice Roach concluded that \u201cthose who supply the service under this modern technique are equally entitled to that protection and security\u201d. He then proceeded to quote the provisions of s. 4 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.O.1960, c. 191, to the effect that \u201cthe law shall be considered as always speaking,\u201d etc. and to say:\nTo deny to these appellants the same security under the Act as was given to those who applied the earlier technique in the construction industry would be wrong and quite contrary to the spirit and purpose of the Act. In this connection I adopt the language of Brown J. in Johnson v. Starrett (1914), 127 Minn. 138 at 142 citing Schaghticoke Powder Co. v. Greenwich and Johnsville Ry. Co., 183 N.Y. 306 where he said \u201cin the construction of statutes their language must be adapted to changing conditions brought about by improved methods and the progress of the inventive arts\u201d. It appears to me that this latter argument loses much of its force when it is remembered that The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act in question was revised by the Legislature of Ontario in the same year (1960) in which the equipment was rented. This is not a question of adapting the language of an old statute to meet new conditions, but rather one of determining the intention of the legislature with respect to a building practice which was currently employed at the time when the statute was enacted.\nThe above excerpts from the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal indicate to me that the conclusion there reached is predicated in large measure on the assumption that the provisions of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act which describe and delimit the classes of persons entitled to a lien thereunder are to be liberally construed and that their language is to be adapted to meet the circumstances here disclosed.\nWith the greatest respect, I am, however, of opinion that the proper approach to the interpretation of this statute is expressed in the dissenting opinion of Kelly J.A. where he says that:\nThe lien commonly known as the mechanics\u2019 lien was unknown to the common law and owes its existence in Ontario to a series of statutes, the latest of which is R.S.O. 1960, c. 233. It constitutes an abrogation of the common law to the extent that it creates, in the specified circumstances, a charge upon the owner\u2019s lands which would not exist but for the Act, and grants to one class of creditors a security or preference not enjoyed by all creditors of the same debtor; accordingly, while the statute may merit a liberal interpretation with respect to the rights it confers upon those to whom it applies, it must be given a strict interpretation in determining whether any lien-claimant is a person to whom a lien is given by it.\nThe same view was adopted in the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of Oregon in Timber Structures v. C.W.S. Grinding & Machine Works[2], where it was said:\nWe agree with the defendant that the right to a lien is purely statutory and a claimant to such a lien must in the first instance, bring himself clearly within the terms of the statute. The statute is strictly construed as to persons entitled to its benefits and as to the procedure necessary to perfect the lien; but when the claimant\u2019s right has been clearly established, the law will be liberally interpreted toward accomplishing the purposes of its enactment. The words \u201cperform\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d are both susceptible of a variety of meanings according to the context in which they are employed and as has been indicated, if the statutory language is liberally construed and selected meanings are assigned to each of these words in order that they may be adapted to the circumstances, it may then be logical to construe the phrase \u201cany person who performs any\u2026service upon or in respect of\u2026constructing any building\u201d as including a person who rents non-consumable equipment for temporary use to facilitate the building\u2019s construction. In my view, however, different considerations apply to the strict construction of a statute which creates a lien, on the one hand, for any person who \u201cperforms any work or service\u201d and on the other hand for any person who \u201cfurnishes any material\u201d. Even if it were accepted that the presence of the equipment at the building site in itself constituted \u00e0 \u201cservice upon or in respect of...constructing\u201d the building it is nevertheless my view that the words \u201cfurnishes\u201d and \u201cperforms\u201d as they occur in s. 5 of the Act must be given separate meanings and that the latter word must be taken as connoting some active participation in the performance of the service on the part of the lien claimant. Having regard to the rule of construction, which I consider to be applicable under the circumstances, I do not think that by merely making their equipment available at a fixed rental, the respondents can be said to be persons who performed any service upon or in respect of the building within the meaning of the section.\nNone of the cases so thoroughly analyzed in the Court of Appeal appears to me to constitute any direct authority for the proposition that the provisions of s. 5 of the Act or any equivalent statutory provisions create a lien for \u201cservices\u201d in respect of the furnishing of equipment alone on a straight rental basis as in the present case. On the other hand, in the case of Crowell Bros. Ltd. v. Maritime Minerals Ltd. et al.[3], the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, construing statutory language which was substantially the same as that with which we are here concerned, concluded that no lien under the heading of service could arise for the rental of a drill sharpener employed in sharpening tools used in the actual making of a mine. It appears to me that Doull J., who rendered the decision of that Court, was correct in adopting the view that:\n\u2026unless expressly so provided by statute, no lien can be acquired for the value or use of tools, machinery or appliances furnished or loaned for the purpose of facilitating the work where they remain the property of the contractor and are not consumed in their use but remain capable of use in some other construction or improvement work.\nIt is true that this language was adopted by Mr. Justice Doull from the resum\u00e9 of American cases contained in Corpus Juris, vol. 40 at p. 86, but it seems to me to have been well applied to the statute which he had before him and that it applies with equal force to the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act of Ontario.\nAs has been indicated, the practice of renting construction equipment appears to have been current in the construction business at the time when The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 233, was enacted and it seems to me that as the legislature at that time made no express provision for the inclusion of the renters of such equipment amongst those persons entitled to a mechanics\u2019 lien, it does not now lie with the Courts to create such a lien by adapting the statutory language that was used so as to accomplish that purpose.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those contained in the dissenting opinion of Kelly J.A., I would allow this appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and direct that the report of the learned master from which the appeal was taken to that Court be restored.\nThe appellants will have the costs of this appeal and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nAppeal allowed, order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside and report of the Master restored.\nSolicitors for the appellant, The Clarkson Co. Ltd.: Aylesworth, Garden, Thompson & Denison, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the appellants, The Sisters ofSt. Joseph: T.A.King, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Acrow (Canada) Ltd.: White, Bristol, Beck & Phipps, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Dell Construction Co.

The company leased its hall on four successive nights of each week to four different charitable. organizations, which conducted bingo games, the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes. These organizations, in each case, made their own arrangements for the conduct of the games, supplying their own equipment and personnel for that purpose. They paid to the company a standard rental per night for the use of the hall, which was not in any way dependent upon the number of persons who played in the games. The respondent was on the premises each evening, but did not participate in any way in the games. The company employed a commissionaire and operated a refreshment stand. The respondent was convicted on a charge of keeping a common gaming house contrary to s. 176(1) of the Criminal Code, but this conviction was quashed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: In order to constitute the offence of keeping a common gaming house, there must be something more than the keeping of a place whose use, by someone other than the accused, makes it a common gaming house. The position of a \u201ckeeper\u201d who does not in any way participate in the operation of the games played, but who knows that the place in question is being used for that purpose, and who permits such use, is that which was contemplated when the lesser offence defined in s. 176(2) (b) was created. That offence must have been created because it was not contemplated that such a person was, himself, keeping the common gaming house within the meaning of s. 176(1).\nThe offence defined in s. 176(1) involves some act of participation in the wrongful use of the place and the evidence in the instant case did not establish any such participation on the part of the respondent.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J., dissenting: By subs. (1)(h)(ii) of s. 168 of the Code, wherein \u201ckeeper\u201d is defined, the respondent was a person who \u201cassists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place\u201d or at least \u201cappears\u201d to do so. The fact that by subs. (2) (b) of s. 176 everyone who, as agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction could not by itself restrict the broad meaning given by Parliament to the word \u201ckeeper\u201d in s. 168. A person who falls within the definition of a \u201ckeeper\u201d, \u201ckeeps\u201d a \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d within s. 176(1).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a conviction for keeping a common gaming house. Appeal dismissed, Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting.\nJ.W. Austin, for the appellant.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is concerned with the proper interpretation of portions of s. 168 and s. 176 of the Criminal Code:\n168. (1) In this Part,\n* * *\n(d) \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d means a place that is\n(i) kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or\n(ii) kept or used for the purpose of playing games\n* * *\n(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or\n* * *\n(h) \u201ckeeper\u201d includes a person who\n(i) is an owner or occupier of a place,\n(ii) assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,\n(iii) appears to be, or to assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,\n(iv) has the care or management of a place, or\n(v) uses a place permanently or temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier; and\n(i) \u201cplace\u201d includes any place, whether or not\n(i) it is covered or enclosed,\n(ii) it is used permanently or temporarily, or\n(iii) any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it.\n(2) A place is not a common gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)\n* * * (b) while occasionally it is used by charitable or religious organizations for the purpose of playing games for which a direct fee is charged to persons for the right or privilege of playing, if the proceeds from the games are to be used for a charitable or religious object.\n(3) The onus of proving that, by virtue of subsection (2), a place is not a common gaming house is on the accused.\n* * *\n176. (1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n(2) Every one who\n(a) is found, without lawful excuse, in a common gaming house, or common betting house, or\n(b) as owner, landlord, lessor, tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house,\nis guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nThe respondent was convicted by a magistrate, in the Province of Ontario, on a charge that in 1959 and 1960 he, in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did keep a common gaming house situate and known as the Club Kingsway, contrary to the Criminal Code. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] the conviction was set aside, MacKay J.A. dissenting.\nKerim Brothers Limited was the registered owner of a lot and of a building thereon in which it carried on business as proprietor of an hotel known as the Kingsway Hotel. That company was licensed by the Metropolitan Licensing Commission. The company operated on the premises a club, known as The Kingsway, and the building was used for a number of purposes including dancing, banquets, receptions and displays. During the period in question the company leased its hall on four successive nights of each week to four different religious and charitable organizations which conducted bingo games, the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes. These various organizations supplied their own equipment and personnel for the bingo games and paid to the company a standard rental for the use of the hall irrespective of the number of persons who played the games. The respondent was the president of the company and while he did not participate in the bingo games, the fees were paid either in cash or by cheque to him or to one Buckingham. The cheques were not made payable to either of these men.\nUndoubtedly the charge was laid under subs. (1) of s. 176 of the Criminal Code, which is in Part V of the Code and by subs. (1)(d) of s. 168, which is in the same Part and which might be repeated:\n168. (1) In this Part,\n* * *\n(d) \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d means a place that is\n(i) kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or\n(ii) kept or used for the purpose of playing games\n* * *\n(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or\nSubsection (2), which might also be repeated, reads as follows:\n(2) A place is not a common gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)\n* * *\n(b) while occasionally it is used by charitable or religious organizations for the purpose of playing games for which a direct fee is charged to persons for the right or privilege of playing, if the proceeds from the games are to be used for a charitable or religious object.\nThere can be no question that the premises were used as a common gaming house as defined, and no point is made that the organizations which conducted the games of bingo fell within subs. 2(b). By subs. (1)(h)(ii) of s. 168, the respondent is a person who \u201cassists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place\u201d or at least \u201cappears\u201d to do so. The fact that by subs. 2(b) of s. 176 everyone who, as agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction cannot by itself restrict the broad meaning given by Parliament to the word \u201ckeeper\u201d in s. 168. There are many examples where the Crown may proceed summarily or by indictment.\nI can come to no conclusion other than that when Parliament widened the definition of a \u201ckeeper\u201d, a person who falls within that definition \u201ckeeps\u201d a \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d within s. 176(1). If a tenant of a house operates it as a common gaming house, without the knowledge of the owner, the latter cannot be said to \u201cknowingly\u201d permit a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or a common betting house.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The respondent was charged with keeping a common gaming house, contrary to the provisions of subs. (1) of s. 176 of the Criminal Code. The facts, which are not in dispute, are as follows:\nKerim Brothers Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe company\u201d) for some years has been the registered owner of the Kingsway Hotel, in Metropolitan Toronto. The company was licensed to carry on the business of a public hall and to sell refreshments and cigarettes. The premises have, on occasion, been used for dances, banquets, receptions, business displays and other purposes. From about February of 1959 to June of 1961 the company leased its hall, on four successive nights of each week, to four different religious and charitable organizations, which conducted bingo games, the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes.\nThese organizations, in each case, made their own arrangements for the conduct of the games, supplying their own equipment and personnel for that purpose. They paid to the company a standard rental per night for the use of the hall, which was not in any way dependent upon the number of persons who played in the games.\nThe respondent was the president of the company and was on the premises each evening, but he did not, himself, participate in any way in the bingo games. The company did employ a commissionaire and it operated a soft drinks refreshment stand.\nThe respondent was convicted of the offence charged, but the conviction was quashed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[3]. From that decision the Crown has now appealed. The relevant sections of the Criminal Code are the following:\n168. (1) In this Part,\n* * *\n(d) \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d means a place that is\n(i) kept for gain to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games; or\n(ii) kept or used for the purpose of playing games\n* * *\n(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or\n* * *\n(h) \u201ckeeper\u201d includes a person who\n(i) is an owner or occupier of a place,\n(ii) assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,\n(iii) appears to be, or to assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,\n(iv) has the care or management of a place, or\n(v) uses a place permanently or temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier; and\n(i) \u201cplace\u201d includes any place, whether or not\n(i) it is covered or enclosed,\n(ii) it is used permanently or temporarily, or\n(iii) any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it.\n* * *\n176. (1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n(2) Every one who\n(a) is found, without lawful excuse, in a common gaming house or common betting house, or\n(b) as owner, landlord, lessor, tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house,\nis guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nAs previously mentioned, the charge was laid under subs. (1) of s. 176 and the question in issue is whether, upon these facts, the respondent was \u201cone who keeps a common gaming house\u201d.\nThe submission of the Crown is that the respondent, on these facts, was a \u201ckeeper\u201d, within the definition of that word, that the hall was a \u201ccommon gaming house\u201d, within the definition of that term, and that, therefore, the respondent was \u201cone who keeps a common gaming house\u201d, within s. 176(1). The position of the respondent is that a person who is a keeper, within the definition, is not necessarily one who keeps a common gaming house, within the meaning of s. 176(1), and this contention is supported on the ground that the word \u201ckeeper\u201d is not used in that subsection and that specific provision was made in subs. (2)(b) for a lesser offence, punishable on summary conviction, in respect of classes of persons a member of which would fall within the definition of a keeper, who \u201cknowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house\u201d. It is argued that if a keeper, within the definition, is automatically guilty of an offence under subs. (1), because the place of which he is a keeper is used by others as a common gaming house, then there was no need to create the lesser offence, defined in subs. (2)(b).\nOn the facts, it would appear that the respondent fell within the definition of a keeper. It also appears that persons resorted to the premises in question for the purpose of playing games and that the premises were used for that purpose, so as to constitute them a common gaming house within the definition.\nThe definition of a keeper in s. 168(1) (h) is a very broad one and it relates to the keeper of a \u201cplace\u201d, which is also broadly defined. Every householder and, indeed, every landowner is a keeper within that definition. But this, of course, in itself, constitutes no offence. The offence defined in s. 176(1) is the keeping of a common gaming house. The question is, if the \u201cplace\u201d is used in a manner which constitutes it a common gaming house, does everyone who falls within the definition of a keeper of that place automatically keep the common gaming house? In my opinion that conclusion does not follow. The offence is the keeping of the common gaming house, and, in my opinion, in order to constitute that offence, there must be something more than the keeping of a place whose use, by someone other than the accused, makes it a common gaming house. I do not, for example, see how the owner of a house leased to a tenant, who; without his knowledge, operates it as a common gaming house, could possibly be found guilty of the offence. What then is the position of a \u201ckeeper\u201d who does not in any way participate in the operation of the games played, but who knows that the place in question is being used for that purpose, and who permits such use? This, it appears to me, is the sort of situation which was contemplated when the offence defined in s. 176(2) (b) was created and, in my opinion, that offence must have been created because it was not contemplated that such a person was, himself, keeping the common gaming house within the meaning of s. 176(1).\nI agree with the conclusion reached by Laidlaw J.A., in the Court below, that the offence defined in s. 176(1) involves some act of participation in the wrongful use of the place and that the evidence in this case does not establish any such participation on the part of the respondent.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed, KERWIN C.J. and TASCHEREAU J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Ontario: W.C. Bowman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Willis & Dingwall, Toronto.\n[1] (1962), 38 C.R. 71, 132 C.C.C. 186.\n[2] (1962), 38 C.R. 71, 132 C.C.C. 186.\n[3] (1962), 38 C.R. 71, 132 C.C.C. 186.\n"

It then granted to I Co., by sub-lease, part of the ore located on the property with the right to mine it. I Co. agreed to pay the respondent a royalty on all ore shipped. I Co. also undertook to mine for the respondent the ore from the property which the latter had retained. What followed was a single uniform operation whereby ore was extracted from a single mine, transported and sold. In 1956 (well within the 36 months mentioned in s. 83(5)), the respondent received over $3 million from I Co. as royalties under the sub-lease, in addition to the proceeds of the sale of its share of the ore, which proceeds were conceded to be tax-exempt. The Minister argued that the royalties were not tax-exempt since the mine was not being operated by the respondent and that the source to the respondent of the royalties was the property right for which they were payable and not the operation of a mine. The Exchequer Court ruled in favour of the respondent. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe royalties were exempt from tax as income \"derived from the operation of a mine\" within the meaning of s. 83(5) of the Act. The word \"derived\" in the context of the section is broader than \"received\" and is equivalent to \"arising or accruing\"; the expression is not limited to income arising or accruing from the operation of a mine by a particular taxpayer.\nThe mine was operated as a unit by the respondent and I Co. as a joint venture for their joint benefit, and the ore in place represented a capital investment of both companies. A return on that capital could be realized only through the operation of the mine, and, in the circumstances here, such operation was the source of the respondent's income within the meaning of s. 83(5), whether that income came from the extraction and sale of its own ore or from the royalties paid to it with respect to the remainder of the ore belonging to I Co.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a ruling of the Minister of National Revenue. Appeal dismissed.\nPaul Ollivier, for the appellant.\nH. H. Stikeman, Q.C., C. G. Cowan, P. N. Thorsteinsson and D. J. Johnston, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada2, allowing respondent's appeal from assessment of income tax for the year 1956. The sole question at issue is whether respondent is entitled to claim exemption from taxation with respect to a sum of $3,182,936.93, as being income derived from the operation of a mine, within the meaning of s. 83(5) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, enacted by 3-4 Eliz. II, c. 54, which reads:\n83. (5) Subject to prescribed conditions, there shall not be included in computing the income of a corporation income derived from the operation of a mine during the period of 36 months commencing with the day on which the mine came into production. The material facts are not in dispute. The respondent is a corporation organized under The Quebec Mining Companies' Act and from 1943 to 1949 expended substantial amounts in exploration work and diamond drilling to prove up certain iron ore deposits in the province of Quebec.\nIn February 1953, under appropriate legislative authority, respondent was granted by the Crown an \"operating licence in the form of a lease\" by which it obtained, inter alia, the right to mine and take iron ore from a tract of land in the northern part of the province.\nAfter obtaining this licence respondent, by what is referred to as a sublease, granted to Iron Ore Company of Canada certain proportions of the iron ore located on the said tract of land, with the right to mine and carry away the ore so granted. The consideration for this grant, as set out in the sublease, consisted of (a) a payment of $100,000 per year to be made to the Province of Quebec, (b) the sublessee's share of the duties payable under the Quebec Mining Act, and (c)\nan overriding royalty on all iron ore and specialties shipped by the Sublessee under this Sublease from any mines upon the described lands (except iron ore and specialties shipped for the account of the Sublessor) and sold and delivered each year by the Sublessee, of seven per cent of the then competitive market price f.o.b. vessels at Seven Islands, Quebec (determined as provided in Section 2 of the Mutual Covenants of this Sublease) for each grade and kind of such iron ore and specialties, which the Sublessee binds itself to pay to the sublessor during the term hereof; provided however, that, in the event seven per cent of such competitive market price for any grade or kind of such iron ore or specialties shall be less than twenty-five cents a ton, then the overriding royalty on such iron ore and specialties shall be twenty-five cents a ton.\nThe contract also provided that, beginning with the year 1955, Iron Ore Company of Canada should pay royalty based on a certain minimum tonnage of iron ore per year, but counsel for appellant stated that this provision has no bearing on the present appeal.\nIn December 1949, Iron Ore Company of Canada entered into a management contract with Hollinger-Hanna Limited, whereby the latter undertook to provide management services and supervision of the operations and properties of Iron Ore Company of Canada.\nIn June 1954, the respondent made a similar contract with Hollinger-Hanna Limited for the management of the respondent's iron ore operations and properties not subleased to Iron Ore Company of Canada. In March 1955, the respondent made a further contract with Iron Ore Company of Canada whereby the latter undertook to mine for the respondent iron ore from the retained undivided interest of the respondent which had not been subleased to Iron Ore Company of Canada.\nWhat followed was a single uniform operation whereby iron ore was extracted from a single mine, transported to Sept-Iles, Quebec, and sold. The sale price of the ore was received by the management company, Hollinger-Hanna Limited, which after deducting its charges, remitted to the respondent the amount representing the proceeds of sale of its share of the ore. The appellant concedes that this sum is not to be included in the respondent's income for the 1956 taxation year by virtue of the provisions of section 83(5) of the Income Tax Act.\nHollinger-Hanna Limited also paid to Iron Ore Company of Canada the amount representing the proceeds of sale of the latter's share of the iron ore and from this amount Iron Ore Company of Canada then paid to the respondent the overriding royalty payable under the sublease, which in 1956 amounted to $3,182,936.93. The appellant included this amount in computing respondent's income for the year 1956, although it is common ground that the whole of that year was within the period of 36 months after the mine came into production.\nShortly stated, appellant's position is (1) that the expression \"income derived from the operation of a mine\" in s. 83(5) refers to income from a particular source namely the operation of a mine, (2) that the operation of a mine being a business, the income exempted from taxation is the profit from such business received by the particular corporation claiming the exemption, and (3) that the source to respondent of the income in issue here was merely the property right for which royalty was payable and not the operation of a mine.\nI share the view expressed by the learned trial judge that the ordinary meaning of the words \"derived from the operation of a mine\" is broader than that contended for by appellant, that the word \"derived\" in this context is broader than \"received\" and is equivalent to \"arising or accruing\" (vide Commissioner of Taxation v. Kirk3) and that the expression is not limited to income arising or accruing from the operation of a mine by a particular taxpayer.\nThe mine in question was operated as a unit by respondent and Iron Ore Company of Canada as a joint venture for their joint benefit, and the ore in place represented a capital investment of both companies. A return on that capital investment could be realized only through the operation of the mine, and in the circumstances here, in my opinion, such operation was the source of respondent's income within the meaning of s. 83(5), whether that income came from the extraction and sale of its own ore or from the royalty paid to it with respect to the remainder of the ore belonging to the Iron Ore Company of Canada.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

The defendant KVOS Inc. operated a radio and television station in the State of Washington. It was alleged that this company had communicated, by radio communication of television programmes beamed at Canada, musical works within the repertoire of the plaintiff. It was also alleged that the company's president, the defendant J, had caused or authorized such communication. An order was made by Dumoulin J. permitting the plaintiff to serve a notice of statement of claim on each of the non-resident defendants. Subsequently, an application to set aside that order was granted by Thorson P. Pursuant to leave, the plaintiff appealed from the latter order.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe power to grant an order for service ex juris was given by s. 75(1) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98. The combined effect of that section and of Rules 76 and 42 of the Exchequer Court was to make applicable Order XI of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. Muzak Corporation v. Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada Ltd., [1953] 2 S.C.R. 182, referred to.\nThe submission that Thorson P. was without jurisdiction to make the order setting aside the order for service ex juris was rejected. The application to the President was not an application for recission of, or an appeal from, the prior order, but was an application by a party, who had not appeared on the initial application, to set the order aside. The English practice which, pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of the Exchequer Court, would become applicable, is that such an order, obtained ex parte, can be set aside, upon the application of the defendant, after service.\nThe affidavit of the executive assistant to the general manager of the plaintiff in support of the plaintiff's application for an order ex juris stated the deponent's belief that the plaintiff had a good cause of action. It stated that to the best of his knowledge and belief the facts set out in the statement of claim were true. The facts stated in the statement of claim clearly showed where the two non-resident defendants were or might probably be found. Those two matters were all that was required by s. 75 of the Act and by Rule 76. In addition to those matters Rule 4 of Order XI required the affidavit to show whether or not the defendant was a British subject. However, under s. 75 of the Act, there was no necessity for a statement in the affidavit, in proceedings in the Exchequer Court, as to whether or not the defendant was a British subject. The final requirement of Rule 4 that the affidavit state the grounds on which the application is made was considered to have been met.\nThis was a proper case for an order for service ex juris within the requirements of the concluding words of Rule 4. The test to be applied was whether the plaintiff had \"a good arguable case\". On the basis of the allegations contained in the statement of claim and the other material which was before the President, the plaintiff had such a case.\nAPPEAL from an order of Thorson P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, setting aside a prior order for service out of the jurisdiction. Appeal allowed.\nM. B. K. Gordon, Q.C., and J. J. Ellis, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nCuthbert Scott, Q.C., and G. S. Hugh-Jones, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal, pursuant to leave, from an order of the learned President of the Exchequer Court2, setting aside a prior order, made by Dumoulin J., ex parte, giving leave to serve out of the jurisdiction two of the defendants in this action.\nThe action is against four defendants for infringement of the appellant's copyright in certain musical works. The statement of claim alleges that KVOS Inc. (which is now named \"International Good Music, Inc.\" and which is hereinafter referred to as \"the American company\") was incorporated in the State of Washington, with its principal place of business in the town of Bellingham, in that State, and that KVOS (Canada) Ltd. (now named \"Rogan Properties Ltd.\" and hereinafter referred to as \"the Canadian company\") is its subsidiary. The respondent Jones is stated to reside in Bellingham and to be a director of both companies. The respondent Reid is stated to reside in the City of Vancouver and to be the manager of the Canadian company. It is further alleged, inter alia, that the American company has communicated, by radio communication of television programmes beamed at Canada, and particularly at the Province of British Columbia, musical works within the 'repertoire of the appellant and that the respondent Jones has caused or authorized such communication.\nThe affidavit in support of the appellant's application for an order for service ex juris was that of John V. Mills, the executive assistant to the general manager of the appellant, and it read as follows:\n1. That I am executive assistant to the General Manager of the plaintiff herein and as such have knowledge of the facts herein deposed to.\n2. That I have read the statement of claim filed herein and can say of my own knowledge or alternatively as a result of enquiries I made personally of various people in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, including the British Columbia agent of the plaintiff herein and the defendant Gordon Munro Reid, that to the best of my knowledge and belief the facts set out in the statement of claim are true.\n3. That I have been advised by Counsel for the plaintiff and do verily believe that the plaintiff has a good cause of action against all the defendants herein.\nUpon this material the order for service ex juris, upon the American company and upon the respondent Jones, was made. Upon the application to set aside that order, there was filed an affidavit of the respondent Jones, of the City of Bellingham, in the State of Washington, in which he stated, inter alia, that he was the president of the American company, which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington, having its head office in the City of Bellingham, in that State, and which operated the business of a radio and television station in that State, the transmitter being situated on Orcas Island, in the State of Washington. In cross-examination on his affidavit, he acknowledged that he was responsible for the operation of that station. He also testified that the major part of the viewing and listening audience of programmes from that station, roughly 80 per cent, was in Canada.\nAnother affidavit was filed of the respondent Reid. He was also cross-examined on his affidavit and on this cross-examination there was filed, as an exhibit, an advertising brochure, paid for by the American company, which stated that the American company's transmitter was located 39 air miles from Vancouver and 30 air miles from Victoria. A map, which formed part of the brochure, showed the station on Orcas Island and indicated that over 1,000,000 people in British Columbia were within its reach, and 300,000 in northwestern Washington.\nThe power to grant an order for service ex juris is given by s. 75(1) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, which provides:\n75. (1) When a defendant, whether a British subject or a foreigner, is out of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court and whether in Her Majesty's dominions or in a foreign country, the Court or a judge, upon application, supported by affidavit or other evidence, stating that, in the belief of the deponent, the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, may order that a notice of the information, petition of right, or statement of claim be served on the defendant in such place or country or within such limits as the Court or a judge thinks fit to direct.\nRules 76 and 42 of the Exchequer Court Rules provide as follows:\nRULE 76\nService out of jurisdiction\nWhen a defendant is out of the jurisdiction of the Court, then upon application, supported by affidavit or other evidence, stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, the Court or a Judge may order that a notice of the information, petition of right, statement of claim or other judicial proceeding be served on the defendant in such place or country or within such limits as the Court or a Judge thinks fit to direct, and the order is, in such case, to limit a time (depending on the place of service) within which the defendant is to file his statement in defence, plea, answer or exception, or otherwise make his defence according to the practice applicable to the particular case, or obtain from the Court or a Judge further time to do so.\nRULE 42\nPractice and procedure not provided for by Statute or by these Rules\nIn any proceeding in the Exchequer Court respecting any patent of invention, copyright, trade mark or industrial design, the practice and procedure shall, in any matter not provided for by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or by the Rules of this Court (but subject always thereto) conform to, and be regulated by, as near as may be, the practice and procedure for the time being in force in similar proceedings in Her Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England.\nIn the case of Muzak Corporation v. Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada, Limited3, three of the five Judges who sat expressed the view that the combined effect of s. 75 of the Exchequer Court Act and of Rules 76 and 42, above cited, was to make applicable Order XI of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. The other two members of the Court expressed no opinion on this point.\nThe relevant portions of Rules 1 and 4 of that Order are as follows:\n1. Except in the case of a writ to which Rule 1A of this Order applies, service out of the jurisdiction of a writ of summons or notice of a writ of summons may be allowed by the Court or a Judge whenever\n* * *\n(ee) The action is founded on a tort committed within the jurisdiction; or\n* * *\n4. Every application for leave to serve such writ or notice on a defendant out of the jurisdiction shall be supported by affidavit or other evidence, stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, and whether such defendant is a British subject or not, and the grounds upon which the application is made; and no such leave shall be granted unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court or Judge that the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Order.\nCounsel for the appellant, at the outset, contended that the learned President was without jurisdiction to make the order setting aside the order for service ex juris. He submitted that after the order of Dumoulin J. had been made it must stand, unless it was rescinded by him pursuant to Rule 259 of the Rules of the Exchequer Court, or unless an appeal was successfully taken from it to this Court under s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nI do not agree with this submission. The initial order was made by Dumoulin J., ex parte. The application to the learned President was not an application for rescission of, or an appeal from, that order, but was an application by a party, who had not appeared on the initial application, to set the order aside. The English practice which, pursuant to Rule 42, would become applicable is that such an order, obtained ex parte, can be set aside, upon the aplication of a defendant, after service. (See The Annual Practice, 1963, vol. I, p. 154.)\nIt, therefore, becomes necessary to consider the matter upon the merits. The learned President, in his reasons for setting aside the order, was of the opinion that the material in the affidavit in support of the order was plainly insufficient to enable the judge to whom the application was made to exercise his discretion to grant it. In his opinion, the affidavit of Mills was inadequate, because it did not show in what place or country the American company and the respondent Jones were or probably might be found; that it did not state the facts which, if proved, would be a sufficient foundation for the action; and that it did not state any grounds for the application. He pointed out that the affidavit did not specify, except as to the respondent Reid, the source of Mills' information.\nWhile the form of Mills' affidavit may be subject to some criticism, I would not be prepared to find that it was totally insufficient to warrant Dumoulin J. in making the order which he did. The affidavit states the deponent's belief that the appellant has a good cause of action. It states that to the best of his knowledge and belief the facts set out in the statement of claim are true. The facts stated in the statement of claim clearly show where the American company and the respondent Jones are or might probably be found.\nThose two matters are all that is required by s. 75 of the Act and by Rule 76. In addition to those matters, Rule 4 of Order XI requires the affidavit to show whether or not the defendant is a British subject. This requirement arises because, under Rule 6 of Order XI, when the defendant is neither a British subject nor in the British Dominions, notice of the writ, and not the writ itself, is to be served upon him. However, s. 75 of the Exchequer Court Act begins with the words \"When a defendant, whether a British subject or a foreigner, is out of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court \u2026\" and then it goes on to provide for service of a notice of the information, petition of right, or statement of claim. There is, therefore, no necessity for a statement in the affidavit, in proceedings in the Exchequer Court, as to whether or not the defendant is a British subject.\nThe final requirement of Rule 4 is that the affidavit state the grounds on which the application is made. When the affidavit in this case is read in conjunction with the statement of claim, it appears to me that it sufficiently alleges that the appellant's claim is that the respondents have committed a tort in Canada by the transmission of programmes, beamed at Canada, in which musical works, in respect of which the appellant had a copyright, were played. However, in any event, when there is added to what is contained in Mills' affidavit the affidavit of the respondent Jones, and the cross-examinations of the respondents Jones and Reid upon their respective affidavits, in my opinion, the formal requirements of Rule 4 have been met.\nThis does not end the matter, because the learned President was of the opinion that this was not a proper case for an order for service ex juris within the requirements of the concluding words of Rule 4. He considered that, on an examination of all of the material before him, there was nothing to indicate an infringement of the appellant's copyright, and he went on to say:\n\u2026 I am unable to see how it could reasonably be said that this right was infringed by a broadcast or telecast of a programme emanating from a television station outside Canada, even if such programme included musical works which would in Canada be within the plaintiff's repertoire and in which it would have in Canada the copyright referred to and even if the programme was beamed towards Canada in order to reach Canadian audiences. There is nothing to indicate the commission of any tort in Canada.\nThere is no dispute as to the tests which have been established for the application of Rules 1 and 4 of Order XI. They were stated by the present Chief Justice of this Court in the Muzak case, in which the disagreement between the majority and the minority was not as to the tests to be applied, but as to whether or not the facts in that case met those tests. The Chief Justice, at p. 187, cited extracts from the judgment of Lord Davey in Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz v. Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik4 and from that of Lord Simonds in Vitkovice Horni A Hutni Tezirstvo v. Korner5, as follows:\n\u2026. Lord Davey said at page 735:\nThis does not, of course, mean that a mere statement by any deponent who is put forward to make the affidavit that he believes that there is a good cause of action is sufficient. On the other hand, the court is not, on an application for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction, or on a motion made to discharge an order for such service, called upon to try the action or express a premature opinion on its merits,\n* * *\nIf the Court is judicially satisfied that the alleged facts, if proved, will not support the action, I think the court ought to say so, and dismiss the application or discharge the order. But where there is a substantial legal question arising on the facts disclosed by the affidavits which the plaintiff bon\u00e2 fide desires to try, I think that the court should, as a rule, allow the service of the writ. In Vitkovice Horni A Hutni Tezirstvo v. Korner, Lord Simonds stated at page 878\n\u2026 the obligation of the plaintiff is, not to \"satisfy\" the court that he is right, but to make it sufficiently appear \u2026 that the case is a \"proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this order.\"\nReferring to the remarks of Lord Davey in 90 L.T.R., p. 735, (supra) Lord Simonds, at page 879, stated:\nIt is, no doubt, difficult to say precisely what test must be passed for an applicant to make it sufficiently appear that the case is a proper one\nand at page 880:\nThe description \"a good arguable case\" has been suggested and I do not quarrel with it.\nThe Chief Justice adopted the test of \"a good arguable case\" and that is the test which the learned President states, in his reasons, should be applied in the present case.\nWith great respect, I am not in agreement with the conclusion which the latter has reached in applying that test. The issue which would have to be determined in the present case, if it is tried, is as to whether a person who operates a television transmitter outside Canada, but with the primary object of transmitting programmes for reception in Canada, can be held to have communicated a musical work by radio communication in Canada, so as to have infringed the rights of the holder of the Canadian copyright in such work.\nThis is a matter on which there does not appear to be any direct authority. The closest analogy which was brought to our attention by counsel is that in the case of Jenner v. Sun Oil Co. Ltd.6, which dealt with an application to set aside an order for service ex juris. The issue raised in that case was as to whether, when defamatory statements were broadcast in the United States and received in Ontario, a tort had been committed in Ontario. McRuer C.J.H.C. reached the conclusion that there was \"a good arguable case\" that the defamatory words were so transmitted as to be published within Ontario.\nI have not formed, and would not, at this stage of the proceedings, wish to express, an opinion as to whether or not, assuming as established the allegations contained in the statement of claim, the appellant has a good cause of action against the respondents, but I am satisfied that, on the basis of those allegations and the other material which was before the learned President, the appellant has got \"a good arguable case\". To me it seems arguable that a person who has held himself out to advertisers as being able to communicate, by means of his American television transmitter, with some 1,000,000 persons in British Columbia, if he transmits musical works, of which the appellant has the Canadian copyright, to viewers in Canada who receive such programmes, has thereby communicated in Canada such musical works by radio communication, within the provisions of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 55. The purpose of this action is to determine that very legal point and, in my opinion, it should not be determined at this stage of the proceedings, but ought to be tried.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the order for service ex juris should not have been set aside and the present appeal should be allowed, with costs, in the cause, to the appellant in this Court and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintif, appellant: Smart and Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Farris, Stultz, Bull & Farris, Vancouver.\n1 (1962), 38 C.P.R. 237.\n2 (1962), 38 C.P.R. 237.\n3 [1953] 2 S.C.R. 182, 19 CP.R. 1.\n4 (1904), 90 L.T.R. 733.\n5 [1951] A.C. 869, 2 All E.R. 334.\n6 [1952] O.R. 240, 2 D.L.R. 526.\n"

E Co., a Delaware corporation, sent an offer to the shareholders of I Co. to purchase all the outstanding shares of that company. E Co. was a wholly owned subsidiary of S Co., a New Jersey corporation, and I Co. was incorporated under the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 53. The offer was to remain open for a period of not less than four months as required by s. 128(1) of the Companies Act. It also stated that S Co. was the owner of 96 per cent of the outstanding shares of I Co. and had indicated its intention to accept the offer and that consequently, E Co. expected to be in a position to give notice under the provisions of s. 128(1) for the compulsory acquisition of the shares of all shareholders who did not accept the offer. S Co. accepted within the four-month period but during that time holders of less than 90 per cent of the free shares accepted.\nE Co. obtained an ex parte order under s. 128 authorizing it to give notice to the dissenting shareholders for the compulsory acquisition of their shares unless these shareholders moved for an \u201corder otherwise\u201d. Two such motions were made by certain dissenting shareholders (the present respondents). These motions, each of which sought an order setting aside the ex parte order and a declaration that E Co. was not entitled nor bound to acquire the common shares of the dissenting shareholders, were unsuccessful. Appeals from the orders dismissing both motions were allowed by the Court of Appeal, one member dissenting. E Co. appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was substantial identity of interest between the majority shareholder of I Co. and the transferee company. With this identity of interest the whole proceeding was a sham with a foregone conclusion, for the purpose of expropriating a minority interest on terms set by the majority. The promoting force throughout was obviously that of S Co. and not its subsidiary. A transfer of shares from S Co. to E Co. was meaningless in these circumstances as affording any indication of a transaction which the Court ought to approve as representing the wishes of 90 per cent of the shareholders (the percentage required by s. 128(1)). Here the 90 per cent was not independent. The section contemplated the acquisition of 90 per cent of the total issued shares of the class affected and that this 90 per cent must be independently held.\nRe Hoare & Co. Ltd.

Chalmers, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which, on appeal from Wells J., rejected an application of Esso Standard (Inter-America) Inc., made under s. 128 of the Dominion Companies Act for the compulsory acquisition of certain minority shares of International Petroleum Company Limited. At the original hearing, Wells J. had made an order for the acquisition of these shares. Section 128(1) reads:\n(1) Where any contract involving the transfer of shares or any class of shares in a company (in this section referred to as \u201cthe transferor company\u201d) to any other company (in this section referred to as \u201cthe transferee company\u2019\u201d) has, within four months after the making of the offer in that behalf by the transferee company, been approved by the holders of not less than nine-tenths of the shares affected, or not less than nine-tenths of each class of shares affected, if more than one class of shares is affected, the transferee company may, at any time within two months after the expiration of the said four months, give notice, in such manner as may be prescribed by the court in the province in which the head office of the transferor company is situate, to any dissenting shareholder that it desires to acquire his shares, and where such notice is given the transferee company is, unless on an application made by the dissenting shareholder within one month from the date on which the notice was given the court thinks fit to order otherwise, entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms on which, under the contract, the shares of the approving shareholders are to be transferred to the transferee company.\nThe respondents are dissenting shareholders who hold approximately 20,000 shares.\nOn January 12, 1960, Esso Standard sent an offer to the shareholders of International Petroleum Company Limited to purchase all the outstanding shares of this company at a price of $45 U.S. per share. This offer was to remain open for a period of not less than four months as required by the section. It also stated that Esso Standard was an affiliate of Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and that this company was the owner of 96 per cent of the outstanding shares of International Petroleum and had indicated its intention to accept the offer of $45 per share and that consequently, Esso Standard expected to be in a position to give notice under the provisions of s. 128(1) for the compulsory acquisition of the shares of all shareholders who did not accept the offer of $45 per share.\nEsso Standard is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and the whole of its issued and outstanding shares were at the date of the offer and at the date of the hearing owned by Standard Oil Company (New Jersey). The following table shows the shareholdings of International Petroleum at the date of the offer, January 12, 1960:\nIssued and outstanding.......................................\n14,568,583\nHeld by Standard Oil of New Jersey..................\n14,095,917 (96.75%)\nHeld by 3,423 other shareholders......................\n474,660\nOutstanding options for shares..........................\n2,400\nBy May 12, 1960, four months after the date of the offer, 2,478 shareholders, holding 377,281 shares had accepted. This was, of course, less than 90 per cent of the free shares. By November 21, 1960, 3,054 shareholders, holding 434,146 shares, had accepted.\nThus, at the date of the hearing before Wells J., out of the shares held by shareholders other than Standard Oil of New Jersey, there were only approximately 40,000 shares the owners of which had not accepted the offer. About half of these outstanding shares are held by the respondents. Standard Oil of New Jersey accepted within the four-month period.\nOn May 18, 1960, the Court made an ex parte order under s. 128 authorizing Esso Standard to give notice to the dissenting shareholders for the compulsory acquisition of their shares at $45 per share unless these shareholders made a motion to the contrary within the statutory period of one month.\nWithin one month two such motions were made by certain dissenting shareholders, who are the respondents in this appeal. Each motion sought an order setting aside the ex parte order of May 18, 1960, and a declaration that Esso Standard was not entitled nor bound to acquire the common shares of the dissenting shareholders. Wells J. dismissed both motions on August 31, 1961.\nOn April 12, 1962, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeals from the orders of Wells J. and declared that \u201cEsso Standard (Inter-America) Inc., is not entitled nor bound to acquire the shares of the appellants or any of them in International Petroleum Company Limited\u201d. Schroeder J.A. dissented and would have dismissed the appeals.\nSection 128 of the Canadian Act is based upon a section of the English Companies Act which now appears as s. 209 of the Companies Act of 1948. The English section was first enacted in 1929 and the Canadian section in 1934. One significant difference between the two Acts is that the English Act provides that in computing the nine-tenths of the shares affected, there shall not be included \u201cshares already held at the date of the offer by or by a nominee for the transferee company or its subsidiary\u201d.\nAt the date of the offer, January 12, 1960, Esso Standard held no shares of International Petroleum but it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, which held on that date 96.75 per cent of the issued shares. It is apparent that if s. 128 permitted Esso Standard to do what it proposed to do, the transfer of this 96.75 per cent would follow as a matter of course and that the necessary percentage would be obtained at one stroke. The outside shareholders were told this in the notice or offer.\nThe reported cases on the sections, both in England and Canada, have been comparatively few. There was little guidance to be found in the legislation itself on the principles to be applied in considering a dissenting shareholder\u2019s application for an \u201corder otherwise\u201d under the section. These were first formulated by Maugham J. in Re Hoare & Company Limited[2], and followed\u2014it seems to me with increasing emphasis on the difficulties in the way of a dissenting shareholder\u2014in three other cases. These were In re Evertite Locknuts, Limited[3]; In re Press Caps Limited[4]; and In re Sussex Brick Company Limited[5] (decided in 1959 but reported in 1961). The matter is summarized in Palmer\u2019s Company Law, 20th ed., at p. 691:\nWhen an application is made to the court by a shareholder who alleges that the terms are not fair, the onus is upon the applicant to establish his allegation. The court will attach considerable weight to the fact that the large body of shareholders have accepted the offer. An application by a shareholder must allege unfairness; it is not sufficient merely to say that insufficient information was given; discovery will not be allowed, upon such an application, to enable the shareholder to establish his case.\nIn each of these cases there was, I think, a true \u201ctakeover bid\u201d where, with more than 90 per cent of the shares of the transferor company held by independent shareholders, the transferee company had acquired 90 per cent of the total outstanding shares. This was certainly so in Re Hoare and in Re Press Caps Limited, according to the statement of Evershed M.R. in Re Bugle Press Limited[6].\nIt is at once apparent that on the facts there is no resemblance between Esso\u2019s position in the present case and the first four English cases above referred to and, in my opinion, these cases give no guidance on what should be done in the present case.\nI agree with Laidlaw J.A. that in this case the Court should grant the dissenting shareholders\u2019 applications for \u201corder otherwise\u201d for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal in England in the case of In re Bugle Press, supra.\nThe shares involved in the Bugle Press case were those of a small publishing company with an issued share capital of 10,000 shares of \u00a31 each. Two majority shareholders held 4,500 shares each and the third, 1,000 shares. The majority shareholders wished to buy out the minority shareholder and had made him a private offer which he had rejected. They then caused a transferee company to be incorporated of which they held all the outstanding shares. This transferee company then made an offer of \u00a310 per share to all three shareholders. The \u00a310 per share was based on a valuation made by a firm of chartered accountants and was less than the private offer that had previously been made. The immediate result of the offer of the transferee company at \u00a310 per share was the acquisition of 90 per cent of the shares of the transferor company from the two majority shareholders. The transferee company then gave notice of its intention to exercise its powers of compulsory acquisition under s. 209 of the Companies Act, 1948. The minority shareholder moved for a declaration similar to the one sought in the present case, that the transferee company was neither entitled nor bound to acquire his shares on the terms offered notwithstanding the approval of nine-tenths of the shareholders.\nBuckley J. made the order sought by the minority shareholder. He held that in the circumstances of this particular case the onus was on the transferee company to show that the scheme was one which the minority shareholder ought to be compelled to accept. This was a reversal of the onus placed on the dissenting shareholder in the ordinary case to show unfairness. He also held that when the 90 per cent majority shareholders are themselves in substance the transferee company, the Court ought to \u201corder otherwise\u201d when compulsory acquisition is sought.\nThe Court of Appeal, in affirming Buckley J., founded its judgment upon his second ground\u2014substantial identity of interest between the majority shareholders and the transferee company. With this identity of interest the whole proceeding, as Laidlaw J.A. stated it, is a sham with a foregone conclusion, for the purpose of expropriating a minority interest on terms set by the majority. Evershed M.R., at p. 286, said:\nEven, therefore, though the present case does fall strictly within the terms of section 209, the fact that the offeror, the transferee company, is for all practical purposes entirely equivalent to the nine-tenths of the shareholders who have accepted the offer, makes it in my judgment a case in which, for the purposes of exercising the court\u2019s discretion, the circumstances are special\u2014a case, therefore, of a kind contemplated by Maugham J. to which his general rule would not be applicable. It is no doubt true to say that it is still for the minority shareholder to establish that the discretion should be exercised in the way he seeks. That, I think, agreeing with Mr. Instone, follows from the language of the section which uses the formula which I have already more than once read \u201cunless on an application made by the dissenting shareholder the court thinks fit to order otherwise.\u201d But if the minority shareholder does show, as he shows here, that the offeror and the 90 per cent. of the transferor company\u2019s shareholders are the same, then as it seems to me he has, prima facie, shown that the court ought otherwise to order, since if it should not so do the result would be, as Mr. Instone concedes, that the section has been used not for the purpose of any scheme or contract properly so called or contemplated by the section but for the quite different purpose of enabling majority shareholders to expropriate or evict the minority; and that, as it seems to me, is something for the purposes of which, prima facie, the court ought not to allow the section to be invoked\u2014unless at any rate it were shown that there was some good reason in the interests of the company for so doing, for example, that the minority shareholder was in some way acting in a manner destructive or highy damaging to the interests of the company from some motives entirely of his own.\nEvershed M.R. did not base his judgment on the proviso in the English section that in computing the nine-tenths of the shares affected there should not be included \u201cshares already held at the date of the offer by, or by a nominee for, the transferee or its subsidiary\u201d. Although the case was within the standard of computation laid down by the section and the shares were not held in the manner stated in the exclusion, the Court should \u201corder otherwise\u201d because the section was not intended to cover this kind of case.\nThere is no distinction between Bugle Press and the present case either on fact or law. This was the opinion of Laidlaw J.A. and I fully agree. We have here 90 per cent ownership in Standard Oil Company (New Jersey). The promoting force throughout is obviously that of Standard Oil and not its subsidiary. A transfer of shares from Standard Oil to Esso Standard is meaningless in these circumstances as affording any indication of a transaction which the Court ought to approve as representing the wishes of 90 per cent of the shareholders. This 90 per cent is not independent. On this ground alone I would reject the appeal and hold that the section contemplates the acquisition of 90 per cent of the total issued shares of the class affected and that this 90 per cent must be independently held.\nEsso Standard cannot strengthen its position by pointing to the extent of its acquisition of the independent shares. These constituted less than 4 per cent of the total issue and even then, as I have pointed out above, it did not acquire 90 per cent of those shares within the four\u2011month period.\nWells J. and Schroeder J.A. were impressed by this large acquisition of the independent shares. They thought that this was sufficient to enable them to find that a substantial number of shareholders of International Petroleum had by their acceptance expressed their favourable opinion of the offer (which was almost 50 per cent above the stock exchange quotation) and that the dissenting shareholders had not satisfied them of the unfairness of the offer. It is very difficult to draw this kind of inference from the facts of this case. Although the number of shares held by independent shareholders is large, the percentage of the total issued shares that they represented is very small. It is, further, difficult to infer to what extent these independent shareholders were influenced by the terms of the offer when they were told that the matter was a foregone conclusion. It is also very difficult to draw any inference as to value from stock exchange quotations when more than 90 per cent of the shares are held by one shareholder.\nThe extent of the acquisition and evidence of value are, however, irrelevant in this case and I found my judgment solely on the principle set out in Bugle Press. I think that it was foreseen in the obiter opinion of Rand J. in Rathie v. Montreal Trust Company et al.[7], when he said:\nThis comparatively new power by which a majority may coerce a minority is one to be exercised in good faith and with the controlling facts available to shareholders to enable them to come to a decision one way or the other. In most, at least, of the cases which have reached the courts in England, the circumstances showed a straightforward transaction with its business considerations made evident to the shareholders. The analogy which obviously suggests itself is that of the sale of a company\u2019s undertaking. Such a power has long been accorded companies, and the equivalent transfer by way of share acquisition presents no greater objection in principle except in relation to individual shareholders. One can easily imagine resort to s. 124 for a purely arbitrary acquisition of shares of a small interest by a larger one, but I cannot think the provision was introduced for any such a purpose; and it is significant that it is to a company and not an individual that the power is given.\nThe respondents, in support of their judgment, submitted an alternative argument that s. 128 was unconstitutional. The question had been raised and argued in the Rathie case but this Court found it unnecessary to decide the point because of the failure of the transferee company to comply with the time requirements of the section. It has again been raised and fully argued throughout the course of the litigation. There has been complete unanimity throughout that Parliament has the power to enact s. 128. The matter was summarized by Laidlaw J.A. as follows:\nIt is my opinion that the Parliament of Canada having legislative power to create companies whose objects extend to more than one Province possesses also the legislative power to prescribe the manner in which shares of the capital of such companies can be transferred and acquired. That matter is one of general interest throughout the Dominion. It is truly legislation in relation to the incorporation of companies with other than provincial objects and it is not legislation in relation to property and civil rights in the province or in relation to any matter coming within the classes of subject assigned exclusively to the legislature of the province. It deals with certain conditions under which a person may become a shareholder or lose his position as a shareholder in such a company and, in my opinion, this case is completely covered by the reasons of this Court in Reference re constitutional validity of s. 110 of the Dominion Companies Act[8]. This was also the opinion of the British Columbia Courts in the Rathie case[9].\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Although all the Attorneys-General of the Provinces were notified, no one appeared on their behalf. The Attorney General of Canada did appear. There should be no order for costs to or against him.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSupplementary Reasons\nWe have been asked by counsel to explain whether our reasons also apply to the 21,645 shares held by 360 or 361 shareholders who were \u201cunheard from\u201d at the date of the motion before Wells J. These shareholders had neither accepted the offer nor moved for an \u201corder otherwise\u201d under s. 128 of the Act.\nWe all agree that, on the facts recited in our reasons, s. 128 was not applicable at all and that the appellant did not acquire the 21,645 shares by virtue of s. 128.\nThe respondents, when they moved before Wells J., asked to have set aside the ex parte order of Landreville J. dated May 18, 1960. This relief was not included in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. It should be included in the judgment of this Court.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Toronto.

The latter was insured with the respondent under a standard automobile policy and was the unsuccessful defendant in an action brought by several plaintiffs arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The respondent alleged that the said sum was one which it would not have been liable to pay except for the provisions of s. 214(1) and 3(ii) of the Act because the appellant at the time of the accident was \"under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of the proper control of the automobile\" within the meaning of the prohibition in statutory condition 2(1)(a) of the policy. The trial judge was of the opinion that on a reasonable balance of probabilities the appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to the extent specified in statutory condition 2(1)(a), but he was also of the opinion that he was bound to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the intoxication of the appellant.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed an appeal and directed a new trial on a different ground, viz., that the trial judge had erred in his interpretation of the effect of s. 20 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 119 [now R.S.O. 1960, e, 125, s. 24] in refusing to declare two of the witnesses to be \"adverse\" within the meaning of that section and thereby excluding prior statements made by them which contradicted statements which they had made on the witness stand. The appellant appealed from the latter finding, and the respondent cross-appealed, saying that the trial judge erred in thinking himself to be bound to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the intoxication of the appellant and that his finding, based on reasonable probability, was sufficient to entitle the respondent to judgment.\nHeld: (Cartwright J. dissenting) : The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The trial judge applied the wrong standard of proof and the question of whether or not the appellant was in a state of intoxication at the time of the accident was a question which ought to have been determined according to the \"balance of probabilities\".

Couture, [1954] S.C.R. 34, referred to; London Life Ins. Co. v. Trustee of the Property of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd., [1929] S.C.R. 117, discussed.\nThe trial judge, while applying the standard of proof applicable in criminal cases, nevertheless expressed his opinion that on a reasonable balance of probabilities the appellant was under the influence of liquor to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of the proper control of his automobile. This opinion was based in large degree upon his assessment of the quality and credibility of the witnesses and there was evidence upon which he could make such a finding. The Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal did not dissent from this conclusion and one of the Justices of Appeal not only adopted it, but would have gone further and found intoxication to be proved even according to the standard by which the trial judge thought himself to be bound. That being so, the opinion as to the appellant's state of intoxication which was reached by the trial judge in accordance with \"a reasonable balance of probabilities\" should not be reversed (Union Insurance Society of Canton Ltd. v. Arsenault, [1961] S.C.R. 766 and Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth, [19601 S.C.R. 210) and as this was the proper basis on which to determine such a question in a civil case, the appeal should be disposed of in accordance with it with the result that the appellant was found to have been in breach of statutory condition 2(1) (a) so that the respondent was entitled to reimbursement of the sum paid by it in satisfaction of the judgment in accordance with s. 214(8) of The Insurance Act. In view of this decision, it was unnecessary to consider the question concerning the interpretation of s. 24 of The Evidence Act, raised in the main appeal.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: While agreeing with the reasons and conclusion of the majority on the question of law as to the applicable standard of proof, a different view was held on the question of fact as to whether the evidence adduced at the trial was sufficient to satisfy the onus which rested upon the respondent. The trial judge was correct in holding that \"adverse\" in s. 20 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 119 [now s. 24 of R.S.O. 1960, c. 125] means \"hostile\", and he was right in deciding not to look at prior statements made by two of the witnesses, which were inconsistent with the evidence they gave at the trial, for the purpose of forming his opinion as to whether the said witnesses were hostile.\nThe evidence, considered as a whale, was insufficient to discharge the burden which rested on the respondent of satisfying the Court by a preponderance of evidence that at the time of the accident the appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be incapable of the proper control of an automobile.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wilson J. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nG. William Gorrell, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nAdrian T. Hewitt, Q.C., and F. J. McDonald, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.: \u2014This action was brought by the respondent pursuant to the provisions of s. 214(8) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, for reimbursement of the sum of $22,174.85 paid by it towards satisfaction of a judgment against the appellant who was insured with the respondent under a standard contract of automobile liability insurance and who was the unsuccessful defendant in an action brought by several plaintiffs arising out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred some time after 11:00 o'clock on the night of May 16, 1958. The respondent has alleged that the said sum was one which it would not have been liable to pay except for the provisions of s. 214(1) and (3) (ii) of the said Insurance Act because the appellant at the time of the accident was \"under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of the proper control of the automobile\" within the meaning of the prohibition in statutory condition 2(1) (a) of the said policy.\nIt is not seriously disputed that if the appellant was so intoxicated as to be in breach of the said statutory condition the respondent is entitled to succeed in this action. Mr. Justice Wilson, who presided at the trial, made the following finding of fact concerning the condition of the appellant during the evening before and at the time of the accident:\nThe defendant, who is a driver of cattle, entered Willards Restaurant in Spencerville about 7:00 p.m. in company with one Earl. He had been drinking; his speech in the restaurant was not too clear in giving his order; his eyes were hazy looking. He ordered a bowl of soup and was served with it, and also with crackers. He was slovenly in the consumption of both, in that he left some mess on the counter. He appeared to be quite drowsy, and dozed a bit while sitting on a stool at the counter in the restaurant. About 7:30 p.m. the Defendant and Earl left the restaurant and proceeded southerly a short distance, in the direction of an hotel. About 10:30 p.m. Hanes and Earl came out of the hotel, which has an entrance on a side street, which leads to the main street Highway No. 16, and entered the blue Oldsmobile which was driven to the Highway, where it came to a stop, and then drove off north at a fast pace. The accident, to which reference has been made, occurred shortly afterwards. The Woodwark car, after the impact, was forced northerly, that is to say against the direction from which it was coming; it turned over and came to rest upside down on the westerly side of the road. The Hanes car proceeded north, beyond the point of impact, and came to rest facing in a north-easterly direction, I think it was, and with the door on the passenger side open, Earl lying outside the car and Hanes still in it, Hanes smelt of alcohol when he was found. He was unconscious. According to the evidence at the trial he had no memory from noon of the day of the accident. Neither Hanes nor Earl gave evidence at the trial.\nAfter finding that the witnesses who testified as to the appellant's sobriety, with the exception of one who had seen him earlier in the day, ought not to be believed, the learned trial judge went on to say:\nAfter long experience in trying both civil and criminal cases I am of the opinion, that on a reasonable balance of probabilities, that Hanes was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of proper control of his automobile. However, the rule in civil cases, although this is a civil case, according to authority, which I interpret to be binding upon me, is not the rule to be applied, namely the rule as laid down in London Life Insurance Company v. Trustee of the Property of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd., [1929] S.C.R. 117, as interpreted in Earnshaw v. Dominion of Canada Insurance Company, [1943] O.R. 385.\nand he proceeded to adopt the following statement made by Robertson C.J.O. in the latter case:\nIn a case of this nature, which is a civil action, but where it is necessary for the respondent to establish a breach of criminal law by the other side, the evidence must be substantially the same as would secure a conviction in the criminal courts. In the Court of Appeal1, Chief Justice Porter made no reference to the learned trial judge's opinion based \"on a reasonable balance of probabilities that Hanes was under the influence of intoxicating liquor\" to the extent specified in statutory condition 2(1) (a), but he agreed that the rule to be applied was the same as that necessary to secure a conviction in the criminal courts. Roach J.A. stated that he would hesitate to hold that as a matter of probability the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the collision to the extent prohibited by the statutory condition. MacKay J.A., on the other hand, concluded that even applying the standard of proof which was accepted by the trial judge the evidence would have justified a finding for the respondent.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, allowed the appeal and directed a new trial on a different ground, viz., that the learned trial judge had erred in his interpretation of the effect of s. 24 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 125, in refusing to declare two of the witnesses to be \"adverse\" within the meaning of that section and thereby excluding prior statements made by them which contradicted statements which they had made on the witness stand. It is from this latter finding of the Court of Appeal that the appellant now appeals and the respondent cross-appeals, saying that the learned trial judge erred in thinking himself to be bound to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the intoxication of the appellant and that his finding, based on reason-able probability and concurred in by MacKay J.A., was sufficient to entitle the respondent to judgment.\nThe question raised by the cross-appeal is one which war-rants a consideration of the development of the authorities in England and in this Court. In England the most authoritative of the early decisions on this subject was that of the House of Lords in Cooper v. Slade11, in which a quasi-criminal issue was clearly involved, the suit being for the recovery of a fine under the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act of 1854, and Willes J. nevertheless said :\n... I may be excused for referring to an authority in support of the elementary proposition that in civil cases the preponderance of probability may constitute sufficient ground for a verdict. I find such an authority referred to in Mr. Best's very able and instructive treatise on the Principles of Evidence (2 Edit. p. 114). So long since as the 14th of Elizabeth, Chief Justice Dyer and a majority of the other Justices of the Common Pleas laid down this distinction between pleadings and evidence, \"that in a writ or declaration or other pleading certainty ought to be shown, for there the party must answer to it, and the Court must adjudge upon it; and that which the party shall be compelled to answer to, and which is the foundation whereupon the Court is to give judgment, ought to be certain, or else the party would be driven to answer to what he does not know, and the Court to give judgment upon that which is utterly uncertain. But where the matter is so far gone that the parties are at issue, or that the inquest is awarded by default, so that the jury is to give a verdict one way or the other, there, if the matter is doubtful, they may found their verdict upon that which appears the most probable, and by the same reason that which is most probable shall be good evidence.\"\nOf even more significance is the decision of the Privy Council in Doe dem. Devine v. Wilson et al.111, where the issue turned on whether or not the signature to a deed had been forged and the trial judge had directed the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt the defendants would have the benefit of that doubt, and Mr. Justice Patteson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, at p. 532 said:\nCertainly, it has been the practice so to direct the jury in a criminal case; whether on motives of public policy or from tenderness to life and liberty, or from any other reason, it may not be material to inquire, but none of those reasons apply to a civil case. If, indeed, by the pleadings in a civil case, a direct issue of forgery or not, be raised, the onus would lie on the party asserting the forgery, and this would be more like a criminal proceeding, but even then the reasons for suffering a doubt to prevail against the probabilities, would not, in their Lordships' opinion, apply.\nEarlier in the same decision Mr. Justice Patteson had defined the duty of a jury in such a case in the following terms:\nThe jury must weigh the conflicting evidence, consider all the probabilities of the case, not excluding the ordinary presumption of innocence, and must determine the question according to the balance of those probabilities.\nIt would not be accurate to suggest that this view of the matter was universally adopted by all the judges of 19th-century England because cases such as Thurtell v. Beaumont1111, are to the contrary effect, but it has long since been accepted by such authorities on the law of evidence as Phipson (see 9th ed. p. 9) and Wigmore (see 3rd ed. para. 2498 at p. 327) that the weight of authority favours the balance of probability as the proper test in such a case, and in 1921 in Clark v. The King11111, Duff J. (as he then was) quoted at length and with approval from the decision in Doe dem. Devine v. Wilson et al.., supra. In 1927 the case of Lek v. Mathews111111, came before the House of Lords, and Lord Sumner had occasion to say at p. 164:\nWith great respect to the Lords Justices it seems to me that what has really made both this forgery theory and this construction of the claim attractive has been a strong reluctance to say that, Mr. Lek has tried to cheat and has backed his effort by perjury. This has been supported by a canon, new to me in the form employed, to the effect that such a man as Mr. Lek cannot be convicted of this so long as any reasonable possibility remains of explaining his conduct otherwise. I am afraid I look at it differently and think that this is wholly without authority. When prisoners could not give evidence, such an appeal might have passed muster with a jury, but on a civil issue I do not think more is required than a correct appreciation of the incidence and the shifting of the onus of proof and a reasonable estimate of the weight pro and con of the various parts of the evidence. Mr. Lek's reputation and wealth are material only as ground for considering the probability of such misconduct. The consequences of a verdict against him are quite immaterial. I am just as reluctant to make the underwriters pay Mr. Lek many thousands of pounds, if he has been guilty of making a false claim, as to find him guilty of it if he has not. The whole question is whether it has been proved; and I think it has.\nIt is against the background of these decisions that the reasons for judgment delivered by Mignault J. on behalf of himself, Anglin C.J. and Rinfret J. in London Life Insurance Co. v. Trustee of the Property of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd.1111111, must be considered.\nThe passage in that judgment upon which Robertson C.J.O. in Earnshaw v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company, supra, placed the interpretation by which the trial judge in the present case felt himself to be bound does not, in my view, bear that interpretation when it is subjected to analysis. The first sentence of the passage reads:\nThat there is, in the law of evidence, a legal presumption against the imputation of crime, requiring, before crime can be held to be established, proof of a more cogent character than in ordinary cases where no such imputation is made, does not appear to admit of doubt.\nThe fact that the words \"proof of a more cogent character\" are by no means synonymous with \"proof beyond a reason-able doubt\" is well illustrated by what was said by Denning L.J. in Eater v. Eater11111111:\nThe difference of opinion which has been evoked about the standard of proof in these cases may well turn out to be more a matter of words than anything else. It is true that by our law there is a higher standard of proof in criminal cases than in civil cases, but this is subject to the qualification that there is no absolute standard in either case. In criminal cases the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but there may be degrees of proof within that standard. Many great judges have said that, in proportion as the crime is enormous, so ought the proof to be clear. So also in civil cases. The case may be proved by a preponderance of probability, but there may be degrees of probability within that standard. The degree depends on the subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require a higher degree of probability than that which it would require if considering whether negligence were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature, but still it does require a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion.\nThe same thought was expressed in different language by Cartwright J. in Smith v. Smith and Smedman111111111, where he said:\nI wish, however, to emphasize that in every civil action before the tribunal can safely find the affirmative of an issue of fact required to be proved it must be reasonably satisfied, and that whether or not it will be so satisfied must depend upon the totality of the circumstances on which its judgment is formed including the gravity of the consequences of the finding.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe passage from the judgment of Mignault J. continues:\nIn criminal cases this rule is often expressed by saying that the crime imputed must be proved to the exclusion of reasonable doubt. There is authority for the proposition that the same presumption of innocence from crime should be applied with equal strictness in civil as well as in criminal cases (Taylor, Evidence, 11th ed., vol. 1, par. 112, and cases referred to). Whether or not, however, the cogency of the presumption is as great in civil matters as in criminal law (a point not necessarily involved here), I would like to adopt the statement of the rule by Middleton J.A., in the court below, which appears entirely sound:\n.. While the rule is not so strict in civil cases as in criminal, I think that when a right or defence rests upon the suggestion that con-duct is criminal or quasi-criminal, the Court should be satisfied not only that the circumstances proved are consistent with the commission of the suggested act, but that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion that the evil act was in fact committed. See Alderson, B., in Rex v. Hodge, (1838) 2 Lewin C.C. 227.\nI would also refer to the authorities cited by Riddell J.A., in the court below, dealing with the presumption against suicide.\n(The italics are mine.)\nWith the greatest respect for the view expressed by Robert-son C.J.O. in the Earnshaw case, supra, I do not think that the language above quoted establishes the rule that where in civil cases it is necessary to establish a breach of criminal law \"the evidence must be substantially the same as would secure a conviction in the criminal courts\". In fact it appears to me that Mignault J. expressly dissociated himself from any such finding by saying that \"the point is not necessarily involved here\".\nIt is true that Mignault J. proceeded to adopt the statement of Middleton J.A. in the Court below which is phrased in much the same language as that employed in the famous judgment of Baron Alderson in Rex v. Hodge, supra, but Middleton J.A. was careful to preface his reference to that case with the words \"While the rule is not so strict in civil cases as in criminal ....\" and I think that in the light of the authorities then existing it must be taken that in adopting this paragraph Mignault J. was adopting the rule in Hodge's case, supra, modified for application to civil cases, and that the statement must be read as meaning that when a right or defence rests upon the suggestion that conduct is criminal or quasi-criminal the Court must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with the commission of the criminal act but that the facts are such as to make it reasonably probable, having due regard to the gravity of the suggestion, that the act was in fact committed. It appears to me that Mignault J.'s reference \"to the authorities cited by Riddell J.A., in the court below\" is indicative of his approach to the problem.\nIn dealing with the American cases on the subject, Riddell J.A. had said in 62 O.L.R. 83 at 90:\nIn the Vermont case of Walcott v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (1891), 64 Vermont 221, 33 Am. St. Repr. 923, it is said that if recovery upon a policy of life insurance is resisted on the ground that the assured committed suicide, the defendant must satisfy the jury. by a preponderance of competent evidence, that the injuries which caused death were intentional on the part of the assured; and I agree in that statement of the law. The cases cited fully support the proposition of the Vermont Court:....\n(The italics are mine.)\nAny doubt about the meaning of Mr. Justice Mignault's statement seems to me to be further clarified by the observations of Newcombe J. who agreed with his conclusion and said at p. 133:\nThe question is one of probabilities and inferences, and the Appellate Division was as well qualified to weigh and determine these as the learned trial judge. In the case of The New York Life Insurance Company v. Schlitt1111111111, this Court was again required to decide the question of whether or not an insured had committed suicide and Taschereau J. adopted the language used in Harvey v. Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation11111111111, where it was held that:\nIf a man is found drowned, and certainly drowned either by accident or by suicide, and there is no preponderance of evidence as to which of the two caused his death, is there any presumption against suicide which will justify a jury or an arbitrator in finding that the death was accidental and innocent, and not suicidal and criminal? In my opinion there clearly is such a presumption. (The italics are mine.)\nIn the same case, Rand J. said at p. 309:\nWhen a point has been reached at which suicide becomes a reasonable conclusion or counter-balances accident, the legal effect of the presumption is exhausted.\nAlthough in the case of Smith v. Smith and Smedman, supra, the Court was considering the standard necessary for the proof of the commission of a marital offence, it is nonetheless significant to note that Locke J., speaking for the majority of the Court at p. 330, expressly recognized the authority of Sir John Patteson's decision in Doe dem. Devine v. Wilson et al., supra.\nThe effect of the above-noted cases decided in this Court was stated by Fauteux J., speaking on behalf of himself and Taschereau J. in Industrial Acceptance Corporation v. Couture111111111111, where he said at p. 43:\nIl se peut qu'accus\u00e9 devant les tribunaux criminels d'avoir vol\u00e9 ce camion, Gagnon ait une d\u00e9fense ou des explications \u00e0 offrir et qu'un jury ne soit pas, par la preuve ci-dessus, convaincu hors de tout doute de sa culpabilit\u00e9. Mais, dans une cause civile o\u00f9 la preuve d'un crime est mat\u00e9rielle au succ\u00e8s de l'action, la r\u00e8gle de preuve applicable n'est pas celle pr\u00e9valant dans une cause criminelle o\u00f9 les sanctions de la loi p\u00e9nale sont recherch\u00e9es, mais celle r\u00e9gissant la d\u00e9termination de l'action au civil.\nNo other members of the Court in that case found it necessary to deal expressly with the question of burden of proof, but the acceptance of the rule adopted by Fauteux J. appears to me to be implicit in the conclusion of the majority that the automobile in question was stolen from the appellant. Having regard to the above authorities, I am of opinion that the learned trial judge applied the wrong standard of proof in the present case and that the question of whether or not the appellant was in a state of intoxication at the time of the accident is a question which ought to have been determined according to the \"balance of probabilities\".\nIt has been noted that the learned trial judge, while applying the standard of proof applicable in criminal cases, nevertheless clearly expressed his opinion:\n... that on a reasonable balance of probabilities ... Hanes was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of the proper control of his automobile.\nWhile I am unable to say from the evidence disclosed in the record before us that I would necessarily have reached the same conclusion, it is nevertheless clear from his reasons that the learned trial judge based this opinion in large degree upon his assessment of the quality and credibility of the witnesses whom he had the advantage of seeing on the witness stand and there was evidence upon which he could make such a finding. Furthermore, Chief Justice Porter in the Court of Appeal did not dissent from this conclusion, and MacKay J.A. not only adopted it, but would have gone further and found intoxication to be proved even according to the standard by which the trial judge thought himself to be bound. This being so, I do not think that the opinion as to the appellant's state of intoxication which was reached by Mr. Justice Wilson in accordance with \"a reason-able balance of probabilities\" should be reversed (see Union Insurance Society of Canton Limited v. Arsenault1111111111111, and Prudential Trust Company Limited v. Forseth11111111111111) and as this seems to me to be the proper basis on which to determine such a question in a civil case, I would dispose of this appeal in accordance with it with the result that I find the appellant to have been in breach of statutory condition 2(1) (a) of the said policy so that the respondent is entitled to reimbursement of the sum paid by it in satisfaction of the said judgment in accordance with s. 214(8) of The Insurance Act. In view of the above, it becomes unnecessary for me to consider the interesting question concerning the interpretation to be placed on s. 24 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 125, which is raised by the main appeal.\nI would accordingly allow the cross-appeal and direct that the order of the Court of Appeal be varied and that the judgment of the trial judge be set aside and that judgment be entered for the plaintiff-respondent against the defendant-appellant for the sum of $22,174.85 together with the costs of the trial, of the appeal to the Court of Appeal, and of the cross-appeal to this Court.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting) :-The findings of fact made by the learned trial judge and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie which I have had the advantage of reading. I agree with his reasons and conclusion on the question of law as to the applicable standard of proof but differ from his view on the question of fact as to whether the evidence adduced at the trial was sufficient to satisfy the onus which rested upon the respondent. This renders it necessary for me to examine the ground upon which the majority in the Court of Appeal proceeded, dealing with the interpretation of s. 20 of The Evidence Act, and also to say something about the evidence.\nSection 20 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 119, is now s. 24 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1960, e. 125, which reads as follows:\n24. A party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character, but he may contradict him by other evidence, or if the witness in the opinion of the judge or other person presiding proves adverse such party may by leave of the judge or other person presiding prove that the witness made at some other time a statement inconsistent with his present testimony, but before such last mentioned proof is given the circumstances of the proposed statement sufficient to designate the particular occasion shall be mentioned to the witness and he shall be asked whether or not he did make such statement.\nHereafter, in these reasons, I shall refer to this section as s. 24.\nThe two questions as to the application of this section in the circumstances of the case at bar on which there has been a difference of opinion in the Courts below are (i) whether the word \"adverse\" as used in the section means hostile or merely unfavourable to the case of the party calling the witness, and (ii) whether in forming his opinion that the witness does or does not prove adverse the judge may examine the statement inconsistent with his present testimony which the witness is said to have made.\nIn the case of two of the witnesses produced by the plain-tiff counsel asked the learned trial judge to declare the 'witness adverse and to permit him to prove that the witness had made an earlier statement inconsistent with the evidence he had just given.\nThe witnesses in question were William Joseph Dake and Doctor Pember Alton Maclntosh. In the case of each application the learned trial judge said that nothing had occurred up to that point to cause him to think that the witness was hostile; counsel then asked the learned trial judge to look at the statement to assist himself in forming the opinion whether or not the witness was hostile. After hearing full argument the learned trial judge held, following Greenough v. Eccles111111111111111, that adverse as used in the section means hostile and said:\nI should state it is my view of the law that a witness must be proved to be hostile and the hostility must be gathered by the judge from the demeanour, the language, the witness' manner in the witness box, and all those elements which are indefinable, but which nevertheless do convey an impression to the judge whether or not a witness is hostile. I am unable to find such hostility in this case.\nThe learned trial judge declined to look at the statements or consider their contents. In my opinion, both of these rulings were correct.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Porter C.J.O. was of opinion that \"adverse\" in s. 24 means \"unfavourable\" and not \"hostile\", that the prior statements should have been allowed to be introduced and that there should be a new trial. Mackay J.A. was of opinion that \"adverse\" means merely \"unfavourable\" but that on the assumption it means \"hostile\" the learned trial judge was entitled to examine the previous statements and to form his opinion as to the hostility of the witnesses on the basis of the contents of these statements even if there were no other indicia of hostility. He agreed with Porter C.J.O. that a new trial should be ordered. Roach J.A. dissented. He agreed with the learned trial judge that \"adverse\" means \"hostile\" and held that he was right in deciding not to look at the statements for the purpose of forming his opinion as to whether the witnesses were hostile. He would have dismissed the appeal.\nOn this branch of the matter I agree with the conclusions of Roach J.A. and (subject to one reservation to be mentioned in a moment) I am so fully in agreement with his reasons that I wish simply to adopt them.\nThe reservation referred to is in regard to a reference made by the learned Justice of Appeal to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act in which he says:\nIt will be noted that under the Canada Evidence Act a party calling a witness may not contradict by other evidence unless in the opinion of the court the witness proves adverse, while under the Ontario Act a party calling a witness may contradict him by other evidence regardless.\nThis observation was not necessary to his decision and does not affect it. With respect, I am of opinion that s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act has been correctly construed as not restricting the right of a party calling a witness to contradict him by other evidence to cases in which in the opinion of the court the witness proves adverse.\nIt remains to consider whether the plaintiff discharged the burden resting upon it of satisfying the Court by a preponderance of evidence that at the time of the collision between the motor vehicles of Hanes and Woodwark which occurred shortly after 11 p.m. on May 16, 1958, Hanes was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of the proper control of the automobile.\nSince the learned trial judge and all members of the Court of Appeal felt themselves bound, by the decision of this Court in London Life Insurance Co. v. Trustee of the Property of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd., as interpreted by the Court of Appeal in Earnshaw v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.1, to hold that in order to succeed the plaintiff was called upon to prove the fact of intoxication with substantially the same strictness as would have been required of the prosecution in the trial of a criminal charge it was not necessary for them to consider or decide the question set out in the preceding paragraph. However, the learned trial judge expressed the opinion quoted in the reasons of my brother Ritchie that he would have answered the question in the affirmative; Mackay J.A. indicated the same view; Porter C.J.O. expressed no opinion; Roach J.A. would have inclined to answer the question in the negative.\nTurning to the evidence it may first be observed that the only items of direct evidence of the consumption of any intoxicating liquor by Hanes on the day in question are\n(i) the statement made by Hanes to an adjuster employed by the plaintiff on June 3, 1958. At the time of making the statement Hanes was still in hospital. The statement was written out by the adjuster and signed by Hanes. It reads as follows:\nMy name is Ralph Hanes age 58 of Prescott, Ontario. On May 16, 1958, I was buying cattle till about noon and Mr. Jack Markham of Ingersoll was with me all morning and I let him off at Daniels Hotel in Prescott at about 12 noon. I do not remember what I was doing for the rest of the day or evening of this accident, and I cannot recall whether I was driving my car at the time this accident took place or if Mr. Earl was driving at the time. Since being in the hospital Mr. Earl's father was in to see me and advised me he thought his son had been driving at the time of this accident. As mentioned above, I cannot recall anything past noon on May 16, 1958, other than having some beer in the afternoon, I cannot recall where I had it, I cannot recall having any lunch or supper that day either.\n(ii) a portion of the examination for discovery of Hanes in the action of Woodwark v. Hanes read into the record by counsel for the plaintiff which is as follows:\n61. Q. Where did you spend all this intervening time between 2.30 and 6 o'clock? A. It was 5 o'clock when I was at the garage at Chesterville, and left there.\n62. Q. How long had you stayed in Chesterville? A. About 2 hours or better.\n63. Q. Were you at the garage all the time? A. No.\n64. Q. Where were you in addition to being in the garage? A. I was over at the hotel, and I was at the restaurant.\n66. Q. Did you have anything to drink? A. I had one pint of beer there.\nOther questions and answers read in indicate that Hanes had to some extent informed himself, as it was his duty to do, of the circumstances surrounding the accident of which he had no memory when questioned in the hospital. For example, he stated definitely that he and not Earl was driving at the time of the accident. It is not an unreasonable supposition that the \"some beer\" referred to in the statement was made up of the one pint he had at the hotel in Chesterville and the one pint to be mentioned in the item next following; (iii) the witness Blanchard deposed that Hanes had one pint of beer in the hotel at Spencerville shortly before 6.30 p.m. on the day in question.\nThere is, therefore, no direct evidence that Hanes had consumed more than a total of two pints of beer.\nThere is, however, the evidence of Betty Willard, the waitress in Willard's restaurant in Spencerville regarding Hanes' appearance and actions there at about 7 p.m. on the day in question. As it is on the evidence of this witness that the opinion of the learned trial judge quoted by my brother Ritchie is largely based it seems necessary to quote all of it that touches the question whether Hanes was then intoxicated. It was all given on examination in chief and is as follows :\nQ. Do you know the defendant Ralph Hanes? A. Yes.\nQ. How long have you known him? A. I would say about five years.\nQ. And had he from time to time been a customer in your restaurant? A. Yes.\nQ. Do you recall a day when an accident occurred on the main high-way between Spencerville and Kemptville involving some people by the name of Woodwark and the defendant, Mr. Hanes? A. Yes.\nQ. When did you learn about this accident occurring, or that it had occurred? A. The same evening.\nQ. Had you that evening you heard the accident occurred seen the defendant Ralph Hanes? A. Yes.\nQ. Where had you seen him? A. In the restaurant.\nQ. What were you doing in the restaurant at the time? A. I was a waitress.\nQ. Waiting on your customers? A. Yes.\nQ. What was Hanes doing in the restaurant? A. He came in for lunch.\nQ. To eat. What time of day was it when he was in the restaurant? A. Approximately 7 o'clock.\nQ. In the evening or morning? A. In the evening.\nQ. And do you know how long he was in your restaurant approximately? A. Half an hour.\nQ. And was there anyone with him? A. Yes.\nQ. Who? A. His name?\nQ. Yes? A. Mr. Earl.\nQ. Jesse Earl? A. I don't know.\nQ. You don't know his first name? A. No.\nQ. Were there other people in the restaurant during the time Hanes was there? A. Yes, a number of people. Q. Are you able to say who they were? A. No, I don't remember.\nQ. Did you observe the conduct of the defendant Hanes when he was in your restaurant that evening? A. Yes.\nQ. Would you describe as far as you can recall it? A. I was under the impression that he had been drinking.\nQ. Why? A. He was quiet.\nQ. Did you speak to him? A. Yes.\nQ. Did he speak to you? A. He gave me his order. Q. What was his manner of speech? A. Not too clear. Q. Did you observe his face and his eyes? A. Yes.\nQ. What was the condition of his face and eyes? A. Well, his appearance was not very good.\nQ. What was the matter with it? A. Well, it, I would say .. .\nQ. Describe as best you can? A. I notice his eyes were not-did not look very good.\nQ. What was wrong with them? A. Just a little hazy looking.\nQ. Do you recall what he had to eat? A. Yes, I do, yes a bowl of soup he ordered.\nQ. Was there anything else? A. I don't remember. I remember the soup.\nQ. Why do you remember the soup? Perhaps I should ask you, did you serve anything with the soup? A. Soup and crackers.\nQ. Is there any reason why you would recall this specifically? A. There was a bit of a mess on the counter when he left.\nQ. A bit of a mess. If I had soup and crackers perhaps I would leave some crumbs and perhaps spill a little soup. How would the mess you referred to compare with what you would expect from the average customer? A. There were crackers around his plate and on the counter and soup had been spilled also.\nQ. Did you observe him eat the soup? I am not quite sure whether you eat or drink soup? A. I beg your pardon.\nQ. Did you see him consume the soup? A. No, I was busy.\nQ. Did you observe anything else about his conduct? A. I remember that he became quite drowsy.\nQ. Where did he sit? Did he sit? A. He was just in the door, on the first or second stool, just inside the door. Q. At the counter? A. Yes.\nQ. And you say he became quite drowsy. When, in reference to when you served him the soup? A. After he had the soup, a few minutes.\nQ. What happened then? A. I would say he dozed a bit.\nQ. Sitting on the stool? A. Yes.\nQ. What happened to him when he dozed? Did he remain seated upright? A. Yes.\nQ. What happened after that? A. I don't remember too clearly.\nQ. Did you see him leave? A. I did not see him walk out, no.\nQ. You saw him walk in? A. No, I was in the kitchen when he came in.\nQ. Did you observe anything else about his conduct which would be other than ordinary? A. No.\n* * *\nMr. HEWITT: You said you knew the defendant. Had you seen him on other occasions? A. Yes, I had. Q. How did his appearance on the evening you have described compare with the appearance on other occasions-I do' not mean on every other occasion? A. A little the worse on this occasion.\nQ. A little worse in what sense? A. As far as drinking is concerned. Q. I see.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Did he come into your restaurant when he had not been drinking? A. Oh, yes.\nMr. HEWITT: I will ask you to make a comparison of the condition of the defendant on the evening the accident occurred to when you had seen him in your opinion when he had not been drinking. A. Would you repeat that?\nQ. You had seen him on occasions when you had thought he was not drinking, or you felt that he had not been drinking? A. Yes.\nQ. How did that condition compare with his condition on the evening of the accident as to the condition we should refer to, perhaps, as normal? A. I do not know how to answer.\nQ. Are you able to answer at all? A. No, I don't think so.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Whether he had been drinking or not he was always the same, is that what you are saying? He would come in and after having soup would leave crackers around, and soup, and would go to sleep? A. It did not happen very often, no. Any time he came in he pretty well behaved himself.\nMr. HEWITT: Are you suggesting on this occasion he did not pretty well behave himself? A. He was quiet.\nHIS LORDSHIP: We are trying to ascertain this man's condition, having in mind the claim by the insurance company that at the time of the accident he was so intoxicated as not to be capable of driving his car. Mr. Hewitt is trying to get at what he is like when he is sober. Do you know? A. No, I just see him coming in-he used to come in the restaurant quite often.\nQ. Had he always been drinking when he came in? A. No, I would not say that, not always.\nMr. HEWITT: Can you say on the night of the accident that his condition was something different than on the occasions when he was perfectly sober and had not been drinking? A. Well, that night I was under the impression that he had been drinking.\nQ. I don't want to ask you how much he had had to drink, but can you put as to what extent he had been drinking in comparative terms? Do you understand? A. Well, err, well.\nQ. Let me take you back to something you said, that on the night of the accident he was a little worse than on other occasions. Worse in what sense? A. There were lots of times he came in when you never thought he had been drinking or you didn't notice, but I notice on this night that he had been drinking.\nThe witness Dake testified that he saw Hanes in Willard's Restaurant around 7 or 7.30. His evidence continues as follows:\nQ. What did you observe as to the conduct of Hanes during the time you were in the restaurant and he was in there. A. I thought he was drinking a little bit. I can't say how much. Q. What was there about him? What did you observe to lead you to believe that he had been drinking? A. Well, the way he acted.\nQ. How did he act? A. Slumped over the counter, and he spilled his soup.\nQ. He spilled his soup, how much? A. Well, not very much.\nQ. You spill soup sometimes? A. Yes.\nQ. How much soup did he spill in comparison to what you might spill ordinarily when eating soup? A. Not too much.\nQ. What else did he do that you observed? A. Nothing else.\nQ. Did you hear him speak? A. No, I can't say I did.\nQ. Did you observe how-whether or not Mr. Hanes consumed the soup? A. Yes.\nQ. How did he do that? A. Drinking it out of the bowl.\nQ. When drinking it out of the bowl what can you say as to his position in reference to the counter? A. He was standing up.\nQ. Was be standing up all the time he was in there? A. No.\nQ. When did he stand up? A. He was standing up quite a while after he came in.\nQ. Had he been sitting any time before he drank his soup? A. I can-not -I am not sure.\nQ. Did you see him walk into or out of the restaurant? A. I saw him walk in and out.\nQ. How did he walk? A. Ordinary.\nQ. I beg your pardon? A. Ordinary.\nQ. Anything unusual about it? A. No.\nQ. Did you see him when he left the restaurant? A. Yes.\nQ. Where were you then? A. I left right behind.\nQ. Where did he go? A. Up towards the street, towards the hotel.\nQ. What hotel? A. The Spencerville Hotel.\nQ. What kind of progress did he make from the restaurant to the hotel? A. Normal.\nQ. I beg your pardon? A. Normal, he walked pretty normal.\nQ. He walked what? A. Normal, just ordinary. He didn't stagger or nothing.\nThis was all given on examination-in-chief.\nThe witness Piche described the conduct of two men in Willard's Restaurant at about 7 p.m. on the day in question. He could not identify either of them as being Hanes but the witness Dake was recalled and said that one of the two men described by Piche was Hanes. The evidence of Piche was as follows:\nQ. What did you observe of the men while you were there? A. When they came in I was under the impression they were drinking.\nHis LORDSHIP: Q. Were drinking, or had been drinking? A. Had been drinking. They staggered a bit and made conversation with the one in the restaurant. Mr. HEWITT: Q. What kind of conversation? A. Just friendly, sort of-. I can't remember now what they said.\nQ. What was their manner of speech? A. It was not as if the soberest, or as if they were the drunkest.\nQ. What do you put on the limits of soberest and the drunkest? A. Well, I don't know-I don't know-they made me feel that they were drinking, that is all.\nThere was no evidence adduced by the plaintiff as to the condition of Hanes at any time after he left Willard's Restaurant between 7 and 8 p.m. until he was found in his car after the collision by the witness Hudson, an officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force who had had some years experience in investigating accidents.\nHudson stated that he believed Hanes was unconscious although shortly he started yelling about the passenger in his car. Hudson said he was \"right up beside him\" and smelt \"a faint smell of alcohol on his breath\".\nIt was argued for the plaintiff that the evidence set out above considered with the fact that Hanes' car at the moment of collision appears to have been on the wrong side of the road was sufficient to satisfy the onus resting upon it and stress was laid on the failure of Hanes to testify.\nIt appears to me that the plaintiff having adduced evidence as part of its case that Hanes had no memory \"past noon on May 16\" has furnished an explanation of his not being called as a witness in his own defence. There is no evidence to suggest he had had anything intoxicating to drink before noon on the day in question.\nIn dealing with the facts the learned trial judge said:\nI find that those witnesses who testified as to his sobriety, with the exception of Markham, who had seen him earlier in the day, and whom I find to be a truthful witness, ought not to be believed.\nAfter a careful perusal of the whole record I have some difficulty in understanding this statement. For example, one witness, the Deputy Reeve of the Township of Oxford, who had seen Hanes at 1 p.m. on the day of the accident in connection with cattle business testified to his complete sobriety at that time and was not cross-examined on this point. There is nothing in the written record to suggest that this witness was not frank and straight-forward. However, the learned trial judge had the advantage of seeing him which we have not and consequently I shall refer only to the evidence of Markham whom the learned trial judge found to be a truthful witness.\nThe significance of Markham's evidence is that, while he parted from Hanes at 11 a.m. on the day of the accident at which time Hanes had had nothing to drink, Hanes called him by long distance telephone between 8.30 and 9.00 p.m., pursuant to an agreement made during the morning, with regard to the arrangements that Hanes was to make for the picking up by trucks of the cattle which Markham had purchased. Markham said that Hanes had made these arrangements and that their long-distance conversation in which he reported on them was a normal one.\nOn a careful consideration of all the evidence, I have reached the conclusion that, while it might have been open to the tribunal of fact to find that at the moment he left Willard's Restaurant Hanes was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be incapable of the proper control of an automobile (although I would have hesitated to find so) the evidence is insufficient to discharge the burden which rested on the plaintiff of satisfying the Court by a preponderance of evidence that at the time of the accident some four hours later Hanes was still incapable. As is pointed out by Roach J.A. the food he had consumed and the lapse of time would both have had a sobering effect; the long-distance telephone conversation with Markham indicates that between 8.30 and 9.00 p.m. Hanes was in a normal condition; there is no evidence of his having taken any more liquor after leaving the restaurant and he had none at the restaurant.\nIn reaching the conclusion stated above I am accepting everything said by the learned trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses and as to the evidence which he accepted and that which he rejected. I differ from him as to the inferences which should be drawn therefrom.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout. It follows that the cross-appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, cross-appeal allowed with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: G.

This property was expropriated by the municipality and the respondent was awarded $1,449,310 by the arbitrator. By a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal the award was fixed at $1,303,555. There were concurrent findings of the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal that the market value of the land alone was $423,555. Both parties agreed that the reproduction cost of the. building was $640,000. The only difference between the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal was that the arbitrator deducted $46,000 for depreciation against a deduction of $60,000 by the Court of Appeal. There was no dispute about the valuation at $100,000 of certain equipment that could not be removed. The Court of Appeal made no change in an allowance of $200,000 for disturbance, moving expenses and other miscellaneous items. Ten per cent additional allowance for compulsory taking had been awarded by the arbitrator before the decision in Drew v. The Queen, [1961] SCR. 614, and, of necessity, had to be disallowed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe municipality claimed that the award should be set aside, and submitted an alternative mode of valuation based upon a comparison between market value and re-establishment cost as ascertained at the date of the arbitration.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe submissions of the municipality were rejected. There was no error either of fact or principle in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. In determining value to the owner in this case, it was correct to take into account the market value of the land plus the reproduction cost of the building, less depreciation. Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 504; Irving Oil Co. Ltd. v. The King, [1946] S.C.R. 551; Diggon\u2011Hibben Ltd. v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 712; Assaf v.

Wilson, Q.C., and A.P.G. Joy, Q.C., for the contestant, appellant.\nB.W. Grossberg, Q.C., and H.J. Bliss, for the claimant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The municipality appeals from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1 which awarded the respondent, Samuel, Son & Co., Limited, $1,303,555 for the expropriation of its property. The arbitrator had awarded $1,449,310. The municipality claims here that the award should be set aside.\nThe respondent was the owner of an industrial building at the southwest corner of Spadina Avenue and Lakeshore Road in Toronto. The frontage on Lakeshore Road was 597 feet, 5\u00bc inches with a depth of 143 feet on Spadina Avenue. The total area of the site was 1.46 acres. There are concurrent findings of the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal that the market value of the land alone was $423,555. The following table shows the arbitrator\u2019s award as varied by the Court of Appeal:\nArbitrator\u2019s Award\nCourt of Appeal\nMarket value of land\n$ 423,55\n$ 423,555\nBuildings\u2014Reproduction cost (agreed).......... $ 640,000\n$ 640,000\n` Depreciation\n46,000\n594,000\nDepreciation\n60,000\n580,000\nCrane Equipment (agreed)\n100,000\n100,000\nAdditional allowance, disturbance, moving, etc.............\n200,000\n200,000\n$ 1,317,555\n10% additional allowance.\n131,755\nNil\nTOTAL\n$ 1,449,310\n$ 1,303,555\nWith the concurrent findings of the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal there can be no question that the valuation of the land is unassailable in this Court. The same applies to the reproduction cost of the building. Both parties agreed that it was $640,000. The only difference between the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal was that the arbitrator deducted $46,000 for depreciation against a deduction of $60,000 by the Court of Appeal. There was a wide difference among the experts on the amount of depreciation which should be deducted. In the Court of Appeal the municipality had urged that the depreciation of $60,000 given by one of the experts should be accepted. The Court of Appeal did no more than give effect to that submission.\nIn my opinion both the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal were right in adopting the principle of reproduction cost less depreciation in determining the value of this building, which was built in 1929 and extended in 1949 for the special purposes of the respondent\u2019s business.\nThere is no dispute about the valuation of the crane equipment at $100,000 which was so constructed that it became part of the building and could not be dismantled, removed and reassembled in a new building.\nThe next item is one of $200,000 for an additional allowance for disturbance, moving expenses and other miscellaneous items. The Court of Appeal made no change in this allowance. There was ample evidence to support this branch of the award. The moving cost alone was $105,239.07. Loss of profit in the interval before the re-establishment of the business in the new location, loss due to dislocation of business, loss of the advertising value of the old location, which was considerable, and other items of loss on which evidence is given, fully justify the difference between the actual disbursements of moving and the award of $200,000. Counsel for the respondent said that $200,000 was a minimum figure and I am inclined to agree with him.\nThe last item was the 10 per cent additional allowance. This was awarded before the decision of this Court in Drew v. The Queen[2] and, of necessity, had to be disallowed by the Court of Appeal.\nAfter this survey, it is apparent that the only difference between the award of the arbitrator and that of the Court of Appeal was this 10 per cent additional allowance and $14,000 additional depreciation deducted by the Court of Appeal, making a total of $145,755. I can see no error either of fact or principle in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. In determining value to the owner in this case, it was correct to take into account the market value of the land plus the reproduction cost of the building, less depreciation. This was done in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King[3]; Irving Oil Co. Ltd. v. The King[4]; Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[5]; Assaf v. The City of Toronto[6].\nThe municipality submitted in this Court an alternative mode of valuation based upon a comparison between market value and re-establishment cost which had been ascertained at the date of the arbitration. The argument is built up in this way:\nMarket value, land and buildings...............................\n$ 650.000.00\nCrane............................................................................\n100,000.00\nMoving expense etc....................................................\n126,495.18\n$ 876,495.18\nThe moving expense includes not only the actual disbursements of $105,239.07 mentioned above but also additional items for loss of executive time, cost of advertising and cost of removing a railway siding, which, altogether, produced the sum of $126,495.18. The ascertained re-establishment cost was $903,195.18, made up as follows:\nCost of Land (7 acres)................................................\n$ 31,500.00\nCost of Building...........................................................\n745,200.00\nCost of Moving.............................................................\n126,49518\n$ 903,195.18\nThe valuation in the first table is fairly close to the re-establishment cost. The difference between the re-establishment cost and the award of the Court of Appeal is the sum of $400,359.82 which the municipality says must be attributable to savings and anticipated profits which the respondent would have hoped to make by continued use of the expropriated property and that there is no basis for the award of any such sum.\nThe respondent\u2019s answer, which, in my opinion, is correct, is that it would be error to start with this assessment on the basis of market value of land and buildings and that this would be a repetition of the error which was corrected in this Court in Woods Manufacturing. He also submits that re-establishment cost is irrelevant and affords no guide to the assessment of compensation.\nAs to market value, the Court of Appeal pointed out that this was a special purpose building built for the purpose of fabricating steel to the special requirements of the respondent\u2019s business. The respondent\u2019s business had been in operation for 100 years and operating at this site since the year 1929. The expert evidence on which the market value of $650,000 for the land and building is based is no more than this: that to sell the property it would be necessary to find a purchaser who could use it for the same type of business and that if such a purchaser could be found he would advise him to pay at the rate of $10 a square foot for land and building, approximately $650,000 in all. He called this a rule of thumb market value. It can afford no guidance in the assessment of value to the owner on the facts of this case.\nThere is error, also, in the municipality\u2019s submission that re-establishment cost can guide one to an assessment of value to the owner in this case. The re-establishment cost as calculated above was $903,195.18. The error in this submission is that the cost of the land at the new location was only $31,500. The market value of the land at the old location was $423,555. What the company acquired was land worth $31,500 as contrasted with $423,555 at the old site and a more expensive and presumably more modern building but widely separated from the old site of business. I agree with the submission of the respondent that re-establishment cost, on the facts of this case, is of no assistance to the appellant\u2019s case.\nThere is no error in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. I agree with them in their entirety and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the contestant, appellant: C.

Eaton Company Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1962: December 3; 1963: January 22.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTrial\u2014Injuries received in fall on escalator\u2014Action for damages\u2014Questions submitted to jury\u2014Supplementary charges, questions and suggestions\u2014Jurymen confused\u2014New trial directed.\nThe plaintiff, while shopping in the defendant\u2019s department store, stepped on an old\u2011fashioned type of escalator. The heel of her shoe stuck in the tread and while trying to extract it as the escalator was descending, she twisted her body to get her foot from the shoe. She finally succeeded in pulling her foot free but immediately fell backwards to the bottom of the escalator and was injured.\nAn action was brought and during the trial seven questions as agreed upon were submitted to the jury. The first question, answered in the affirmative, was: \u201cWere the injuries to the plaintiff caused by an unusual danger on the defendant\u2019s escalator of which the defendant knew or ought to have known?\u201d In the second question the jury was asked, if the answer to question 1 was \u201cyes\u201d, to state fully in what such danger consisted. The answer, based on an exhibit of a sample cleat, stated that it was possible for the cleats to work loose. The trial judge, having asked the jury to retire, said to counsel that the answer to the questions seemed to be inconclusive. The jury was recalled and instructed to return to the jury-room and \u201cif you can, say what the danger was\u201d. If they could not, they were to change the answer to the first question to \u201cno\u201d, which in the event was done. Subsequently, the jury was reinstructed several times with regard to question 3: \u201cDid the defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?\u201d It was finally agreed that an answer was not required.\nThe judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. An appeal in forma pauperis was brought to this Court. No question arose as to the amount of damages; the only question raised was one of liability.\nHeld: (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed limited to the question of liability.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The jurymen were confused by the various supplementary charges, questions and suggestions put to them by the trial judge. The trial and its result were so unsatisfactory that the verdict could not stand. Dozois v. Pure Spring Co. Ltd. and Ottawa Gas Co., [1935] S.C.R. 319, followed; Herd v. Terkuc, [1960] S.C.R. 602, referred to.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: When the jury answered the first question affirmatively, they supported their finding with a reason which could not be founded on any evidence that they had heard. Their finding was not one of fault. In the circumstances, the trial judge, who had already instructed the jury on fact and law, had the power and the. duty to instruct the jury to reconsider the answer to question 2. On reconsideration, they found that there was no unusual danger. This was the correct finding on the evidence. Having answered question 1 in the negative, there was no answer required for questions 2 and 3. There was no impropriety in the subsequent discussion of these points in the presence of the jury.\nAPPEAL in forma pauperis from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of McLennan J. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nB.J. Thomson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal in forma pauperis by the plaintiff in the action, Emily Jane McCormack, from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which without recorded reasons affirmed the judgment at the trial of the Honourable Mr. Justice McLennan dismissing the action.\nThe appellant was shopping in the department store of the respondent on August 22, 1956. She stepped on an old-fashioned type of escalator no longer in service to descend to the basement. The heel of her shoe stuck in the tread and while trying to extract it as the escalator was descending, she twisted her body to get her foot from the shoe which had a strap across it. The heel was an ordinary one. She finally succeeded in pulling her foot from the shoe but immediately fell backwards to the bottom of the escalator and was injured. No question arises as to the amount of damages, but, as we are of opinion that a new trial should be had on the question of liability, all reference is omitted to the proceedings at the trial except such as is necessary to indicate the reasons for our conclusion.\nThe action was tried with a jury and the questions to be submitted had been agreed upon. These questions and the answers, which the jury first brought in, are as follows:\n1. Were the injuries to the Plaintiff caused by an unusual danger on the Defendant\u2019s escalator of which the Defendant knew or ought to have known?\nAnswer: \u201cYes\u201d 2. If your answer to question No. 1 is \u201cYes\u201d, then state fully in what such danger consisted.\nAnswer: \u201cOn Exhibit 16, the sample of the cleat shown, we find non-slip material on sides and bottom of the cleat which is mortised into the bottom plate, proving in our opinion that it is possible for these cleats to work loose.\u201d\n3. Did the Defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?\nAnswer: \u201cNo\u201d\n4. Did the Plaintiff use reasonable care for her own safety?\nAnswer: \u201cYes\u201d\n5. If your answer to question No. 4 is \u201cNo\u201d wherein did she fail to use reasonable care?\n(No Answer)\n6. If your answers to questions 3 and 4 are \u201cNo\u201d state in percentages the degree of fault attributable to each.\n(No Answer)\n7. Irrespective of how you answer the other questions, at what amount do you assess the Plaintiff\u2019s damages?\nAnswer: $10,500.00.\nCounsel for neither party desired to have the jury retained but the trial judge nevertheless asked them to retire and he then considered with counsel the answer to Question 2. When the jury had again retired, the trial judge stated to counsel that the answer to the questions seemed to be inconclusive. After some considerable further discussion the jury was recalled and instructed by His Lordship to return to the jury-room and \u201cif you can, say what the danger was\u201d. He added:\nI am going to return these answers to you and I have put at the bottom of the sheet \u2018No. 2(a)\u2019. I want you, if you can, to answer that question as to what the danger was and not your reasons for it. If you cannot, then don\u2019t answer it and change the answer to the first question to \u2018No\u2019.\nIs that clear?\nFOREMAN: Yes, my lord.\nCourt adjourned for twenty minutes when the jury returned and the following occurred:\nREGISTRAR: Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?\nFOREMAN: We have.\nHis LORDSHIP: Gentlemen, you have changed your answer to Question 1 from \u2018Yes\u2019 to \u2018No\u2019. So that means that presumably Question 3 remains as \u2018No\u2019. I should have put that to you before. That is, did the defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury. FOREMAN: My lord, we decided if you wanted that question changed we agreed that it should be changed to \u2018Yes\u2019.\nA JUROR: No.\nFOREMAN: Pardon me. Somebody disagrees with me.\nHis LORDSHIP: I think perhaps then, gentlemen, I must send you back again. I think that is the only right thing to do. On the basis of these questions, if your answer to Question No. 1 is \u2018Yes\u2019, then the next (sic) question: \u2018Did the defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?\u2019 Your answer to that was \u2018No.\u2019. But you have changed the answer to Question No. 1 to \u2018No\u2019, so Question No. 3 does not arise, presumably. However, that is the way it is. So I invite you now to retire to your jury room. It must follow logically, gentlemen, that that is the way.\nThe jury retired and the following discussion occurred between His Lordship and counsel:\nHis LORDSHIP: I think we might wait for a few moments, gentlemen. I wouldn\u2019t expect the jury to be long. Did I make it sufficiently clear to them that their answer to No. 1 being \u2018Yes\u2019, their\u2014\nMR. THOMSON: If the answer to Question is is \u2018No\u2019\u2014I beg your pardon. Were the injuries caused by an unusual danger? They have changed that to \u2018No\u2019.\nHis LORDSHIP: Then 3 does not arise at all.\nMR. THOMSON: That\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t understand that your lordship was telling them that they should perhaps strike out their answer to 3, if that is what your lordship\u2014\nHis LORDSHIP: That is what I intended to say. Perhaps I didn\u2019t say it aptly.\nMR. THOMSON: I think you said that the answers should be consistent.\nHis LORDSHIP: Perhaps I should call them back once more.\nWhereupon the jury was again recalled and the following occurred:\nHis LORDSHIP: Gentlemen, I come back to Question No. 3: \u2018If your answer to Question 1 is \u201cYes\u201d, then did the defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?\u2019 Now, if your answer to Question No. 1 is now \u2018No\u2019, you need not answer Question 3. So my suggestion would be that you strike out the word \u2018No\u2019 in answer to Question 3. But I think you will have to do it by agreement. Is it all agreed between you?\nSOME JURORS: Yes.\nHis LORDSHIP: It is?\nA JUROR: It seems logical.\nHis LORDSHIP: YOU see, you really don\u2019t need to answer that question. I wanted the verdict clear. That is your verdict, is it, gentlemen?\nSOME JURORS: Yes.\nThe trial judge thereupon granted the motion of counsel for the respondent that the action be dismissed with costs. In Dozois v. The Pure Spring Company Limited and The: Ottawa Gas Company[1], a new trial was directed by this Court because it was found that the trial and its result were so unsatisfactory that the verdict should not stand and there should be a new trial. In the present case we are of opinion that the jurymen were confused by the various supplementary charges, questions and suggestions put to them by the trial judge and that there was that kind of error referred to in Dozois. While in Herd v. Terkuc[2] it was held that the course there followed by the trial judge was a proper one, it was pointed out at p. 606 that the power to tell the jury to reconsider their verdict is not one to be used lightly.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial set aside and a new trial directed limited to the question of liability. The appellant is entitled to her costs in the Court of Appeal and also in this Court, but, as to the latter, by our Rule 142(4), she will have only her out-of-pocket expenses and three-eighths of the usual professional charges under the other items of the tariff including the application upon which leave to appeal in forma pauperis was granted. The costs of the first trial will be disposed of by the Justice presiding at the new trial.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014In my respectful opinion, which is contrary to that of the majority of the Court, I would not send this case back for a new trial but would dismiss the appeal.\nWhen the jury said that there was an unusual danger of which the defendant knew or ought to have known, they supported their finding with a reason which could not be founded on any evidence that they had heard. They said that it was possible for a cleat to work loose because a particular exhibit had non-slip material at the bottom and on its sides. This exhibit was produced as a specimen cleat and there was no evidence whatever from which they could infer that it had ever been attached to the elevator or any elevator. Their finding was not one of fault.\nIt is apparent from what took place when the jury returned with these two answers that counsel for the defendant was not going to urge that they be sent back. He was satisfied that their answers did not constitute a finding against his client. Counsel for the plaintiff did not ask to have the jury sent back. He may well have thought that he had the maximum finding in his client\u2019s favour. In these circumstances, the trial judge, who had already adequately instructed the jury on fact and law, had the power and the duty to instruct the jury to reconsider the answer to question 2. He was merely telling them to face the issues. He asked them to find whether there was a worn cleat or a loose cleat. It was in this way that the case had been originally put to them. When they were told that they must do one thing or the other, they came back with a clear answer which denied liability. They found that there was no unusual danger which, in my opinion, was the correct finding on the evidence. Having answered the first question in the negative, there was no answer required for questions 2 and 3. There was no impropriety in the subsequent discussion of these points in the presence of the jury. There should not be a new trial on this ground.\nFollowing Herd v. Terkuc[3], the power of the learned trial judge is unquestionable. If he had waited for a motion for judgment he might well have dismissed the action on the questions as first answered. I think, with respect, that he followed the better course in sending the jury back.\nAppeal allowed with costs and a new trial directed limited to the question of liability, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: Raymond L.

The weather was fine and the pavement dry. At the time the plaintiff was leaning back in his seat and had closed his eyes but was not asleep. He estimated the speed of the car at no more than thirty miles per hour. His wife was instantly killed and he was seriously injured. There were no eye-witnesses. All that can be deduced from the physical facts is that while going down a slight grade and rounding a somewhat pronounced curve to the left at a speed in the neighbourhood of 50 miles per hour, the automobile left the pavement, proceeded on the shoulder for 45 feet and was turning to regain the pavement when it struck the cement block. The trial judge maintained the action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ: There is no provincial statute which requires the Quebec Roads Department to provide roads under its control with a shoulder of any particular width or of any particular character. A motorist venturing on to such shoulder should proceed slowly and with care. At the time of the accident the appellant's car was well off the paved portion of the highway and was travelling at a speed which in the light of what happened must have been at least 50 miles per hour. This excessive speed was the real cause of the accident. There was no explanation as to why the car was being driven at such speed on the shoulder of the road. The plaintiff has failed to establish fault on the part of the defendant.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The evidence did not support a finding that the accident was caused by the negligence of the appellant's wife. Negligence is not presumed. All the known circumstances were more consistent with the absence of negligence than with its presence. Although the speed was not definitely ascertained, it was not in excess of 50 miles per hour which was a lawful one on this highway. There was nothing to suggest that any harm would have been caused by the manner in which the car was driven had it not been for the presence of the cement block. The cement block was so situated that an automobile proceeding on the shoulder must inevitably strike it unless the driver should see it in time to stop or turn. It was at a point on the highway where it was the right, and might at times be the duty, of the driver of an automobile to proceed. It constituted a grave and obvious danger which it was the duty of the defendant to remove, and its presence rendered the defendant guilty of actionable fault.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Cliche, J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nJean L. Peloquin, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nLeonce Cot\u00e9, Q.C., and Yves Forest, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The facts leading up to the tragic accident, in which appellant's wife was killed, are fully set out in the reasons of my brother Cartwright and I need not repeat them. In their essential details they are not in dispute.\nThe record shows that at the place where the accident happened, the Stanstead-Sherbrooke Highway (the paved portion of which is 22 feet wide) makes a wide sweeping curve to the left looking toward Sherbrooke, and at that point is virtually level. The shoulder, on the side on which the appellant's car left the travelled portion of the highway, slopes gently towards a shallow ditch and is partly gravelled, partly grass-covered.\nIt is clear that at the time of the accident appellant's car was completely off the paved portion of the highway. A block of cement weighing 2,400 lbs. was thrown a distance of some 60 feet from the point of impact, after which the appellant's car, continuing on, struck and broke a telephone pole. It was established that this block of cement, in the form of a cube about 2\u00bd feet square, was located at a distance of 4\u00bd feet from the paved portion of the highway on the grass covered portion of the shoulder.\nThere is no provincial statute which requires the Quebec Roads Department to provide roads under its control with a shoulder of any particular width, or of any particular character and it is common knowledge that, in fact, on roads in the province such shoulders vary appreciably both as to width and as to character, depending in most cases upon the nature of the terrain.\nIn places where the shoulder of a road is appropriate for that purpose, it can be used for parking or in case of emergency may be driven along, but in either case, I share the view expressed in the Court2 below that a motorist venturing on to such shoulder is obliged to proceed slowly and with care.\nAt the time of the accident, appellant's car was well off the paved portion of the highway and was travelling at a speed which\u2014on the evidence of the witness C\u00f4t\u00e9 and in the light of what happened\u2014must have been at least fifty miles per hour.\nIn my opinion this excessive speed was the real cause of this unfortunate accident. Appellant was dozing at the time, his wife was killed, there were no eye witnesses and therefore no explanation as to why the car was being driven at such speed on the shoulder of the road. The Court below found unanimously that appellant failed to establish fault on the part of respondent and I am in agreement with that finding.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec1 which reversed the judgment of Cliche J. and dismissed the appellant's action.\nCliche J. had given judgment for the appellant personally for the sum of $10,088.80 and as tutor for his infant children for the sum of $2,900 for the child Michelle Robitaille and for the sum of $2,100 for the child France Robitaille. As to these last two items counsel for the appellant asks for leave to appeal.\nOn June 24, 1958, the appellant and his wife were driving in his automobile from Rock Island to Sherbrooke on provincial highway number 5. The distance between these places is about 35 miles. At the commencement of their journey which was at about 10.30 p.m. the appellant was driving but after a time at his wife's suggestion he allowed her to drive. He said he was glad to do this as he was tired. The wife was an experienced and licensed driver. The weather was fine and the pavement dry. The appellant leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes but did not fall asleep. At a point close to the junction of the Waterville Road with highway number 5 he heard sounds suggesting to him that the car had left the paved portion of the highway. His impression was that the car was proceeding at not more than 30 miles per hour. He lifted his head but had no time to see anything. He recovered consciousness in the hospital the following morning.\nNo eye-witnesses of the accident were called to give evidence but, subject to a question as to the speed of the automobile, what actually occurred is established by marks on the surface of the shoulder and the physical facts.\nOn the south-easterly shoulder of highway number 5, that is on the right-hand side as the automobile in question was being driven, there stood a block of cement cubical in shape measuring 2\u00bd to 3 feet and its weight being about 2400 lbs. The distance from the edge of the paved portion of the highway to the nearest part of this cement block was 4\u00bd feet. It had been in that position for a number of years. The appellant's automobile struck the block of cement with the result that his wife was instantly killed, he seriously injured and the automobile demolished.\nThe evidence of a witness called by the respondent, traffic officer Daigle who investigated the accident and made a number of measurements, was accepted by the learned trial judge and is of importance. He testified that there were tire marks made by the automobile shewing that it was driven for 45 feet with all four wheels on the shoulder of the road up to the point where it struck the cement block and that these tire marks before reaching the spot where the block was were curving slightly to the left indicating that the automobile was being turned back towards the paved portion of the highway. As to the condition of the shoulder this witness said:\nQ. Alors, le terrain sur lequel cette automobile-l\u00e0 a circul\u00e9, est-ce que le terrain n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au m\u00eame niveau que la surface pav\u00e9e? R. Elle pouvait l'\u00eatre, mais peut-\u00eatre un peu plus bas.\nQ. Combien? Un pouce (1\")? R. Un pouce (1\"). Q. Alors, il n'y avait pas de diff\u00e9rence substantielle entre l'endroit ou l'automobile a circul\u00e9 et la route pav\u00e9e? R. Non, la seule diff\u00e9rence qu'il y a, c'est un peu plus bas.\nQ. Et s'il y avait un foss\u00e9, il serait encore \u00e0 droite de la machine? R. Si vous voulez appeler un vrai foss\u00e9 plus creux, c'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 droite du chemin.\nQ. Alors, cette automobile-l\u00e0 ne circulait pas dans ce qui \u00e9tait un foss\u00e9 mais sur la route pav\u00e9e ou substantiellement au m\u00eame niveau que la route pav\u00e9e? R. Ou presque.\nThis witness also testified, as indeed seems obvious, that had it been necessary for the driver of the automobile to leave the paved portion of the highway the place in which it was being driven up to the point of striking the block was a proper one. His measurements shewed that the cement block had been moved 60 feet by the impact, that the automobile had continued 45 feet from the point of impact with the block and had come to rest against a telephone pole which it struck and broke.\nThe paved portion of the highway opposite the block was 22 feet in width; the condition of the surface on the right-hand side of the paved portion has been described above. The inference to be drawn from all the evidence of the witness Daigle is that but for the presence of the cement block the automobile would have regained the paved surface of the highway and proceeded on its way without mishap.\nThe plan of the highway filed as an exhibit indicates that at and approaching the point of the accident the highway, as one goes towards Sherbrooke, was sloping slightly downwards and curving pronouncedly to the left.\nTwo questions present themselves (i) at what rate of speed was the automobile being driven, and (ii) for what reason was it driven off the paved portion of the highway.\nOn the first question the evidence of the appellant places the rate of speed at about 30 miles per hour. The respondent's witness, the engineer C\u00f4t\u00e9, as a result of calculations from the distance the cement block was driven expressed the opinion that the rate of speed was about 50 miles an hour. If one takes the higher of these estimates the rate of speed was a lawful one on this highway.\nThe second question is more difficult. All that is known is that while going down a slight grade and rounding a somewhat pronounced curve to the left at a speed not definitely ascertained but not in excess of 50 miles per hour, the automobile did leave the pavement, proceeded on the shoulder for 45 feet and was turning to regain the pavement when it struck the cement block.\nAll the learned Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench were of the opinion that the circumstances of the case put the appellant in the position of having to offer a satisfactory explanation of the happening of the accident, that he had failed to do this and that this necessitated a finding that the negligence of the wife of the appellant was the sole cause of the accident. In reaching this conclusion they purported to apply the principle succinctly stated by my brother Taschereau in Parent v. Lapointe3:\n\u2026. Quand, dans le cours normal des choses, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne doit pas se produire, mais arrive tout de m\u00eame, et cause un dommage \u00e0 autrui, et quand il est \u00e9vident qu'il ne serait pas arriv\u00e9 s'il n'y avait pas eu de n\u00e9gligence, alors, c'est \u00e0 l'auteur de ce fait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il y a une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re, dont il ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable et qui est la source de ce dommage. Si celui qui avait le contr\u00f4le de la chose r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour, l'existence du fait extrins\u00e8que, il aura droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'exon\u00e9ration.\nThe principle is not questioned, but I agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant that in the case at bar the circumstances established in evidence do not call for its application.\nIn Parent's case the car which the defendant was driving while his passengers were asleep left the road and after turning over several times came to rest in a field about 50 feet from the highway. That these facts called for an explanation is not questioned.\nIn the case at bar there is nothing to suggest that any harm would have been caused by the manner in which the car was driven had it not been for the presence of the cement block. The car would presumably have returned to the paved portion of the road and continued without incident. Driving on the shoulder of the highway is not per se either negligent or unlawful. There are times when it is the duty of a driver to do so. There are a number of possibilities; an approaching car passing another car may have caused the driver of the appellant's car to turn onto the shoulder to avoid a collision; it may be that, as suggested in the defence of the respondent, \"elle fut aveugl\u00e9e dans la courbe par les lumi\u00e8res d'un v\u00e9hicule circulant en sens inverse\" and so failed momentarily to realize the sharpness of the curve in the highway. In neither of these supposed cases would she have been guilty of negligence. She might have fallen asleep, which would have been negligent, but this seems unlikely as the journey was a short one and she herself had been driving for only a few miles. Negligence is not presumed; it may, of course, be proved by circumstantial evidence as well as by direct evidence; but in my opinion all the known circumstances are more consistent with the absence of negligence on the part of the driver of the appellant's automobile than with its presence. I have reached the conclusion that the finding of the Court of Queen's Bench that the accident was caused by the negligence of the appellant's wife is not supported by the evidence and should be set aside.\nIt remains to consider whether the respondent was guilty of actionable fault. As to this I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge and I am in substantial agreement with his reasons but as I am differing from the view of the Court of Queen's Bench I will state my reasons briefly in my own words.\nThe block of cement had been in the position in which it was when struck by the appellant's automobile for a number of years. Its size and position have already been described. Its colour was such that it would not be readily visible at night. It was so situated that an automobile proceeding on the shoulder with its left-hand wheels just off the paved portion of the highway must inevitably strike it unless the driver saw it in time to stop or turn. It was at a point on the highway where it was the right, and might at times be the duty, of the driver of an automobile to proceed. It constituted a grave and obvious danger which it was the duty of the respondent to remove. Article 35 of Chapter 141 of the Revised Statutes of Qu\u00e9bec (1941) provides as follows:\n35. Work necessary for the maintenance and repair of provincial highways, regional highways or improved roads, means: \u2026\n3. The maintenance and repair of shoulders.\nI agree with and wish to adopt the following passage in the reasons of the learned trial judge:\nLa preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas pourquoi l'\u00e9pouse d\u00e9funte du Requ\u00e9rant a conduit le v\u00e9hicule qui les transportait sur l'accotement de la route \u00e0 ce moment. Comme dit l'ing\u00e9nieur C\u00f4t\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, l'accotement du chemin est lui-m\u00eame une surface de roulement. 'C'est une de ses fonctions' dit-il 'd'y recevoir les v\u00e9hicules en cas d'urgence pour y rouler ou y stationner.' Bien que la Cour ne sache pas pourquoi le v\u00e9hicule a circul\u00e9 sur l'accotement \u00e0 ce moment, il reste que c'\u00e9tait son droit d'y circuler en cas d'urgence et d'y trouver une surface de roulement d\u00e9pourvue d'obstacle semblable.\nApr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la preuve dans son ensemble, la Cour arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que cet accident et les dommages qui en sont r\u00e9sult\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s uniquement par la faute des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'entretien de cette route nationale, dont l'Intim\u00e9 est responsable, pour avoir laiss\u00e9 subsister, durant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, cette obstruction dangereuse sur la surface de roulement d'urgence qui pr\u00e9sentait l'accotement de la route \u00e0 cet endroit et sur lequel le v\u00e9hicule concern\u00e9, en cette occasion, a percut\u00e9, causant la mort de l'\u00e9pouse du requ\u00e9rant, les blessures graves de ce dernier et le bris de son v\u00e9hicule.\nThe assessment of damages made by the learned trial judge was not attacked.\nI would grant the application for leave to appeal as to the sums awarded by the learned trial judge for the infants Michelle Robitaille and France Robitaille. I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright J. dissenting\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Blanchette, P\u00e9loquin & Roberge, Sherbrooke.\nAttorney for the defendant, respondent: L.

Frenette, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nAbbott J.:\u2014Le 2 ao\u00fbt 1954, Raymond B\u00e9rub\u00e9, alors membre des Forces Arm\u00e9es du Canada, \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de trente jours. Il vint solliciter un emploi de journalier de l'intim\u00e9e, dont il connaissait l'un des contrema\u00eetres, G\u00e9rard Lemieux, pour qui il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9.\nIl fut embauch\u00e9 suivant un contrat d'engagement intervenu selon les r\u00e8gles ordinaires. L'employeur, couvert par la Commission des Accidents du Travail de Qu\u00e9bec, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les cotisations pour ce nouvel employ\u00e9, dont le nom appara\u00eet sur sa feuille de paie.\nLe 3 ao\u00fbt 1954, B\u00e9rub\u00e9 fut affect\u00e9, avec d'autres journaliers au creusage d'une tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 Charlesbourg, pr\u00e8s de Qu\u00e9bec. Ce foss\u00e9 devait recevoir un drain agricole de six pouces de diam\u00e8tre, devait \u00eatre de trois cent cinquante pieds de longueur, de quatre pieds de largeur au sommet, de deux pieds \u00e0 la base, et avoir une profondeur de six \u00e0 huit pieds.\nB\u00e9rub\u00e9 connaissait ce genre de travail puisqu'il avait travaill\u00e9 en 1951 pour Lemieux, contrema\u00eetre de l'intim\u00e9e, pour le creusage d'une tranch\u00e9e. Le 12 ao\u00fbt 1954, B\u00e9rub\u00e9, alors qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 creuser \u00e0 quatre pieds et demi, fut recouvert par un amas de terre \u00e9boul\u00e9e et subit une fracture du tibia gauche.\nLa victime fut alors hospitalis\u00e9e \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital St-Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise et y demeura jusqu'au 2 septembre 1954 alors que, sa permission expir\u00e9e, il regagna son r\u00e9giment.\nA cette date, les frais d'hospitalisation et les frais m\u00e9dicaux furent acquitt\u00e9s par la Commission des Accidents du Travail de Qu\u00e9bec, soit $382. La Commission paya \u00e0 la victime $136.36 \u00e0 titre d'incapacit\u00e9 totale temporaire pour la p\u00e9riode du 13 ao\u00fbt au 9 septembre 1954, se basant sur un taux de 7 pour cent et paya, \u00e0 titre d'incapacit\u00e9 partielle permanente, la somme de $1,922.44.\nAu retour de l'accident\u00e9 au r\u00e9giment, il fut constat\u00e9 que la fracture n'\u00e9tait pas consolid\u00e9e. L'appelante fit hospitaliser B\u00e9rub\u00e9 pendant 67 jours au total dans divers h\u00f4pitaux militaires et lui accorda trois cong\u00e9s d'invalidit\u00e9 de trente jours chacun.\nL'accident\u00e9, le 2 septembre 1954, \u00e0 son retour au r\u00e9giment, n'avait pas inform\u00e9 la Commission des Accidents du Travail de Qu\u00e9bec et le service des r\u00e9clamations dut entreprendre les recherches pour le retracer.\nLe 10 novembre 1954, le Lieutenant-Colonel Trudeau, commandant du Royal 22e R\u00e9giment \u00e0 Valcartier fut avis\u00e9 par lettre et requis de r\u00e9pondre si l'autorit\u00e9 militaire devait, dor\u00e9navant, assumer les frais de l'accident\u00e9. Le 19 novembre 1954, le Colonel Trudeau r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la Commission, disant qu'elle serait avis\u00e9e lorsque les dispositions seraient prises, d\u00e8s que les r\u00e9sultats de la Commission d'enqu\u00eate seraient connus.\nMalgr\u00e9 cette lettre, aucune communication ou r\u00e9clamation ne fut dirig\u00e9e ni \u00e0 la Commission des Accidents du Travail de Qu\u00e9bec, ni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e par B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ou par les autorit\u00e9s militaires.\nLa r\u00e9clamation de la Couronne \u00e9tait au total de $2,689.95 y compris (1) $924.55 valeur de soins m\u00e9dicaux et (2) $1,765.40 de solde et des allocations. L'appelante soumet que l'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute de l'intim\u00e9e, qu'en l'occurrence sa propre loi l'obligeait \u00e0 verser ces prestations, que celles-ci sont la mesure du pr\u00e9judice qu'elle a subi, et qu'elle a droit de les r\u00e9clamer de l'intim\u00e9e.\nB\u00e9rub\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 \u00e0 un travail des plus simple, pour une man\u0153uvre, un ouvrage qui, de sa nature, ne comporte aucun danger: la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 accompli le m\u00eame genre d'ouvrage dans des conditions identiques.\nIl admit que les instructions venant de la direction lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 plusieurs reprises par le contrema\u00eetre Lemieux, qu'il reconna\u00eet comme un homme comp\u00e9tent et consciencieux. Le jour m\u00eame de l'accident, le contrema\u00eetre avait averti de ne pas creuser plus que n\u00e9cessaire pour la pose d'une section de tuyautage d'un pied. Au moment de l'accident le contrema\u00eetre \u00e9tait tout pr\u00e8s de la victime.\nLes instructions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, par le Pr\u00e9sident de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e9taient les suivantes:\u2014\u00abPass\u00e9 quatre pieds, si vous voyez que \u00e7a devient dangereux, boisez\u00bb, et comme question de fait, les pi\u00e8ces de bois avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9es et d\u00e9pos\u00e9es sur le bord de la tranch\u00e9e pour parer \u00e0 toute \u00e9ventualit\u00e9. L'\u00e9boulis s'est produit alors que tout paraissait normal.\nLes travaux \u00e9taient surveill\u00e9s de pr\u00e8s par un contrema\u00eetre consciencieux et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 qui se tenait sur les lieux. Les ouvriers \u00e9taient entra\u00een\u00e9s au travail qu'ils accomplissaient; les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises; les ouvriers n'avaient pas pr\u00e9venu le contrema\u00eetre d'aucun danger apparent.\nLa Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier2 renvoya l'information, par le motif principal que la Couronne n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir comme question de fait que l'intim\u00e9e a commis aucune faute qui aurait engendr\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 suivant les dispositions du Code Civil de Qu\u00e9bec. Il y a preuve suffisante pour soutenir ce jugement; je partage l'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve du savant juge au proc\u00e8s, et ne saurait la modifier.\nDans les circonstances ci-dessus relat\u00e9es, je ne trouve pas qu'il convienne de consid\u00e9rer la question, \u00e0 savoir si la Couronne pourrait soutenir avec succ\u00e8s une r\u00e9clamation contre l'intim\u00e9e dans le cas o\u00f9 il y aurait eu faute de la part de cette derni\u00e8re.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: E.

Rawlings (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1962: December 13, 14; 1963: March 7.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Agreement to forbear from taking action on promissory notes\u2014Undertaking by debtor to perform certain obligations\u2014Good consideration\u2014Creditor's right to sue suspended\u2014Action on notes premature.\nAn action was brought for the balance owing on six promissory notes, all of which were made by the defendant payable to the plaintiff. Before the commencement of the action the parties had executed an agreement as to five of the notes, whereby it was agreed that the defendant would pay, and the plaintiff would accept, $300 per month at 5 per cent, instead of $400 at 8 per cent, until the account was fully paid. It was orally agreed that payment of the sixth note should be postponed until the first five had been paid pursuant to the terms of the written agreement. The payments, starting on August 16, 1958, were to be paid on or before the 16th of each month. From time to time the defendant was to give the plaintiff a series of six post-dated cheques, each series to cover a period of six months. The several series were so given, but the cheques for the period July to December, 1960, were in each case dated on the 18th instead of the 16th, apparently as the result of inadvertence. These cheques were accepted by the plaintiff as being in compliance with the agreement; those for July to November were cashed as they came due.\nThe writ was issued on December 7, 1960. The defendant argued that the action was premature by reason of the written and oral agreements. However, the trial judge found that there had been default on the part of the defendant in respect of the cheques payable in October and November, 1960, and directed that the plaintiff recover the full amount of principal and interest outstanding on the notes. An appeal from this judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, one member dissenting. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nAt the date of the issue of the writ the agreement between the parties was in existence and the defendant was not in default under its terms.\nThe giving of the several series of post-dated cheques constituted good consideration for the agreement by the plaintiff to forbear from taking action on the promissory notes so long as the defendant continued to deliver the cheques and the same were paid by the bank on presentation. Sibree v. Tripp (1846), 15 M. & W. 23, applied; Foakes v. Beer (1884), 9 App. Cas. 605, referred to. The inclusion in the agreement of a privilege of prepayment did not affect the question. The defendant did not reserve any option to himself to refrain from delivering the cheques or from providing for their payment by the bank.\nAs held by the Court below, the plaintiff's right of action on the six promissory notes had not been extinguished. It followed that should the defendant have made default under the agreement, it would thereupon have been open to the plaintiff to bring action for the amount remaining unpaid on the notes; but an agreement for good consideration suspending a right of action so long as the debtor continues to perform the obligations which he has undertaken thereunder is binding. To hold that the claimant in such a case may, in breach of the agreement, pursue his right of action leaving the defendant to a cross-action or counterclaim would be to countenance the circuity of action and multiplicity of proceedings which it was one of the chief objects of the Judicature Acts to abolish and would be contrary to the terms of subs. 7 of s. 2 of the Laws Declaratory Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 213. British Russian Gazette & Trade Outlook Ltd. v. Associated Newspapers Ltd. [1933] 2 K.B. 616, distinguished; Stracy v. The Governor and Company of the Bank of England (1830), 6 Bing. 754, applied.\nSo long as the defendant in the instant case continued to perform his obligations under the agreement, the plaintiff's right to sue on the notes was suspended; consequently, the action brought on December 7, 1960, was premature and accordingly should have been dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Maclean J. Appeal allowed.\nJoseph McKenna, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant. Robert A. Price, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Maclean J. directing that the respondent recover the full amount of principal and interest outstanding on six promissory notes and that there be a reference to ascertain the total outstanding. Davey J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nThe particulars of the notes sued on, all of which were made by the appellant payable to the respondent, are as follows:\n1. Promissory Note dated February 4, 1952, to secure the sum of $4,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, payable on demand.\n2. Promissory Note dated February 4, 1952, to secure the sum of $5,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, payable on demand.\n3. Promissory Note dated February 4, 1952, to secure the sum of $5,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, payable on demand.\n4. Promissory Note dated February 4, 1952, to secure the sum of $2,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, payable on demand.\n5. Promissory Note dated October 10, 1956, to secure the sum of $5,000 payable to the plaintiff on May 1, 1957.\n6. Promissory Note dated May 5, 1958, to secure the sum of $4,576.01, with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum, payable to the Plaintiff on December 10, 1958.\nAll the notes were dated at Victoria, B.C.; the first five were payable \"at Victoria B.C.\"; the sixth was payable \"at the Canadian Bank of Commerce here\".\nNo question is raised as to the making or the validity of the notes or as to the finding of the learned trial judge that the sixth note was duly presented for payment. The defence is that the action was premature by reason of a written agreement between the parties as to the first five notes and an oral agreement as to the sixth note. The written agreement was in the form of a letter addressed by the respondent to the appellant. It reads as follows:\nJuly 7th, 1958.\nE. H. M. Foot, Esq.,\nBank of Toronto Building,\nDouglas St., Victoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nI have been thinking matters over regarding your indebtedness to me and after a good deal of thought I think that you may be interested in the following proposal:\n(1) That I accept the sum of $300.00 per month provided that it is paid on the sixteenth of each and every month without fail, and I agree to lower the interest from eight per cent to five per cent.\n(2) The above offer only to take place provided you do not miss any of the Three hundred dollar payments, which are to be paid monthly, starting on August 16th, 1958 and to be paid to me on or before the sixteenth of each and every month following until the full account is paid.\n(3) These cheques to be for $300.00 each and the first to be payable on the 16th day of August 1958, and every month following, these cheques to be given to cover the following six months starting on the 16th of Angust 1958 and to the 16th of February 1959, after which you are to give me six more such cheques to carry on the next six months, that would take it to August 1959 after which you are to give me six more such cheques to cover another six months and so on until the account is fully paid.\n(4) Should any of these cheques be turned down by the C.B. of C. the whole of the unpaid indebtedness will go back to the present state namely, the interest will revert to the present eight per cent, and the monthly payments revert to $400.00 per month.\n(5) My reason for making this offer is not only to help you in your finances but to help me carry on. I realize that I am not going to have many more years to live and would like to be able to do several things before that time comes. This is clearly an advantage to you, as first of all you save three per cent in interest which at the present rate you are paying saves you Fifty dollars per month.\n(6) You of course to have the privilege of paying off the whole debt to me at any time you may wish to do so, this offer must be accepted in writing on or before August next.\n(7) I, E. H. M. Foot, agree to the above terms of payment.\nThis was signed by both parties on July 17, 1958.\nIt was orally agreed between the parties that payment of the sixth note should be postponed until the first five had been paid pursuant to the terms of the written agreement. The respondent sent to the appellant from time to time the several series of six post-dated cheques called for by paragraph 3 of the agreement; but the six cheques dated in the months of July 1960, to December 1960, inclusive, were in each case dated on the 18th instead of the 16th of the month. These were sent in a letter from the appellant to the respondent dated July 26, 1960, which stated that they were sent \"in accordance with our continuing agreement of the past several years relating to the balance of the monies I owe you\". It would seem that dating these cheques on the 18th was the result of inadvertence.\nIt may be that the respondent could have elected to regard the lateness in sending the July cheque and the dating of all six on the 18th instead of the 16th as a default entitling him to rescind the agreement but he did not do so. He acknowledged them by letter to the appellant dated July 28th, 1960, in which he said:\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of six $300.00 cheques, dating from July 18th to Dec. 18th '60 as per your letter to me of July 26th, these cheques to be cashed as dated.\nThis was followed by a statement of the balance of the account to date.\nThe cheques dated in July 1960, to November 1960, were all cashed by the respondent. The writ was issued on December 7, 1960.\nOn the question whether at the date of the issue of the writ the appellant was in default under the agreement I wish to adopt the following passage in the reasons of Davey J.A.:\nIn accordance with the memorandum the appellant delivered to the respondent each series of six post dated cheques. But, with the series of cheques payable from July 16th, 1960, to December, 1960, the appellant through some oversight post dated each one, including those for October, November and December, 1960, on the 18th instead of the 16th of each month. It is clear that the respondent accepted that as a compliance with the memorandum, cashed the cheques as they came due, and credited the appellant with the proceeds. From page 112 of the appeal book it would appear that the default respondent relied on in the trial Court lay in the circumstance that the cheques for these three months were dated the 18th instead of the 16th. That seems to have been the default found by the learned trial Judge. But, with deference, I am unable to regard that as a default in face of the respondent's conduct. Before us, respondent's counsel finally conceded that he didn't seriously rely on that as a default.\nWhen I first read the appeal book, it occurred to me that the learned trial Judge might have concluded from the dates in respondent's accounts that the appellant's cheques for October and November, 1960, had not been paid until the last days of those months. But that was not argued before us, and, apparently, not below. In any event it was not raised in the evidence of either appellant or respondent. The dates entered in respondent's accounts may just as well have been due to the respondent's delay in presenting the cheques for payment or to his method of keeping his accounts. The latter explanation seems to be the more likely, since in respondent's statement for November, 1960, enclosed in an envelope post-marked November 22, 1960, he gives appellant credit for the November payment under date of November 30, 1960. Also in Exhibit 10, the respondent has credited each of the monthly payments for June to November, 1960, as of the last day of each month.\nIn my respectful opinion, there was no default in the payments for October or November, 1960.\nIt should be mentioned that before us counsel for the respondent stated that he does rely on the fact that these cheques were dated on the 18th instead of on the 16th as constituting default. In reaching my agreement with the view of Davey J.A. that there was no default I do not base my conclusion on any concession that may have been made by counsel at any stage of the proceedings.\nI take it then that the factual situation at the date of the issue of the writ was that the agreement between the parties was in existence and the appellant was not in default under its terms. The question calling for decision is whether this rendered the action premature.\nThe learned trial judge found that there had been default by the appellant in respect of the cheques payable in October and November, 1960, and consequently did not find it necessary to deal with the other points which were fully argued before us; it is clear, however, that the point which appears to me to be decisive of the appeal was taken before him. He says:\nIn his reply the plaintiff pleaded lack of consideration for the agreement, and in this connection a point of some nicety arose as the defendant contended that the giving of the post-dated cheques constituted consideration sufficient to support the agreement.\nI have reached the conclusion that the giving of the several series of post-dated cheques constituted good consideration for the agreement by the respondent to forbear from taking action on the promissory notes so long as the appellant continued to deliver the cheques and the same were paid by the bank on presentation. This view of the law has prevailed ever since the Court of Exchequer in Sibree v. Tripp[3] expressed disapproval of the decision in Cumber v. Wane[4]. In Sibree v. Tripp the defendant pleaded in answer to a claim for five hundred pounds that the plaintiff had agreed to accept as full payment three promissory notes made by the defendant payable to the plaintiff for one hundred and twenty-five pounds, one hundred and twenty-five pounds and fifty pounds and that the defendant had given these notes to the plaintiff in pursuance of the agreement. It was held that this plea was a good answer to the action in point of law as the acceptance of a negotiable instrument may be in law a satisfaction of a debt of a greater amount. At pp. 37 and 38 Baron Alderson said:\nIt is undoubtedly true, that payment of a portion of a liquidated demand, in the same manner as the whole liquidated demand ought to be paid, is payment only in part; it is not one bargain, but two, namely, payment of part, and an agreement, without consideration, to give up the residue. The Courts might very well have held the contrary, and have left the matter to the agreement of the parties; but undoubtedly the law is so settled. But if you substitute for a sum of money a piece of paper, or a stick of sealing-wax, it is different, and the bargain may be carried out in its full integrity. A man may give in satisfaction of a debt of One Hundred pounds, a horse of the value of five pounds, but not five pounds. Again, if the time or place of payment be different, the one sum may be a satisfaction of the other. Let us, then, apply these principles to the present case. If for money you give a negotiable security, you pay it in a different way. The security may be worth more or less: it is of uncertain value. That is a case falling within the rule of law I have referred to.\nThere is nothing in the judgments delivered in the House of Lords in Foakes v. Beer[5] to throw any doubt on the rule laid down in Sibree v. Tripp; indeed its validity is assumed and the case is distinguished. For example, at p. 613 the Earl of Selborne L.C., says:\nAll the authorities subsequent to Cumber v. Wane, which were relied upon by the appellant at your Lordships' Bar (such as Sibree v. Tripp. Curlewis v. Clark and Goddard v. O'Brien) have proceeded upon the distinction, that, by giving negotiable paper or otherwise, there had been some new consideration for a new agreement, distinct from mere money payments in or towards discharge of the original liability. I think it unnecessary to go through those cases, or to examine the particular grounds on which each of them was decided. There are no such facts in the case now before your Lordships. Sheppard J.A., with whom Tysoe J.A. agreed, was of opinion that there was no consideration for the agreement; he expressed doubts as to whether on the true construction of the agreement the appellant had promised to deliver the cheques and cause them to be paid and continued:\nIn any event, assuming that the promise had been given by the defendant as alleged, that performance may be effected by the defendant paying the debt in full (Clause 6), but there can be no legal prejudice in such payment as the debt has throughout remained due and owing. Hence the promise of the defendant to deliver the cheques could be avoided without legal prejudice, namely, by paying the debt in full, and therefore the promise is not a valid consideration.\nWilliston on Contracts, revised edition, p. 365, reads:\n'That a promise which in terms reserves the option of performance to the promisor is insufficient to support a counter-promise is well settled.'\nOn the question of construction I agree with Davey J.A. when he says:\nAs a matter of construction, the agreement clearly implies that so long as there is no default in its terms the respondent will not sue on the notes, but will forbear from bringing action. A promise to forbear is readily implied from an arrangement such as this.\nIn my view, when paragraphs 3 and 7 of the agreement are read together they disclose an undertaking by the appellant to give the cheques from time to time in accordance with paragraph 3; this undertaking is the consideration for the respondent's agreement to withhold action and so long as the appellant continued to carry it out the respondent's right to sue was suspended.\nWith the greatest respect I am unable to agree that the inclusion in the agreement of a privilege of prepayment affects the question. The authorities to which Sheppard J.A. refers are distinguishable on their facts. In the case at bar the appellant did not reserve any option to himself to refrain from delivering the cheques or from providing for their payment by the bank.\nThere was a further ground upon which Sheppard J.A. would have dismissed the appeal, which is expressed as follows:\nFurther, the written agreement, if a valid contract, does not create a defence. The promise by the plaintiff is merely to withhold action; there was no intention to extinguish the debt. Hence, assuming a valid contract and a binding promise to withhold action, that was a mere accord and until such time as there is satisfaction, such an accord does not divest the plaintiff of his right of action. The learned Justice of Appeal refers to the reasons of Greer L.J. in British Russian Gazette & Trade Outlook Ltd. v. Associated Newspapers Ltd.[6], and to Chitty on Contracts, 20th ed., at p. 286, and continues:\nIt follows that notwithstanding such 'contract', the plaintiff could bring action on the five promissory notes then due although he might make himself liable to damages for not withholding action as agreed. The oral agreement relating to the sixth note affords no defence for the same reasons.\nI agree with the view of Sheppard J.A. that the respondent's right of action on the six promissory notes has not been extinguished. It follows that should the appellant have made default under the agreement of July 17, 1958, it would thereupon have been open to the respondent to bring action for the amount remaining unpaid on the notes; but an agreement for good consideration suspending a right of action so long as the debtor continues to perform the obligations which he has undertaken thereunder is binding. To hold that the claimant in such a case may, in breach of the agreement, pursue his right of action leaving the defendant to a cross-action or counter claim would be to countenance the circuity of action and multiplicity of proceedings which it was one of the chief objects of the Judicature Acts to abolish and would be contrary to the terms of subs. 7 of s. 2 of the Laws Declaratory Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 213.\nThe judgments in the British Russian Gazette case were not directed to the question whether an agreement for good consideration suspending or postponing a right of action can be pleaded as a bar to an action brought prematurely.\nOn this point I think it sufficient to refer to one authority. In Stracy v. The Governor and Company of the Bank of England[7], the plaintiffs had a valid claim against the bank for having transferred stock standing in their names to another name under a forged power of attorney. The plaintiffs, for good consideration, agreed not to take action until they had made a claim under a commission of bankruptcy isued against the firm in which the forger of the power had been a partner. It was held that until they had fulfilled their engagement to tender a proof under the commission of bankruptcy they could not sue the bank. Tindal C.J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (other than Bosanquet J., who had been engaged in the cause and took no part in the judgment,) said: at p. 773:\nWe all think our judgment ought to be given for the Defendants, upon another point which has been presented for the consideration of the Court. For it appears to us that the Plaintiffs have, before the commencement of this action, entered into an agreement with the Defendants upon good consideration; under which agreement their right of action is suspended, until they take the proceeding which they had bound themselves by such agreement to adopt.\nat p. 774:\nIt is urged by the Plaintiffs, that if this is an agreement on their part, it may be the ground of an action by the Bank to recover damages, but that it is no bar to the present action. But the agreement is not set up as a perpetual bar; it is merely insisted on as an objection to the action being brought at the present time. It is urged as an agreement by which the Plaintiffs have for a good consideration restrained themselves from suing, not perpetually, but only until they have first done a particular action.\nand at p. 775:\nUnder these circumstances, we think the Defendants, in order to avoid circuity of action, may avail themselves of this agreement as a suspension of the Plaintiffs' right to sue in the present action, and that they are not confined to a remedy by a cross action thereon.\nJudgment was accordingly given for the defendants.\nIn my opinion the reasoning of this judgment is applicable to the facts of the case at bar. So long as the appellant continued to perform his obligations under the agreement of July 17, 1958, the respondent's right to sue on the notes was suspended, consequently his action brought on December 7, 1960, was premature and should have been dismissed on that ground.\nThe reasons which have brought me to the conclusion that the action was premature make it unnecessary to consider either the ground of estoppel on which Davey J.A. proceeded or the arguments addressed to us as to the effect of subs. 33 of s. 2 of the Laws Declaratory Act. I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and that of the learned trial judge and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Joseph McKenna, Victoria.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: Robert A.

The deceased was found lying prone with a bullet wound in his right temple and a rifle was lying on or beside the body. An action having been brought on the policy, the company invoked a provision thereof which read: \"In case the life insured shall die by his own hand whether sane or insane within two years from the date on which this policy is issued, the liability of the company hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the premiums paid on this policy without interest.\" The trial judge held that the defendant had not satisfied the onus resting upon it to show that the deceased had committed suicide. However unlikely an accident might be as an explanation of the death, it was not beyond all possibility, and it was not more unlikely than that a normal, cheerful, happy young man had deliberately taken his life. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, affirmed the judgment at trial; the defendant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Courts below did not adopt any standard of proof other than that of weighing the probabilities and improbabilities of the plaintiff's case against those of the case for the defendant, and having due regard to the seriousness of the allegation of suicide and the complete absence of motive they concluded that the preponderance of evidence weighed in the plaintiff's favour. This was no departure from the rule with respect to the burden resting upon those who set out to prove the commission of a criminal or quasi-criminal offence in civil cases as it has been accepted in this Court. Clark v. The King (1921), 61 S.C.R. 608; Smith v. Smith and Smedman, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 312; New York Life Insurance, Co. v. Schlitt, [1945] S.C.R. 289; Industrial Acceptance Corporation v. Couture, [1954] S.C.R. 34; Hanes v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co. [1963] S.C.R. 154, referred to.\nTritschler J.A., one of the dissenting Justices of Appeal, discounted entirely the complete absence of motive. It has been clearly recognized that motive taken alone is of very little probative value in counterbalancing the presumption against suicide, but it did not follow from this that complete absence of evidence of motive when, taken in conjunction with the unnatural quality of the act of self-destruction can never be a decisive factor in support of the theory that death was accidental. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Schlitt, supra; Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Insurance Co. [1919] A.C. 254, referred to.\nThere was no error in the standard of proof adopted in this case, and as there was evidence to support the finding of accidental death the appeal was accordingly dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Bastin J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and J. Flynn, for the defendant, appellant.\nD. E. Bowman and J. S. Walker, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba affirming the judgment of Bastin J. which ordered that the respondent recover against the London Life Insurance Company the proceeds of an insurance policy issued by that company on the life of her husband Robert L. Chase with effect from the 15th of April 1959.\nRobert L. Chase died as the result of a gunshot wound on May 1, 1959, and the appellant, while admitting that the policy in question was then in force, invokes the following provision thereof:\nIn case the life insured shall die by his own hand whether sane or insane within two years from the date on which this policy is issued, the liability of the company hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the premiums paid on this policy without interest. The learned trial judge has summarized the evidence concerning the character and background of the late Robert Chase and the circumstances of his death in the following paragraph of his reasons:\nThe late Robert Leroy Chase and the plaintiff were 23 years of age at the date of his death. They had been married for four years and were living with their children, aged respectively 2\u00bd years and 5 months, in a house they were purchasing in the Town of Transcona. Mr. Chase had been employed by the Canadian National Railways for 7 years as a clerk and was receiving a monthly wage of $365.00. On the evening of May 1st, 1959, he had gone to a \"stag\" party, for a friend who was getting married, at the Canadian Legion Hall. He returned at about 20 minutes to midnight, kissed his wife who was dozing on the chesterfield, and went to the bathroom at the rear of the house. He then went into a room, across the hall from the bathroom, which was used for storage purposes. On hearing a sound his wife went to this room and found him lying on the floor. She summoned her family, consisting of her father, mother and brother, from their home 2\u00bd blocks away and her father summoned the police. Within a few minutes Sergeant Teres, who is now Chief Constable of the Transcona Police, arrived with two constables and found the deceased lying prone with a bullet wound in his right temple.\nAll the judges in the Courts below concluded that the fatal wound indicated that the muzzle of the rifle was in close contact with the skin at the moment when the bullet and propelling gases left the barrel and entered the skull of the deceased, and Dr. Fontaine, a highly qualified expert called on behalf of the appellant, testified that the nature of the wound, the position of the body, and the character of the rifle all pointed to suicide as the only logical explanation of the death.\nThe learned trial judge noted that Dr. Fontaine's reconstruction of the shooting was based entirely on the evidence of other witnesses and that while it appeared to account for all the known facts and to justify the opinion that the death was suicidal, it nevertheless did not exclude the possibility of accident.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Bastin stated his view of the issue before him in the following terms:\nThe issue before me is whether the circumstances of the death of Robert Leroy Chase are not only consistent with suicide but inconsistent with any other reasonable explanation. The issue might be put in another way by asking the question: Has the fact of suicide been proved to my reasonable satisfaction, in spite of the inherent unlikelihood of this conclusion as shown by the evidence as to character and situa- tion of the deceased? However the issue is expressed, I conclude that the degree of improbability of suicide in the circumstances must be overborne by the cogency of the proof.\nAfter a careful review of the evidence, the learned trial judge concluded by saying:\nI have come to the conclusion that however unlikely accident may be as an explanation of the death it is not beyond all possibility and it is not more unlikely than that this normal, cheerful, happy young man deliberately took his life. The defendants have therefore not satisfied the onus resting upon them.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the opinion of the majority was delivered by Schultz J. who, having cited the well-known decision of Mignault J. in London Life Insurance Co. v. Trustee of the Property of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd.1 went on to say:\nBy virtue of that case the burden resting on the defendants in the instant case was that they must prove affirmatively not only that the evidence is consistent with this allegation of suicide but further that it is inconsistent with any rational explanation.\nThese and other excerpts from the judgments in the Courts below were cited by the appellant's counsel as evidence of the fact that the trial judge and the majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal had misdirected themselves as to the standard of proof applicable to the circumstances, and it was pointed out that some of the language used was capable of being construed as meaning that in assessing the evidence these judges were guided by the rule applicable to criminal cases or that they applied an even higher standard of proof but when the judgments are read as a whole I do not think that they bear out this construction.\nIt is apparent from the judgment of Schultz J.A. that he discounted the evidence of Dr. Fontaine, which was the cornerstone of the appellant's case, and that he was strongly influenced by the complete lack of proof of any kind of motive for suicide. In my view, the true basis of his decision is to be found in the following paragraph:\nThese considerations lead me to conclude that having regard to the physical facts relevant to the death of Robert Chase, the story advanced by the plaintiff though open to question on some points is a possible and rational one. But when in addition to such considerations, regard is had to the fact that there was a complete absence of any motive for death on the part of the insured, and every reason and desire to live, I am persuaded that the theory of the plaintiff, bearing in mind the totality of all the circumstances, is a more consistent and rational one than the hypothesis advanced by the defendants which wholly ignores the evidence of lack of motive.\nAfter considering the decisions of Bastin J. and Schultz J.A. in their entirety, I cannot say that they adopted any standard other than that of weighing the probabilities and improbabilities of the plaintiff's case against those of the case for the defendant and that having due regard to the seriousness of the allegation of suicide and the complete absence of motive they concluded that the preponderance of evidence weighed in the plaintiff's favour. I do not regard this as any departure from the rule with respect to the burden resting upon those who set out to prove the commission of a criminal or quasi-criminal offence in civil cases as it has been accepted in this Court. (See Clark v. The King2; Smith v. Smith and Smedman3; New York Lije Insurance Company v. Schlitt4; Industrial Acceptance Corporation v. Couture5; and Hanes v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company6.)\nIt is interesting to note that the same rule was applied by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in the case of Derrington v. Dominion Insurance Corporation7, a decision which was rendered very shortly after the present case was decided in that Court and to which Schultz J.A. was a party.\nIt would not be proper to ignore the thorough and analytical dissenting judgments of Tritschler J.A. and Guy J.A., the former of which was particularly relied on by the appellant. An examination of the opinion of Tritschler J.A. discloses that the learned judge discounted entirely the complete absence of motive and he said in the last paragraph of his reasons:\nThe absence of evidence of motive can never be decisive. The proof of suicide is to be sought in the circumstances of the death. These circumstances force me to the conclusion that the death was self-inflicted with intent.\nIn the present case, it appears to me that there was not only \"absence of evidence of motive\" but \"evidence of absence of motive\" and it was interesting to note that counsel were unable to point to any decided case in which suicide was raised as a defence and where, as here, there was no evidence to support either motive or insanity as a contributing cause.\nThe weight to be attached to evidence of motive in a suicide case was discussed by Taschereau J. in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Schlitt, supra, where he said, at p. 301:\nMotives are indeed very unreliable and they cannot be classified as an accurate determining cause of human deeds which they too often influence in different ways. Taken alone, and not coupled with other extraneous evidence, they have very little probative value, and surely those that are alleged in the case at bar do not rebut the presumption against suicide.\nIt has thus been clearly recognized that motive taken alone is of very little probative value in counter-balancing the presumption against suicide but it does not, in my opinion, follow from this that complete absence of evidence of motive when taken in conjunction with the unnatural quality of the act of self-destruction can never be a decisive factor in support of the theory that death was accidental.\nThe case of Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Insurance Co.8 was one in which suicide was raised as a defence by the life insurance company and Lord Dunedin had occasion to observe that:\nThe evidence to be examined in such a case falls at once into two distinct divisions. There is the evidence which bears on the motive for such an act, and there is the evidence of the facts as to the method of death, which include all actions of the deceased antecedant to, and possibly leading up to, the castastrophe.\nIn my opinion, the majority of the judges in the Courts below concluded that although the method of Chase's death made it improbable that he shot himself accidentally, the story of his life made it even more improbable that he committed suicide.\nI do not find that there was any error in the standard of proof adopted in this case, and as I am of opinion that there was evidence to support the finding of accidental death I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Fillmore, Riley & Company, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Walsh, Micay & Company, Winnipeg.\n1 [1929] S.C.R. 117, 1 D.L.R. 328.\n2 (1921), 61 S.C.R. 608 at 616-17, 59 D.L.R. 121.\n3 [1952] 2 S.C.R. 312 at 331, 3 D.L.R. 449.\n4 [1945] S.C.R. 289, 2 D.L.R. 209.\n5 [1954] S.C.R. 34.\n6 [1963] S.C.R. 154.\n7 (1962), 39 W.W.R. 257, 35 D.L.R.

Some time subsequent to the making of this agreement the appellant took the position that it was void and of no effect, as being beyond the powers of the appellant to make. On December 21, 1959, the Water Assessment Department of the appellant wrote to the respondent advising that as no agreement had been negotiated with that department, by the legislative authority vested in the department, under the direction of the department's head, the rate to be charged would be five cents per thousand gallons. Later, the appellant sued the respondent for moneys alleged to be due for water supplied. Judgment was given by the trial judge in favour of the respondent and this decision having been affirmed by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 70 of the Saint John City Assessment Act, 1948, 1948 (N.B.), c. 137, did not confer upon the Assessment Department the power to make the kind of agreement in question and it did not prevent the appellant, by its Common Council, from determining rates in relation to those special cases which were provided for in s. 5 of An Act to Consolidate the Laws Relating to Sewerage and Water Supply, in the City of Saint John, and in Portions of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds, 1914 (N.B.), c. 83.\nSection 70 of the 1948 Act appeared in the same terms as s. 55 of the Saint John City Assessment Act, 1942, 1942 (N.B.), c. 80. Read against the background of earlier legislation, s. 55 was never intended to do anything more than to transfer to the Assessment Department those powers which, prior thereto, had been exercised by the Director of the Department of Water and Sewerage and which, before 1936, had been exercised by the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage, together with the power of assessment and rate determination which, under s. 30 of the 1914 Act had been vested in the Common Council of the appellant, with, in some instances, the Councillors of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds.\nIt was significant that the power conferred upon the Assessment Department appeared in the Assessment Act and not in a statute amending the 1914 Act. The Assessment Act dealt specifically with the making of assessments and the imposition of rates. It was inconceivable that the Legislature, without any reference whatever to the wide powers of the Common Council conferred by s. 5 of the 1914 Act, and with no repeal thereof, could be deemed to have repealed s. 5 by implication and to have given those broad discretionary powers conferred upon the Common Council to a city department, under the direction of a departmental head who was, himself, appointed by and responsible to the Common Council.\nAttention was also to be paid to the saving provision which appears at the end of s. 70 of the 1948 Act: \"but all provisions of said Act and Acts mentioned and all amendments thereto, not inconsistent with this Act are to be construed as still in force and effect.\" The only provisions of the 1914 Act which could be preserved by this saving clause were those contained in s. 5.\nThe resolution of the Common Council, passed on October 17, 1957, agreeing in principle to the agreement between the appellant and the respondent, coupled with the resolution authorizing the execution of the agreement passed on October 8, 1958, with which resolution that agreement must be read, constituted a resolution of the kind provided for in s. 5. Thereafter the appellant was not entitled to increase the rates, during the twenty-five year period, above those provided by the resolution.\nThe joint meetings of the Common Council of Saint John and Councillors of Lancaster and Simonds provided for in s. 29 of the 1914 Act related only to those matters provision for which was made in s. 30; i.e., the assessment and imposition of water rates. Section 5 stood by itself and dealt with a special situation. By its terms it referred only to a resolution of the Common Council of the City of Saint John and that Common Council alone had the power to pass a resolution for the purposes of that section. It could do so without the presence of any Councillors from the other municipalities whose territory was within the Water District.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, affirming a judgment of Michaud C.J.Q.B.D. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. P. Barry, Q.C., and G. T. Clark, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. B. Gilbert, Q.C., D. M. Gillis, Q.C., and W. E. Clarke, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014 This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which had affirmed the decision of Chief Justice Michaud, which gave judgment in favour of the respondent, with costs. The appellant sued the respondent for moneys alleged to be due for water supplied by the appellant to the respondent. The water, which had been supplied to the respondent from the appellant's Loch Lomond system, was billed on the basis of five cents per thousand gallons.\nIn answer to the appellant's claim, the respondent relied upon an agreement between the parties dated October 16, 1958. The background of this agreement is set forth in its recitals as follows:\nWhereas the Company operates a pulp mill in the City of Lancaster in the Saint John Water District and has been using water supplied by the City from its Spruce Lake watershed;\nAnd Whereas the said supply of water is inadequate for the purposes of the Company and the Company is also desirous of expanding its operations by the construction of an additional pulp mill, or kraft pulp mill;\nAnd Whereas the City has agreed to construct a pipeline to conduct water from its mains in the City across the Reversing Falls Bridge to the Company's property in the City of Lancaster to supply additional water to the said mill and to enlarge its pipeline and storage facilities from and at Loch Lomond and other lakes in the Water District.\nThis agreement went on to provide for the construction by the appellant of certain pipelines and the enlargement by it of its water storage facilities at Loch Lomond, so as to supply the respondent's mills with an estimated quantity of thirty million gallons of water per day.\nThe respondent agreed to pay to the appellant a fixed amount of $35,000 per year, for a period of twenty-five years, and further agreed to pay a consumption charge for such water at the rate of one cent per thousand gallons for the first nine million gallons and one-half cent per thousand gallons for consumption in excess of nine million gallons.\nSome time subsequent to the making of this agreement the appellant took the position that it was void and of no effect, as being beyond the powers of the appellant to make, and on December 21, 1959, the Water Assessment Department of the appellant wrote to the respondent, advising that:\nAs no agreement has as yet been negotiated with this department with respect to the charge to you for supply of water from this source (the Loch Lomond system), by the legislative authority vested in this department, under my direction, the rate to be charged shall be five cents per thousand gallons. The main question in issue in these proceedings is as to the validity of the agreement, as the appellant concedes that if it is valid the appeal must fail.\nThe appellant's main argument is that it had no legal authority to make the agreement because of the provisions of s. 70 of the Saint John City Assessment Act, 1948, c. 137, Statutes of New Brunswick 1948, the provisions of which will be cited later. It is further contended that, even apart from s. 70, the appellant had no authority to make the agreement.\nIt is necessary, for the consideration of this submission, to consider chronologically certain of the statutory provisions relating to the supply of water by the appellant. In 1914 there was enacted, as c. 83 of the Statutes of New Brunswick 1914, An Act to Consolidate the Laws Relating to Sewerage and Water Supply, in the City of Saint John, and in Portions of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds. The relevant portions of that statute, which will hereinafter be referred to as the \"1914 Act\", were as follows:\n1. In this Act the expression \"City\" shall mean the City of Saint John.\n\"Commissioner\" shall mean the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage of the City of Saint John.\nSection 1 further defined \"Water District\" as including the whole of the City of Saint John and certain defined portions of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds.\n4. The city is hereby authorized to take, hold and appropriate and to convey through the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds to, into and through the Water District, all the water of Menzie's Lake, Ludgate's Lake and Spruce Lake, so called, in the Parish of Lancaster, and of Loch Lomond, Lake Robertson, Mispec River, Lake Latimer, and Little River in the Parish of Simonds, and the waters which may flow into and from the same, and any other ponds and streams within the distance of four miles from the same, and any water rights connected therewith; and also to take and hold, by purchase, expropriation or otherwise, any lands or real estate necessary for creating lakes and reservoirs, and for laying up and maintaining pipes, mains and conductors of water for carrying, discharging, disposing of and distributing water, and also any land on and around the margin of the said lakes, reservoirs and river, and on and around the said other ponds and streams, so far as may be necessary for the preservation and purity of the same, for the purpose of furnishing within the said Water District a supply of pure water, and the said City, for the purpose aforesaid, may connect the waters of any of said lakes together, may erect and maintain dams to raise and retain the water therein, may distribute the water throughout the Water District, and may supply and dispose of the same by agreement, outside of said Water District, and for these purposes may lay down pipes to any house or building within the said Water District, and may regulate the use of the said water within and without the said Water District; and the said City, for the purposes aforesaid may, within and without said Water District, carry any pipes under or about any highway or other way, in such manner as not to obstruct or impede travel thereon, and may enter upon and dig up any such road, street or way, for the purpose of laying down pipes beneath the surface thereof, or of repairing them when laid down, not obstructing or impeding travel as aforesaid, and in general may do any other acts and things necessary, convenient or proper for the purposes of this Act.\n5. In supplying water to any company or companies, corporation or corporations, or any individual or individuals, either within or without the said Water District, for the purpose of carrying on manufacturing, or a manufacturing business, or that may be supplied to any factory and factories, mill and mills, manufactory and manufactories, or other building used for manufacturing purposes, the amount of water provided may be as large in quantity and may be furnished at such rates, and upon such terms, conditions and limitations as the City shall determine, by resolution of Common Council, upon petition of any such person or corporation, but such resolution shall not be, nor shall it be construed to be a contract to supply water, and the City shall not be entitled to increase such rates for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, to be set forth in such resolution, and all the rules and regulations concerning the water supply of the said Water District now lawfully made, or that hereafter may lawfully be made, shall apply and extend to the said petitioners and each of them, and their and each of their successors, and the said premises and the said business carried on therein, and to all persons and corporations using such water, to the full extent that such rules and regulations are or may or can be applicable thereto, and the said City is hereby authorized and empowered to make such rules and regulations with regard to supplying water to and the use of the same by the said petitioners, or any of them, or their successors, both within and without said water district, as the said City may deem necessary and expedient.\n* * *\n29. The Councillors of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds, representing such Parishes in the Municipal Council of the City and County of Saint John shall, as such Councillors, represent their said respective Parishes at all meetings of the Common Council of the City of Saint John at which rates are fixed or any matters are considered appertaining to the supply of water within their respective Parishes. Each Councillor shall have one vote, and each member of the Common Council shall have three votes at such meetings. The said Councillors shall vote only upon the fixing of rates and upon matters appertaining to the supply of water within their respective Parishes.\n30. Within the Water District, the owners in fee or the leaseholders, either in perpetuity or for renewable terms of any lands or tenements through or along which, or within seven hundred feet of which mains for the supply of water shall pass, and also the owners of or traders in all stocks in trade, wares and merchandize in the said Water District shall, whether the water be taken or used on the premises respectively or not, be assessed for the purpose of this Act, in each year, at a rate and rates to be fixed and determined by a majority of the Common Council of said City with the Councillors of the said respective Parishes, as provided by the thirtieth section of this Act, in each year in their discretion according to the Schedule (B) appended to this Act, and being part thereof, and when pipes for the supply of water are laid to any premises then, at a rate and rates to be fixed and determined by the said Common Council with the Councillors as aforesaid, in each year in their discretion, according to the Schedule (C) also appended to this Act, and being part thereof., excepting steam mills, manufactories, public baths, hotels, and all places for which and where a large quantity of water is required, which shall be rated by agreement with the Commissioner and the parties requiring supply, and which shall be payable quarterly. The owner of a dwelling house or other occupied building, in front or along which, or in any street or thoroughfare near to which a main for the supply of water shall pass shall, whether the water be taken or used upon or in the premises or not, be assessed at the same rate according to Schedule (C) of this Act, as if service pipes for the supply of water were laid to such premises and the water actually taken and consumed thereon; provided only that the Commissioner shall have a discretionary power, partly or wholly to exempt any such owner as last mentioned when, in his opinion, it may be impracticable or very expensive to introduce the water into the premises, and in such case may decline to carry in a service pipe. Property owned by the City shall not be liable to assessment against, the City. In making up the assessment hereunder, the valuation of real estate within the City made by the Board of Assessors of Taxes for the said City in the year in which such assessment for water supply is made, shall be adopted so far as it may be practicable to do so.\nThe reference in s. 30 to \"the thirtieth section of this Act\" is clearly an error. The reference should have been to the twenty-ninth section of the Act.\nAt the time this Act was passed the Common Council of the City of Saint John consisted of a Mayor and four Elective Commissioners, each Commissioner being responsible for certain aspects of City administration, one of whom was the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage referred to in the 1914 Act. In 1936 this form of government was changed, the Commissioners being replaced by six Councillors, by c. 94, Statutes of New Brunswick 1936. Section 14 of that Act provided as follows:\n14. (1) Subject to the further provisions of this Act, the Common Council shall exercise all the powers formerly vested in the Commissioner of Finance and Public Affairs, the Commissioner of Public Safety, the Commissioner of Public Works, the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage (save and except that such powers and duties as are vested in the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage by Chapter 83 of 4 George V (1914), An. Act to Consolidate the Laws Relating to Sewerage and Water Supply, in the City of Saint John, and in portions of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds, in the City and County of Saint John, and amendments thereto, shall be vested in and exercised by the Director of the Department of Water and Sewerage) and the Commissioner of Harbours arid Ferries and Public Lands.\n(2) For the more efficient administration of the municipal services the Common Council shall with all convenient speed organize and co-ordinate the following departments:\n* * * (b) The Department of Assessment, or Board of Assessors of Taxes, in respect to the management of the levying and assessing of rates and taxes, subject to the provisions of the Saint John City Assessment Act;\n* * *\n(g) The Department of Water and Sewerage, in respect to the management of water supply and sewage disposal;\n* * *\n(3) The Common Council shall appoint a person having suitable qualifications to be administrative head of each such department and known as the \"Director\" or as he may be otherwise called by the Common Council. Such person shall devote his whole time to the business of the City and be paid a salary to be determined by the Common Council. He shall hold his appointment during the pleasure of the Common Council, and be responsible to the Common Council for the efficient administration of the services entrusted to him or his department.\n(4) It shall be the duty of such administrative head of each department, in addition to such other duties as may be prescribed by the Common Council, to attend the meetings of the Council when and as required to do so by it, and to recommend to it from time to time such measures as he shall deem necessary or expedient for it to adopt. He shall furnish any information respecting his department when required by the Council, and at least once a month present to the Council a summary report on the administrative work of his department.\nFollowing the enactment of this statute, therefore, those powers which, under the 1914 Act, had been vested in the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage became vested in the Director of Water and Sewerage. Unlike the Commissioner, who had been an elected officer and a member of the Common Council, the Director was an appointed official, appointed by the Common Council, holding his appointment during the pleasure of the Common Council and responsible to it.\nIt is against this background that in 1942 s. 55 of the Saint John City Assessment Act, 1942, c. 80, Statutes of New Brunswick 1942, was enacted. This statute dealt with the assessing and levying of rates for taxes in the City, dealing with such matters as the assessment and taxation of real estate, personal property and business, providing a machinery for the making of assessments and for appeals therefrom. One portion of the Act is headed \"ASSESSORS' DEPARTMENT\", and s. 37 provides for a Board of Assessors of Taxes for the City of Saint John, consisting of one or more persons to be appointed by the Common Council. Section 55 of that Act provided as follows:\n55. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts of Assembly 4 Geo. V. (1914) Chapter 83 and amendments thereto, all rates, assessments and agreements for water supply within or without the City of Saint John shall be made by the Assessment Department under the direction and control of the Director of that department, but all provisions of said Act and Acts mentioned and all amendments thereto, not inconsistent with this Act are to be construed as still in force and effect.\nIn 1948 the 1942 Act, as amended from time to time, was consolidated in the Saint John City Assessment Act, 1948, in which there appeared s. 70 in the same terms as s. 55 of the 1942 Act above quoted. It is upon this section that the appellant chiefly relies, in contending that the agreement between the appellant and the respondent was void and of no effect.\nThe appellant's contention is that, after the enactment of s. 55 of the 1942 Act, only the Assessment Department of the appellant had the power to impose rates and assessments for water supply and to make agreements for such supply. This involves the contention that the effect of s. 55 was to repeal, by implication, s. 5 of the 1914 Act. It is said that, since s. 55 covered all rates, assessments and agreements for water supply, no powers remained in the Common Council, under s. 5, to make provision for the supply of large quantities of water to factories, mills, manufactories and buildings used for manufacturing purposes; that all such powers now reside solely in the Assessment Department, under the direction of the Director of that Department; that as the respondent's agreement was not made with the Assessment Department, it had no effect, and the Assessment Department, on the direction of the Director, had the authority to impose the rate of five cents per thousand gallons of water delivered to the respondent from the appellant's Loch Lomond system.\nI am unable to agree with this submission. Read against the background of the earlier legislation, it does not appear to me that s. 55 of the 1942 Act was ever intended to do anything more than to transfer to the Assessment Department those powers which, prior thereto, had been exercised by the Director of the Department of Water and Sewerage and which, before 1936, had been exercised by the Commissioner of Water and Sewerage, together with the power of assessment and rate determination which, under s. 30 of the 1914 Act, had been vested in the Common Council of the appellant, with, in some instances, the Councillors of the Parishes of Lancaster and Simonds. Under the 1914 Act, s. 30 was the one which made provision for assessment for water rates, for the fixing of such rates and, in the case of steam mills, manufactories, public baths, hotels and places where a large quantity of water is required, for the fixing of rates by agreement with the Commissioner. Section 5 was a special provision enabling the Common Council, by resolution, to make provision for water supply to factories, mills, manufactories and buildings used for manufacturing purposes, in large quantities and at special rates.\nIt is significant that the power conferred upon the Assessment Department appears in the Assessment Act and not in a statute which amends the 1914 Act. The Assessment Act is dealing specifically with the making of assessments and the imposition of rates. I cannot conceive that the Legislature, without any reference whatever to the wide powers of the Common Council conferred by s. 5 of the 1914 Act, and with no repeal thereof, can be deemed to have repealed s. 5 by implication and to have given those broad discretionary powers conferred upon the Common Council to a City Department, under the direction of a departmental head who is, himself, appointed by and responsible to the Common Council.\nAttention must also be paid to the saving provision which appears at the end of s. 70 of the 1948 Act: \"but all provisions of said Act and Acts mentioned and all amendments thereto, not inconsistent with this Act are to be construed as still in force and effect.\" The only provisions of the 1914 Act which could be preserved by this saving clause are those contained in s. 5 and, in my opinion, they were preserved by it.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that s. 70 of the Saint John City Assessment Act, 1948 did not confer upon the Assessment Department the power to make the kind of agreement which is in question here and that it did not prevent the appellant, by its Common Council, from determining rates in relation to those special cases which are provided for in s. 5 of the 1914 Act.\nThe next submission of the appellant is that, in any event, s. 5 of the 1914 Act does not contemplate nor authorize the execution by the appellant of any agreement. Re- liance is placed on the words in that section \"but such resolution shall not be, nor shall it be construed to be a contract to supply water\".\nSection 5 of the 1914 Act enables the appellant, by-resolution of its Common Council, to arrange for the supply of water to factories, mills, manufactories and buildings used for manufacturing purposes, in as large a quantity, at such rates and upon such terms, conditions and limitations as the resolution provides. The only limitation is that the resolution shall not be, nor be construed to be, a contract to supply water. The rates set by such resolution cannot be increased for the period set forth in the resolution, not exceeding twenty-five years. The purpose of the restrictive provision in this section is to prevent the City from becoming obligated as a matter of contract by such a resolution to supply water and thereby to prevent an action in damages against the appellant in the event that it is unable to supply the quantities provided for in the resolution.\nThe respondent points out that s. 5 does not, by its terms, preclude the appellant from making a contract, but merely provides that the resolution itself shall not constitute a contract to supply water. The respondent further contends that the appellant, as a Royal Charter corporation, had, in law, the right to make any contracts which it saw fit to make, provided that the same were not illegal.\nWhether or not this contention is sound; I agree with McNair C.J. in the Court below that the resolution of the Common Council, passed on October 17, 1957, agreeing in principle to the agreement between the appellant and the respondent, which had been discussed at that meeting and which is set forth in the minutes of the meeting, coupled with the resolution authorizing the execution of the agreement passed on October 8, 1958, with which resolution that agreement must be read, constitute a resolution of the kind provided for in s. 5 of the 1914 Act, and that thereafter the appellant was not entitled to increase the rates, during the twenty-five year period, above those provided by the resolution.\nFinally the appellant contended that, as the respondent's mill was in Lancaster and as the agreement related to the supply of water there, the meeting which passed the resolu- tion was not properly constituted, as there were no Councillors present from the City of Lancaster as required by s. 29 of the 1914 Act.\nIn my view, s. 29 is to be read in conjunction with s. 30 and the joint meetings provided for in s. 29 relate only to those matters provision for which is made in s. 30; i.e., the assessment and imposition of water rates. Section 5 of the 1914 Act, in my opinion, stands by itself and deals with a special situation. By its terms it refers only to a resolution of the Common Council of the City of Saint John, and, in my opinion, that Common Council alone has the power to pass a resolution for the purposes of that section. It could do so without the presence of any Councillors from the other municipalities whose territory is within the Water District.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: H. D. Hopkins and J. P. Barry, Saint John.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: W. E. Clarke, Saint John.\n"

Minister of National Revenue, [1963] S.C.R. 223\nDate: 1963-04-01\nJames Frederick Scott Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respodent.\n1963: January 28, 29; 1963: April 1.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Agreements for sale, lease-option agreements and mortgages purchased at a discount and held to maturity\u2014Whether profits taxable income or capital gain\u2014Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, ss. 8, 4 and 127(1)(e)\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e).\nThe appellant, a barrister and solicitor, was found liable for income tax on certain discounts received in the years 1950 to 1955 inclusive. These receipts came from his purchase of agreements for sale of land, lease- option agreements on land and mortgages on land. He purchased at a discount and held the securities to maturity. Most of the agreements covered small house properties in outlying districts where mortgage institutions would not normally do business. The source of funds from which the agreements were purchased was the sale of certain houses and other assets owned by the appellant. As payments were made on the agreements, the appellant used these funds for further purchases. He also operated with a bank loan under which his maximum liability was $100,000. The issue was whether the discounts when received were taxable income or accretions to capital. The Exchequer Court having held that they were taxable income, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nFor the reasons given by the Exchequer Court the appeal failed. It was true that the appellant purchased the agreements by himself and never in association with anyone else, and that he did not set up any organization for their acquisition. He was not in the business of lending money nor in the business of buying and selling agreements. That there was an element of risk in the transactions was obvious. Nevertheless the facts established that the appellant was in the highly speculative business of purchasing these agreements at a discount and holding them to maturity in order to realize the maximum amount of profit out of the transactions. The profits were taxable income and not a capital gain.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thorson P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, holding that certain discounts received by the appellant were taxable income. Appeal dismissed.\nT. J. Hopwood, for the appellant.\nD.S.Maxwell, Q.C., and O.W.Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014Both the Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court1 have found the appellant liable for income tax on certain discounts received in the years 1950 to 1955 inclusive. These receipts came from his purchase of agreements for the sale of land, lease-option agreements on land and mortgages on land. He purchased at a discount and held the securities to maturity. The issue is whether the discounts when received by him were taxable income or accretions to capital. The judgment of the Exchequer Court holds that they were taxable income and, in my respectful opinion, for the reasons given by Thorson P., the appeal fails. There has been a line of six cases on this problem in the Exchequer Court beginning in 1957 with the case of Arthur Cohen v. Minister of National Revenue2. There the accretion was held to be capital in the case of a retired businessman who disposed of many of his investments and put his capital into mortgages which he purchased at a discount. In the next five cases including the present one: Minister of National Revenue v. Louis W. Spencer3; James F. Scott v. Minister of National Revenue4; Minister of National Revenue v. Beatrice Minden5; Minister of National Revenue v. Philip Mandelbaum and Albert Mandelbaum6; Minister of National Revenue v. Henry S. Rosenberg7, the contrary conclusion was reached. The discounts when received were held to be taxable because the securities were acquired not as investments but as a scheme of profit-making and, consequently, taxable as income from a business. However, in the latest case, Minister of National Revenue v. William Hedley MacInnes8, the judge concluded that the taxpayer was engaged in investment and not in a scheme for profit-making.\nThis diversity of opinion is understandable when the decision must depend upon a full review of the facts in each case for the purpose of determining whether the discounts can be classified as income from a business. Even on the same facts, there is room for disagreement among judges on the conclusions that should be drawn from these activities of a taxpayer, for the Act nowhere specifically deals with these discounts, as it does, for example, in s. 105(a) with shares redeemed or acquired by a corporation at a premium. It is possible to deal expressly with the problem and the Act has not done so.\nThe appellant is a barrister and solicitor practising in the City of Calgary. At the time of the appeal to the Exchequer Court he was 69 years of age and had been practising for 47 years. His income from his practice during the years in question was approximately $12,000 a year. In 1945, he purchased a ranch and was operating it in a fairly substantial way at the time of the appeal. Nothing in this appeal turns on his activities as a rancher.\nThe appellant began to purchase these agreements in 1947 and continued until 1955. His explanation for his withdrawal from this activity is that he was getting older and wished to leave a more liquid estate to face estate tax liabilities. From 1947 to 1954 he purchased 149 agreements, particulars of which are as follows:\nIn 1947 ................................................. 28 agreements\nIn 1948 ................................................. 17 agreements\nIn 1949 ................................................. 20 agreements\nIn 1950 ................................................. 28 agreements\nIn 1951 ................................................. 20 agreements\nIn 1952 ................................................. 20 agreements\nIn 1953 ................................................. 15 agreements\nIn 1954 ................................................. 1 agreement\nTotal ................................ 149 agreements\nOf the 84 agreements purchased in the period 1950 to 1954, there were 70 lease-option agreements, 12 agreements for sale and 2 first mortgages.\nMost of the agreements covered small house properties in undeveloped districts on the outskirts of Calgary where mortgage institutions would not normally do business. The properties had been sold with small down payments averaging from 10 to 15 per cent of the full purchase price with 8 to 11 years in which to pay the balance. The appellant only purchased agreements where a discount was offered and these discounts varied from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the balance of the purchase price. Most of the agreements carried interest at 6 per cent. The going rates of interest at the time on National Housing Act mortgages were, first, 4\u00bd per cent and later, 5 per cent, and on other mortgages 5 per cent and later 5\u00bd per cent, but these rates were on loans not exceeding 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the appraised value made by mortgage companies on first class properties. I mention these interest rates because there appears to be no connection between the size of the discount and an unduly low interest rate. When the appellant purchased an agreement, he obtained a transfer of title from the vendor and an assignment of the agreement and thus became the registered owner of the property, subject only to such caveat as the purchaser or lessee under the agreement might have filed against the title.\nThe source of funds from which the appellant purchased these agreements was first of all the sale of 25 small houses which he owned before the war and which he sold after the war. He had, in addition, $54,000 in stocks and bonds. As payments were made on the agreements, he used these funds for further purchases. He also operated with a bank loan under which his maximum liability was $100,000.\nThe appellant purchased these agreements by himself and never in association with anyone else. He did not set up any organization for their acquisition, never employed anyone to purchase agreements for him, never advertised for them and never offered to buy them, nor did he bargain with vendors about the price he would pay. The appellant was approached by building contractors or real estate agents who stated how much they wanted for the agreements and he decided whether he would accept their offer or not. In some cases, the building contractors or real estate agents were clients. Some of the agreements were drawn by his law firm and many were not. The building contractors concerned often had small financial means and when they had sold a house, they had to realize cash on the agreement under which they had sold in order to build another one. The appellant explained that it became known that he was a potential purchaser of such agreements in the first place because of the agreements held by him on the 25 houses originally owned by him and which he had sold.\nSometimes he purchased an agreement from a builder immediately after the builder had sold the house but he never dealt with a builder before the property was sold.\nThe appellant did not sell any of the agreements purchased by him but kept them all until maturity or until paid off prior to maturity except for some 25 agreements transferred to his ranching company, incorporated under the name of Baha Tinda Stock Farm Ltd., for preference stock equivalent to the balance owing on the agreements transferred. The appellant was clearly not in the business of lending money. He did not lend money at any time. He purchased for less than their face value existing obligations which arose from a sale by a builder to a purchaser. These obligations given back by the purchaser carried a normal rate of interest which was slightly above the rate of interest charged under the National Housing Act at the times in question.\nThere was an obvious element of risk in these transactions. The down payments were small and mortgage companies and other lending institutions were not interested in them. Furthermore, provincial legislation which restricted the owner of the security to reliance upon the security and not upon the personal covenant made it even more risky. The discount is, therefore, explained by the nature of the risk and the needs of the builder who had to sell these obligations to finance further building.\nThe appellant was not in the business of buying and selling. He bought long-term obligations with small down payments and, with the exception of the transfer of 25 of these obligations to the ranch when it became incorporated in return for preferred shares in the ranch, the appellant never sold any of them. He held them all to maturity with the exception of one or two, on which he had to realize by way of foreclosure or sale.\nI have stated the facts with all the emphasis given to them by counsel for the appellant. Nevertheless, I remain in agreement with the judgment of Thorson P. that these facts establish that the appellant was in the highly speculative business of purchasing these obligations at a discount and holding them to maturity in order to realize the maximum amount of profit out of the transactions, and that the profits are taxable income and not a capital gain.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Scott, Gregg, Hopwood & Scott, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.A.McGrory, Ottawa.\n1 [1961] C.T.C. 451, 61 D.T.C. 1285.\n2 [1957] Ex.

Registrar, Vancouver Land Registration District, [1963] S.C.R. 229\nDate: 1963-03-07\nGerald Henry Heller (Petitioner) Appellant;\nand\nThe Registrar, Vancouver Land Registration District Respondent;\nand\nMary Elizabeth Heller Respondent.\n1963: February 18, 19; 1963: March 7.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nReal property\u2014Conveyance registered and new certificate of title issued\u2014Registrar erroneously acting under impression he had duplicate certificate of title in his possession\u2014Whether registrar must automatically, on discovering error, cancel new certificate of title\u2014Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 208, s. 256.\nThe respondent presented to the Vancouver Land Registry Office a conveyance, from her husband, the appellant, to herself, of title to certain property. The conveyance was registered and title to the lands in question was issued in her name under a new certificate of title. The conveyance was registered under the erroneous impression that the appellant's duplicate certificate of title was lodged at the registry office. The appellant's solicitor later wrote to the registrar requesting that the certificate of title issued to the respondent be cancelled and that the cancellation stamp on the appellant's certificate of title be removed. The registrar refused to comply with this request and the husband then filed a petition, by way of appeal, in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which petition was granted. An appeal to the Court of Appeal, argued on an agreed statement of facts substantially different from what had been alleged in the petition, was allowed and the petition was dismissed.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 256 of the Land Registry Act enables the registrar to exercise a limited power of cancellation, or correction, where he discovers that error has occurred. The power thus conferred on him is one which he is authorized to exercise at his discretion. There is no provision in the section for an application to the registrar by an interested party, nor is there any direction that, upon such application, the registrar shall proceed to exercise his powers. This was not, therefore, a provision which imposed a duty to exercise the power to enforce the right of a party, such as was mentioned by Lord Blackburn in Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford (1880), 5 App. Cas. 214 at 241.\nThe registrar's powers were limited by the words \"so far as practicable, without prejudicing rights conferred for value\". Although it appeared that the consideration stated in the conveyance from the appellant to the respondent was the sum of $1, the registrar would not, without receiving additional evidence, be in a position to know, merely by looking at the conveyance itself, whether the rights conferred upon the respondent by the conveyance were for value or not. It was no part of the function of a registrar, under this section, to adjudicate upon contested rights of parties, for the determination of which it would be necessary for him to hear, receive and weigh evidence. He can only act upon the material which is before him in his own records.\nThe error in the present case was not in relation to the issuance of a title according to the tenor of the transfer, but was in respect of the failure to have required the production of the duplicate certificate of title of the appellant (s. 157). C.P.R. and Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Turta, [1954] S.C.R. 427, distinguished. There was nothing before the registrar, on his own records, to indicate whether or not that duplicate certificate of title was available and would be produced by the respondent. Any information which he had in that regard could only be obtained on the basis of outside evidence submitted by the appellant, which might be contested by the respondent.\nUnder s. 35, as between the appellant and the transferee, the conveyance had become operative. Furthermore, under s. 159, the holder of any duplicate certificate of title covering land for which he has given a conveyance or transfer is required to deliver up his duplicate certificate of title to the registrar. The appellant's position was, therefore, that in order to obtain redress as against the respondent, he would have to establish, by evidence, that there had been an incomplete gift, that there had been no delivery of the deed, or that there was fraud on the respondent's part, any of which issues, could not properly be determined by a registrar, under the provisions of s. 256, but which could only be determined by an action in court.\nFinally, although the point was not argued in this Court, nor in the Courts below, and consequently without expressing a final opinion, it was doubtful whether the registrar's decision to act, or his refusal to act, under s. 256 was the proper subject-matter of the appeal provisions contained in Part XV of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Brown J. Appeal dismissed.\nDouglas Norby, for the petitioner, appellant.\nMiss Mary F. Southin, for the respondent: Mary Elizabeth Heller.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014On February 10, 1958, the respondent Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Heller (hereinafter referred to as \"the respondent\") presented to the Vancouver Land Registry Office a conveyance, from her husband, the appellant, to herself, of title to the lands at that time registered in his name under Certificate of Title 152412L. The stated consideration was $1. The conveyance was registered and title to the lands in question was issued in her name under Certificate of Title 380035L. The conveyance was registered under the erroneous impression that the appellant's duplicate certificate of title was lodged at the Registry Office.\nOn January 5, 1959, the appellant's solicitor wrote to the respondent the Registrar of the Vancouver Land Registration District, requesting that the certificate of title issued to the respondent be cancelled and that the cancellation stamp on Certificate of Title 152412L be removed. In this letter it was stated:\nMr. Heller wishes it to be understood that he is not asking you to adjudicate on the validity of the deed of land to Mrs. M. E. Heller covering the above property.\nThe Registrar refused to comply with this request and, in his letter in reply, stated, among other things:\nWith respect I point out that the said paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 of your letter are contradictions in terms in that I cannot interfere with Mrs. Heller's registration without agreeing with Mr. Heller's contention of fraud on her part, none of which is disclosed by the conveyance itself, nor does the said conveyance give any intimation that even an error has been made in this office.\nThe appellant then filed a petition in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, by way of appeal from the Registrar's decision, containing a number of allegations, which included the following:\n2. THAT in the summer of 1949 Your Petitioner was by his physician advised to undergo a serious surgical operation and on the 8th day of August, 1949 drew and duly executed a deed conveying the said property to Mary Elizabeth Heller, Your Petitioner's wife, the consideration mentioned therein was $1.00 but no money actually passed it being Your Petitioner's intention that the conveyance operate as a testamentary instrument if Your Petitioner did not survive the operation.\n3. THAT the said deed was never delivered to Mary Elizabeth Heller but was placed among Your Petitioner's private papers and at no time did the said Petitioner intend to deliver the same.\n4. THAT Your Petitioner on the 30th day of August, 1949, entered into an Agreement for Sale of an undivided one-half interest in the said property and a building to be built thereon, to one W. P. Cuff, which Agreement has not been registered in the Land Registry Office in the said City of Vancouver.\n5. THAT Your Petitioner subsequently caused to be constructed upon the said property a building of the value of approximately $20,000.\n6. THAT by Deed of Land dated the 15th day of July, A.D. 1953, Your Petitioner conveyed a one-half interest in the said property to the said W. P. Cuff.\n7. THAT the Deed of Land mentioned in the preceeding paragraph contained a reference to the said unregistered Agreement for Sale and the said Cuff encountered difficulty in registering the said Deed. 8. THAT Gordon Johnson, Esquire, Solicitor to the said Cuff requested from Your Petitioner a registrable Deed for the said one-half interest and the Duplicate Certificate of Indefeasible Title numbered 152412L, in pursuance of such request Your Petitioner caused to be delivered to the said Gordon Johnson the said Certificate to be held by him pending and for the purpose of the registration of the said Cuff's interest in the said property.\n9. THAT the said Mary Elizabeth Heller was at all times cognizant of the aforesaid agreements.\n10. THAT on or about the 10th day of February, A.D. 1958, the said Mary Elizabeth Heller without Your Petitioner's knowledge or consent and in some manner unbeknownst to Your Petitioner became possessed of the Deed above mentioned, and caused the same to be registered in the said Land Registry Office from which office, in due course, issued a Certificate of Indefeasible Title numbered 380035L citing the said Mary Elizabeth Heller as the registered owner of the said property.\nThis petition was supported by an affidavit of the appellant in which he swore that he verily and truly believed the statements set out in the petition were true and correct in substance and fact. It was heard by Brown J., who, according to his formal order, heard evidence, and who ordered the Registrar to cancel Certificate of Title 380035L and to remove the cancellation stamp from Certificate of Title 152412L.\nFrom this order the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Before that Court it appears that for the first time a statement of facts was agreed upon, on the basis of which the Court directed the appeal to proceed. Included in the statement of facts is the following material:\nIt was also alleged by the Petitioner (Respondent) that the deed was an attempted testamentary disposition but it was agreed between Counsel in the Court Below that the question of delivery or non-delivery of the deed was not in issue.\nSo far as the Registrar of Titles was concerned he had before him a deed valid and duly delivered on its face which complied with the requirements of the \"Land Registry Act\".\nIt is not suggested that the Appellant knew that the duplicate certificate of title was not in the Registry nor is it suggested in these proceedings that she was guilty of any fraud in applying to register this deed.\nThe respondent's appeal was allowed and the appellant's petition was dismissed with costs[2].\nThe situation, therefore, exists that, whereas Brown J. dealt with a petition which contained the allegations previously cited, supported by affidavit, the appeal to the Court of Appeal was argued on an agreed statement of facts substantially different from what had been alleged in the petition itself.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was refused by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. On a motion before this Court for leave to appeal, it was not disputed by counsel that the amount in issue exceeded $10,000 and consequently it became unnecessary to consider whether or not leave should be granted. It was not until the argument of the appeal itself that it first became apparent that, as the issues of delivery of the deed to, and the fraud of, the respondent were not in issue before the Court of Appeal, the rights of the parties had not finally been determined by its judgment. In the circumstances it was felt that, the matter having proceeded as far as it had, leave should be granted to the appellant in order that the submissions of the parties might be heard.\nIt is, however, at once apparent that a judgment of this Court in the present proceedings, in their existing form, could not finally determine the rights of the parties if the appeal fails, since there would still remain serious issues as between the parties which had not been before either the Court of Appeal or this Court. The Court, therefore, finds itself in the position where, in the light of what occurred before the Court of Appeal, it cannot determine the issues on the basis on which, according to the petition, they were presented before the learned trial judge, and that it is being asked to determine the question, which is really hypothetical, as to whether, under the British Columbia Land Registry Act, a Registrar, who, erroneously acting under the belief that he has in his possession a duplicate certificate of title, registers a conveyance and issues a new certificate of title, must automatically, on discovering his error, cancel the new certificate of title under the powers conferred upon him by s. 256 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 208. Throughout these reasons I will be referring to those section numbers which appear in the Act as it presently stands, rather than to the numbers which existed at the time these proceedings were commenced, as the sections which require consideration are identical in their wording with the sections which appeared in R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171, although not having the same numbering throughout the Act. Section 256 provides as follows:\n256. If it appears to the Registrar\n(a) that any instrument has been issued in error or contains any misdescription; or\n(b) that any entry, memorandum, or endorsement has been made in error or has erroneously been omitted to be made on any register or any instrument; or\n(c) that any registration, instrument, entry, memorandum, or endorsement was fraudulently or wrongfully obtained,\nand whether the instrument is in his custody or has been produced to him under summons, the Registrar may, so far as practicable, without prejudicing rights conferred for value, cancel the registration, instrument, entry, memorandum, or endorsement, or correct the error in the register or instrument or any entry, memorandum, or endorsement made thereon, or in any copy of any instrument made in or issued from the Land Registry Office, and may supply entries omitted to be made. In the correction of any error the Registrar shall not erase or render illegible the original words, and he shall affix his initials thereto and the date upon which the correction was made or entry supplied. Every register or instrument so corrected, and every entry, memorandum, or endorsement so corrected or supplied, has validity and effect as if the error had not been made or the entry omitted. Every cancellation of an instrument, entry, memorandum, or endorsement under this section has validity and effect as from the issuing of the instrument or the making of the entry, memorandum, or endorsement.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nIn the first place, the power conferred on the Registrar by this section is one which he is authorized to exercise at his discretion. The section provides that, if it appears to the Registrar that certain things have occurred, he \"may\" do certain things. There is no provision in the section for an application to the Registrar by an interested party, nor is there any direction that, upon such an application, the Registrar shall proceed to exercise his powers. This is not, therefore, a provision which imposed a duty to exercise the power to enforce the right of a party, such as is mentioned by Lord Blackburn in Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford[3]. The section, which is similar to like provisions in other statutes in Canada creating a Torrens system of titles, is one which enables a Registrar to exercise a limited power of cancellation, or correction, where he discovers that error has occurred.\nIn the second place, his powers are limited by the words \"so far as practicable, without prejudicing rights conferred for value\". Although it appears that the consideration stated in the conveyance from the appellant to the respondent was the sum of $1, the Registrar would not, without receiving additional evidence, be in a position to know, merely by looking at the conveyance itself, whether the rights conferred upon the respondent by the conveyance were for value or not. In my opinion, it is no part of the function of a Registrar, under this section, to adjudicate upon contested rights of parties, for the determination of which it would be necessary for him to hear, receive and weigh evidence. He can only act upon the material which is before him in his own records.\nI realize that the provisions of para. (c) of s. 256 may appear to be inconsistent with this conclusion. That paragraph relates to a situation where \"any registration, instrument, entry, memorandum, or endorsement was fraudulently or wrongfully obtained\". If, however, these words were to be construed in their widest sense, so as to enable a Registrar to act, under the section, upon evidence submitted to him upon which he could make a finding of fraud, I would have grave doubts as to whether this provision could be held to be intra vires of the Legislature of British Columbia. So construed, the Registrar would be clothed with an original jurisdiction to determine questions of title to land in relation to which fraud had been alleged (Attorney-General for Ontario and Display Service Co. Ltd. v. Victoria Medical Building Ltd. et al.[4]).\nThe present case is in no way comparable, on its facts, to the situation which had arisen in C.P.R. and Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Turta[5], at the stage where the transfer from the C.P.R. to Podgorny had been registered. In that case the error which had arisen was the issuance of a title to land, including certain minerals, in the name of Podgorny, when the transfer to him from the C.P.R., which gave rise to his title, had specifically reserved them to the C.P.R. The error was apparent on the face of the records in the Land Titles Office. In the present case the title issued to the respondent was that which the conveyance provided for. The error was not in relation to the issuance of a title according to the tenor of the transfer, but was in respect of the failure to\nPage 236]\nhave required the production of the duplicate certificate of title of the appellant. Section 157 of the Act provides:\n157. Where a conveyance or transfer is made of any land the title to which is registered, the grantee or transferee is entitled to be registered as the owner of the estate or interest held by or vested in the former owner to the extent to which that estate or interest is conveyed or transferred; and the Registrar, upon being satisfied that the conveyance or transfer produced has transferred to and vested in the applicant a good safe-holding and marketable title, shall, upon production of the former certificate or duplicate certificate of title, register the title claimed by the applicant in the register.\nThere was nothing before the Registrar, on his own records, to indicate whether or not that duplicate certificate of title was available and could be produced by the respondent. Any information which he had in that regard could only be obtained on the basis of outside evidence submitted by the appellant, which might be contested by the respondent.\nIn the third place, I do not see how a party, who has executed and delivered a conveyance (and, on the basis of the agreed statement of facts before the Court of Appeal, delivery was not in issue), but who has failed to deliver the duplicate certificate of title to the transferee, is in any position to complain of the conduct of the Registrar in respect of the registration of that conveyance without proof of further facts. Under s. 35 of the Act, as between himself and the transferee, the conveyance had become operative. Furthermore, under s. 159, it is provided:\nThe holder of any duplicate certificate of title covering land for which he has given a conveyance or transfer shall deliver up his duplicate certificate of title to the Registrar\u2026..\nThe appellant's position was, therefore, that, in order to obtain redress as against the respondent, he would have to establish, by evidence, that there had been an incomplete gift, that there had been no delivery of the deed, or that there was fraud on the respondent's part, any of which issues, in my opinion, cannot properly be determined by a Registrar, under the provisions of s. 256, but which can only be determined by an action in court.\nFinally, I have some question in my mind as to whether a decision of the Registrar not to act under s. 256 can properly be the subject of an appeal under the provisions of Part XV of the Act. This point was not argued before us, nor in the Courts below, and consequently I would not wish to express a final opinion with respect to it. I note, however, that the provisions dealing with appeals from the Registrar are contained in ss. 235 and 237 of the Act. An appeal under s. 235 arises in respect of a refusal by the Registrar, as described in s. 234(1), which reads as follows:\n234. (1) In case the Registrar refuses to issue a certificate of title or to effect registration, renewal, filing, lodging, deposit, or cancellation in accordance with the tenor of any application, he shall forthwith notify the applicant, or the solicitor or agent of the applicant, in writing, of his refusal, stating briefly the reasons therefor and his requirements, and in case a subsequent application is affected by his refusal he shall also similarly notify the subsequent applicant.\nSection 237 provides as follows:\n237. If any person is dissatisfied with any decision of the Registrar, that is to say, any summary rejection of application, act, omission, decision, direction, or order of the Registrar in respect of any application, other than a refusal of the Registrar to which section 234 applies, he may forthwith require the Registrar to furnish to him, set forth in writing under the hand of the Registrar, the reasons of the decision; and may, within twenty-one days after the receipt by him of the Registrar's reasons, apply to a Judge of the Supreme Court in Chambers upon a petition by way of appeal from the Registrar's decision; and sections 235 and 236 apply in respect of the petition and the proceedings thereon.\nIt will be noted that s. 234(1) refers only to a refusal of the Registrar to issue a certificate of title or to effect registration, renewal, filing, lodging, deposit, or cancellation \"in accordance with the tenor of any application\".\nSection 237 refers to dissatisfaction with a decision, act or omission of the Registrar \"in respect of any application\".\nIt would seem to me that the word \"application\", though not specifically defined in the statute, relates only to those matters in respect of which the Act gives to a person a right to apply to the Registrar to do something which the Act requires him to do, examples of which are to be found in the forms of application set forth, in Forms A to E inclusive, in the First Schedule to the Act. There is no provision for an application to the Registrar to act under s. 256. I would doubt whether his decision to act, or his refusal to act, under that section is the proper subject-matter of the appeal provisions contained in Part XV of the Act.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the petitioner, appellant: Jestley, Morrison, Eckardt, Ainsworth and Henson, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Mary Elizabeth Heller: Ladner and Southin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960), 33 W.W.R. 385, 26 D.L.R.

At that time there was no medical appeal provision in the Workmen's Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 312, but such a provision was added as s. 54A of the Act by 1955 (B.C.), c. 98, s. 15. In 1956 the appellant applied to the Board, under the provisions of s. 54A, to be examined by a specialist and his application was granted. Some time after the examination the appellant was informed by a letter from the Board that the latter had received the certificate of the specialist. He was further informed that his claim had been reviewed, that the matters contained in the certificate had been fully considered, and that no change had been made in the status or disposition of his claim. An application for a writ of mandamus with certiorari in aid to quash the decision of the Board was dismissed by Brown J. and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, one member dissenting. By leave of the Court of Appeal, an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. Per Curiam: The contention that the Board had \"declined jurisdiction\" by failing to notify the appellant of its decision regarding the matters contained in the specialist's certificate failed. The provisions of s. 54A (9) did not give the workman a right to anything more from the Board than a notification in writing of its decision. The Board had complied with this section, albeit in a most niggardly fashion.\nThe contention that as s. 54A(5) makes the specialist's certificate \"conclusive as to the matters certified\" and as the certificate in the present case certified that his disability was \"a result of his occupation\", the Board had no jurisdiction to do otherwise than to reinstate the appellant's pension in accordance with this finding also failed. This contention overlooked the fact that the specialist's report is initiated on the strength of a physician's certificate \"certifying that in the opinion of such physician there is a bona fide medical dispute to be resolved\". It is for the purpose of resolving this dispute that the specialist makes his examination and furnishes his certificate to the Board, and it is his opinion as to how this dispute is to be resolved which is embodied in the certificate and made conclusive and binding on the Board by s. 54A(5). The effect of this certificate upon the Board's decision with respect to whether compensation was to be awarded or not was another matter and the fact that the specialist's certificate was not intended to be conclusive in this regard was demonstrated by the provisions of s. 54A (9) which clearly contemplate a review of the whole claim and the making of an independent decision by the Board after the certificate has been received.\nUnder the provisions of the present s. 77 (d) (formerly s. 76) of the Act, the Board is given \"\u2026 exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine \u2026. (d) the degree of diminution of earning capacity by reason of any injury;\" and s. 22(1) of the Act provides that when the Board is awarding compensation \"regard shall be had to the workman's fitness to continue in the occupation in which he was injured or to adapt himself to some other suitable employment or business\". Accordingly, the Board had jurisdiction to review the appellant's claim in light of the specialist's certificate and to determine that no change should be made in the disposition of his case because of the degree of his fitness to adapt himself to employment at clerical work if he chose to do so. Whether or not this formed the basis of the Board's decision was not for the Court to say. In assessing the effect of the specialist's certificate on the appellant's right to compensation it was within the jurisdiction of the Board to examine all other data available to it for the purpose of determining whether or not the appellant's earning capacity had been diminished as a result of his disability and the fact that the Court was unable, on the material before it, to understand how the Board reached the decision which it did was beside the point. Farrell v. Workmen's Compensation Board [1962] S.C.R. 48, followed; Battaglia v. Workmen's Compensation Board (1960), 32 W.W.R. 1, distinguished.\nPer Hall J.: The appellant did not appear to have received the substantial justice which s. 79 of the Act contemplates. However, the courts are without power to review the merits of the case on certiorari. The legislature has given the Board unlimited discretion not subject to appeal or judicial review as long as the Board acts within its jurisdiction. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Brown J. Appeal dismissed.\nT. R. Berger, for the appellant.\nC. C. Locke, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014 This is an appeal brought by leave of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia from a judgment of that Court[2], (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) affirming the judgment of Brown J. whereby he dismissed the appellant's application for a writ of mandamus with certiorari in aid to quash a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Board of British Columbia, dated March 28, 1957.\nThe notice of motion by which these proceedings were initiated sought relief upon the following grounds:\n1. Workmen's Compensation Board did not notify the Prosecutor in writing of its decision regarding the matters contained in the certificate made in 1957 by Dr. K. Greenwood pursuant to the provisions of section 54A of the Workmen's Compensation Act, and thereby declined jurisdiction.\n2. Workmen's Compensation Board neglected or refused to consider the certificate of the specialist appointed pursuant to the provisions of section 54A in 1957 as conclusive as to the matters certified therein, and thereby declined jurisdiction.\n3. That the said Board, following receipt of the specialist's certificate, neglected or refused to pay compensation to the Prosecutor, and thereby declined jurisdiction.\nThe circumstances giving rise to this application are that Robert C. Kinnaird, the prosecutor, contracted dermatitis in December 1944, as a result of his employment as a painter and was granted compensation therefor by the Workmen's Compensation Board from February 1945 until February 1947, when his pension was discontinued and he was advised by the Board that:\nFrom the medical information now on file it is considered that as far as any disability arising out of your employment with the Newcastle Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. is concerned, it cannot obviously be now considered to be produced by occupational contact, and your claim is therefore terminated this date and a cheque accordingly for time-loss to February 5th inclusive, together with subsistence allowance for January 8th, and transportation, is herewith enclosed. It is the belief of this Board that you should immediately apply yourself to the suggestion given you by Dr. Williams and obtain employment, light in nature, clean and of a clerical type.\nAt this time, there was no medical appeal provision in the Workmen's Compensation Act, but by s. 15 of c. 91 of the Statutes of British Columbia, 1955, s. 54A was added to the statute whereby provision was made entitling any workman who disputed a finding of the Board to be examined by a specialist to be nominated by him from a list of specialists provided by the Board. The request initiating such an examination was required to be\n\u2026accompanied by a certificate from a physician certifying that in the opinion of such physician there is a bona fide medical dispute to be resolved, with sufficient particulars thereof to define the question in issue.\nUnder the provisions of s. 54A (5) the specialist so selected was required to report to the Board within 18 days after his appointment, certifying as to:\n(a) The condition of the workman;\n(b) His fitness for employment;\n(c) If unfit, the cause of such unfitness;\n(d) The extent of his temporary or permanent disability by reason of the injury in respect of which he has claimed compensation; and\n(e) Such other matters as may, in his opinion, or in the opinion of the Board, be pertinent to the claim;\nand such certificate, which shall be in the form provided by regulation, shall be conclusive as to the matters certified. (The italics are mine.)\nOn September 15, 1956, the appellant decided to take advantage of the provisions of this section and applied to the Board in writing to be examined by a specialist, enclosing a certificate of a physician certifying that in his opinion there was a bona fide medical dispute to be resolved. Upon this application being granted, the appellant nominated Dr. Greenwood as the specialist to conduct the examination and the examination was conducted on January 29, 1957. Dr. Greenwood furnished the Board with his certificate in accordance with s. 54A(5) on February 1, 1957, in which he reported as follows:\n(a) Examination of the skin revealed a mild non-specific eczematous process involving the fingers, with some active vesiculation. Occasional similar lesions are present also on the feet. The skin appears otherwise clear. (b) This patient is temporarily unfit for work, on account of his recent coronary attacks. The exceptionally sensitive condition of his skin precludes him from any occupation except for dry, clean work such as clerical work. He is unfit to continue in his two trades, namely, painting and baking.\n(c) This unfitness is due to the skin having been previously severely sensitized as a result of his occupation.\n(d) The skin in itself would constitute very little disability to an individual employed in clerical work. This man, however, is permanently unfit for either of his two trades. He also states that his educational attainments do not fit him for any other more suitable job.\n(e) I would estimate that there is an element of resentment in this case, and that this psychological factor may well be responsible for the recalcitrance of the disease process. It is not possible to say whether or not the patient could have employed himself in a nonirritating occupation, had this \"negative\" attitude been absent.\nUnder the provisions of s. 54A(9) the Board is required \"within eighteen days of the receipt of the certificate from the specialist \u2026.\" to \"review the claim and notify the workman in writing of its decision regarding the matters contained in such certificate\".\nThe notification which the appellant received from the Board pursuant to this section is contained in a letter dated March 28,1957, which reads as follows:\nThe certificate of the specialist nominated by you for examination under Section 54A of the Workmen's Compensation Act has been received.\nYour claim has been reviewed by the Board and the matters contained in the certificate fully considered and this is to inform you that no change has been made in the status or disposition of your claim.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that the Board \"declined jurisdiction\" by failing to notify him of its decision regarding the matters contained in the specialist's certificate, and although I am bound to say that, in my opinion, it would have been more humane and more businesslike for the Board to have furnished the appellant with a copy of the certificate and an explanation of its decision, I am nevertheless unable to find that the provisions of s. 54A(9) give the workman a right to anything more from the Board than a notification in writing of its decision, and it seems to me that the Board complied with this section, albeit in a most niggardly fashion, when it advised the appellant in its letter of March 28, 1957, that after reviewing his claim and having given full consideration to the certificate it had decided that there was no change in the disposition of his claim. It is contended, however, that as s. 54A(5) makes the specialist's certificate \"conclusive as to the matters certified\" and as the certificate in the present case certifies that his disability is \"a result of his occupation\", the Board had no jurisdiction to do otherwise than to reinstate the appellant's pension in accordance with this finding.\nThis contention appears to me to overlook the fact that the specialist's report is initiated on the strength of a physician's certificate \"certifying that in the opinion of such physician there is a bona fide medical dispute to be resolved \u2026\". It is for the purpose of resolving this dispute that the specialist makes his examination and furnishes his certificate to the Board, and it is his opinion as to how this dispute is to be resolved which is embodied in the certificate and made conclusive and binding on the Board by s. 54A(5). The effect of this certificate upon the Board's decision with respect to whether compensation is to be awarded or not is quite another matter and, in my view, the fact that the specialist's certificate is not intended to be conclusive in this regard is demonstrated by the provisions of s. 54A(9) which clearly contemplate a review of the whole claim and the making of an independent decision by the Board after the certificate has been received. If the specialist's certificate were intended to be conclusive of the workman's right to compensation, there would be no room for the jurisdiction to review and decide which the Board is required to exercise under s. 54A(9).\nIn the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, Davey J.A. expressed the following opinion:\nIn my opinion it is possible that the Board may have accepted Dr. Greenwood's certificate but still have concluded, rightly or wrongly, on law or facts falling within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction that the opinion certified did not entitle the appellant to restoration of his compensation.\nCounsel for the appellant treated this passage as meaning that the Court of Appeal required the appellant to prove his case to the exclusion of all possibilities instead of in accordance with the preponderance of evidence. I do not, however, think that any problem concerning burden of proof is raised by the above-quoted passage or that Davey J.A. was doing more than saying that it was open to the Board and within its jurisdiction to reach the conclusion which it did. Under the provisions of the present s. 77 (d) (formerly s. 76) of the Act, the Board is given\n\u2026exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine . . .\n(d) the degree of diminution of earning capacity by reason of any injury;\nand s. 22(1) of the Act provides that when the Board is awarding compensation \"regard shall be had to the workman's fitness to continue in the occupation in which he was injured or to adapt himself to some other suitable employment or business\".\nIn my opinion, the Board has jurisdiction to review the appellant's claim in light of the specialist's certificate and to determine that no change should be made in the disposition of his case because of the degree of his fitness to adapt himself to employment at clerical work if he chose to do so. Whether or not this formed the basis of the Board's decision is not for me to say. In assessing the effect of the specialist's certificate on the appellant's right to compensation, it was, in my opinion, within the jurisdiction of the Board to examine all other data available to it for the purpose of determining whether or not the appellant's earning capacity had been diminished as a result of his disability and the fact that I am unable, on the material before us, to understand how the Board reached the decision which it did is quite beside the point.\nAs was said by Judson J. in Farrell v. Workmen's Compensation Board[3]:\n\u2026even if there was error, whether in law or fact, it was made within the exercise of the jurisdiction and is not open to any judicial review including certiorari.\nThe case of Battaglia v. Workmen's Compensation Board[4] stands on entirely different ground, because in that case it was clear that the medical opinion embodied in the certificate of a specialist had been ignored by the Board which had reached its decision on the basis of a contrary opinion obtained from other doctors. In so doing, the Board disregarded the medical conclusions contained in the certificate and thus trespassed on a field over which the specialist had been given exclusive jurisdiction by s. 54A(5). In view of all the above, I would dismiss this appeal.\nI would, however, make no order as to costs as I am of opinion that these proceedings might well have been avoided had the Board seen fit to inform the appellant of the reasons for its decision regarding the matters contained in Dr. Greenwood's certificate of February 1, 1957.\nHALL J.:\u2014I concur in the judgment of Ritchie J. I am impelled, however, to say, that this workman does not appear to have received the substantial justice which s. 79 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of British Columbia contemplates. Section 79 reads:\n79. The decision of the Board shall be upon the real merits and justice of the case, and it is not bound to follow strict legal precedent.\nThe courts are without power to review the merits of the case on certiorari. The legislature has given the Board unlimited discretion not subject to appeal or judicial review as long as the Board acts within its jurisdiction.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Shulman, Tupper, Worrall & Berger, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ladner, Downs, Ladner, Locke, Clark & Lenox, Vancouver.\n[1] (1962), 39 W.W.R. 177, 34 D.L.R.

The Crow's Nest Pass Agreement was made between the Crown and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in 1897 pursuant to the Crow's Nest Pass Act, 1897 (Can.), c. 5, and provided for certain rate reductions on grain and flour. The rates so fixed were later extended in application by provisions added to the Railway Act in 1925, which now appear as subs. (6) and (7) of s. 328 of the present Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234.\nThe issue for determination was as to whether the word \"grain\", as it is used in the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement and in the Crow's Nest Pass Act, was to be construed as meaning only those commodities which, at the time the statute and the agreement came into existence, were, in the ordinary sense, considered as grain, or whether it should be held to include a commodity which, at a later date, had come to be regarded as a grain in the ordinary sense. The Board, by a majority, decided that the word \"grain\" in the Crow's Nest Pass Act and the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement, and in s. 328 (6) and (7) of the Railway Act, did not include rapeseed. Subsequent to this decision and to the order giving the appellant leave to appeal, an amendment to s. 328 of the Railway Act, effective August 1, 1961, was passed which provided that the expression \"grain\" included rapeseed. Therefore the instant decision had relation only to the situation which existed prior to that date.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe principle of construction that was stated, with reference to the British North America Act, in British Coal Corporation v. The King, [1935] A.C. 500, i.e., in interpreting a constituent or organic statute that construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted, could not properly be applied to the statute in question in this case because its purpose was entirely different. The Crow's Nest Pass Act was enacted so as to provide for the making of an agreement. The agreement that followed was dealing with a reduction in the existing rates on grain and flour and it seemed that the parties contemplated, and only contemplated, the effecting of a reduction in rates then applicable on what both parties, at that time, regarded as being grain. The Governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba v. The C.P.R., [1925] S.C.R. 155, applied.\nThe words of a statute must be construed as they would have been the day after the statute was passed, unless some subsequent statute has declared that some other construction is to be adopted or has altered the previous statute.

MacDonald, for the respondent: Canadian National Railways.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners2, which dismissed the appellant's application for an order declaring that rapeseed is a \"grain\" within the meaning of the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement, and for an order directing the establishment by the respondents and the Board of rates on rapeseed from Prairie points eastbound to Fort William and westbound to the Pacific coast, on the basis of export rates applicable to grain from Prairie points to Fort William and the Pacific coast as the case may be, and declaring the rates being charged at the time of the application to be and to have been beyond the jurisdiction of the respondents and of the Board, void and of no effect.\nThe issue of law, on which leave to appeal was given in this case, is stated in the order which gave to the appellant leave to appeal, and is as follows:\nWhether the majority of the Board, consisting of Chief Commissioner Rod Kerr and Assistant Chief Commissioner H. H. Griffin, and Commissioner W. R. Irwin, whose reasons for judgment were delivered by the said Chief Commissioner erred, having found that rapeseed was now recognized as a grain, in not holding that rapeseed must be included within the meaning of the word \"grain\" as used in the Crowsnest Pass Act, being Chapter 5 Statutes of Canada, 1897, and the Railway Act of Canada, Section 328 (6) and (7) ?\nCommissioner Knowles and Commissioner Woodard, who dissented, were of the opinion that rapeseed is now a \"grain\" within the meaning of the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement.\nThe Crow's Nest Pass Agreement was made on September 6, 1897, between Her Majesty The Queen, acting in respect of the Dominion of Canada, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (which is hereinafter referred to as \"C.P.R.\"). It was made pursuant to a statute commonly known as the Crow's Nest Pass Act, 1897 (Can.), c. 5, which authorized a grant of subsidy to the C.P.R. toward the cost of construction of a railway through the Crow's Nest Pass on condition that the C.P.R. first enter into an agreement with the Government containing certain stipulated covenants by the C.P.R., which included the following:\n(a) That the Company will construct or cause to be constructed, the said railway upon such route and according to such descriptions and specifications and within such time or times as are provided for in the said agreement, and, when completed, will operate the said railway for ever;\n* * *\n(e) That there shall be a reduction in the Company's present rates and tolls on grain and flour from all points on its main line, branches, or connections, west of Fort William to Fort William and Port Arthur and all points east, of three cents per one hundred pounds, to take effect in the following manner:\u2014 One and one-half cent per one hundred pounds on or before the first day of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and an additional one and one-half cent per one hundred pounds on or before the first day of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine; and that no higher rates than such reduced rates or tolls shall be charged after the dates mentioned on such merchandise from the points aforesaid.\nThe agreement, as executed, contained these covenants.\nIn the year 1924 the Board of Railway Commissioners had to consider the issue as to whether the rate reductions provided for in the agreement applied only to points which had been upon the railway's system in 1897, or whether they also applied to points to which the system had been extended subsequently. The Board ruled that the rates stipulated in the agreement were not binding upon the Board and, therefore, that it did not require to consider this issue. An appeal by leave of the Board was taken to this Court, which was argued in 1925 (The Governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba v. The C.P.R.3). It was decided on that appeal that the statute and the agreement were binding upon the Board, which had no power to change the rates thereby fixed, but that the rates so fixed applied only to the carriage of freight between the points which were on the C.P.R. system in 1897. Anglin C.J.C., at p. 171, said:\nWe now pass to the consideration of the second question: Do the Crow's Nest Pass rates apply exclusively to the designated traffic between points which were on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's lines in 1897? The terms in which the rate reduction clauses (d) and (e) were couched seem to afford a conclusive answer in the affirmative. Both clauses provide for a reduction in then existing rates and tolls\u2014clause (d) by deducting certain specified percentages from rates and tolls in respect to the carriage of certain commodities as now charged or as contained in the present freight tariff of the company, whichever rates are the lowest; clause (e) by deducting from the present rates on eastbound grain and flour 3 cents per one hundred pounds. It is obvious that the rates and tolls to be reduced whether those actually charged, or those contained in the freight tariff, were rates and tolls between points actually on the Canadian Pacific Railway as then existing. There were\u2014there could be\u2014no rates or tolls in existence to or from points not then on the system; and there could be no reductions in non-existing rates and tolls.\nFollowing that decision, Parliament promptly enacted c. 52, Statutes of Canada 1925, which added provisions to the Railway Act which now appear as subss. (5), (6) and (7) of s. 328 of the present Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234.\n(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3 the powers given to the Board under this Act to fix, determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and to change and alter rates as changing conditions or cost of transportation may from time to time require, are not limited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto, whether general in application or special and relating only to any specific railway or railways, and the Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities, or of undue or unreasonable preference, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by any agreement made or entered into by the company.\n(6) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (5), rates on grain and flour shall, on and from the 27th day of June, 1925, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to chapter 5 of the statutes of Canada 1897, but such rates shall apply to all such traffic moving from all points on all lines of railway west of Fort William to Fort William or Port Arthur over all lines now or hereafter constructed by any company subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament. (7) The Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities or of undue or unreasonable preference, respecting rates on grain and flour, governed by the provisions of chapter 5 of the statutes of Canada, 1897, and by the agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto within the territory referred to in subsection (6), on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by the said Act or by the agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto.\nOn August 26,1927, by Order 448, the Board ordered that the rates on grain and flour from Prairie points to Vancouver and Prince Rupert for export (to which the 1925 statute had not applied the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement rates) be on the same basis as the rates to Port Arthur.\nThe application in the present case raised the issue as to whether or not rapeseed was a \"grain\" within the meaning of the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement and the Crow's Nest Pass Act. The application was heard on March 8 and 9, 1960. Subsequent to the decision of the Board and to the order giving to the appellant leave to appeal therefrom to this Court, there was enacted, on July 13, 1961, and taking effect on August 1, 1961, an amendment to s. 328 of the Railway Act, adding thereto subs. (8) as follows:\n(8) For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7) and the Act and agreement therein referred to, the expression \"grain\" includes rapeseed, and the rates applicable to the movement of rapeseed from any point referred to in subsection (6) after the coming into force of this subsection shall not exceed the rates applicable to flaxseed.\nAs from August 1, 1961, therefore, the issue before this Court has been settled by the statute and the decision of the Court in this case can only have relation to the situation which existed prior to that date.\nThe evidence before the Board showed that the rape plant is a broad-leafed plant of the same genus as cabbage, brussels sprouts and turnips. There is an annual variety and a biennial type. The latter was grown in Canada as a forage crop as far back as the 1890's, but, as it could not survive the winter in most parts of Canada, it produced only forage and not seeds. The seed for it was imported into Canada.\nThe annual variety, which produces oil seed rapes, was not produced commercially in Canada until 1943, when it was first grown to provide a source of oil for certain naval requirements. It produces an edible oil, useful for margarine and other foods, and has continued to be produced commercially in Canada since 1943. The evidence indicated that this type of plant, for the purpose of providing seeds for the production of oils, had been grown in Europe for a hundred years or more. There was, however, no evidence as to whether it had been considered, in the countries in which it was produced, as being a grain crop.\nThere was evidence, which the Board accepted, that rapeseed would not have been generally regarded in Canada in 1897 as a grain. \"Grain\" is a term of general usage applied to certain agricultural commodities by the trade. In 1943, when rapeseed came to be grown commercially, with the seed sold as a commercial product for purposes other than the growing of new plants, it did become recognized by the trade as a grain. The Board made the following finding upon the evidence:\nI find that the word \"grain\", as used and understood today by farmers, agronomists, transportation people and what is generally called the \"grain trade\" in Canada, in respect of such undisputed grain as wheat, oats and barley also includes rapeseed, that rapeseed to them is grain in the same sense that wheat, oats and barley are grain, and that they include rapeseed in their common usage of the word grain\u2014and that it was so included, used and understood by them since 1943, but not prior thereto.\nEvidence was, given regarding the tariffs immediately prior to and subsequent to the making of the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement. This evidence is summarized in the reasons of the Chief Commissioner as follows:\nWhen the Crow's Nest Pass Act was passed, Canadian Pacific's present rates and tolls on grain and flour were contained in its Tariff No. 236 which came into effect on September 5, 1893, and was in effect through 1897. The title page of that tariff had the following words:\n\"Special Tariff\non\nGrain, Flour, Oatmeal, Millstuffs\nFlaxseed, Oilcake, Potatoes and Hay,\nin Carloads,\nFrom Stations on the above Railways in Manitoba,\nAssiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta,\nKeewatin, Rat Portage,\nWest Fort William, Fort William\nand\nPort Arthur.\"\nThere was no specific reference to rapeseed in that tariff. To find the rate for rapeseed it would be necessary to go to \"Canadian Joint Freight Classification No. 10(a)\", which took effect on September 1, 1897, and use it in conjunction with C. P. Tariff No. 270, which provided for mileage class rates effective on October 1, 1894. There was no specific reference to rapeseed in Classification No. 10(a) and one would have to use the item \"Seed, Field, not otherwise specified\". The classification contained the item \"Grain\" and under it are specified only \"Barley, Beans, Buckwheat, Corn, Malt, Oats, 'Peas, Rye, Wheat\", and the statement \"The general term 'Grain' will not apply on Pot and Pearl Barley, Beans, Buckwheat or Split Peas on special 'grain' Tariffs, unless these articles are enumerated thereon as included in the Special Grain Rates.\" The carload ratings in the classification on seed, including rapeseed, were fifth class, and the fifth class rates to Fort William were considerably higher than the rates on grain to Fort William in Tariff No. 236 above referred to.\nThe first reduction on grain and flour made by Canadian Pacific under the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement was by its Tariff No. 494, effective August 1, 1898, and its title page was similar to the title page of Tariff 236 above described.\nThe second reduction under the Agreement was made by C.P. Tariff No. 543, effective September 1, 1899, and it was entitled as follows:\n\"Special Tariff\non\nGrain, Flour, Oatmeal, Mill Stuffs.\"\nand did not include flax, oilcakes, potatoes and hay which were put in another tariff without the second reduction in rates.\nRapeseed was first listed specifically when it appeared in Supplement No. 1 to Canadian Freight Classification No. 15, effective August 15, 1911, where it appeared under the item \"Seeds\" as \"Rape, in barrels \u2026\", taking fifth class carload rating.\nIn 1925, the position was that rapeseed was listed in Canadian Freight Classification No. 16, under the item \"Seed\" among such other seeds as clover, mustard, timothy, sugar beet, etc., with fifth class carload rating.\nSupplement No. 39 to C.P.'s Tariff No. W-4933, C.R.C. W-2641, effective June 18, 1925, and Supplement No. 36 to C.N.'s Tariff W-1-183-B, C.R.C. W-251, effective June 18, 1925, each of them on grain and grain products, were in effect when the 1925 amendment to the Railway Act was passed. Neither the supplements nor the original tariffs which they supplemented provided rates on rapeseed.\nIn 1927, pursuant to Board's General Order No. 448, rates were published on the Crow's Nest Pass basis on grain and grain products but they did not apply on rapeseed, the rates on rapeseed being the fifth class rates as provided in the Canadian Freight Classification under the heading \"Seed\".\nRapeseed has never taken the Crow's Nest Pass rates on grain, instead it has taken substantially higher rates.\nThe legal issue which has to be determined is as to whether the word \"grain\", as it is used in the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement and in the Crow's Nest Pass Act, is to be construed as meaning only those commodities which, as at the time the statute and the agreement came into existence, were, in the ordinary sense, considered as grain, or whether it should be held to include a commodity which, at a later date, has come to be regarded as a grain in the ordinary sense.\nThe appellant, in supporting the latter view, relies upon s. 10 of the Interpretation Act:\n10. The law shall be considered as always speaking, and whenever any matter or thing is expressed in the present tense, the same shall be applied to the circumstances as they arise, so that effect may be given to each Act and every part thereof, according to its spirit, true intent and meaning.\nReliance was placed upon the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada4, in which there was considered the meaning of the word \"banking\" in s. 91 of the British North America Act and the question as to whether that term was confined to the activities of banks as conducted in 1867. Viscount Simon, at p. 516, said:\nThe question is not what was the extent and kind of business carried on by banks in Canada in 1867 but what is the meaning of the term itself in the Act.\nThere was also cited the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Re McIntyre Porcupine Mines Limited and Morgan5, in which the Court had to consider the meaning of the word \"concentrators\" for the purposes of the Assessment Act. In that case Hodgins J.A., at p. 219, said:\nThe rule laid down in the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1914, ch. 1, sec. 10, is that statutes shall \"receive such fair, large, and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act, and of the provision or enactment, according to the true intent, meaning and spirit thereof.\" It is therefore open to the Court to adopt the larger or later meaning of the word in question, if it be true, as I think it is, that the Assessment Act in this particular aims at exempting such means as may be adopted in the mining location to aid in the concentration of the ore-mass, even if that progresses to the point of using chemical means as well as those mechanical, and in so doing draws within its scope some part of what may be alternatively described as amalgamation or reduction:\nSection 10 of the Interpretation Act refers to the \"spirit, true intent and meaning\" of an Act and, in construing the meaning of the Assessment Act, Hodgins J.A., in the passage just quoted, gave effect to the purpose which he found for the section in question in the Assessment Act.\nIn The Attorney-General for Alberta v. The Attorney-General for Canada the Court was considering the meaning of a term in the British North America Act, which the learned Chief Commissioner, in his reasons, has described as \"an organic statute conferring legislative powers\". In his reasons the Chief Commissioner went on to refer to British Coal Corporation v. The King6, in which, at p. 518, Viscount Sankey said:\nIndeed, in interpreting a constituent or organic statute such as the Act, that construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted.\nI do not think that the same principle of construction can properly be applied to the statute in question in the present case because its purpose was entirely different. The Crow's Nest Pass Act was enacted so as to provide for the making of an agreement. It is true that the rates established by that agreement had statutory effect, as was pointed out by this Court in 1925 in the case of The Governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba v. The C.P.R., previously mentioned. But, none the less, it was an agreement which was being made in 1897 between two parties, the Crown and the C.P.R., and under its terms, in consideration of a grant from the Crown to the C.P.R., the latter agreed to reduce its rates on certain commodities. That was the essence of the agreement, which provided that \"there shall be a reduction in the Company's present rates and tolls on grain and flour\". It then went on, after providing how and when such reductions should be effected, to provide: \"and that no higher rates than such reduced rates or tolls shall be charged after the dates mentioned.\" In other words, the reduction in rates was not temporary in nature, but would continue. The agreement was dealing with a reduction in the existing rates on grain and flour and it seems to me that the parties contemplated, and only contemplated, the effecting of a reduction in rates then applicable on what both parties, at that time, regarded as being grain.\nI am reinforced in this opinion by the reasons of Anglin C.J.C., already cited, in the case of The Governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba v. The C.P.R. The reasoning which he applied, in deciding that the agreement related only to points existing on the C.P.R. lines as at the date of the agreement, applies, by analogy, in considering what was meant by the word \"grain\", and, just as the agreement did not cover points subsequently added to the system, so it did not cover commodities which were not considered as grain at the time of the making of the agreement, even though they subsequently came to be considered as grain in the trade.\nIn my opinion, the rule which is applicable in this case is that which was stated by Lord Esher in his judgment in Sharpe v. Wakefield7:\nNow what is the rule of construction to be applied? It is that the words of a statute must be construed as they would have been the day after the statute was passed, unless some subsequent statute has declared that some other construction is to be adopted or has altered the previous statute.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case was affirmed by the House of Lords8.\nIn Simpson v. Teignmouth and Shaldon Bridge Company9, the issue was as to whether a bicycle was a \"carriage\" within the meaning of a statute of George IV which imposed certain bridge tolls. The Earl of Halsbury L.C. said at p. 413:\nThe broad principle of construction put shortly must be this: What would, in an ordinary sense, be considered to be a carriage (by whatever specific name it might be called) in the contemplation of the Legislature at the time the Act was passed?\nThis passage was cited in the Privy Council decision in Kingston Wharves Ltd. v. Reynolds Jamaica Mines Ltd.10 The same principle was applied by the Privy Council in Attorney-General for the Isle of Man v. Moore11.\nApplying that rule in the present case, it is my opinion that the Board, having found that the word \"grain\" did not include rapeseed prior to 1943, properly decided that the word \"grain\" in the Crow's Nest Pass Act and the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement, and in s. 328(6) and (7) of the Railway Act, did not include rapeseed.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & Macdonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Canadian Pacific Railway Co.: K.

After unsuccessful negotiations between the parties a notice of expropriation, with a form of easement attached thereto, was served by the respondent on the appellant. Upon the matter being heard before the County Court judge, a warrant for immediate possession of the main line right of way was granted to the respondent, who then took possession and constructed the pipe line. At the compensation proceedings the appellant took the position that while the National Energy Board under s. 72 of the National Energy Board Act had jurisdiction to award compensation for mines and minerals lying within the respondent's right of way and for a distance of forty yards on either side of the limits of the right of way, the awarding of compensation for mines and minerals lying beyond the forty-yard limits was not within the competence of the Board but could be awarded only by the County Court judge in his capacity as arbitrator. The matter having been brought before the Board for determination, the latter found that under the National Energy Board Act it had sole jurisdiction to award compensation for mines and minerals, whether within or without the protected area. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe jurisdiction over mines and minerals vested in the National Energy Board pursuant to the National Energy Board Act, 1959 (Can.), c. 46, including its jurisdiction to award compensation to an owner, lessee or occupier of any mines or minerals, is restricted to those mines and minerals only, lying under a pipe line or any of the works connected therewith, or within forty yards therefrom. Any right which the owner of the right of way may have to prevent mining outside the protected area, arises and must be enforced under the general law.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the National Energy Board, granting certain declaratory orders sought by the respondent. Appeal allowed.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and A. B. Ferris, for the appellant.\nJohn L. Farris, Q.C., and J. M. Giles, for the respondent. The judgment of Abbott, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This is an appeal pursuant to s. 18(1) of the National Energy Board Act, 1959 (Can.), c. 46, from a decision of the National Energy Board made on June 13, 1962, granting two declaratory orders sought by the respondent Alberta Natural Gas Company.\nThese two orders declared:\n(a) That the National Energy Board Act gives the National Energy Board sole jurisdiction to determine the compensation payable in respect of any mines and minerals affected by a pipeline.\n(b) that such compensation may only be awarded from time to time if the Board is satisfied the mine owner has a bona fide intention to commence mining operations which will be affected by the presence of a pipeline.\nThe main questions before the Board were (1) whether ss. 68 to 72 inclusive of the Energy Board Act gave to the Board sole jurisdiction to determine the compensation payable in respect of any mines and minerals adversely affected by the construction and operation of a pipe line no matter where such mines and minerals may be located, or (2) whether, as the appellant contended, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to awarding compensation, if any, for those mines and minerals lying under a pipe line and any works connected therewith or within forty yards therefrom.\nThe events which led up to the parties bringing the matter before the Board for determination, are admirably summarized in the Board's decision as follows:\nThe Applicant (the present respondent) having been granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity No. GC-12 to construct a pipe line, proceeded with the work. The Respondent (the present appellant) owns certain lands and the mines and minerals, including coal thereunder, if any, through which the Applicant's main line right-of-way passes. These lands, mines and minerals are situate in the Kootenay District of the Province of British Columbia. Columbia Iron Mining Company has options to purchase these mines and minerals, including the coal. After unsuccessful negotiations between the parties whereby the Applicant sought to obtain a grant of easement from the Respondent for the construction of the pipe line and other facilities, a notice of expropriation dated January 19, 1961, with a form of easement thereto attached, was served by the Applicant upon the Respondent. Upon the matter being heard before the County Court Judge of the County of East Kootenay, a warrant for immediate possession of the main line right-of-way was granted to the Applicant. The Applicant posted security in the sum of $100,000, took possession of the main line right-of-way and thereupon commenced construction of its pipe line, which was later completed.\nSubsequently the Applicant applied to the said Judge as Arbitrator to determine the compensation payable to both the Respondent and Columbia Iron Mining Company by reason of the taking of the right-of-way. The necessary hearing to set compensation commenced July 6, 1961, and has since, by consent of the parties, been adjourned from time to time.\nAt the compensation proceedings, prior to the last adjournment thereof, the Respondent took the position that, while the National Energy Board under Section 72 of the National Energy Board Act had jurisdiction to award compensation for mines and minerals lying within the Applicant's right-of-way and for a distance of forty yards on either side of the limits of the right-of-way, the awarding of compensation for mines and minerals lying beyond the forty-yard limits (hereinafter referred to as \"outside minerals\") was not within the competence of the National Energy Board but could be awarded only by the County Court Judge in his capacity as Arbitrator. The Applicant, Alberta Natural Gas Company, of course argued that the National Energy Board has jurisdiction under Section 72 of its Act to award compensation for mines and minerals both inside and outside the aforementioned forty-yard limits. The parties have agreed, without prejudice to the right, if any, of the Respondent and Columbia Iron Mining Company to continue the arbitration proceedings before the County Court Judge for the County of East Kootenay with respect to their claims for compensation for mines and minerals (including coal and the severance thereof) lying outside the right-of-way and more than forty yards therefrom, and without prejudice to the right, if any, of the Applicant to maintain and assert in any such proceedings that the said County Court Judge does not have jurisdiction to award such compensation, upon a form of easement which has been granted by the Respondent and Columbia Iron Mining Company to the Applicant and registered in the Land Registry Office at the City of Nelson, British Columbia. This easement grants Alberta Natural Gas Company a right-of-way upon and through which it may construct its pipe line and other facilities. By reason of the grant of the easement, the Respondent and Columbia Iron Mining Company are obliged not to withdraw support of the surface of the right-of-way. The easement does not make provision for payment to the Respondent or to Columbia Iron Mining Company of any compensation for mines or minerals (including coal or the severance thereof). The Compensation claims of the Respondent and of Columbia Iron Mining Company for mines and minerals (including coal and the severance thereof) are preserved to them as hereinbefore provided to be presented before or dealt with by such Board, Court or Arbitrator as may be found to have jurisdiction with respect thereto. Provision has, however, been made in the easement for the payment of compensation for minerals (including coal) that are necessary to be dug up, carried away or used on the right-of-way during the course of the construction or reconstruction of the pipe line and other facilities of the Applicant.\nThe Board found that under s. 72 of the National Energy Board Act it had sole jurisdiction to award compensation for mines and minerals whether within or without the protected area prescribed by s. 70 of the said Act, and on August 17, 1962, it made the declaratory orders above referred to.\nThe present appeal by leave is from that decision.\nThe National Energy Board Act is the successor to and repealed the Pipe Lines Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 211. These two acts were the first federal statutes dealing with the regulation of pipe lines in Canada. Under the Pipe Lines Act regulatory duties were vested in the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada. Under the Energy Board Act these duties were transferred to a new body, the National Energy Board.\nPower to expropriate is granted under the Energy Board Act and s. 64 of that Act (which is identical to s. 166 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234) provides that a company exercising its powers under the act shall make full compensation to all persons interested for all damages sustained by them by reason of the exercise of such powers. The expropriation provisions of the Railway Act\u2014ss. 218 to 246 inclusive\u2014are incorporated by reference into the Energy Board Act. Generally speaking, these sections provide for such matters as the fixing of compensation, the appointment of an arbitrator, proceedings before the arbitrator and the like. It is common ground that the said sections govern the fixing of compensation payable for the surface rights of way for a pipe line.\nThe Pipe Lines Act and the Energy Board Act each contain five sections under the sub-heading \"Mines and Minerals\" which are in substantially the same terms. In the Energy Board Act these are ss. 68 to 72 inclusive. They were based upon five similar sections under the same sub-heading \u2014ss. 197 to 201 inclusive\u2014in the Railway Act. These sections in turn had their origin in an Imperial statute, the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, c. 20. The effect of what are now ss. 197 and following of the Railway Act was considered by the Judicial Committee in Davies v. James Bay Railway Company1, and after that decision was rendered Parliament amended the Railway Act by adding what are now ss. 200 and 201 of the said act.\nWith certain minor differences\u2014which in my view have no relevance to the question at issue in this appeal\u2014ss. 68 to 71 of the Energy Board Act are in the same terms as ss. 197 to 199 and s. 201 of the Railway Act. Section 72 of the Energy Board Act is in slightly different terms to the corresponding s. 200 in the Railway Act, and it is upon this difference that respondent mainly relies.\nBoth s. 70 of the Energy Board Act and the corresponding s. 199 of the Railway Act, provide that no person shall work mines or minerals lying under a pipe line or railway or any of the works connected therewith or within forty yards therefrom until leave therefor has been obtained from the Energy Board or the Board of Transport Commissioners as the case may be. This area\u2014some three hundred feet wide\u2014 was appropriately described by Mr. Robinette in his argument as \"the protected area\".\nAs Locke J. pointed out in Attorney General of Canada v. C.P.R. and C.N.R.2, the effect of ss. 197 to 201 of the Railway Act is to ensure that when a railway is carried over lands which contain mines or minerals the interests of (1) the owner of such minerals (2) the public and (3) the railway company, are adequately protected. In my opinion ss. 68 to 72 inclusive of the Energy Act have precisely the same purpose and effect.\nIn my view it is also clear, that neither the Board of Transport Commissioners nor the Energy Board has been given any jurisdiction to interfere with mining operations outside the protected area. Any right which the owner of the right of way may have to prevent mining outside the protected area, arises and must be enforced under the general law.\nIt is common ground that in the case of a railway right of way, jurisdiction to fix the compensation, if any, for minerals lying under the right of way, is vested by s. 200 of the Railway Act in the Board of Transport Commissioners, but that compensation for minerals outside the protected area, which must be left in place to afford support to the surface of the right of way, is to be determined by an arbitrator in accordance with ss. 222 and following, in the same way as compensation for the surface right of way.\nRespondent's contention is that by virtue of s. 72 of the Energy Board Act, the Energy Board has sole jurisdiction to determine the compensation payable in respect of any mines and minerals affected by a pipe line. That contention is based upon what respondent submits is the plain and literal meaning of the said section which reads:\n72. A company shall, from time to time, pay to the owner, lessee or occupier of any mines such compensation as the Board shall fix and order to be paid for or by reason of any severance by a pipe line of the land lying over such mines, or because of the working of the mines being prevented, stopped or interrupted, or because of the mines having to be worked in such manner and under such restrictions as not to injure or be detrimental to the pipe line, and also for any minerals not purchased by the company that cannot be obtained by reason of the construction and operation of its line.\nThe corresponding s. 200 in the Railway Act reads:\n200. The company shall, from time to time, pay to the owner, lessee, or occupier of any such mines such compensation as the Board shall fix and order to be paid, for or by reason of any severance by the railway of the land lying over such mines, or because of the working of such minea being prevented, stopped or interrupted, or of the same having to be worked in such manner and under such restrictions as not to injure or be detrimental to the railway, and also for any minerals not purchased by the company that cannot be obtained by reason of the construction and operation of the railway.\nThe italics are mine.\nIt will be seen that the only differences between the two sections are the substitution of the word \"a\" for the word \"the\" in the first line [in s. 200 as in R.S.C. 1952], the elimination of the word \"such\" between the words \"any\" and \"mines\" in the second line, the substitution of the words \"pipe line\" for \"railway\" in the fourth line, the substitution of the word \"the\" for the word \"such\" in the sixth line, the substitution of the words \"the mines\" for the words \"the same\" in the seventh line, and the substitution of the words \"its line\" for the words \"the railway\" in the last line.\nSection 72 must be read in the context in which it is found. It forms part of a group of five sections which provide for the control of mining operations under and within a prescribed distance from a pipe line. No power is given to control mining operations outside that protected area. The purpose of these five sections (and of the corresponding sections in the Railway Act) is to ensure that the interests of the public, the pipe line company and the mine owner are protected.\nI agree with Mr. Robinette's submission that the differences between s. 72 of the Energy Board Act and s. 200 of the Railway Act are merely drafting changes and do not justify any inference that Parliament intended in the case of a pipe line, to alter the law with respect to the fixing of compensation for minerals lying outside the protected area. That law is to be found in ss. 218 and following of the Railway Act which have been incorporated by reference into the National Energy Board Act.\nUnder the Railway Act if the removal of minerals lying under a railway is proposed, the owner must apply to the Transport Board for leave to do so and that Board under the powers given to it by s. 199 may prescribe the measures to be taken for the protection of the public. The same powers are given to the Energy Board under s. 70 of the Energy Board Act. Section 200 gives the Transport Board power to direct a railway company to pay to such owner compensation by reason of the severance by the railway of the lands lying over the mines because working them is prevented or interrupted. It is conceded that the Transport Board's jurisdiction to award such compensation is limited to compensation for minerals lying within the protected area.\nSimilar powers are given to the Energy Board under s. 72 of the Energy Board Act and, in my opinion, the jurisdiction of the Energy Board under s. 72 to award compensation, is subject to the same limitation as that imposed upon the Transport Board under the s. 200 of the Railway Act.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and declare that the jurisdiction over mines and minerals vested in the National Energy Board pursuant to the National Energy Board Act, 1959 (Can.), c. 46, including its jurisdiction to award compensation to an owner, lessee or occupier of any mines or minerals, is restricted to those mines and minerals only, lying under a pipe line or any of the works connected therewith, or within forty yards therefrom.\nMartland J.:\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons delivered by my brother Abbott and merely wish to add the following additional comments.\nSection 72 of the National Energy Board Act, which is cited in his judgment, relates only to compensation by a pipe line company to the owner, lessee or occupier of any mines. He is to receive compensation from the pipe line company, fixed by the National Energy Board,\n(a) for severance of his land lying over the mines;\n(b) because the working of his mines is prevented, stopped or obstructed;\n(c) because his mines have to be worked in such manner and under such restrictions as not to injure or be detrimental to the pipe line;\n(d) for minerals not purchased by the pipe line company that he cannot obtain by reason of the construction and operation of the pipe line.\nThe severance of lands above the mines referred to in (a) occurs by reason of the acquisition of its right of way by the pipe line company. The matters referred to in paras. (b) and (c) obviously relate to the limitations imposed on his right to work his mines created by s. 70 of the Act, the relevant portions of which provide:\n70. (1) No person shall work or prospect for mines or minerals lying under a pipe line or any of the works connected therewith, or within forty yards therefrom, until leave therefor has been obtained from the Board.\n* * *\n(3) Upon an application to the Board for leave to work or prospect for mines or minerals, the applicant shall submit a plan and profile of the portion of the pipe line to be affected thereby, giving all reasonable and necessary information and details as to the proposed operations.\n(4) The Board may grant the application upon such terms and conditions for the protection and safety of the public as to the Board seem expedient, and may order that such things be done as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger arising or likely to arise from the proposed operations.\nIn my opinion the minerals mentioned in para. (d) to which s. 72 refers, which the mine owner cannot obtain by reason of the construction and operation of the pipe line, are only those minerals which, because of the restrictions imposed by the Board under s. 70, he cannot obtain.\nAny minerals lying beyond the protected area provided for in s. 70(1) are not prevented from being obtained by reason of the construction and operation of the pipe line. If they are prevented from being obtained at all, it is only because their owner is compelled to provide that support to which the pipe line owner becomes entitled at common law as an incident of his ownership of the pipe line right of way. The obligation to support resting upon the owner of the lands adjoining the pipe line right of way arises as soon as the pipe line company acquires its right of way, and not because of the construction and operation of its line. The restrictions on the obtaining of minerals, which arise by reason of the construction and operation of the line, are only those which are imposed under s. 70.\nThe words \"not purchased by the company\" are also of some significance. Obviously, if the pipe line company has purchased minerals, then the mine owner would not be in a position to claim compensation because he was unable to obtain them. In my opinion, these words must be related back to s. 69, which reads:\n69. A company is not entitled to mines, ores, metals, coal, slate, oil, gas or other minerals in or under lands purchased by it, or taken by it under compulsory powers given to it by this Act, except only the parts thereof that are necessary to be dug, carried away or used in the construction of the works, and except as provided in this section, all such mines and minerals shall be deemed to be excepted from the conveyance of such lands.\nI think that the reason the words appear in s. 72 is that they had appeared in the equivalent section of the Railway Act, s. 200. They were included in that section because in s. 198(1) of the Railway Act, which is the equivalent of s. 69 of the National Energy Board Act, but different in its terms, the wording was as follows:\nThe company is not, unless the same have been expressly purchased, entitled to any mines, ores, metals, coal, slate, mineral oils, gas or other minerals in or under any lands purchased by it, or taken by it under any compulsory powers given it by this Act, \u2026\nWhen s. 200 of the Railway Act referred to \"minerals not purchased by the company that cannot be obtained by reason of the construction and operation of the railway\", it meant minerals underlying the railway which the railway company had not expressly purchased and also those underlying the forty-yard strip on each side of the railway right of way.\nThe reference in s. 72 of the National Energy Board Act was, I think, incorporated directly from the Railway Act, even though s. 69 of the National Energy Board Act makes no reference to an express purchase of minerals. The significance of these words is, however, to direct attention to those minerals which underlie the pipe line right of way itself. Their inclusion in s. 72 tends to emphasize that when that section speaks of \"any minerals not purchased by the company that cannot be obtained by reason of the construction and operation of its line\" it is not referring to minerals in general, but is doing no more than to refer to those minerals which underlie the pipe line right of way and those which adjoin the pipe line right of way underlying the forty-yard strip on each side of it which the mine owner is precluded from working, without the leave of the Board, by virtue of s. 70.\nI agree with the disposition of this appeal proposed by my brother Abbott.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Messrs. Davis & Company, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Messrs. Farris & Company, Vancouver.\n1 [1914] A.C. 1043.\n2 [1958] S.C.R. 285 at 304, 12 D.L.R. (2d) 625.\n"

Workman Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\nWilliam Huculak Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n1963: January 24, 25; 1963: February 11.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nKerwin C.J. died before the delivery of the judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nCriminal law\u2014Capital murder\u2014Body of alleged victim never found\u2014Circumstantial evidence\u2014Theory that one of two accused merely an accessory after fact to murder committed by other\u2014Whether sufficient reality to theory to require trial judge to place it before jury.\nThe two appellants, W and H, were convicted as principals, on a charge of capital murder. The victim's body was never found. The Crown's case relied exclusively on circumstantial evidence, and was based largely on the testimony of one O who testified as to events on the night of the alleged murder as well as to events before and after. A strong motive for murder was proved against W who devised the plan for the killing, but there was no evidence of motive against H who heard the plan on the day the deed was done. The common defence of both accused was that the death had not been satisfactorily proved, and that the Crown's case failed to meet the requirements for a conviction. In the Court of Appeal it was contended, for the first time, that the jury could have found that H was concerned not as a principal but as an accessory after the fact and that the trial judge erred in not putting this defence to the jury. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The accused appealed to this Court where the same submission on behalf of H was repeated.\nHeld: The appeal of W should be dismissed.\nHeld further (Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal of H should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The jury was correctly instructed that the case put against the accused was that they were both involved as principals, also as to the defence of both accused and as to the credibility of O's testimony. There was ample evidence upon which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was dead, even though his body had not been found, and that the two accused were guilty as-principals in his killing.\nWith respect to the submission of H, there was no possible ground for any instructions that, on any view of the evidence, H could be an accessory after the fact and not a principal. There could not be found in the record any evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the submission. Failure of counsel to raise the matter does not relieve the trial judge of his duty to place a possible defence before the jury but there must be something beyond fantasy to suggest the existence of the duty.\nPer Ritchie and Hall JJ., dissenting as to H's appeal: A trial judge, when addressing a jury in a criminal case, is not under a duty to explore all the remotest and most fantastic possibilities. Even though the alternative defence of H that he was an accessory after the fact rather than a principal relied on improbable suppositions, and even though it was extremely unlikely in the present case that the jury would have found in favour of such a defence, under all the circumstances such a direction should have been given. It could not be said to be impossible that the jury would have found H to be an accessory. The failure of the trial judge to place that defence before the jury entitled H to a new trial even though it was not raised at his original trial.\nAs to the case of W, the evidence against him was overwhelming.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming the convictions of the accused for capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting as to H's appeal.\nT. J. Nugent, for the appellant Huculak.\nF. S. Lieber, for the appellant Workman.\nJ. W. K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The two appellants were convicted on a charge of the capital murder of one Frank Willey. Their appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2. They appeal to this Court under s. 597(a) of the Criminal Code. The two accused were separately represented on both appeals. Neither gave evidence at the trial nor did they call any witnesses.\nThe learned trial judge instructed the jury that the case put against the accused was that they were both involved as principals in the offence charged and, in my respectful opinion, it was not open to objection on that basis, and, in fact, no objection was made by either counsel for the accused. The defence of both accused, also correctly and adequately put to the jury by the judge, was that the death of Frank Willey had not been satisfactorily proved, his body not having been found, and that the Crown's case, being based largely on circumstantial evidence, failed to meet the requirements for a conviction.\nFor the first time in the Court of Appeal counsel for Huculak submitted that on one view of the evidence, the jury could have found that his client was concerned not as a principal but as an accessory after the fact and that the learned trial judge erred in not putting this defence to the jury. The same submission was repeated in this Court and this makes it necessary for me to review the evidence.\nFrank Willey was a golf professional in the City of Edmonton. At the time of his disappearance he was living in the same house as his wife and two children although there was strong evidence of an adulterous association between Workman and Mrs. Willey. Fourteen months before the disappearance of Willey, Workman had enquired of an Alberta solicitor whether it was possible for a guilty party in an adulterous association to get a substantial part of the property of the opposite party. When he was told that this was a very improbable result, he said to the solicitor \"we'll just have to kill him.\" This was in February 1961. In July 1961, Mrs. Willey sued her husband for a judicial separation and claimed maintenance in the sum of $800 per month. Willey defended the action and also counterclaimed against Workman for damages for enticement and harbouring. This action was settled in January 1962.\nHuculak did not come to Edmonton until February 1962. There is no evidence that he had ever known or even met Mrs. Willey or her husband or that he knew his co-accused Workman before he came to Edmonton or that he had any motive for joining in the killing of Willey.\nOne Paul Osborne, a neighbour of Huculak and one who had known him in Eastern Canada, gave evidence that on April 18, he met Workman and Huculak and had a conversation with them in a car, and that Workman suggested that he would like somebody \"worked over.\" The three met again the following morning and, according to Osborne, Workman was still talking about \"working this guy over.\" He eventually said that he wanted him killed and wanted it to look like an accident. \"Knock this guy out, take him out in the country and hit him with another car.\" No name was mentioned and Osborne said that he immediately refused to have anything to do with the plan. Part of the plan was to lure the victim to a partially built house somewhere. Workman telephoned Osborne at one o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, April 19, to find out whether his decision was final.\nOn the same day, Willey received a telephone call for the delivery of a set of ladies golf clubs, not to exceed $225 in value, as a present for the caller's wife. He accepted the order, procured the golf clubs and agreed to deliver them at 9 o'clock that night. There is evidence that on the afternoon of April 19, Workman was at the house where the killing is alleged to have been done and spoke to the painters. The purpose of his enquiry seems to have been to find out how late they would be working. Huculak was not with him. The house was under construction by a builder who employed Workman as a book-keeper.\nOn this date, April 19, Willey arrived home for dinner with the golf clubs and an extra bag in his car. He had dinner with his wife and family and with his sister and mother, who were visiting from Vancouver. After dinner he left with the car to deliver the golf clubs. A neighbour gave evidence of the presence of two cars and two men at a certain house. The two cars were identified as being white in colour. Willey owned an Oldsmobile which had a white body and brown top, and Workman had hired a white Pontiac a few days before April 19. It was in this house, which was the one which Workman had visited during the afternoon, that the police found a lot of blood, even after cleaning-up operations.\nBetween 9 and 10 on the same evening, April 19, Workman brought a tire to a service station. This tire came from Willey's car. At about 3 a.m. the following morning, he came back to this service station and picked up the wrong tire and rim. Instead of picking up the one from the Olds-mobile that he had left, he picked up one from a Cadillac belonging to another customer. This tire and rim were later found on Willey's car. There is a clear inference from this evidence that Workman at least was in possession of Willey's car when this tire and rim were removed and replaced by another not belonging to the car. To resume with Osborne's evidence, he said that about 10 p.m. on the evening of April 19, he received a telephone call from Workman who was enquiring about the whereabouts of Huculak:\nQ. What did he say?\nA. He asked me if I had seen Mr. Huculak.\nQ. What did you say?\nA. I said no.\nQ. Anything else?\nA. Oh, he said something about\u2014I asked him what was the matter and he said everything went haywire. I said, you don't mean to tell me you went through with that thing and he said yes.\nQ. Did you\u2014did he ask or say anything more?\nA. He asked me if I would phone around and see if I could get hold of Mr. Huculak.\nQ. And what did you say?\nA. I said I would, yes.\nQ. Did you?\nA. No sir I didn't.\nThen, at 11.30 p.m., in response to a telephone call from Mrs. Huculak, Osborne and his wife went to the apartment where the Huculaks lived and which was close to where the Osbomes lived. He and his wife sat up with Mrs. Huculak until about 3 a.m. when Workman and Huculak came to the, apartment together. Osborne noticed nothing unusual about Workman's appearance but he did notice that Huculak was very disturbed.\nWell, Mr. Huculak was in pretty rough shape. I took him in the washroom and calmed him down. He kept mentioning about this guy's eyes sticking out of his head and something hanging out of the back of his head and he was just all shook up.\nWorkman also joined them in the bathroom. When they returned to the living-room Workman told Huculak to get rid of his shoes, which were very muddy. Mrs. Huculak cleaned them. Osborne said that the two stayed for about an hour and then went out again. On being asked whether either of them said anything before leaving, Osborne replied:\nYes, Mr. Huculak said there was a body in a shed somewhere and they had to go out and bury it.\nOsborne had a further conversation with Huculak over the Easter week-end. He was not sure whether it was Satur- day or Sunday. April 20 was Good Friday. This is the conversation that he reported with Huculak:\nA. He mentioned something to me about something coming off a wrench or something, some bandages or tape or something that flew off.\nQ. Did he say when it flew off or what caused it to fly off?\nA. He said when the person was hit some tape or something on the end of this wrench flew off.\nQ. Did he say anything else at this time?\nA. Something about they would have to\u2014if I remember correctly, they would have to go back to this house and get it, something to that effect.\nQ. Back to the house?\nA. To get this tape or whatever it was, I wasn't too clear on it, I wasn't listening to him too good.\nQ. Did he say anything about the burying which they had talked about before?\nA. Oh yes, he said they couldn't get this bury deep enough into the ground or something, the ground was frozen and they couldn't bury him deep enough.\nOn being brought back to the night of April 19 or the early morning of April 20, Osborne reported one further item of conversation\u2014that they had to go back and clean up this house. Osborne also said that several days later Workman brought a Pontiac car into his driveway for the purpose of borrowing a hose to wash out the trunk of the car, and that a few days later he went for a drive in the country with Workman in the Pontiac. They turned off the main highway after driving south for about 12 miles and drove another 15 or 16 miles into the country. Workman stopped the car and told Osborne to drive down the road and come back in about 20 minutes to pick him up. Osborne said he did this but Workman said nothing about the purpose of the trip. He also said that at some time Huculak expressed a fear about some woman talking to the police about the night in question and that Workman said that he was not worried about that.\nRose Francis, the woman with whom Osborne was living and who passed as Mrs. Osborne, also gave evidence of the return of Huculak and Workman to the Huculak apartment about 3 a.m. in the early morning of April 20. She said that Huculak looked scared and that his wife cleaned his shoes, that Osborne, Workman and Huculak were all in the bathroom together and that Workman and Huculak remained in the apartment until about 4.30 a.m. She did not hear the conversation in the bathroom. She did hear Workman say-that he was glad that it was a holiday week-end so that he could go back and clean the walls.\nIt is apparent that if the jury believed Osborne, there was a very strong circumstantial case against both the accused on a charge of capital murder. The learned trial judge gave clear directions on the question of credibility and pointed out that Osborne's criminal record went to the question of credibility. He also raised the question why it was that when Workman called about 10 p.m., he was enquiring about the whereabouts of Huculak if Workman and Huculak had been working in concert.\nThe defence submitted by counsel for Workman and put to the jury by the learned trial judge as applicable to both defendants was based upon what was alleged to be an infirm circumstantial case. With evidence of the kind that I have outlined and with the jury adequately charged on Osborne's evidence, including its weaknesses, I can see no possible ground for any instruction that, on any view of the evidence, Huculak could be an accessory after the fact and not a principal. Before this could be done, there must be found in the record some evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the submission: Kelsey v. The Queen3. Failure of counsel to raise the matter does not relieve the trial judge of his duty to place a possible defence before the jury but there must be something beyond fantasy to suggest the existence of the duty. The Court of Appeal, in the exercise of its function under s. 583A(3) (b) of the Criminal Code, in dismissing the appeals found no error on this ground and I respectfully agree.\nThere was a full review of the evidence in the charge of the learned trial judge. It was again reviewed in the reasons of the Court of Appeal and, finally, before this Court. My conclusion is firm that there was ample evidence upon which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Willey was dead, even though his body had not been found, and that the two accused were guilty as principals in his killing.\nWhile there might be a question of the admissibility against Huculak of evidence of the solicitor's conversation with Workman in February 1961, it was admissible against Workman for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal. Huculak was not identified with any motive or animosity that Workman may have entertained and this was plain to be seen. But on the evidence of Osborne, which the jury must have accepted, Huculak was actively involved in the plan and in its execution. It is for this reason that I would hold that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the judge's failure to instruct the jury that the solicitor's evidence was admissible only against Workman.\nThe appeals of both appellants must be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by Ritchie J. (dissenting as to Huculak's appeal):\u2014This appeal is brought pursuant to the provisions of s. 597A of the Criminal Code from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta4 affirming the conviction of both the appellants on a charge of the capital murder of Frank Willey.\nThe evidence has been reviewed in the reasons for judgment of my brother Judson, which I have had the advantage of reading, and it would be superfluous for me to repeat it.\nThe main argument advanced by Mr. Nugent on behalf of the appellant Huculak was that the evidence against his client was not necessarily inconsistent with his having been an accessory after the fact rather than a party to the murder, and although this defence was not raised by counsel at the trial the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury with respect to it nevertheless constituted a miscarriage of justice entitling Huculak to a new trial.\nIt appears to me to be established that the failure of a defence counsel to advance an alternative argument does not relieve the judge from the duty of directing the jury with respect to it if there is any evidence to justify such a direction. This is supported by the decision of Viscount Simon in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions5, and the decision of Lord Reading in Rex v. Hopper6, is to the same effect.\nIn this Court, in the case of McAskill v. The King7, Duff J., as he then was, had occasion to say:\nThe able and experienced judge who presided at the trial properly directed the attention of the jury to the defence as it was put before them by counsel for the prisoner; and having done this, he did not ask them to apply their minds to the further issue which we have just defined. It was the prisoner's right, however, notwithstanding the course of his counsel at the trial to have the jury instructed upon this feature of the case. We think, therefore, that there must be a new trial.\nThe position of a Court of Appeal in such circumstances appears to me to be well described in the decision of Lord Tucker speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Bullard v. The Queen8:\nIn the present case the fact that the jury rejected the defence of self-defence does not necessarily mean that the evidence for the defence was not of such kind that, even if not accepted in its entirety, it might not have left them in reasonable doubt whether the prosecution had discharged the onus which lay on them of proving that the killing was unprovoked. Their Lordships do not shrink from saying that such a result would have been improbable, but they cannot say it would have been impossible. ...Every man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given. To deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached. Their Lordships are accordingly of opinion that the verdict of guilty of murder cannot stand in this case.\nThe same considerations, in my opinion, apply wherever it can be said that any alternative defence could properly arise on the facts in a murder case but it must be borne in mind that when non-direction by a trial judge is made a ground of appeal it is to be considered subject to the conditions outlined by Fauteux J. in Kelsey v. The Queen9, where he said:\nThe allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance.\nI am satisfied that there is ample evidence in the record before us to justify the jury in finding that Willey was killed, that Workman had a motive for killing him and that he did in fact cause him to be lured to a partially-built house where he was killed. The circumstances are also undoubtedly consistent with Huculak having taken part in the murder, but the narrow question to be considered is whether it can be said with certainty that a rational jury, after being instructed in the manner now suggested, would necessarily have concluded, in fight of all the evidence, that these circumstances were entirely inconsistent with Huculak's participation being limited to assisting in the disposal of the body and the cleaning up of the mess occasioned by the murder.\nWhile it is appreciated that motive is not a necessary ingredient in the crime of murder, it nevertheless appears to me that the strong motive proved against Workman who devised and propounded the plan for killing Willey, and the complete absence of any evidence of motive for murder on the part of Huculak who heard the plan for the first time on the morning of the day the deed was done, place the two appellants in somewhat different categories and that this is something which can properly be taken into consideration in determining whether a separate defence should have been suggested to the jury by someone on Huculak's behalf. Save as hereinafter set forth, no attempt was made to sever the defences in any way.\nThe learned trial judge, during the course of his instructions to the jury as to the law, made the following statements:\n1. The onus is on the Crown to establish to you, to your satisfaction, first, that Frank Willey is dead; secondly, that Frank Willey came to his death as a result of the actions of these two accused or one of them, or either of them, and that when the act causing death was carried into effect it was carried into effect as part of a planned and premeditated scheme to kill Frank Willey.\n2. You must consider the evidence to determine the question of whether or not he came to his death through the criminal act or acts of the two accused in concert or either one of them by themselves.\n3. If, however, you are satisfied that the death came about, that it was done by the accused or one or either of them, yet you are not satisfied of the planning and deliberation but you were satisfied that the two accused or either of them intended to kill but without the planning and deliberation then the verdict would be of murder, not capital murder \u2026 What is more, and I should make it clear to you, that if in your consideration of the evidence there were doubts in your minds as to whether one or the other of the two accused has the essential elements proved against him but that you are satisfied that it has been proved against the other, you can only convict the one.\nIn my view, these very proper instructions to the jury cannot be considered as a substitute for an express direction as to the defence that Huculak was an accessory after the fact if it can be said, to use the language of Fauteux J. in the Kelsey case, supra, that there exists \"in the record some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality\" to such a defence. I think it must be accepted that the jury believed the evidence to the effect that on the morning of the 19th of April Workman proposed that Huculak and Osborne should join him in carrying out his plan to kill a man which Osborne refused to do, that Willey was lured to an empty house which two men were seen to be leaving at 9:45 p.m. in cars not dissimilar to Willey's Oldsmobile and Workman's rented Chevrolet, and that about 15 minutes after the murder had been committed Workman was telephoning to Osborne telling him that everything had gone \"haywire\" and asking him if he could \"get hold of Huculak\".\nIn my view, the question of whether or not a jury could properly have accepted the theory that the circumstances were not inconsistent with Huculak's involvement being limited to the role of an accessory after the fact must depend in large measure upon the weight to be attached to this telephone conversation, which was reported by Osborne as follows:\nQ. From whom did you get the call?\nA. From Mr. Workman.\nQ. The accused?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. What did he say?\nA. He asked me if I had seen Huculak.\nQ. What did you say?\nA. I said no.\nQ. Anything else?\nA. Oh, he said something about\u2014I asked him what was the matter and he said everything went haywire. I said you don't mean to tell me you went through with that thing and he said yes.\nQ. Did you\u2014did he ask or say anything more?\nA. He asked me if I would phone around and see if I could get hold of Mr. Huculak.\nQ. And what did you say?\nA. I said I would, yes.\nQ. Did you?\nA. No sir, I didn't.\n'The only comment on this conversation made to the jury by anyone was the following observation by the learned trial judge:\nNow one of the things that struck my mind as being a matter to consider in weighing the entire evidence of Osborne, and this is no reflection of his credibility, but on the basis of it being true one wonders why he gave evidence to the effect that at something like 11 o'clock at night on the evening of the 20th of April 1962 he had a phone call from Workman in which Workman said something in effect that things had gone haywire. He wanted to know where Huculak was and Workman asked him, he didn't go through with that thing and he said yes. The query comes to mind that if Workman and Huculak had been working in concert in carrying out this plan just why it would be that Workman wouldn't know where Huculak was at that time of night when it is remembered that they both ultimately came into Huculak's suite at something after 3 o'clock in the morning. It just leaves a query in one's mind.\nIt is obvious that in this passage where the learned judge said \"and Workman asked him, he didn't go through with that thing \u2026\" he meant \"and Osborne asked him \u2026\" and it is equally clear from the evidence that the call was at 10 o'clock on the 19th and not at 11 o'clock on the 20th.\nIt is now suggested that the trial judge should not have stopped at telling the jury that this evidence left \"a query\" in his mind but that he should have gone on to point out that it was open to them to reach the conclusion that Huculak was an \"accessory after the fact\" rather than a principal in the murder, if they took the view that the other evidence, viewed in the light of this telephone conversation, was not inconsistent with Huculak, having backed out of the plan, failing to turn up at the time of the murder and subsequently having been persuaded by Workman to help in the disposal of the body.\nThe question, of course, is whether some such instruction should have been given by the learned trial judge and whether if it had been given a rational jury could have concluded that the whole evidence viewed in this manner was not entirely inconsistent with Huculak being an accessory after the fact rather than a party to the murder.\nOsborne's story of the return of Huculak and Workman to the Huculak apartment at 3 o'clock, and of Huculak's wild statements about \"a guy's eyes sticking out of his head and something hanging out of the back of his head\" are fully reported in the reasons of my brother Judson. It will be noted that Huculak spoke of a body being in a shed somewhere and that they had to go out and bury it, and also that there was talk of going \"back\" to the scene of the crime, and a statement by Huculak which was not made until a day or two after the murder that they would have to go there to get \"some bandages or tape or something that flew off\" the end of the wrench when the person was hit. In order to find that there is any substance to the defence now suggested, it must be accepted that the muddy condition of Huculak's shoes at 3 o'clock in the morning and his description of the dead body which \"they had to go out and bury\" were not inconsistent with his role being limited to assisting the murderer to escape detection by getting rid of the body and the evidence of violence, and that his knowledge of the bandages or tape \"that flew off\" the wrench which he did not communicate to Osborne until much later was something which Workman had told him about when they were cleaning up at the scene of the crime. It is also necessary to accept Mr. Nugent's submission that the heel mark in the blood on the floor of the partially-built house which the police expert stated could have been made by Huculak's shoe might have been left when Huculak went there to clean up the mess.\nWhile I am bound to say that these suppositions are improbable this does not answer the question of whether the jury should have been instructed on this feature of the case. The question is by no means an easy one, but I have come to the conclusion that under all the circumstances such a direction should have been given in this case.\nI do not wish to be construed as saying that a trial judge, when addressing a jury in a criminal case, is under a duty to explore all the remotest and most fantastic possibilities but I do think that in a capital case where the two accused are jointly charged and no independent defence has been advanced to the jury on behalf of the one of them who has not been shown to have any motive for the crime then it does become necessary for the trial judge to scrutinize the circumstances with additional care in a conscious effort to insure that the jury has been informed of all defences for which any support can be found in the evidence. If under such circumstances some such defence should escape the notice of the trial judge then, in my view, the accused is entitled to a new trial.\nAlthough I am of opinion that it is extremely unlikely in the present case that the jury would have found Huculak to be an accessory rather than a principal, it cannot be said to be impossible. In this regard, I would adopt the language employed by Humphreys J. in Rex v. Roberts1, where he said:\nThe Court \u2026 cannot delve into the minds of the jury and say what they would have done if the issue had been left open to them.\nIn view of the above, I would allow the appeal of William Huculak, set aside his conviction and direct a new trial.\nAs to the case of Workman, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the evidence against him is overwhelming and I would dismiss his appeal.\nBoth appeals dismissed, Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting as to H's appeal.\nSolicitors for the appellant Huculak: Main, Dunne, Nugent & Forbes, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the appellant Workman: Lieber, Romaine & Koch, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Alberta.\n1 [1963] 1 C.C.C. 297.\n2 [1963] 1 C.C.C. 297.\n3 [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220, 226, 105 C.C.C. 97, 16 CR. 119.\n4 [1963] 1 C.C.C. 297.\n5 [1942] A.C. 1 at 7, 28 Cr.

Moore of the Royal Canada Mounted Police was served with the notice, but the affidavit did not state that Moore was the informant. Pursuant to an objection by the Crown, the District Court Judge refused to hear the appeal on the ground that he had no jurisdiction since he could not satisfy himself that the respondent had been served with the notice of appeal as required by s. 722 of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from that judgment. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nA similar situation presented itself in the case of the appellant McDonnell charged and found guilty of unlawfully selling liquor, where the informant was described as \"Lee J.

We think that the affidavit of service which was filed was sufficient, as the presumption would be that Roger E. Moore was the respondent, unless that fact was questioned, which it was not. Had it been doubtful whether Moore was the respondent, we are of opinion that the learned District Court Judge could and should have looked at the information which would have shown at once that Moore was in fact the respondent.\nWe would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal1 and of the District Court Judge and remit the case to the District Court Judge to be heard and disposed of.\nThe decisions of this Court, referred to in the reasons of the Court of Appeal, are not decisive of the point raised on this appeal.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1963: January 23; 1963: May 1.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nBills and notes\u2014Promissory note signed in blank\u2014Authority given holder to complete\u2014Holder in due course\u2014Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, ss. 31, 32.\nK told S, the manager of a car sales agency, that he wished to raise money on a truck of which he was the owner. S inquired of the plaintiff finance company, who informed him that K was not a suitable risk. S then suggested the use of an accommodation party and K asked the defendant M to let him use his name and credit to obtain a loan. The latter so agreed and signed a blank form of conditional sale contract and a blank form of promissory note which were presented by S to the plaintiff. The conditional sale contract purported to sell the truck for a price of $18,500, with a down payment of $6,500, leaving an unpaid cash balance of $12,000. Finance charges were added, bringing the total up to $14,326.96, which was to be paid in specified instalments. S filled in the first part of the document down to the $12,000 balance on the purchase price, and the rest of the document was filled in by the plaintiff who. also filled in the promissory note. The plaintiff discounted the note and paid S $8,000 by cheque and retained $4,000 in S's holdback account.\nAfter M had signed the documents, K found that he could raise the money from another finance company and thereupon told S to call off the deal with M and the plaintiff. However S fraudulently retained the moneys received from the plaintiff and concealed this fact from both M and K. In an action brought on the promissory note, the plaintiff obtained judgment at trial and this judgment was affirmed on appeal with an increase in amount. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.: The plaintiff took the note for full value and was a holder in due course. It was not open to this Court to draw inferences of a conditional delivery and failure to fill in the document in accordance with the authority given, in the face of the evidence and the unanimous findings which were at the basis of the judgments of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. Nor was there any substance in the defence that the documents were delivered conditionally upon the understanding that K would get the proceeds. This was the understanding, but it presupposed use of the documents as honest documents; S converted the money after they had been used for the purpose for which they were intended.\nPer Cartwright and Hall JJ., dissenting: While the matter was not spelled out in detail, in any one sentence in the evidence, a reading of all the record made it clear that M entered into the deal on the stated under- standing that (i) the liability to the plaintiff which he would be assuming would be secured by a hen on K\u2019s truck, (ii) that the proceeds of the deal would be paid to K, and (iii) that the total amount raised was to be $10,000. The third of these items was alone decisive of this appeal. The note was filled up for $14,326.96, which was the amount required to yield not $10,000 but $12,000. Accordingly, the note, not having been filled up strictly in accordance with the authority given (contrary to the requirements of s. 32 of the Bills of Exchange Act) but actually in contravention of that authority in respect of the amount to be raised, never became an enforceable note at all.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Riley J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nJ. W. K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. E. Redmond, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014Imperial Investment Corporation Ltd., which is a company engaged in financing the purchase of cars, sued the appellant John Mazur on a promissory note. The finance company obtained judgment at trial and this judgment was affirmed on appeal2 with an increase in amount. The maker of the note now appeals.\nThe defences submitted on behalf of the maker were (1) that the finance company was not a holder in due course, and (2) that the note was signed in blank, delivered subject to conditions which were not fulfilled, and was not filled in in accordance with the authority given.\nMazur signed the note as maker for the accommodation of one Karraja. Karraja was the owner of a 12-ton Mack tandem truck. Early in 1958, he told one James Sheddy, who operated a company known as A. C. Car Sales & Service Ltd., that he wished to raise money on this truck. Sheddy inquired of the finance company, who informed him that Karraja was not a suitable risk. It does not appear from the evidence what legal arrangements were to be made to put through this proposed loan. Sheddy then suggested the use of an accommodation party and Karraja asked Mazur to let him use his name and credit to obtain a loan. The finance company approved of Mazur as a suitable risk. Mazur then went to Sheddy's office where he signed a customer's statement giving particulars of his assets, a conditional sale contract and a promissory note. Mazur said, on discovery, that he did not recollect whether there was any writing on the conditional sale contract when he signed it. On cross-examination at the trial, he said there was nothing on it. As to the promissory note, he said at the trial that it was in blank, that he did not read it but just signed on the line for his signature. He did admit that he knew what he was signing. He was in the transport business himself and had had many dealings with finance companies.\nSheddy presented the conditional sale contract and the promissory note to the finance company. The conditional sale contract purports to sell the truck for a price of $18,500, with a down payment in cash of $6,500, leaving an unpaid cash balance of $12,000. The finance charges are then added, bringing the total up to $14,326.96, which was to be payable in 17 instalments of $797, and a final instalment of $777.96. I do not think that there is any doubt that Sheddy filled in the first part of the document down to the $12,000 balance on the purchase price, and that the rest of the document was filled in in the office of the finance company. The promissory note is filled in in typewriting in accordance with the conditional sale contract, and everything points to this having been done in the office of the finance company.\nMazur said in evidence:\nQ. In your discussions with Mr. Sheddy when you were at his office to sign whatever it was that you signed, did you tell Mr. Sheddy what you wanted him to do with those documents?\nA. No I did not.\nQ. Did he tell you what he was going to do with them; that is, did he tell you anything about where he would take them or what he would write on them, anything of that sort?\nA. No.\nOn discovery he had said:\nQ. That was not the question, the question was did you know that this transaction was set up to describe you as purchaser of this vehicle from A. C. Car Sales and Service?\nA. I will answer yes to that.\nNowhere in the record is there any evidence of any attempt to have these documents conform to reality. These documents appear to indicate a bona fide sale but the sale was entirely fictitious to the knowledge of all three participants in a scheme to induce the finance company to discount a note. The fraud of all three is obvious but, in addition, Sheddy kept the proceeds of the discount for his own use.\nThe learned trial judge spoke harshly of Sheddy and refused to believe his evidence when he said that the finance company knew that it was an accommodation transaction. But willingness to engage in this trickery is an equal reflection on the other two. The note was discounted on January 20, 1958. Mazur said that about three weeks later he received a booklet from the finance company showing the payments to be made and that he made the first three payments with money supplied by Sheddy. He knew exactly how the documents had been used when he received this booklet and he did nothing about it for three months. Then he went to Sheddy, who said that he would cancel the contract. Mazur then produced his copy of the contract, which contained all the details, including the finance charges, and Sheddy then wrote the word \"cancelled\" on Mazur's copy.\nKarraja had no further interest in the transaction. He did not sign anything and he had not parted with his truck. He says that he had told Sheddy that he was no longer interested in this transaction because he was making arrangements to get the money elsewhere. Sheddy says that he was only told this after the transaction had gone through. There is no evidence that Karraja ever communicated with Mazur to tell him before the documents were used to get them back because they were not needed. There is evidence from Sheddy that his company had no money to acquire the truck from Karraja and it is to be remembered that he had a substantial equity in his truck. It is clear that he never intended to part with it.\nThe learned trial judge made very clear findings of fact which, in my respectful opinion, are fully supported by the evidence. He said3:\nThe evidence of the defendant was that he gave no instructions to Sheddy as to what should be done with the note, nor did Sheddy tell him what was to be done with the note. There is no evidence that anything which may have passed between Sheddy and Karraja at the time of execu- tion of the documents or later was communicated to Mazur, and there is every indication that it was not. Therefore, the prima facie authority to complete the note given by sec. 31 must operate in this case.\nThe Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion4:\nI have given consideration to the question of whether it was established by the filling in of material parts of the conditional sale agreement by the plaintiff that the conditional sale agreement became void to the knowledge of the plaintiff. If it did so become void to the knowledge of the plaintiff, it would be necessary to consider the application of the decision in the Supreme Court of Canada in Traders Finance Corp. v. Casselman, 22 D.L.R. (2d) 177, [1960] S.C.R. 242, in the facts of this case to the question of whether the promissory note is enforceable. I have considered such cases as Tayler v. Great Indian Peninsula R. Co. (1859), 4 De G. & J. 559, 45 E.R. 217; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Paris v. Walker et al. (1885), 11 App. Cas. 20; Swan v. North British Australasian Co. (1863), 2 H. & C. 175, 159 E.R. 73; and Wilson & Meeson v. Pickering, [1946]. 1 K.B. 423. I have reached the conclusion that the defendant impliedly authorized the filling in of the conditional sale agreement for the purpose of assisting in the raising of money for Karraja, and that therefore it cannot be found that that agreement became void to the knowledge of the plaintiff by reason of the filling in of particulars which the defendant must have known would have to be filled in.\nNowhere can I find that these conclusions lack foundation and that Mazur's signature of the documents was conditional upon the finance company having a lien on the truck and that the total net amount was to be limited to $10,000. The figure of $10,000 was mentioned, according to Karraja, in his first conversation with Sheddy. Sheddy says that the figure mentioned was $10,000 or $12,000. Mazur said that he understood that the figure was $10,000 but, against this, he was in possession of the completed contract and the booklet of payments showing that the figure was $12,000 and he made no protest.\nI do not think that it is open to this Court to draw inferences of a conditional delivery and failure to fill in the document in accordance with the authority given in the face of this evidence and the unanimous findings which are at the basis of the judgments of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. Nor is there any substance in the defence that the documents were delivered conditionally upon the understanding that Karraja would get the proceeds. Of course this was the understanding but it presupposes use of the documents as honest documents. Sheddy converted the money after they had been used for the purpose for which they were intended. The finance company took this note for full value. It paid Sheddy $8,000 by cheque and retained $4,000 in Sheddy's account, called a holdback account. At the time of the transaction, Sheddy was overdrawn in this account by $1,362.02. After the $4,000 was credited, he had a credit balance of $2,637.98.\nMuch of the evidence at trial was directed to show that the finance company did not take this note in good faith because it knew that the transaction was fictitious or had sufficient knowledge of the facts to bring home to it knowledge of its nature. With a note taken for full value and the rejection of Sheddy's evidence, any attack on the judgment on this ground must fail.\nThe judgment of the trial judge awarded the finance company only $5,600, namely, $8,000 less the 3 payments of $800 made. The plaintiff cross-appealed and asked that its judgment be increased to $9,600. This cross-appeal was allowed and, in my opinion, correctly. Why the plaintiff did not cross-appeal for judgment for the face value of the note, namely, $14,326.96 less the 3 payments, I do not know.\nThe plaintiff is a holder in due course of this note. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta5 dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Riley J. and allowing a cross-appeal whereby the judgment was increased from $5,600 to $9,600 together with interest and costs.\nThe facts are not complicated. The learned trial judge has stated that Sheddy is unworthy of belief, but he has made no similar observation as to either Mazur or Karraja and, after a careful perusal of the whole record, I am unable to find any reason that the evidence of these two witnesses where it is uncontradicted, unshaken on cross-examination and not inherently improbable should not be acted on.\nIn January 1958, one Karraja approached James Sheddy, the manager of A. C. Car Sales & Service Ltd. seeking to borrow $10,000 on a 12-ton truck owned by Karraja. Sheddy asked the respondent whether it would make the advance requested and, after the respondent had made some investigation as to the credit of Karraja, he was advised that it would not. Sheddy suggested to Karraja that if he knew anyone whose credit rating was good and who was willing to assist him the matter could be arranged.\nKarraja then asked the appellant if he would allow his name to be used to enable Karraja to obtain the advance and the appellant consented.\nFollowing this Mazur and Karraja went together to Sheddy's office. Karraja stated that he wanted $10,000 \"to himself\", that is to say, clear after payment of financing and other charges.\nIt was agreed that Sheddy would prepare a conditional sale agreement under the terms of which A. C. Car Sales & Service Ltd. would sell Karraja's truck to Mazur. Mazur would sign this agreement as purchaser and would also sign a promissory note for the balance due under the agreement. The conditional sale agreement and the note would be transferred to the respondent and it would make the necessary advance to A. C. Car Sales & Service Ltd. which in turn would pay it over to Karraja. Both Mazur and Karraja were familiar with the practice of purchasing trucks under conditional sale agreement.\nThere was nothing either fraudulent or unlawful in this proposal and it could have been carried out by Karraja transferring the title to his truck to A. C. Car Sales and by that company, in turn, making the sale to Mazur, it being agreed as between Mazur and Karraja that Mazur would not in fact be called upon to pay as the payments would be made by Karraja. But for the other arrangement made by Karraja, to be referred to later, there is no reason to suppose that it would not have been carried out.\nWhile the matter is not spelled out in detail, in any one sentence in the evidence, a reading of all the record appears to me to make it clear that Mazur entered into the deal on the stated understanding that (i) the liability to the respondent which he would be assuming would be secured by a lien on Karraja's truck, (ii) that the proceeds of the deal would be paid to Karraja, and (iii) that the total net amount raised was to be $10,000. While each of these three items was no doubt of importance to Mazur it is the third which, in my opinion, is decisive of this appeal and which alone requires further consideration.\nOn this understanding Mazur signed a printed form of conditional sale agreement and a printed form of promissory note. I agree with the finding of Smith C.J.A. that:\nIt seems probable that the conditional sale agreement and the promissory note were entirely blank when they were signed by Mazur.\nOn the argument before us it was conceded that the promissory note was signed in blank and that all the blanks were later filled up by employees of the respondent.\nSheddy inserted in the form of conditional sale agreement which Mazur had signed the description of the truck, a figure of $18,500 as sale price, a figure of $6,500 as cash payment and an apparent unpaid cash price balance of $12,000.\nSheddy then took the documents to the respondent.\nThe respondent inserted in the conditional sale agreement the cost of insurance, the registration fee and the \"finance charge\" and added these to the unpaid cash price balance, making a total of $14,326.96. The respondent also filled in blanks so as to provide for payment of seventeen instalments of $797 each and a final instalment of $777.97, the first being payable on February 20, 1958, and the remainder on the 20th of each successive month. In the promissory note the respondent filled in $14,326.96 as the sum payable, and inserted the same dates and amounts of instalments.\nA. C. Car Sales Ltd. assigned the conditional sale agreement and endorsed the promissory note to the respondent which then issued a cheque to A. C. Car Sales & Service Ltd. for $8,000 and placed $4,000 to its credit in a \"holdback\" account.\nWhen he had been advised by Sheddy that the respondent would not make the advance to him Karraja had commenced negotiations with another finance company and after Mazur had signed the forms referred to above Karraja found that this company would advance $10,000 on his truck. He thereupon told Sheddy to call off the deal with Mazur and the respondent. Sheddy says that at this time, he had already turned over the documents to the respondent and received the $8,000; whether or not this is so does not appear to me to be of importance. Sheddy, as has been found, fraudulently retained the moneys received from the respondent and concealed this fact from both Mazur and Karraja.\nThe action is brought on the promissory note. It was blank in all material particulars when received by the respondent and the blanks were filled in by the respondent. In my view, the respondent can succeed in the action only if it was entitled to fill in these blanks under ss. 31 and 32 of the Bills of Exchange Act, which read as follows:\n31. Where a simple signature on a blank paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a prima facie authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount, using the signature for that of the drawer or acceptor, or an endorser; and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a prima facie authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.\n32. (1) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given; but where any such instrument, after completion, is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.\n(2) Reasonable time within the meaning of this section is a question of fact.\nIt is clear that Mazur placed his signature on the blank printed form of note and delivered it to Sheddy in order that it might be converted into a promissory note. It is also clear that Mazur became a party to the note prior to its completion and consequently he is liable on it only if it was filled up within a reasonable time and \"strictly in accordance with the authority given\". It was, no doubt, filled up within a reasonable time but it seems to me that the authority given by Mazur to Sheddy was limited to filling it up (and also filling up the conditional sale agreement which Mazur had signed in blank) for such amount as was necessary to yield $10,000 to Karraja. In fact the note was filled up for $14,326.96, which was the amount required to yield not $10,000 but $12,000.\nThe note, not having been filled up strictly in accordance with the authority given but actually in contravention thereof in the respect just mentioned, never became an enforceable note at all. The situation would, of course, have been different if Sheddy had filled that note up and then negotiated it to the respondent. Had that happened, the finding of the learned trial judge concurred in by the Court of Appeal that, whether or not it was negligent, the respondent acted honestly and took the note in good faith and for value, would have entitled it to succeed.\nIn the case at bar, however, the respondent itself filled up the note. In doing so, I will assume that it was acting honestly in the sense that, relying on Sheddy, it believed that it was entitled to fill up the note as it did but this does not assist it when, in fact, the note was filled up in a manner which was not in accordance with the authority given by Mazur.\nI do not find it necessary to review the authorities which were discussed in the full and helpful arguments addressed to us by both counsel. Once it is established that all the blanks in the note were filled up by the respondent itself the only question requiring decision is whether they were filled up strictly in accordance with the authority given. If there has been a de facto exceeding of the authority that is an end of the matter. Authority to fill up a note for the amount of $10,000 plus incidental charges, is exceeded when the note is filled up for the amount of $12,000 plus incidental charges.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the judgments below set aside and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nHall J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts have been set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright which I have had the advantage of reading and with which judgment I concur. However, I would like to comment on an important aspect of the case which I think influenced the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal and was absent in this Court, and which, accepting the findings of the learned trial judge as to credibility, brings me to a conclusion opposite to that reached in the Courts below. The crucial fact in this case, in my judgment, is that the promissory note sued on bore only the signature of the appellant, Mazur, when it came into the possession of the respondent. It is obvious from reading the judgment of Riley J. that he predicated his finding that the respondent became the holder in due course of the note upon the view that the appellant had not satisfied the onus of proving that the note was not complete and regular on its face when delivered to the respondent, for he says in part:\nThe Defendant has not satisfied the onus of proving that the note was not complete and regular on its face when delivered to the Plaintiff. The only evidence of the condition of the note when delivered to the Plaintiff is that of Sheddy, who says that he did not do the typewriting. Sheddy was a most unsatisfactory witness. In cross-examination he admitted retaining the moneys advanced by the Plaintiff although he had promised Karraja that he would obtain money for him. He also admitted numerous other falsehoods, including his statements to Karraja that he would cancel the arrangement, his promise to Mazur that he would cancel the arrangement, along with numerous other similar representations. These admissions establish that Sheddy was not a credible witness, that his evidence should not be believed, and that therefore in the absence of evidence satisfying the court that the note was not complete and regular on the face of it when delivered to the Plaintiff, the Defendant has failed to satisfy the onus and the Plaintiff must be found to be a holder in due course of the note entitled to recover upon it.\nThere was still an element of uncertainty on this very point when the case was before the Court of Appeal which the Chief Justice of Alberta dealt with as follows:\nIt seems probable that the conditional sale agreement and the promissory note were entirely blank when they were signed by Mazur.\nOn the argument before this Court, it was conceded that the document bore only the signature of the appellant when it came into the possession of the respondent. It is perhaps because this outright admission was not made to Riley J. and to the Court of Appeal that both Riley J. and the Chief Justice of Alberta relied so strongly on s. 31 of the Bills of Exchange Act and not on s. 32(1) which reads:\n32. (1) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given; but where any such instrument, after completion, is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.\n(The italics are mine.)\nWhile Riley J. disbelieved Sheddy and said that Sheddy was not a credible witness, he made no adverse findings as to the credibility of Karraja or the appellant. Their evidence establishes, as my brother Cartwright has pointed out, that when the appellant put his signature on the blank promissory note form he did so on certain conditions, one of those being that a loan to yield $10,000 to Karraja was to be obtained. The note was actually filled in to yield $12,000 and not $10,000 and therefore not strictly in accordance with the authority given Riley J. appears to have dealt with the appellant as an innocent party as well as the respondent. He quotes from London and South Western Bank v. Wentworth6:\nThis language [i.e., the term 'estoppel'] might be not improperly applied to the present case, but, for our own part, we should prefer not to use the word 'estoppel', which seems to imply that a person by his conduct is excluded from showing what are the true facts, but rather to say that the question is whether, when all the facts are admitted, the acceptor is not liable upon the well-known principle that where one of two innocent persons must suffer from the fraud of a third, the loss should be borne by him who enabled the third person to commit the fraud.\nindicating he did not consider the appellant in the same category as Sheddy or a party to Sheddy's fraud.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Shortreed, Short-reed, Stainton & Enright, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Bishop, McKenzie, Jackson, Latta, Redmond & Johnson, Edmonton.\n1 (1962), 39 W.W.R. 149, 33 D.L.R.

The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and directed a new trial. The Crown sought leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law: \"Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury as to the theory of the defence\". The accused opposed the motion on the ground, inter alia, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was based on two separate and distinct grounds, the first of which did not raise a question of law alone and that, therefore, this Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal upon it.\nHeld: The application for leave to appeal should be granted.\nWhere a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be dismissed. But in view of the state of the authorities as to whether this Court will entertain appeals based on the ground of the failure of the trial judge to deal adequately with the evidence in his charge to the jury, the point raised here should be dealt with by the Court constituted to hear an appeal rather than on an application for leave. Assuming therefore, for the purposes of this application, that both of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal proceeded raised points of law as to which this Court has jurisdiction, leave to appeal should be granted. However, this will not prevent the accused from urging her objection at the hearing of the appeal.\nAPPLICATION by the Crown for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario quashing the conviction of the accused and ordering a new trial. Application granted.\nP. Milligan, Q.C., for the applicant.\nG. A. Martin, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014Adrienne Laroche was convicted before His Honour Judge Macdonald and a jury on February 16, 1962, on an indictment charging that she did between the 17th day of September, 1956 and the 17th day of May, 1960, at the Town of Eastview, in the County of Carleton, unlawfully convert to her own use money to the amount of $10,790.52, the property of the Municipal Corporation of the Town of Eastview and did thereby steal the same, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada.\nShe appealed to the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds, some of which that Court found it unnecessary to discuss. The Court of Appeal by a unanimous judgment delivered by McLennan J.A. allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.\nThe Crown seeks leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law:\nWhether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury as to the theory of the defence. The question as stated appears to be one of law but counsel for the respondent opposes the motion on the ground, inter alia, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was based upon two separate and distinct grounds which he summarizes as follows:\n(i) That the trial was unsatisfactory because the trial judge, while he put the theory of the defence to the jury, did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently comprehensive way.\n(ii) That the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they ought to acquit if the accused honestly thought she was 'obliged' to give the money to the Mayor and thereby conveyed to the jury the impression that they should acquit only if they found the accused believed she was under a legal compulsion to obey the Mayor's orders.\nHe submits that the first of these does not raise a question of law alone and that this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal upon it.\nIt is clear from the judgment of this Court in The Queen v. Warner1, that where a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be dismissed.\nIn support of his submission that the first of the two grounds summarized above does not raise a question of law alone, Mr. Martin relies on R. v. Bateman2, particularly at 207 and R. v. Curlett3. Both of these judgments appear to lend considerable support to Mr. Martin's argument but neither of them is binding on us. The first is that of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England composed of Channell, Jelf and Bray, JJ. The second is a majority decision of the Court of Appeal for Alberta, Harvey C.J.A., Ewing and McGillivray JJ.A. being the majority and Clarke and Lunney JJ.A. dissenting. Both cases appear to hold that whether there has been nondirection or misdirection by the trial judge in dealing with the evidence is not a question of law alone. In the latter case Harvey C.J.A. points out that while this Court appears to have decided Brooks v. R.4 as if the failure to make adequate reference to an item of importance in the evidence raised a question of law appealable to this Court, the point was not raised or discussed. There are, however, a number of cases in which this Court has entertained appeals based on the ground of the failure of the trial judge to deal adequately with the evidence in his charge to the jury. As examples, Mr. Milligan referred us not only to the Brooks case but also to Azoulay v. The Queen5 and Kelsey v. The Queen6.\nThe importance of the point raised by Mr. Martin is obvious; if he were clearly right it would, of course, be our duty to refuse leave, but in view of the state of the authorities we think the point should be dealt with by the Court constituted to hear an appeal rather than on an application for leave.\nAssuming for the purposes of this application that both of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal proceeded raise points of law as to which this Court has jurisdiction we are all of opinion that leave ought to be granted. It is clear from the decision in Warner's case that the fact of our having granted leave will not prevent Mr. Martin urging his objection before the Court on the hearing of the appeal.\nLeave to appeal on the question set out in the notice of motion is granted.\nApplication granted.\nSolicitor for the applicant: W.

By a deed of sale, the plaintiffs sold their land and buildings to the predecessors in title of the defendants. The right to use part of the land and all the buildings as well as to remove the buildings until full payment of the purchase price was reserved to the plaintiffs. Anticipating the probable expropriation of the property by the city, clause 7 stipulated that any compensation paid for the expropriation of \"ladite terre\" should be remitted to the plaintiffs and applied to reduce the balance due on the purchase price. The city expropriated part of the property including the buildings and deposited the compensation into court. The plaintiffs applied to the Superior Court to have the amount paid to them as creditors secured by hypothec and privilege of bailleurs de fonds. The Court so ordered on condition that the defendants be credited for it. The plaintiffs appealed upon the ground that the defendants were not entitled to be credited with the part of the indemnity covering the value of the buildings. The appeal was dismissed and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nClause 7 was inserted in the deed having in mind an expropriation which was imminent, and the. word \"terre\" as used was broad enough to include both land and buildings. That clause was not necessary to protect the plaintiff's rights as privileged creditors. It was intended to settle in advance that the defendants were to be entitled to receive credit on account of the balance of the purchase price for the full amount of the prospective indemnity.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Tellier J. Appeal dismissed.\nThomas Vien, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nAlfred Tourigny, Q.C., and Henri-Paul Lemay, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014On October 14, 1958, by deed before Roch-A. Bergeron, notary, appellant sold a farm property\u2014being part of original lot no. 481 on the Official Plan and Book of Reference of the Parish of Longue-Pointe\u2014with the buildings thereon erected, to Federal Construction Limited and Huron Investment Corporation, predecessors in title of the respondents. The price of sale was $500,000 of which $200,000 was paid in cash, the balance of $300,000 payable on or before October 15, 1963, being secured by hypothec and privilege of bailleur de fonds. Under the terms of the said deed of sale appellants reserved the right to continue to occupy the buildings and to cultivate the land upon the following conditions:\nCONDITIONS SPECIALES:\nLes vendeurs se r\u00e9servent le droit de continuer \u00e0 habiter les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ladite terre et de s'en servir de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 cultiver ladite terre, aux conditions suivantes, savoir:\n1. Les vendeurs continueront d'occuper tous les b\u00e2timents mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus, avec une lisi\u00e8re de vingt-cinq pieds (25') de terrain tout autour d'iceux, ainsi que trois (3) arpents en arri\u00e8re de ces b\u00e2tisses, tant et aussi longtemps que le solde du prix de vente mentionn\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, de m\u00eame que les int\u00e9r\u00eats;\n2. Les vendeurs pourront cultiver le r\u00e9sidu de ladite terre tant que les acqu\u00e9reurs n'en auront pas besoin pour les fins de leur exploitation.\n* * *\n5. Il est entendu entre les parties que les acqu\u00e9reurs pourront payer le solde du prix de vente avec int\u00e9r\u00eats en aucun temps; elles devront, cependant, donner aux vendeurs un avis de six mois, par lettre recommand\u00e9e, avant d'exiger de ces derniers qu'ils lib\u00e8rent ladite terre, mais ces derniers auront alors le droit d'enlever \u00e0 leurs frais, toutes les b\u00e2tisses et les transporter ailleurs s'ils le jugent \u00e0 propos, sans indemnit\u00e9 de part et d'autre;\n6.

Il est \u00e0 la connaissance des parties aux pr\u00e9sentes que la terre cidessus vendue a front sur le Boulevard M\u00e9tropolitain, traversant l'\u00cele de Montr\u00e9al, actuellement en construction, et qu'il est probable qu'une partie de ladite terre sera expropri\u00e9e pour les fins dudit Boulevard M\u00e9tropolitain; dans ce cas, toute somme d'argent pay\u00e9e aux vendeurs ou aux acqu\u00e9reurs en compensation de l'expropriation de partie de ladite terre devra \u00eatre remise aux vendeurs et par eux appliqu\u00e9e en r\u00e9duction de tout solde du prix de vente alors d\u00fb.\nIn August 1959 a portion of the said property then owned by respondents\u2014which included the part upon which the buildings were erected\u2014was in fact expropriated by the Montreal Metropolitan Corporation for the extension of the Metropolitan Boulevard. Proceedings were taken before the Public Service Board of the Province of Quebec to fix the compensation payable and by a report dated July 21, 1960, deposited August 15, 1960, while the Montreal Metropolitan Corporation, the Public Service Board awarded compensation in the amount of $173,204.16. That award was homologated by a judgment of the Superior Court on September 8, 1960, and on the same date the amount awarded was deposited into Court to be paid \u00e0 qui de droit.\nOn September 22, 1960, appellants filed a petition in the Superior Court asking for an order that the amount deposited in Court be paid to them as creditors secured by hypothec and privilege of bailleurs de fonds.\nOn October 26, 1960, judgment was rendered by Tellier J. granting the appellants' petition, the operative part of that judgment being as follows:\nDECRETE que les requ\u00e9rants Robin et Bovet ont droit de retirer en entier le montant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la Corporation de Montr\u00e9al M\u00e9tropolitain, soit une somme de $173,204.16, comprenant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t pr\u00e9liminaire effectu\u00e9 le 19 octobre 1959, lequel montant devra \u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9sents mis-en-cause pour valoir sur le prix de vente, en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eat en vertu de l'acte du 14 octobre 1958; tel paiement \u00e9quivaudra \u00e0 quittance par les requ\u00e9rants aux mis-en-cause, sur le prix de vente, mais sujet \u00e0 la limitation ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue des lib\u00e9rations hypoth\u00e9caires conventionnelles des parties, suivant l'acte du 14 octobre 1958; DECRETE que sur paiement de la susdite somme, main-lev\u00e9e d'hypoth\u00e8que sur l'immeuble concern\u00e9 devra \u00eatre donn\u00e9e par et en faveur des parties susdites, mais seulement sur la partie, l'\u00e9tendue et pour les valeurs mentionn\u00e9es et pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 4 des \u00abConditions Sp\u00e9ciales\u00bb de l'acte du 14 octobre 1958 dans l'occurrence main-lev\u00e9e hypoth\u00e9caire jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence d'une somme de $125,000 et sur les parties de l'immeuble mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la description technique et au plan pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Laurent C.

The appeal was dismissed, Badeaux J. dissenting. From that judgment appeal was taken to this Court.\nThe majority opinion in the Court below was delivered by Montgomery J. with whom Casey, Hyde and Taschereau JJ. concurred. I am in agreement with his reasons and conclusions and there is very little that I can usefully add to them. Appellants sold the property with all the buildings erected thereon, although reserving certain temporary rights of use and occupation, as provided in the special conditions to which I have referred. Moreover the expropriation award contained the following provision:\nL'expropri\u00e9 ou ses ayants droit pourra ou pourront d\u00e9m\u00e9nager les constructions \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur l'une ou l'autre des emprises ou les d\u00e9molir et en conserver les mat\u00e9riaux pourvu que le terrain expropri\u00e9 soit lib\u00e9r\u00e9 du tout dans un d\u00e9lai de SIX (6) mois de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nIt is clear that special condition 7 was inserted in the deed of sale having in mind an expropriation which was imminent, and the word \"terre\" as used in the said clause is broad enough to include both land and buildings. The said condition was not necessary in order to protect appellants' rights as privileged creditors and I agree with the opinion of the majority in the Court below that it was intended to settle in advance that the purchasers were to be entitled to receive credit on account of the balance of purchase price for the full amount of the prospective indemnity.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Vien, Par\u00e9, Ferland, Barbeau & Pelletier, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendants, respondents: Lemay, Martel, Poulin & Corbeil, Montreal.\n1 [1962] Que.

The respondent, an elderly businessman, was principally occupied as a soap manufacturer. Between 1944 and 1954 he purchased 309 mortgages at a discount from mortgages offered to him by various real estate agents. The mortgages so purchased were first mortgages but were regarded as substandard by mortgage companies; they were generally for amounts ranging from $1,500 to $3,000 and for a term of five to eight years. In the years 1946 to 1954 the respondent realized discounts on 113 of these mortgages which either matured or were paid off during that period. The discounts thus realized were assessed as income by the Minister. The Exchequer Court in dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the Tax Appeal Board held (a) that the discounts realized in the years 1946 to 1948 were not profits from a trade or business within s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, and (b) that the discounts realized in the years 1949 to 1954 were not profits from a business within the meaning of that term as defined in the Income Tax Act. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIt was quite impossible to distinguish this case, even on the facts, from those in Scott v. Minister of National Revenue, [1963] S.C.R. 223. The respondent was engaged in the highly speculative business of purchasing mortgages at a discount and holding them to maturity in order to realize the maximum amount of profit out of the transaction. The discounts realized by him were taxable income since they were profits or gains from a trade or business within the meaning of s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, or ss. 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nArgue v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] S.C.R. 467, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming with a variation a judgment of the Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and G. Ainslie, for the appellant.\nK. Eaton and B. Crane, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The Minister of National Revenue appeals from the judgment of the Exchequer Court2, which held (a) that certain discounts realized in the years 1946 to 1948 on the purchase of mortgages were not profits from a trade or business within s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, and (b) that similar discounts realized in the years 1949 to 1954 were not profits from a business within the meaning of that term as defined in the Income Tax Act. It is the unanimous opinion of the Court that these receipts were taxable under the appropriate legislation.\nAs we are prepared on the facts, which are not disputed, to draw inferences different from those of the learned trial judge, it is necessary to state them in brief outline. The Minister, in making the re-assessment for the taxation years under appeal, added to the respondent's income the following amounts in respect of discounts realized by the respondent on certain mortgages and agreements for sale which he had purchased. These realized discounts were:\n1946 .................................................................................. $ 750.00\n1947 .................................................................................. 968.23\n1948 .................................................................................. 1,523.17\n1949 .................................................................................. 711.73\n1950 .................................................................................. 1,397.00\n1951 .................................................................................. 5,798.11\n1952 .................................................................................. 8,212.72\n1953 .................................................................................. 8,703.35\n1954 .................................................................................. 10,667.67\n$ 38,731.98\nAt the time of the hearing of the appeal, the respondent was 83 years of age. He had had a long and varied business career. He had also held two offices in the Civil Service of the Province of British Columbia, one of which was that of Official Administrator for the County of Vancouver, which he held from 1925 to 1929. In the mid-thirties he went into the business of manufacturing soap and he was carrying on that business at the time of the appeal.\nIn 1944 the respondent began to purchase substandard mortgages at a discount. The following table shows by years the number of mortgages purchased at a discount between 1944 and 1954, and the aggregate of the amounts owing under the terms of the mortgages at the time they were acquired by the respondent:\nYear Number Purchase Price Amount Owing\n1944 ................... 3 $ 4,144.50 $ 4,860.00\n1945 ................... 1 914.00 975.00\n1946 ................... 23 46,577.66 51,592.02\n1947 ................... 25 50,169.83 62,529.97\n1948 ................... 22 9,063.70 60,743.57\n1949 ................... 30 72,096.06 85,423.63\n1950 ................... 31 78,922.09 96,787.38\n1951 ................... 36 89,790.68 115,802.80\n1952 ................... 60 170,068.41 212,590.07\n1953 ................... 34 115,835.07 148,365.76\n1954 ................... 44 148,394.86 212,714.51\n309 $ 825,976.86 $ 1,053,220.78 (*)\n(*) The aggregate of the fourth column in the above table is, in fact, $1,052,384.71, but the respondent conceded that the figure of Sl,053,220.78, arrived at by the appellant's assessors was the correct figure. Of the 309 mortgages acquired during the period between 1944 and 1954, 113 either matured or were paid off and the respondent realized discounts in the sum of $38,731.98. In addition to these 113 mortgages, three or four additional mortgages in respect of which no discounts had been taken either matured or were paid off.\nAt the end of the respondent's 1954 taxation year, 196 of the 309 mortgages were still current and the amount of the unrealized discounts was $171,000, and between 1954 and the date of the trial before the Exchequer Court, the bulk of the discounts in relation to these mortgages had been realized by the respondent.\nBetween 1954 and the date of the trial before the Exchequer Court, the respondent was still as actively engaged in obtaining further mortgages as he had been in the earlier years.\nAll of the mortgages which had been acquired at a discount were first mortgages but were regarded as substandard, since in most cases the principal amount secured represented up to two-thirds of the value of the property, instead of 45 per cent of the sale value which, according to the respondent's evidence, was the amount normally secured under a conventional first mortgage. It was the respondent's view that to the extent that the principal amount exceeded 45 per cent of the value of the property mortgaged, there was a \"second morgage factor\" or a risk similar to that attaching to a second mortgage. All of the 309 mortgages acquired by the respondent were mortgages on which the principal repayable was in excess of 50 per cent of the value of the property mortgaged.\nThe sources of the funds with which the respondent acquired these mortgages were the profits from the soap business, the sale in the late forties and fifties of certain assets owned by him in Eastern Canada and the payments being received by him on the existing mortgages.\nMost of the mortgages acquired by the respondent were mortgages on small old-fashioned houses with fir floors and old-fashioned plumbing, located in South Vancouver and Burnaby. The mortgages were generally for amounts ranging from $1,500 to $3,000 and for a term of five to eight years. They bore the current rate of interest payable on first mortgages, and provided for monthly payments of between $30 to $45 per month on account of interest and principal.\nGenerally, the respondent, before acquiring a mortgage, would insist on the purchaser-mortgagor having an equity in the property equivalent to one-third of its value and would acquire these mortgages at a discount of 15 per cent.\nThe mortgages in question were all selected by the respondent from those offered to him by various real estate agents in whom he had reasonable confidence and who were constantly canvassing him to acquire these mortgages. Originally, the respondent purchased most of the mortgages from two real estate firms, but as time went on he dealt with up to ten or twelve real estate firms. Persons acting for vendors in the sale of property knew that the respondent was a person interested in purchasing substandard mortgages. The respondent never bargained over the amount of the discount; he either accepted or rejected the offer made by the real estate agent.\nDuring the years in question, the respondent was principally occupied in carrying on his business as a soap manufacturer. However, he gave evidence to the effect that at all relevant times, the interest and discounts realized from the mortgages were as great as his profits from the soap business.\nThe learned trial judge found:\n\u2026 In my view there is nothing in the case which characterizes what the respondnet did as anything but mere investment of funds which he had available for investment.\n\u2026 it would I think be unrealistic to look upon what he did as a course of conduct or scheme directed primarily to the making of profit by realizing such discounts. The interest return was of greater importance and the most that could be said on this score is that his object was to get both \u2026\n\u2026 That these mortgages as a class were in fact good securities is demonstrated by the result and though each involved some risk and at that possibly a somewhat greater risk than the types in which the mortgage companies were interested, I see nothing so unusual about them as to suggest that the respondent chose them in the course of a gamble or adventure looking to the realization of a speculative profit.\nIn our opinion there was error in the judgment of the learned trial judge in failing to find on the evidence which I have outlined that the respondent had engaged in the highly speculative business of purchasing mortgages at a discount and holding them to maturity in order to realize the maximum amount of profit out of the transaction, and in failing to find that the discounts realized were taxable income since they were profits or gains from a trade or business within the meaning of s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, or ss. 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nIt is quite impossible to distinguish this case, even on the facts, from those in Scott v. Minister of National Revenue3. We are also of the opinion that Argue v. Minister of National Revenue4 is in no way relevant to the issues raised in the present appeal. The problem in Argue was whether what was admittedly interest earned on long-term real estate mortgages and agreements could be regarded as income derived from the carrying on of a money-lending business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 (Can.), c. 32. There was no evidence in Argue that the mortgages acquired were risky securities and there was no issue raised concerning either discounts or bonuses. The Court was concerned exclusively with money paid to Argue as interest. The Court simply held that there was no evidence which would justify the finding that Argue was carrying on business as a money-lender\u2014no evidence which would serve to convert what was admittedly interest received from securities into profits from a business.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Exchequer Court reversed with costs and the re-assessments referred back to the Minister in order to adjust the amount of the discounts realized and included in the respondent's income in accordance with the table of discounts set out above and totalling $38,731.98, counsel having agreed upon these amounts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Wedlake (Respondent) Respondent.\n1963: March 26; 1963: May 1.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContracts\u2014Partnership agreement\u2014Annual payments by one partner in reduction of capital account of other partner\u2014Essentials of an agreement for sale lacking\u2014Dissolution of partnership\u2014Distribution of Assets\u2014The Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 288, s. 44.\nThe respondent and E who carried on business together, in partnership, as hardware merchants, entered into an agreement which terminated that partnership and was intended to form a limited partnership for the continued operation of their business. It was provided in the agreement that E would contribute $90,000 to the capital of the partnership, that the respondent would pay interest on this amount, or on such capital of E as remained in the partnership from time to time, and that the respondent would also make annual payments towards the purchase of E\u2019s share. It was further provided that in the event of E\u2019s death his personal representatives would continue the partnership. E died in 1955 and the partnership was continued by his executors (the appellants) and the respondent until 1961, when an agreement was made between the respondent and the appellants for the dissolution of the partnership and liquidation of the partnership assets by the respondent. After satisfying all outstanding liabilities, there remained on hand the sum of $36,608.99.\nThe appellants applied to the Court for a judgment declaring their rights in connection with this sum and also the liability of the respondent to the appellants. Their contention was that, under the terms of the agreement, the respondent had agreed to purchase from E his interest in the partnership for $90,000 of which $53,000 still remained unpaid. They claimed, therefore, that they were entitled to all the moneys realized from the partnership assets and also a personal judgment against the respondent for the amount of the difference between that amount and $53,000. Judgment on the motion was given in favour of the appellants but, on appeal, this decision was reversed. An appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe partnership agreement lacked the essential ingredients of an agreement for sale. The essential purpose of the agreement was to provide for a partnership, for the terms governing the partnership relation and the operation of the partnership. It provided for the gradual reduction by the respondent of the capital account to E\u2019s credit during the continuance of the partnership. There was no outright covenant by the respondent, without any reservation or limitation, to buy E\u2019s capital interest. The respondent did no more than to undertake, while the partnership lasted, to make limited annual payments in reduction of E\u2019s capital account. The agreement was completely silent as to the distribution of assets on dissolution and, that being so, the statutory rules governed. The appellants were entitled to no more than a proportionate interest in the distribution of assets and the proportions were to be determined in accordance with the respective capital interests of the appellants and the respondent as of the date of the dissolution of the partnership.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing a judgment of Smily J. upon an application for a declaration of the rights of the parties under an agreement of partnership. Appeal dismissed.\nHonourable R.L. Kellock, Q.C., for the applicants, appellants.\nG.D. Finlayson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The respondent and George Andrew Elliott carried on business together, in partnership, as hardware merchants, at the City of Brantford, under the terms of a partnership agreement dated October 1, 1937, until June 30, 1954. That partnership was terminated on the latter date by an agreement between them dated June 21, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe agreement\u201d), the relevant portions of which provided as follows:\nWHEREAS the Parties hereto have been carrying on business as hardware merchants at the City of Brantford under the name of Elliott Wedlake under the terms of an agreement of partnership dated October 1st, 1937,\nAND WHEREAS the Parties hereto have agreed to terminate and dissolve the said partnership and to enter into a Limited Partnership under the provisions of the Limited Partnership Act, R.S.O. Chap. 208 on the terms and conditions hereinafter set out,\nAND WHEREAS it is the intention of the parties hereto that the Party of the Second Part shall purchase the interest of the Party of the First Part in the said Limited Partnership in accordance with the terms hereinafter set forth in this agreement,\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that the Parties hereto covenant and agree with each other as follows:\n1. The general partnership heretofore carried on by the Parties hereto at the City of Brantford under the name of Elliott Wedlake shall be terminated on June 30th, 1954.\n2. The Party of the Second Part on or before said date will pay to the Party of the First Part the sum of Twelve Thousand and Forty three Dollars and Thirteen Cents ($12,043.13), less any drawings of the Party of the First Part since the 31st of May, 1954, being the amount to the credit of the capital account of the Party of the First Part in said business in excess of $90,000 and for the amount of the value of good will and por- tion of depreciation on fixed assets of said business agreed upon by the Parties, less drawings on account by the Party of the First Part during 1954,\u2026\n* * *\n4. The Party of the First Part is to contribute the sum of $90,000 to the capital of the partnership as a limited partner under the provisions of the Limited Partnership Act, R.S.O. Chap. 208, and a new limited partnership to be known as Elliott Wedlake is to be formed as of the date July 1st, 1954 under the terms and conditions herein set out.\n5. The limited partnership shall continue from year to year during the lifetime of the Party of the First Part, and continue thereafter subject to the conditions hereinafter contained.\n6. Interest at 5% is to be paid to the Party of the First Part on said sum of $90,000 or on such capital of the Party of the First Part as may remain in the partnership from time to time, payable quarterly or as may be required, and the Party of the Second Part is also to pay the sum of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) on account of the purchase of the share of the Party of the First Part each year during the remainder of the lifetime of the Party of the First Part, such payments to be made on the 31st day of January in each year commencing January 31st, 1955.\n7. In the event of the death of the Party of the First Part during the continuance of the partnership, the personal representatives of the Party of the First Part shall continue the partnership as limited partners on the same terms and conditions as are herein contained excepting that the Party of the Second Part shall be entitled to increase the annual payment on account of the purchase of the share of the Party of the First Part to any amount desired by him on giving the personal representatives of the Party of the First Part two (2) months\u2019 notice in writing of the amount intended to be paid by him.\n8. The lease of the premises 193 Colborne Street made by the Party of the First Part to Elliott Wedlake dated the 22nd day of November, 1949, is assigned to the Limited Partnership and the Party of the First Part consents thereto and is to be amended as follows:\nThe Lessee is to pay one half the total municipal taxes chargeable against the said premises and the land therewith and one half of all local improvements for the remainder of the term reserved by said lease, including the whole of the year 1954.\nThe Party of the Second Part is to pay two per cent (2%) per annum on $90,000 or on such amount as the Party of the First Part may have invested in said partnership as of the 1st day of February in each year from time to time in addition to the interest at five per cent (5%) per annum provided by the Limited Partnership Act, such additional interest to be charged by the Party of the Second Part as rent for accounting purposes, the intention being that the Party of the First Part shall receive seven per cent (7%) on capital invested in said partnership.\n9. It is agreed between the Parties hereto that the Party of the First Part shall not be entitled to any profits arising from the operation of the said business with the exception of the payments herein set forth of interest at 5% on the invested capital of the Party of the First Part and 2% increase of rent calculated on invested capital of the Party of the First Part.\nAlthough the agreement contemplated a limited partnership, with Elliott as a limited partner, it is conceded by counsel for both parties that this was not accomplished, as there was no contribution of an actual cash payment by Elliott to the common stock, as required by s. 2 of The Limited Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 208. However, it is also similarly conceded that this does not in any way affect the outcome of these proceedings, since all creditors of the partnership were paid off in full.\nElliott died on August 6, 1955, and the appellants are the executors of his last will and testament. The partnership was continued by the appellants and the respondent, as provided for in clause 7 of the agreement. The respondent made payments to the appellants in accordance with the agreement, including payments pursuant to clauses 6 and 7 of the agreement. As a result of the payments made by the respondent pursuant to those two clauses, both before and after Elliott\u2019s death, Elliott\u2019s contribution to the capital of the partnership, which had been defined in the agreement at $90,000, had been reduced, as of January 31, 1961, to $58,000. Subsequent to that date and prior to the time these proceedings were commenced, a further $5,000 payment was made by the respondent, reducing this amount to $53,000.\nLosses occurred in the operation of the partnership business. These were absorbed by the respondent, whose capital interest in the partnership was correspondingly reduced from time to time in the amount of the losses. Thus, whereas as of June 11, 1959, the respondent\u2019s capital interest was $60,292.24, this had been reduced by January 31, 1961, to $39,208.78.\nOn May 25, 1961, an agreement was made between the respondent and the appellants for the dissolution of the partnership and for liquidation of the partnership assets by the respondent. After satisfying all outstanding liabilities, there remained on hand the sum of $36,608.99.\nThe appellants applied to the Court on November 22, 1961, for a judgment declaring their rights in connection with this sum and also the liability of the respondent to the appellants. Their contention was that, under the terms of the agreement, the respondent had agreed to purchase from Elliott his interest in the partnership for $90,000, of which $53,000 still remained unpaid. They claimed, therefore, that they were entitled to all the moneys realized from the partnership assets and also a personal judgment against the respondent for the amount of the difference between that amount and $53,000. The respondent\u2019s contention was that the proceeds of the realization of the partnership assets should be divided between the appellants and himself in proportion to the standings of their respective capital accounts as of the date of dissolution.\nJudgment on the motion was given in favour of the appellants but, on appeal, the Court of Appeal unanimously reversed this decision and held in favour of the respondent. From that judgment the present appeal is brought.\nBefore this Court it was submitted, on behalf of the appellants, that the effect of clauses 6 and 7 of the agreement, coupled with the third recital clause, was to constitute a binding agreement by the respondent with Elliott to purchase the latter\u2019s interest in the partnership for $90,000, of which there still remained owing a sum of $53,000.\nWith respect to the effect of clauses 6 and 7 of the agreement, Kelly J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held as follows:\nConsidered by themselves, clauses 6 and 7, in my opinion, lack the essential ingredients of an agreement for sale; there is no mutual undertaking to buy on the one hand and to sell on the other; there is no purchase price stated or capable of being determined by any means specified in the agreement; there is no obligation on the part of Wedlake to pay anything beyond the sum of $2,000 a year during the lifetime of Elliott. In my view, unless the operative parts of the agreement can be bolstered up by the words of the third recital, the agreement fails completely to be an effective agreement of sale of which the Elliott executors can enforce performance.\nHe then went on to consider whether this result was altered by the wording of the third recital clause and, after referring to various authorities dealing with the effect of a recital clause upon the interpretation of an agreement, he concluded as follows:\nClauses 6 and 7 are not ambiguous in the sense that they are capable of alternative constructions to choose between which the Court may be assisted by reference to the recitals. Clauses 6 and 7 are vague in the sense that by themselves they do not support a construction which would lead to establish an enforceable contract of purchase or sale. Resort to the recitals may not be had to clear up the vagueness and to incorporate words which it would be necessary to insert in order that those clauses expressed the agreement of sale and purchase sought to be found in them by the Elliott executors.\nI have reached the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal, for the following reasons. I agree entirely that clauses 6 and 7 do not spell out the essential ingredients of an agreement for sale whereby the respondent undertook, without reservation, to purchase Elliott\u2019s interest in the partnership for $90,000. The essential purpose of the agreement was to provide for a partnership, for the terms governing the partnership relation and the operation of the partnership. The effect of clauses 6 and 7, even when read in conjunction with the recital clause, which, it must be remembered, referred only to \u201cthe intention\u201d of the parties that the respondent should purchase Elliott\u2019s interest \u201cin accordance with the terms hereinafter set forth in this agreement\u201d, was to make provision for the gradual reduction by the respondent of the capital account to Elliott\u2019s credit during the continuance of the partnership. There is no outright covenant by the respondent, without any reservation or limitation, to buy Elliott\u2019s capital interest. The respondent did no more than to undertake, while the partnership lasted, to make limited annual payments in reduction of Elliott\u2019s capital account.\nThe appellants are seeking to claim a preference on dissolution for the full return of Elliott\u2019s capital and I find nothing in the agreement which so provides. It is completely silent as to the distribution of assets on dissolution and, that being so, the statutory rules must govern and the division should be made in the manner directed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants also submitted that, even if there were no firm agreement by the respondent to purchase Elliott\u2019s interest, that the appellants had a lien on the partnership assets to the extent of the appellants\u2019 interest at the date of dissolution. This argument was based upon the proposition that under the terms of the agreement the respondent was obligated to assume all losses incurred by the partnership; that as the proceeds of realization of the partnership assets were insufficient to pay off the remaining portion of the appellants\u2019 capital interest, there had obviously been a capital loss and, consequently, for the amount of this loss the respondent was responsible to the appellants out of what otherwise would have been his share of the proceeds of the sale of the partnership assets.\nI do not find anything in the agreement to justify this contention. The agreement does not, in terms, even obligate the respondent to assume operating losses. Clause 9 provided merely that Elliott should not be entitled to any profits from the operation of the business other than the 5 per cent per annum on his invested capital and the rent in respect of the business premises calculated at 2 per cent on his invested capital. It may be implied from this provision that the respondent agreed to assume operating losses and this, in fact, he did. His own capital interest was reduced from time to time by the amount of the operating losses sustained by the business and, in consequence, the extent of his proportionate participation in the distribution of the partnership assets on dissolution was reduced. There is, however, no covenant on his part that, upon a dissolution of the partnership, the appellants should be entitled to be fully reimbursed for all moneys invested in the partnership by Elliott in priority to any participation therein by himself.\nThe appellants relied upon a statement of the law found in Lindley on Partnership, 12 ed., p. 383, reading as follows:\nIn other words, each partner may be said to have an equitable lien on the partnership property for the purpose of having it applied in discharge of the debts of the firm; and to have a similar lien on the surplus assets for the purpose of having them applied in payment of what may be due to the partners respectively, after deducting what may be due from them, as partners, to the firm.\nThis proposition does not assist the appellants. The debts of the partnership were all paid off. There were no outstanding advances by Elliott to the partnership. There is no evidence that he made any such advances. What he did was to make a contribution to the capital of the partnership. There were no debts owing by the partnership to the appellants or by the respondent to the partnership. That being so, in the absence of any provision in the agreement to the contrary (and there is none), the appellants are entitled to no more than a proportionate interest in the distribution of the partnership assets, the proportions to be determined in accordance with the respective capital interests of the appellants and the respondent as of the date of the dissolution of the partnership.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the applicants, appellants: Read & Innes, Brantford.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\n"

For the purpose of obtaining tax advantages the parties were advised that instead of making the sale direct to C, a company should be incorporated and the property transferred to it. This arrangement was followed and the defendant received the preferred shares of the company in exchange for his business. It was agreed that C would purchase these shares. The defendant and other members of the company's board of directors subsequently resigned and were replaced by a new board with C as president. After the new directors had assumed office the company executed a mortgage to the defendant to secure payment by C of the purchase price of the shares. The company later went into bankruptcy and the trustee sought to have the mortgage set aside on the grounds that it was ultra vires of the company, having been given in contravention of s. 37(1) of the Companies Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 33. The trial judgment, which held that the mortgage should be wholly sustained, was reversed by the Court of Appeal. On appeal to this Court the defendant contended that even if he failed on the main issue, there had been error in the Court below in declaring the mortgage void in so far as it secured the defendant for taxes imposed upon the land described in the mortgage, which he had paid.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nFor the reasons given by Ritchie J.A. in the Court below, the covenant for payment of the entire principal amount was invalid. If the mortgage was invalid as to the principal amount secured, then the covenant in respect to taxes could not come into operation at all, because there was then no obligation resting upon the mortgagor company toward the defendant to pay taxes upon the property described in the mortgage, and, unless there was such an obligation, the defendant was not enabled, by paying the taxes owed by the company, to obtain security upon its property for the amount which he had paid.\nNorthern Electric and Manufacturing Co.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, reversing a judgment of West J. Appeal dismissed.\nC. J. A. Hughes, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nE. J. Mockler, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014In my opinion, for the reasons given by Ritchie J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick2, this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe only point on which further comment is required is with respect to the appellant's contention that, even if he failed on the main issue, there had been error in the Court below in declaring the mortgage void in so far as it secured the appellant for taxes imposed upon the land described in the mortgage which he had paid in 1957, amounting to $3,940.\nThe appellant relied upon that clause in the mortgage whereby Thibault Auto, Limited covenanted with the appellant that it would pay all taxes imposed upon the mortgaged premises and which further provided that, in the event of the failure of that company to pay the same, it would be lawful for the appellant to pay them and to add the amount to the principal sum secured by the mortgage as a further charge upon the mortgaged premises. It was urged that, even if the mortgage were invalid in relation to the principal sum which it purported to secure, it could yet be upheld in respect of this covenant.\nThe cases cited by the appellant, Northern Electric and Manufacturing Co. Limited v. Cordova Mines Limited3 (reversed on other grounds under the title Hughes v. Northern Electric and Manufacturing Co.4), and Re Johnston Foreign Patents Company Limited5, do not support his contention. In the former case, the Court of Appeal of Ontario held that a mortgage given by a company could be upheld to the extent of the amount due to the mortgagees as advances to the company, even though it was ultra vires of the company in so far as it was given to secure payment of purchase moneys for its shares being purchased by a third person from a shareholder. In the latter case, each of three companies had become parties to joint debentures binding them jointly and severally. It was ultra vires of each company to charge its assets for funds advanced to another company. It was held that, to the extent to which the moneys advanced had come into the hands of each company, the debentures were a valid charge upon the assets of that particular company. It will be observed that in neither of these cases was the mortgage security entirely invalid. In each case the mortgage was valid with respect to a certain part of the principal sum secured by it, even though invalid with respect to the remaining portion of it.\nIn the present case, however, the covenant for payment of the entire principal amount was invalid. The covenant upon which the appellant relies in this case is by way of additional security to the main covenant to pay, and is subordinate to it. The main covenant has been found to be completely invalid. If the mortgage is invalid as to the principal amount secured, then the covenant in question could not come into operation at all, because there was then no obligation resting upon the mortgagor company toward the appellant to pay taxes upon the property described in the mortgage, and, unless there was such an obligation, the appellant was not enabled, by paying the taxes owed by the company, to obtain security upon its property for the amount which he had paid.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: J.-M.

Both operations were enclosed by substantial wire fences. During the whelping season (a time when female mink are easily agitated and if thus upset have a proclivity to destroy their young), the defendants' dog, by climbing or leaping over the plaintiff's fence, got into the compound and when found was on top of the mink cages. The mink were in a state of panic as a result of which 67 kits and two adult mink were killed. The dog had been allowed to roam at large in contravention of a municipal by-law and s. 44 of The Game Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 126. The trial judge found that there was negligence on the part of the defendants and awarded damages to the plaintiff. This judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal; by leave, an appeal was brought to this Court.\nThere was no evidence that the defendants had any knowledge or suspicion that their dog had any propensity to disturb mink or the inclination or ability to leap over a high wire fence. Relying on the law relating to the liability of the owner of a domestic animal for damage done by a domestic animal while at large, defendants' counsel argued that liability could not be found against the defendants in the absence of scienter.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: In the light of the circumstances of this case, there was a duty of care imposed upon the defendants to take reasonable steps to prevent their dog from straying on to the plaintiff's premises. There was sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion reached by both of the Courts below that, in the light of all the circumstances, there was negligence on the part of the defendants.\nFardon v.

Per Abbott, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The defendants were entitled to succeed unless there were present in this case circumstances which were special in the sense that they created a duty on the part of the defendants toward the plaintiff and that there had been a breach of that duty. To allow this dog which was strange to plaintiff's mink to run at large in this area in the whelping season with knowledge that there is a hostile reaction between mink and strange dogs was negligence. The defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff not to frighten the female mink at that particular time and were in breach of that duty in allowing the dog to run at large. Recognition of such a duty was implied in ss. 44, 112(b) and 121 of The Game Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 126, and By-law No. 205 of the Municipal District of Strathcona.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain J. Appeal dismissed.\nA. O. Ackroyd and A. R. Thompson, for the defendants, appellants.\nJ. W. McClung and J. T. Joyce, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The facts of this case have been fully stated in the reasons of my brother Hall, with which I agree.\nThe case involves the question of liability for damage caused by a dog. At common law the dog has been placed in a favoured position, as compared with that of most of the other domestic animals. Like them, the dog did not involve its owner under the strict liability imposed in respect of the keeping of dangerous animals. Liability in respect of a dog, under that strict rule, would only arise if scienter were proved. But, in addition to this, the dog was not an animal whose trespass would involve its owner under the strict liability imposed for cattle trespass.\nThe latter proposition is established in Buckle v. Holmes2, which, although it involved the owner of a cat, stated the law respecting dogs and applied the same rule also to cats. The reason for the special position of the dog was stated by Bankes L.J., at p. 129, as follows:\nTrespass by a dog is very different; a dog following its natural propensity to stray is not likely to do substantial damage in ordinary circumstances, although it might do so by rushing about in a carefully tended garden; but those who administered the law in the course of its development had regard not to exceptional instances but to the ordinary experience of a dog's habits, and they also took into account that the dog, a useful domestic animal, must be used if at all according to its nature; that it cannot ordinarily be kept shut up, and that the general interest of the country demands that dogs should be kept and that a reasonable amount of liberty should be allowed them. Therefore dogs are placed by the common law in a class of animals which do not by their trespasses render their owners liable.\nIt may be noted at the outset that the Municipal District of Strathcona No. 83, within the area of which the damage in question here occurred, did not share this kindly attitude toward the position of the dog, for it had enacted, on February 9, 1953, Bylaw No. 205, which provided, in part, as follows:\n1. For the purpose of this bylaw, the term \"running at large\" shall refer to any dog not under the immediate and effective control of its owner whether on the premises of its owner or otherwise.\n2. No person shall, after the passing of this bylaw, suffer or permit any dog of which he is the owner to run at large within the Municipal District.\nThe liability of a dog owner for damage caused by his dog did not necessarily have to be founded on the rule of strict liability relating to the keeping of dangerous animals. It might be established in negligence if, in the circumstances, a duty to take care in relation to the dog existed and there had been a breach of it. This proposition was recognized by the House of Lords in Fardon v. Harcourt-Rivington3, and it is stated by Lord Atkin in that case, at p. 392, as follows:\nBut it is also true that, quite apart from the liability imposed upon the owner of animals or the person having control of them by reason of knowledge of their propensities, there is the ordinary duty of a person to take care either that his animal or his chattel is not put to such a use as is likely to injure his neighbour\u2014the ordinary duty to take care in the cases put upon negligence.\nIt should also be noted that in this Court, in the case of Fleming v. Atkinson4, Judson J., who delivered the reasons of three out of the five majority judges in that case, applied the ordinary rules of negligence in a case involving the straying of cattle on to a highway.\nIn my opinion, the question in issue here is as to whether or not the respondent is entitled to succeed against the appellants on a claim under the ordinary rules of negligence. Was there a duty on the part of the appellants, in the circumstances of this case, to take reasonable care that their dog would not be free to stray on to the respondent's premises, thereby involving the likelihood of injury to his mink? Both of the Courts below have held that there was such a duty and that the appellants were in breach of it.\nIn the first place, it should be noted that the appellants did not have a right to let their dog run at large. This was expressly forbidden by the provisions of the bylaw previously quoted. Counsel for the respondent relied upon that bylaw and also upon s. 44 of The Game Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 126, as establishing a statutory duty, the breach of which gave to the respondent a cause of action. Section 44 of The Game Act provides:\n44. No person having the custody or control of a retriever dog, setter dog or pointer dog or any other dog used for the hunting of game birds shall allow any such dog to run at large at any time between the first day of May and the first day of August in any year, unless he is expressly authorized to do so by this Act or the regulations.\nI do not find it necessary to determine whether or not an absolute statutory liability was imposed upon the appellants by either or both of these provisions, so as to entitle the respondent, on establishing a breach thereof and damage to himself, to succeed in a claim for damages. Put at their lowest, however, these provisions are of significance in establishing that the appellants did not have any legal right to permit their dog to run at large. It seems to me that they serve as a complete answer to the contention made by the appellants, based on the English decisions of Buckle v. Holmes, supra, Tallents v. Bell and Goddard5, and Toogood v. Wright6, that a dog owner is not to be found liable in negligence because he suffers his dog to be at large, knowing of the natural propensities of dogs and that harm may possibly result when these propensities are manifested. In none of these cases did there exist a statutory provision which forbade the dog owner from permitting his animal to run at large.\nIn addition to the statutory provisions, however there are also, in this case, the following circumstances:\n1. The appellants were aware of the existence of the respondent's mink farm adjacent to their own premises. 2. They were aware that their dog had been accustomed to frequent the area near the respondent's land.\n3. They should have known that the presence of a strange dog in the respondent's mink enclosure during the whelping season would terrify the whelping females who, in such circumstances, have a proclivity to destroy their young.\n4. The appellants took no precautions to confine or restrain the dog during the whelping season.\nIn the light of all these circumstances, in my opinion, there did exist a duty of care imposed upon the appellants to take reasonable steps to prevent their dog from straying on to the respondent's premises. Both of the Courts below have found that there Was negligence on the part of the appellants in the light of all the circumstances and, in my opinion, there was sufficient evidence to warrant that conclusion being reached.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014For some 17 years prior to May 15, 1959, both parties to this action carried on the business of mink farming in the Municipal District of Strathcona immediately adjacent to the south boundary of the City of Edmonton. The two mink farms were close together, being separated only by an extension of 109th Street at one point and being contiguous at another point. Both operations were enclosed by substantial wire fences, the Caine fence being about 4-5 feet in height and the Kokolsky fence being 6 feet.\nIn 1958 the appellant Caine had acquired a Chesapeake retriever, a young dog, which by May 1959 had grown to full size and was described in the evidence as a large Chesapeake retriever which had received training as a mink dog and was used as such by the employees of Caine Fur Farms Limited. It had also been trained as a bird dog. The dog was normaly kept within the mink compounds or enclosure of the Caine farm and permitted to roam amongst the mink pens. The dog was also allowed to roam at large and to leave the mink farm area. The evidence also established that the dog was free to roam in the wooded area adjacent to these mink farms and that the dog went into the wooded area, and, on occasion, put up pheasants and perhaps other birds and game there.\nThis period of the year is known in the mink farming business as the whelping season. Both the respondent and Mr. Caine and the Caine Fur Farms Limited foreman, Mr. Phillips, knew that whelping was in progress on the respondent's mink farm. It was established that during the whelping season the female mink are easily agitated and that a strange dog in a mink compound was likely to upset the female mink and cause them to destroy their young. The dog had not shown any propensity or inclination to behave in an unusual or aggressive manner toward mink nor had he shown any inclination to leap over high fences.\nOn the evening of May 15, 1959, the respondent found this Chesapeake retriever in his mink compound. The learned trial judge found that the dog got into the compound by leaping or climbing over the fence which surrounded the compound. The dog was on top of the mink cages or runs. The respondent went to the Caine mink ranch and returned with the foreman Phillips who led the dog away. When the respondent first saw the dog in the compound, the mink were in a state of panic and some had kits in their mouths. Four pens were upset and the nest boxes from these pens were a considerable distance away. Early the next morning the respondent checked and found 67 dead kits and two dead adult mink. Two other adult female mink were missing and never found.\nThe respondent brought action in the Supreme Court of Alberta for damages. The action was tried by Milvain J. who gave judgment for the respondent in the sum of $3,726 and costs. The appellants appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and the Court of Appeal7 sustained the judgment of Milvain J. An appeal was then taken to this Court by leave granted May 7, 1962.\nMilvain J. found both the appellant John T. Caine and Caine Fur Farms Limited negligent, and his judgment on that branch of the case reads in part as follows:\nNow, in my view there was negligence on the part of the defendants and I say so for these reasons. In the first place, the defendants were in the mink raising business, as was the plaintiff, and therefore fully aware of the danger of dogs or anything else disturbing female mink during the whelping season. They are also all aware of the law as laid down in The Game Act \u2026 that a mink owner finding a dog in his mink enclosure disturbing his mink is authorized by the statute to shoot the dog forthwith, which is an indication of how serious the invasion of a dog\u2014a strange dog\u2014into the mink enclosure is regarded by the mink industry and by the governmental authorities that control it; and with that knowledge, and with the knowledge that any person must have of a proclivity of a healthy, intelligent dog to roam when at large, and that while roaming he might very easily upset the female mink in nearby premises, and that it was negligent not to take precautions to keep the dog restrained, at least during the whelping season.\nKane J.A. who wrote the judgment of the Court of Appeal also held that the appellants were guilty of negligence. He said, in part:\nA reasonable man in the position of the defendants knowing, as the defendants did, that the plaintiff's ranch was situate across the road from the defendant company's ranch, and that during the whelping season female mink have a well-known proclivity to destroy their young, would have foreseen the damage which might result from allowing the dog to run at large on May 15th, 1959. Their failure to do so constituted a breach of duty owing by them to the plaintiff. In the circumstances, therefore, the defendants were negligent.\nBoth the learned trial judge, Milvain J., and Kane J.A. in the Court of Appeal, referred to the provisions of The Game Act of Alberta, R.S.A. 1955, c. 126, and to By-law No. 205 of the Municipal District of Strathcona. The relevant sections of The Game Act read:\n44. No person having the custody or control of a retriever dog, setter dog or pointer dog or any other dog used for the hunting of game birds shall allow any such dog to run at large at any time between the first day of May and the first day of August in any year, unless he is expressly authorized to do so by this Act or the regulations.\n* * *\n112. No person shall operate a fur farm except where\n* * *\n(b) the fur-bearing animals at the farm are kept in pens and such pens are enclosed by a fence that will adequately prevent all other animals from having access thereto.\n* * *\n121. An owner or caretaker of fur-bearing animals kept on a fur farm for any purpose pursuant to a licence or permit obtained under this Act may kill any dog found on the premises near the enclosure in which the fur-bearing animals are kept if the dog is terrifying the fur-bearing animals by giving tongue, barking or otherwise.\nBy-law No. 205 is as follows:\nA By-law of the Municipal District of Strathcona No. 83 to provide for the governing and destruction of dogs running at large. Under authority of Section 230 of the Municipal District Act, being Chapter 151 R.S.A., 1942 and amendments thereto, the Council of the Municipal District of Strathcona No. 83 enacts as follows:\n1. For the purpose of this bylaw, the term \"running at large\" shall refer to any dog not under the immediate and effective control of its owner whether on the premises of its owner or otherwise.\n2. No person shall, after the passing of this bylaw, suffer or permit any dog of which he is the owner to run at large within the Municipal District.\n3. Any person or persons duly authorized or appointed by the Council for such purpose, shall immediately destroy all dogs found running at large.\n4. This bylaw shall come into force immediately upon the passing thereof.\nCounsel for the appellants relied strongly on the fact that there was no evidence at all that the appellants had any knowledge or suspicion that the dog in question had any propensity to disturb mink or the inclination or ability to leap over a high wire fence, and, relying on the law relating to the liability of the owner of a domestic animal for damage done by a domestic animal while at large, argued that liability could not be found against the appellants in the instant case in the absence of scienter.\nIt is not necessary, in my view, to review all the relevant authorities dealing with the liability of an owner of a domestic animal dealt with by both counsel in their full and helpful arguments before us. The appellants are entitled to succeed unless there are present in this case circumstances which were special in the sense that they created a duty on the part of the appellants towards the respondent and that there has been a breach of that duty.\nTo allow this dog which was strange to respondent's mink to run at large in this area in the whelping season with knowledge that there is a hostile reaction between mink and strange dogs was negligence. The appellants owed a duty to the respondent not to frighten the female mink at that particular time and were in breach of that duty in allowing the dog to run at large. Recognition of such a duty is implied in the provisions of The Game Act and the by-law to which I have referred.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Liden, Ackroyd, Bradley & Philion, Edmonton,\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: J.

The vessel, which at the time of the voyage in question was unseaworthy for navigation in ice, encountered ice conditions on her arrival at the entrance to Goose Bay. After the ship got through this ice, reports started to come from the engine room that she was leaking and within approximately one hour she sank. The judgment at trial allowing the plaintiff's claim was affirmed on appeal. With leave of the Court of Appeal an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defendant, whose defence was based primarily on Article IV, Rule 2(a) of the Schedule to the Water Carnage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 291, failed to discharge the burden of proving that the loss of the ship resulted from an \"act, neglect, or default of the master ... in the navigation or in the management of the ship\". In any event, as the loss was occasioned by the fact that the Henry Stone was unseaworthy and unfit to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage at the particular season in question, the exemption contained in Article IV, 2(a) could not be invoked to relieve the shipowner from responsibility. Smith, Hogg & Co. v. Black Sea and Baltic General Insurance Co., [1940] A.C. 997, referred to.\nThe Henry Stone was not dispatched on an \"ice free\" voyage but rather on a voyage during which it was expected that she would be navigated in ice conditions which the master did not consider \"unfavourable\". The event proved that the vessel was unseaworthy for navigation even under such conditions and as no steps were taken by the defendant between the date of the steamship inspection and the date of the loss to fit the Henry Stone \"to be navigated in ice\" it could not be said that \"the carrier\" had discharged \"the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence\" to make the ship seaworthy, so as to claim exemption from liability under Article IV, Rule 1 of the Schedule to the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (on appeal)[1], affirming a judgment of Furlong C.J. Appeal dismissed. P. J. Lewis, Q.C., and J. W. G. MacDougall, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., and D. Hunt, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (on appeal) from a judgment of that Court[2] affirming a judgment of Furlong C.J., and allowing the respondent's claim in respect of certain goods shipped by it from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Square Island, Labrador, and being carried by the appellant's motor vessel Henry Stone when that vessel sank in Goose Bay, Labrador, on November 19, 1959.\nThe goods in question were delivered to the coastal office of the appellant at St. John's, Newfoundland on November 6, 1959 and were consigned to B. W. Powell, one of the respondent's customers at Square Island aforesaid, in accordance with the provisions of bills of lading which were subject to the provisions of the Water Carriage of Goods Act.\nIt had originally been intended that the respondent's goods would be carried on the S.S. Burgeo but owing to the lateness of the season and the large quantity of freight awaiting shipment, the M.V. Henry Stone was pressed into service and it was thus that the respondent's goods were shipped by that vessel instead of the Burgeo.\nThe Henry Stone was a 17-year-old wooden vessel of 264.8 gross tons which had undergone extensive but not permanent repairs in the spring of 1959, and which was, at the time when she started on the voyage in question, operating with a temporary inspection certificate issued by the Department of Transport, good only until December 1959 and subject to the following limitations:\nTo operate as non-passenger ship on home trade Class 2 voyages; within the limits of the Canadian East Coast Atlantic Coastal Waters as far north as Chidley, Labrador. Not to be navigated in ice. (The italics are mine.)\nThe appellant's marine superintendent, who appears to have been responsible for sending the Henry Stone on this voyage, quite frankly admitted that, due to the lateness of the season and his knowledge of the conditions at Goose Bay, he anticipated that ice would be encountered and he describes the steps which he took to guard against this danger as follows:\nThe Henry Stone was the first available vessel and contemplating the ice due to the lateness of the season I had consulted with the Captain of the Burgeo and the Captain of the Henry Stone and arranged with them that in the event of meeting any conditions, unfavourable ice conditions at Goose Bay, that the Henry Stone would come to Cartwright and make contact with the Burgeo and the Burgeo would come and take the freight from him, and in no event was the Burgeo to leave the coast without seeing that the Henry Stone had completed her work.\nThe master of the Henry Stone, Captain John Tobin, gives the following account of these instructions:\nA. Yes, I had instructions from Mr. Healey before we left St. John's. He was sending us out on this trip and it was up in November and as usual you would be expecting ice conditions for that time of the year. So he told me the Burgeo was enroute to Goose Bay and to keep in contact with the Burgeo, and if conditions at Goose Bay were unfavourable for the Henry Stone to go to Goose Bay, for the Henry Stone to go to Cart-wright and the Burgeo would come to Cartwright and take the freight and deliver it.\nQ. And tranship the freight? A. That's right.\nQ. That is if ice conditions in Goose Bay were such that\u2014 Who was making the decision\u2014you? A. Well, I wouldn't\u2014I guess I was responsible for the Henry Stone. I guess it would be my decision. If I went in to Cartwright before we got down there, well, I'd have to\u2014. Whoever I was talking to up there on ice conditions I would have to go by what they tell me.\nQ. All right. Yes, but I just want to get the facts now. You did have instructions before you left? A. That's right.\nQ. That you were to keep in contact or in communication with the Master of the Burgeo? A. That's right.\nQ. And if ice conditions were such in Goose Bay that you think you shouldn't enter, then the Burgeo would tranship the freight for you from Cartwright. Is that the position? A. That's right.\nIt is apparent also from Captain Tobin's evidence that he thought that the direction \"not to be navigated in ice\" which was contained in the certificate applied only to heavy arctic ice and that it did not include such ice as he encountered at Goose Bay. The appellant's marine superintendent indicated on direct examination that he shared this opinion and although he qualified this evidence considerably on cross-examination, there is no indication that he ever explained to Captain Tobin the kind of ice that was to be treated as \"unfavourable\".\nAfter a rough but not hazardous voyage, which included calls at one port of loading (Carbonnear) and three ports of discharge, the vessel, while en route to Goose Bay, encountered the government icebreaker Ernest Lapointe, whose master reported on the Goose Bay ice conditions saying \"Ice conditions were not bad; there was three or four inches of ice there but he did not think we would have any difficulty getting up through there\". In addition to obtaining this information, Captain Tobin kept in constant touch with the Burgeo which was then at Goose Bay. On arriving at Sandy Point, which is at the entrance to Goose Bay, at 3:00 a.m. on November 19, the Henry Stone waited until daylight and at about 7:45 entered the channel leading to the bay. The conditions in the channel are described by the master as follows:\nA. It was level ice, but it wasn't a hard ice; it was a tough sort of ice, but it was moving out from the Bay. You see it was\u2014I guess where\u2014 wherever the boats came down probably it was broke off or something like that, because it was moving out; because we eventually got through the ice you see\u2014got in clear water. The day before that they broke; the ice was right in to Goose Bay you see. It was slow going, but with the ice coming out now, well, that made it so much slower you see; because we were cutting ice. Well, we weren't covering the ground, that we were cuting the ice\u2014say it that way. The ice was moving but it wasn't heavy ice; it was touch to get through. It was this kind of soft tough ice.\nAfter the vessel got through the ice at about 10:30, reports started to come from the engine room that she was leaking, and it soon became apparent that the pumps were unable to cope with the mounting water. Between 11:30 and 12:00 o'clock, or a little later, the ship sank.\nThere is some suggestion in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge that the sinking may have been due to a leak occurring before the vessel entered the ice which resulted in water being penned up in the forward hold, but I agree with counsel for the appellant that the two and three-quarter hour run through the ice at Goose Bay was by far the most likely cause of the sinking which occurred because of the fact that the vessel was unseaworthy for navigation in ice.\nBefore this Court, the appellant based its defence primarily on Article IV, Rule 2(a) of the Schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act, which reads as follows:\nNeither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from\n(a) act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or the management of the ship; It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the master was negligent in entering the approaches to Goose Bay with the ice conditions as they were on November 19, and that it was this negligence which caused the loss.\nThe marine superintendent who was \"in complete charge of the operating and overall supervision of the steamship operations\" for the appellant in Newfoundland deliberately dispatched the vessel on this voyage to a destination where it was \"usual\" for ice to be encountered in the month of November and in so doing he left the master with the impression that he was to be guided by information which he received from persons on the spot and particularly from the Burgeo in deciding whether or not ice conditions were unfavourable for the Henry Stone at Goose Bay.\nAs I interpret the evidence, the master carried out these instructions as best he could and, in my opinion, the appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proving that the loss of the ship resulted from an \"act, neglect, or default of the master in the navigation or in the management of the ship\".\nIn any event, as I find that the loss was occasioned by the fact that the Henry Stone was unseaworthy and unfit to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage at the particular season in question, I am of opinion that the exception contained in Article IV, 2(a) cannot be invoked to relieve the shipowner from responsibility. In this regard, I refer to what was said by Lord Wright in Smith, Hogg & Co. v. Black Sea and Baltic General Insurance Co.[3] In that case, there was a clause in the charterparty providing that the shipowner would not be liable for loss or damage resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the shipowner to make the vessel seaworthy; and also that the shipowner should not be responsible for loss or damage arising from (amongst other things) act, neglect or default of the master in the navigation or management of the ship . . . The trial judge held that the accident there in question took place not by reason of the unseaworthiness of the ship but by reason of the acts of the master, which he found to have been wrong in the circumstances, and that the shipowner was entitled to succeed by reason of the above exception. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Lord Wright, in reversing the trial judge, said at p. 1004:\nI think the contract may be expressed to be that the shipowner will be liable for any loss in which those other causes covered by exceptions co-operate, if unseaworthiness is a cause, or if it is preferred, a real, or effective or actual cause.\nHaving found that the loss of the Henry Stone was occasioned by unseaworthiness, it remains to be determined whether due diligence was exercised by the owner to make the ship seaworthy. Article IV, Rule 1 of the Schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act, reads as follows:\nNeither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article III.\nWhenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this section.\nThe Henry Stone was not dispatched on an \"ice free\" voyage but rather on a voyage during which it was expected that she would be navigated in ice conditions which the master did not consider \"unfavourable\". The event proved that the vessel was unseaworthy for navigation even under such conditions and as no steps were taken by the appellant between the date of the steamship inspection and the date of the loss to fit the Henry Stone \"to be navigated in ice\" I do not think that it can be said that \"the carrier\" has discharged \"the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence . . .\" which rests on it under this rule. For these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: P. J.

In an action for damages, the trial judge found that the accident was occasioned by the gross negligence of the female defendant so as to give rise to liability under s. 99(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112. The trial judge was of opinion that no single act on the part of the female defendant amounted in itself to gross negligence, but that the cumulative effect of her negligent acts did constitute gross negligence. An appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal where the majority held that while it was perfectly proper to consider a number of related acts or omissions which, taken cumulatively, might establish gross negligence, each or at least some of the related acts should possess a more flagrant quality than they had here if they were to be capable of being accumulated to show a pattern of behaviour amounting to gross negligence. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the decision of the trial judge restored.\nThe defendant's behaviour was very near the borderline between simple negligence and gross negligence, but the difficult task of assessing the quality of the negligent actions of the driver of a motor vehicle immediately before and at the time of an accident in order to determine whether or not they are to be characterized as \"gross negligence\" involves a reconstruction of the circumstances of the accident itself including the reactions of the persons involved, and this was a function for which the judge who has seen and heard the witnesses is far better equipped than are the judges of an appellate court. Since the trial judge did not misdirect himself as to the law and as the main facts were not in dispute, this was not a case in which the opinion of an appellate court as to the quality of the negligence should be substituted for the opinion reached by the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, allowing an appeal from a judgment of May-bank, J. Appeal allowed. R. R. Brock, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC. R. Huband, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba (Freedman and Schultz JJ.A. dissenting) setting aside the judgment of Mr. Justice Maybank at the trial of the action whereby he had awarded damages in the amount of $7,880.90 to the appellant in respect of injuries sustained by her as the result of an accident which occurred while she was being transported as a guest passenger without payment for transportation in a motor vehicle owned by the respondent George Perry and operated by the respondent Irene Perry. The learned trial judge found that the accident was occasioned by the gross negligence of Irene Perry so as to give rise to liability under s. 99(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, and the appellant now appeals from the reversal of that finding by the Court of Appeal and also seeks to have the damages increased.\nThe accident in which Miss Burke was injured occurred at about 11:30 on the evening of July 17, 1961, when Mrs. Perry was driving her husband's motor vehicle over the Disraeli Freeway in the City of Winnipeg. It was dark and raining so heavily that the windshield wipers were not able to keep the windshield clear at all times, and as the car approached the slippery surface of the bridge it was required to round an ascending curve. At about this time, at least one passenger in the car asked Mrs. Perry to slow down but she continued at a speed of about 30 miles per hour and in so doing passed two other cars.\nThere is some evidence that the tires were worn smooth and due to a combination of this factor, the slippery surface of the bridge, and the speed at which she was travelling Mrs. Perry lost control of the vehicle. Once out of control, the car went across the travelled portion of the bridge and the left-hand sidewalk and barged into the iron railing substantially damaging the railing and the car, and causing the appellant to sustain the serious facial lacerations and other injuries in respect of which she has brought this action.\nThe learned trial judge was careful to explain that no single act on the part of Mrs. Perry amounted in itself to \"gross negligence\" but he took the view that the cumulative effect of her negligent acts did constitute that \"very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves\" which characterizes \"gross negligence\" within the meaning attributed to that term by Sir Lyman Duff in McCulloch v. Murray1.\nGuy J.A., who delivered the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal, made an elaborate review of the evidence, and concluded by saying:\nWhile the authorities are clear that it is perfectly proper to consider a number of related acts or omissions which, taken cumulatively, might establish gross negligence, my own view is that each or at least some of the related acts should possess a more flagrant quality than they have here if they are to be capable of being accumulated to show a pattern of behaviour amounting to gross negligence.\nThe general principle relating to cumulative acts of negligence amounting in toto to gross negligence was considered by my brother Freedman when he wrote the majority judgment of this Court in the case of Wruck v. Krzuk (1962) 37 W.W.R. 68. In that particular case, we dealt with a more aggravated speed than in the instant case, and the other aspects were regarded as incidental. Mr. Justice Freedman came to the conclusion that gross negligence had not been proved.\nIn Wruck v. Krzuk, supra, the appeal was against a finding that the conduct in question did not amount to gross negligence and in the course of his judgment, Freedman J.A. said at p. 72:\nWhere as here the tribunal consists of a judge sitting without a jury it is entirely a question for him. An appellate court should be slow to substitute its opinion for his as to whether the defendant's conduct amounts to gross negligence.\nIn support of this proposition, the learned judge relied on the case of Semeniuk v. Scoyoc2, in which Cartwright J., speaking for the majority of this Court, said:\nIn my view, where the conduct of a party is clearly negligent and the Judge presiding at a trial without a jury has neither misdirected himself as to the law nor misapprehended the primary facts an appellate court should be slow to substitute its opinion for his as to whether such party's conduct amounts to gross negligence.\nI am conscious of the fact that Mrs. Perry's behaviour was very near the borderline between simple negligence and gross negligence and I can readily understand the difference of opinion which existed in the Courts below, but the difficult task of assessing the quality of the negligent actions of the driver of a motor vehicle immediately before and at the time of an accident in order to determine whether or not they are to be characterized as \"gross negligence\" involves a reconstruction of the circumstances of the accident itself including the reactions of the persons involved, and this is a function for which the trial judge who has seen and heard the witnesses is far better equipped than are the judges of an appellate court.\nI am satisfied that the learned trial judge did not misdirect himself as to the law and as the main facts are not in dispute I am, with respect, unable to agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that this is a case in which the opinion of an appellate court as to the quality of the negligence should be substituted for the opinion reached by the learned trial judge. Like Freedman J.A., I do not consider the award of general damages to be so inordinately low as to warrant interference by an appellate tribunal.\nFor these reasons as well as for those contained in the dissenting opinion delivered by Freedman J.A. on behalf of himself and Mr. Justice Schultz, I would allow this appeal and restore the decision of the learned trial judge. The appellant should have her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court but as she was granted leave to appeal to this Court in forma pauperis the costs of this appeal will be governed by the provisions of Rule 142 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAppeal allowed with costs; Supreme Court rule 142 to apply.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Thompson, Dilts, Jones, Hall, Dewar & Ritchie, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Richardson, Richardson, Huband & Wright, Winnipeg.\n1 [1942] S.C.R. 141, 2 D.L.R. 179.\n2 [1955] 4 D.L.R. 780.\n"

He also leased to the plaintiff his right, title, interest and estate in and to the leased substances, or any of them, within, upon or under any lands excepted from, or roadways, lanes, or rights-of-way adjoining, the said lands. The plaintiff agreed to pay a gross royalty on the leased substances produced, saved and marketed from the lands, which royalty, in respect of crude oil, was fixed at 12\u00bd per cent of the current market value of the crude oil produced.\nBy a farm-out agreement the defendant agreed to drill a well and to pay the plaintiff upon production an overriding royalty of 5 per cent of the value of all crude oil and naphtha produced. The defendant agreed to perform all of the plaintiff's obligations under the lease and to indemnify the plaintiff against all claims and demands which it might sustain, pay or incur consequent upon the failure of the defendant to carry out any of the plaintiff's obligations contained in the lease.\nPetroleum production was obtained and the defendant, when paying the royalties to the lessor and to the plaintiff in respect of its production of oil from the lands during the period in question, computed same upon the total production of such oil, less 1.88 per cent thereof, and claimed that it was entitled to make the deduction by reason of The Road Allowances Crown Oil Act, 1959. The plaintiff, apparently feeling itself obligated to do so under the terms of the lease, thereupon proceeded to pay to the lessor the difference between a royalty computed on the total production and the amount of the royalty which had been paid to the lessor by the defendant. It then proceeded to sue the defendant for the amount which it had paid to the lessor and also for the difference between the 5 per cent overriding royalty computed on the total production and the amount of royalty which had been paid to the plaintiff by the defendant.\nBoth the Courts below decided in favour of the defendant and dismissed the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court, with leave of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 3 of The Road Allowances Crown Oil Act, 1959, declared a property interest in the Crown of 1.88 per cent of all the recoverable oil within the whole of a producing reservoir. No matter where the oil migrated the Crown's interest remained in it and, on production, the property interest still remained. After the Act had provided for the payment to the Crown of 1 per cent of the value of all oil produced, or for the delivery of that percentage in kind in lieu of payment, s. 6 then provided that the owner might retain and dispose of \"oil declared by section 3 to be the property of the Crown\" to the extent of 88 per cent of the oil produced. This was a clear indication that the declaration contained in s. 3 was as to the ownership of oil produced from a reservoir and that of the 1.88 per cent thereof belonging to the Crown the owner, after paying for or delivering 1 per cent to the Crown, would be free to dispose of the remaining portion of the Crown interest for his own benefit. It followed that the defendant could not be compelled to pay royalty, under the provisions of the lease or the farm-out agreement, upon all the oil produced from the lands, because of that oil, 1.88 per cent was the property of the Crown.\nSo far as the lease was concerned, the obligation to pay royalty was upon the leased substances owned by the lessor and leased and granted by him to the lessee. The lessee could not be compelled to pay royalty upon oil which did not belong to the lessor. Similarly the defendant could not be obligated to pay royalty to the plaintiff, under the farm-out agreement, on that portion of the oil which it produced, not by virtue of rights conferred upon it by the lease, but pursuant to the provisions of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, affirming a judgment of Brownridge J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. Lorn McDougall, Q.C., and D. E. Lewis, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nL. Harris McDonald, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The issue in this case involves the determination of the purpose and meaning of The Road Allowances Crown Oil Act, 1959, (Sask.), c. 53, which came into force on April 1 of that year and which is hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\".\nThe appellant is the lessee under the provisions of a petroleum and natural gas lease, dated April 23, 1949, from Emile Boutin, as lessor, in respect of the North Half of Section 15, Township 6, Range 1, West of the Second Meridian, in the Province of Saskatchewan, hereinafter referred to as \"the lands\". The lessor, as registered owner, or entitled to become registered owner, of the petroleum, natural gas and all related hydrocarbons within, upon or under the lands, granted arid leased to the appellant all petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons, except coal and valuable stone, which were referred to in the lease as the \"leased substances\", within, upon or under the lands. He also granted and leased to the appellant his right, title, interest and estate in and to the leased substances, or any of them, within, upon or under any lands excepted from, or roadways, lanes, or rights-of-way adjoining, the lands.\nThe appellant agreed to pay a gross royalty on the leased substances produced, saved and marketed from the lands, which royalty, in respect of crude oil, was fixed at 12\u00bd per cent of the current market value of the crude oil produced.\nClause 4 of the lease provided as follows:\n4. LESSER INTEREST:\u2014\nIf the Lessor's interest in the leased substances be less than the entire and undivided fee simple estate therein, then the royalties and rentals herein provided shall be paid the Lessor only in the proportion which his interest bears to the whole and undivided fee.\nOn March 30, 1959, the appellant and the respondent entered into a farm-out agreement, whereby the respondent agreed to drill a well on the lands and would thereby become entitled to earn the right to acquire the appellant's interest under the lease for the term of the lease less the last day thereof. An overriding royalty was provided in favour of the appellant on the production of petroleum substances from the lands, which, in the case of crude oil and naphtha, was 5 per cent of the value thereof produced from the lands. The respondent agreed to perform all of the appellant's obligations under the lease and to indemnify the appellant against all claims and demands which it might sustain, pay or incur consequent upon the failure of the respondent to carry out any of the appellant's obligations contained in the lease. The respondent did drill a well on the lands and obtained therefrom petroleum production.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:\n2. In this Act:\n* * *\n3. \"oil\" means crude petroleum oil and all other hydrocarbons, regardless of gravity, that are produced at a well in liquid form by ordinary production methods; 4. \"owner\" means a person who has a right to drill into an underground reservoir and produce therefrom oil or gas or oil and gas and to appropriate the oil or gas he produces either to himself or others or to himself and others;\n* * *\n3. In every producing oil reservoir one and eighty-eight one-hundredths per cent of the recoverable oil shall be deemed to be within, upon or under road allowances and shall be the property of the Crown.\n4.\u2014(1) Except as provided in section 5, every owner producing oil shall be liable to pay and shall on or before the last day of each month, commencing with the month of May, 1959, pay to the minister one per cent of the value, calculated on the average prevailing well-head price, of the oil produced, free and clear of any deductions, during the preceding month.\nSection 5 provided that the Minister of Mineral Resources could elect to take payment in kind instead of the money payment provided for in s. 4.\nSection 6 provided as follows:\n6. Subject to compliance with section 4 or 5, every owner producing oil may retain and dispose of oil declared by section 3 to be the property of the Crown to the extent of eighty-eight one-hundredths of one per cent of the oil produced, or the proceeds of the sale thereof, for his own use and benefit.\nIt is conceded that in this case the respondent is the \"owner\" within the meaning of subs. 4 of s. 2.\nThe question in issue is as to whether, in the light of the provisions of the Act, the respondent, in paying the royalties to the lessor under the lease and to the appellant under the farm-out agreement, is obligated to pay in respect of all the oil produced by it from the lands, or is obligated only to pay royalty upon (a) that quantity, less 1.88 per cent thereof, or (b) that quantity, less 1 per cent thereof. The respondent, when paying the royalties to the lessor and to the appellant in respect of its production of oil from the lands during the months from and including May 1959 to February 1960, computed the same upon the total production of such oil, less 1.88 per cent thereof. The appellant, apparently feeling itself obligated to do so under the terms of the lease, thereupon proceeded to pay to the lessor the difference between a royalty computed on the total production. during the period in question and the amount of the royalty which had been paid to the lessor by the respondent. It then proceeded to sue the respondent for the amount which it had paid to the lessor and also for the difference between the 5 per cent\n[Page 337\noverriding royalty computed on the total production and the amount of royalty which had been paid to the appellant by the respondent.\nBoth the Courts below decided in favour of the respondent and dismissed the appellant's action. The appellant has appealed to this Court, with the leave of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan.\nThe appellant's contention may be summarized as follows: Section 3 of the Act does nothing more than to define, in arithmetic terms, the amount of oil, in place in a reservoir, which belongs to the Crown, as being within, upon or under road allowances. The title to such oil, in place, was already in the Crown by virtue of The Mineral Resources Act, 1931, (Sask.), c. 16, carried forward into c. 47 of the Revised Saskatchewan Statutes 1953, which was in effect when the Act came into force. That Act provided that mines, minerals and mining rights, in, on or under all public highways and road allowances, should continue to be vested in the Crown and might be leased or otherwise disposed of under the regulations. The Act does not purport to provide that the Crown is the owner of oil when actually produced at a well. Such oil is the property of the producer. Though he is compelled, by s. 4 of the Act, to pay to the Minister of Mineral Resources 1 per cent of the value of the production, this does not alter, in any way, the contractual obligation, imposed by the lease and the farm-out agreement, to pay royalty upon all the oil produced. That is a contractual obligation which is not affected by the provisions of the Act.\nI am unable to accept this interpretation of the Act. Section 3 refers to a \"producing oil reservoir\"; i.e., a reservoir from which oil, as defined in subs. 3 of s. 2, is being produced; namely, crude oil and those other hydrocarbons which, regardless of gravity, are produced at a well in liquid form by ordinary production methods. In such a reservoir 1.88 per cent of the oil which is recoverable is declared to be the property of the Crown. In my opinion, the consequence of this provision is that, of the oil which is actually produced from a producing reservoir, 1.88 per cent belongs to the Crown.\nCounsel for the appellant contends that oil is a fugitive and migratory substance and that the law of capture applies to it. He cites, from the judgment of the Privy Council in Borys v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company2, the following passage:\nThe substances were fugacious and were not stable within the container, although they could not escape from it. If any of the three substances was withdrawn from a portion of the property which did not belong to the appellant but lay within the same container, and any oil or gas situated in his property thereby filtered from it to the surrounding lands, admittedly he had no remedy. So, also, if any substance was withdrawn from his property, thereby causing any fugacious matter to enter his land, the surrounding owners had no remedy against him. The only safeguard was to be the first to get to work, in which case those who made the recovery became owners of the material which they withdrew from any well which was situated on their property or from which they had authority to draw.\nLord Porter has here summarized the legal position of a landowner from within whose lands oil has migrated to the land of an adjoining landowner by reason of the operation of a well upon that land. Such, in the absence of s. 3 of the Act, would have been the legal position of the Crown in respect of oil which migrated from beneath a road allowance because of the operation of a well on adjoining land.\nSection 3, however, declares a property interest in the Crown of 1.88 per cent of all the recoverable oil within the whole of a producing reservoir. This is a property interest, not in relation to oil situated beneath the surface of specific lands, but in respect of a portion of all the oil in the whole of a reservoir. The result is that, no matter to where the oil in that reservoir migrates, the Crown's interest remains in it and, on production, the property interest still remains.\nThis view of the effect of s. 3 is reinforced by the wording of s. 6. After the Act has provided for the payment to the Crown of 1 per cent of the value of all oil produced, or for the delivery of that percentage in kind in lieu of payment, s. 6 then goes on to provide that the owner may retain and dispose of \"oil declared by section 3 to be the property of the Crown\" to the extent of 88 per cent of the oil produced. This is a clear indication that the declaration contained in s. 3 was as to the ownership of oil produced from a reservoir and that of the 1.88 per cent thereof belonging to the Crown the owner, after paying for or delivering 1 per cent to the Crown, would be free to dispose of the remaining portion of the Crown interest for his own benefit.\nApplying this view of the effect of s. 3 of the Act, it must, I think, follow that the respondent cannot be compelled to pay royalty, under the provisions of the lease or the farm-out agreement, upon all the oil produced from the lands, because, of that oil, 1.88 per cent is the property of the Crown.\nIn so far as the lease is concerned, the obligation to pay royalty is upon the leased substances owned by the lessor and leased and granted by him to the lessee. The lessee cannot be compelled to pay royalty upon oil which does not belong to the lessor and this conclusion, which, I think, must follow, even apart from the provisions of clause 4 of the lease, is reinforced by the terms of that clause.\nSimilarly, in my opinion, the respondent cannot be obligated to pay royalty to the appellant, under the farm-out agreement, on that portion of the oil which it produces, not by virtue of rights conferred upon it by the lease, but pursuant to the provisions of the Act.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: McDougall, Ready & Hodges, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Balfour, MacLeod, McDonald, Laschuk & Kyle, Regina.\n1 (1962), 40 W.W.R. 412, 36 D.L.R.

Cartwright. Martland. Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA\nNegligence\u2014Defendant general contractor employing independent contractor to make particular repair on plaintiff's building\u2014No contract as between defendant and plaintiff to effect repair\u2014Building destroyed by fire because of independent contractor's negligence\u2014Extent of duty owed to plaintiff by defendant.\nThe defendant contractor was engaged in making certain repairs to a building owned by the plaintiff and instructed an independent contractor to solder a hole in the gutter. While the servant of the independent contractor was proceeding to effect this repair, a fire was caused by the servant's negligent operation of a lighted blowtorch and resulted in the destruction of the building. The plaintiff's claim was, initially, framed as one for breach of contract by the defendant, but no contract by the defendant with the plaintiff to repair the gutter was proved, and the case proceeded to trial solely as a claim that the defendant was vicariously liable for the negligence of the workman in doing that work. The trial judge dealt with the case as being one which involved the issue of liability of the defendant for the negligence of an independent contractor hired by it. He decided that the work done by the servant was not, by its nature, inherently dangerous and consequently that the case was not one in which liability would attach to the defendant in respect of the negligence of the servant of its independent contractor. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, allowed an appeal from this judgment and the defendant then brought an appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nThe issue was as to the extent of the duty owed to a claimant by a person who contracts with an independent contractor to do work, not for himself, but for the claimant, at the claimant's request, if the claimant's own property is then damaged because of negligence on the part of the independent contractor who is working on it. The plaintiff had failed to prove any contract between the defendant and itself whereby the defendant undertook to effect the repair of the gutter. The only connection of the defendant with the matter was the actual hiring of the services of the independent contractor and providing him with the staging from which to do the work. In these circumstances, the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff was no more than to exercise reasonable care in the selection of a competent independent contractor to perform the work. There was no suggestion in the evidence that the choice made by the defendant was an improper one and, therefore, there was no evidence of a breach of that duty. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco1, allowing by a majority an appeal from a judgment of Parker J. Appeal allowed.\nJ. H. Dickey, Q.C., and J. J. Fitzpatrick, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nC. M. Rosenblum, Q.C., and G. S. Black, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This case involves a claim for damages sustained by the respondent as a result of the destruction by fire, on November 12, 1959, of the court-house building owned by it in the City of Sydney. For some days prior to that date, and on that day, employees of the appellant had been engaged in making repairs to the exterior of the building. On that day James Garland, a servant of George Garland who was the owner of a small roofing and sheet metal business in Sydney, went to the top of a scaffolding on the south side of the building, which had been erected by the appellant, for the purpose of repairing a hole in the gutter; this hole was about the size of a fifty-cent piece. He took with him a blowtorch, a soldering iron and other necessary materials. He lit the blowtorch, placed it in the gutter with the flame pointing along the length of the gutter and put the soldering iron on to heat. His reason for placing the torch in the gutter was that there was a wind blowing from the south and he thought that if he left it on the scaffolding it would be blown out. The gutter was made of copper about one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness; it was about ten inches deep; its width at the top was about nine inches and at the bottom about seven inches. The base of the blowtorch was round; it was about six inches in diameter and eight inches in height; when placed in the gutter it went right to the bottom. In the position in which Garland was working nothing inflammable was exposed; the walls of the building were brick; the shingles on the roof were not wood; copper flashing came down from the roof and lapped over the metal of the gutter. The flashing and the gutter were nailed to a wooden fascia board but no part of this board was visible. The learned trial judge found that the fire was caused by the heat from the blowtorch passing through the metal of the flashing and the gutter and igniting the fascia board. He found that the fire was caused by the negligence of James Garland and this finding was not questioned before us.\nThe circumstances which led to James Garland being present at the building on that day were as follows: An employee of the appellant, who had been engaged in replacing copper moulding on the building, had noticed the hole in the gutter. He brought this to the attention of a Mr. Carmichael, the County Clerk, who had previously requested the employees of the appellant to advise him as to the condition of the building. Subsequent to Carmichael's receiving this advice, a Mr. MacInnis, the appellant's foreman, attended at the shop of George Garland.\nThe only evidence as to the arrangement which was made for the repair of the gutter to be done by James Garland is that which James Garland gave at the trial. Neither Carmichael nor MacInnis gave evidence. James Garland testified that he overheard a conversation between his father, George Garland, and MacInnis, in which the latter wished to have James Garland go up and solder the gutter. MacInnis told James Garland where the hole was which he was to repair and James Garland went to examine it. The staging was not high enough for him to reach the hole and, in consequence, the appellant's employees increased the height of the staging from which James Garland worked. James Garland went to do the work upon the instructions of his father.\nThe respondent commenced action against the appellant, claiming in contract, alleging that:\nOn or about the 1st day of November, A.D. 1959, the Defendant entered into a contract with the Plaintiff pursuant to which the Defendant undertook to effect certain repairs to the Court House building aforesaid and it was a term of the said contract, express or implied, that the Defendant would use reasonable care and due diligence, and would see that reasonable care and due diligence was used by others employed by it, in and about and during the performance of the said work, for the safe performance thereof and the preservation of the Plaintiff's property.\nThis was followed by an allegation that on November 12, 1959, the servants or agents of the defendant, while engaged in the performance of the work included in the contract, negligently set fire to the building. Particulars of the neg- ligence were then given. The appellant, in its statement of defence, denied that it was under contract to do this work, or that its servants or agents negligently set fire to the building.\nHad the respondent been able to establish the contract which it pleaded and that the repair of the gutter was included in the work which the appellant had contracted to perform, the respondent would have been entitled to succeed against the appellant, irrespective of whether James Garland was a servant of the appellant or a servant of an independent contractor hired by the appellant to do that work. By contracting to do the work the appellant would have been under an obligation to the respondent to do the work itself, or to ensure that it was done, carefully. In such a case the appellant could not have evaded its contractual duty by delegating the performance of the work to someone else.\nHowever, the respondent was apparently unable to prove such a contract. There was no evidence led to establish its existence and counsel for the respondent at the trial stated that he was basing his claim solely in negligence.\nThe learned trial judge dealt with the case as being one which involved the issue of liability of the appellant for the negligence of an independent contractor hired by it. He said:\nIn my opinion, what the evidence shows is that James Garland was at all relevant times the servant of his father, George Garland. The legal relationship between the defendant and George Garland was that of a general contractor and an independent subcontractor.\nHe decided that the work done by James Garland was not, by its nature, inherently dangerous and consequently that the case was not one in which liability would attach to the appellant in respect of the negligence of the servant of its independent contractor.\nFrom this decision the respondent (at that time the appellant) appealed to the Court of Appeal. The case was dealt with in that Court upon the same basis. MacQuarrie J., who delivered the reasons of the majority of the Court, said:\nWith deference, in my opinion, \u2026 the matter comes to this, that it is reasonable to conclude on the whole of the evidence that the work that was done by George Garland and James Garland in connection with soldering the hole in the copper gutter, was done by George Garland engaged by Mr. MacInnis to do work in connection with the Court House repairs as an independent contractor working for the respondent and by James Garland as the servant of George Garland.\nHe went on to hold, however, that:\nIn my opinion, considering all the circumstances in the present case, the respondent ordered the doing of work, which, if done by the usual method, would create a danger of fire to the appellant's building, and it thereupon came under a duty either to provide that the dangerous method be not used or to provide that, if it were used, all necessary precautions against fire be taken, and it could not escape liability for the non-performance of such duty by delegating its performance to George Garland.\nMacDonald J. dissented and, for the reasons which he stated, agreed with the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge that \"it cannot be said that such work was by its nature inherently dangerous.\"\nThe Court of Appeal permitted the respondent to amend its pleadings so as to plead, in addition to the allegation of negligence on the part of the appellant, its servants or agents, which it had previously pleaded, an additional allegation of negligence on the part of its independent contractor.\nWith the greatest respect for the conclusions reached in the Courts below, I find it difficult to see how the relationship of contractor and subcontractor could have existed as between the appellant and George Garland, when there is no evidence of a main contract, as between the appellant and the respondent, involving any responsibility on the part of the appellant to repair the gutter. On the evidence in this case it cannot be said that the appellant contracted with the respondent to do that work and consequently it was under no duty to the respondent to perform it. It is not possible to infer such a contract from the conversation between MacInnis and George Garland without any additional supporting evidence. It must be recalled that the evidence shows that the hole in the gutter had been disclosed to Carmichael. There is no evidence to establish what instructions were thereafter given by Carmichael to MacInnis. I do not see how it is possible to infer that MacInnis undertook, as a matter of contract with the respondent, that the appellant should undertake that work merely because later he requested George Garland to have that work done. Carmichael might have requested that the appellant undertake that work as a matter of contract. On the other hand, he might equally well have requested MacInnis to arrange that someone should do the work. The respondent failed to prove any contract between the appellant and itself whereby the appellant undertook to effect the repair of the hole in the gutter.\nThe absence of such a contract is of great importance, not only because the appellant cannot be held liable in contract in respect of the damage which occurred, but also because it has a very important bearing in determining the question as to whether the appellant became vicariously responsible for the negligence of George Garland's employee James Garland. How, in the absence of such a contract, is the rather scanty evidence given by James Garland to be construed in determining the legal relationship between the appellant and George Garland? In my opinion there is no more reason for construing the conversation between George Garland and MacInnis as leading to the inference that MacInnis made a contract with George Garland to do the repair work on behalf of the appellant than there is for construing the evidence as leading to the inference that MacInnis requested George Garland to do the work for the respondent. If the appellant was not obligated by contract to do this work itself, why should it enter into a contract with George Garland that he do the work in question on behalf of the appellant? If the second of the above inferences is drawn, then that is an end of the matter, for, in that case, George Garland was never an independent contractor of the appellant's and consequently there could be no vicarious liability on its part for the negligence of George Garland's servant. As the onus rested upon the respondent to establish the relationship between the appellant and George Garland, I would think that we are not entitled to adopt the first inference.\nBut, in any event, even if that inference were to be drawn, I do not see how it can lead to liability on the part of the appellant, in the absence of the existence of a main contract between the appellant and the respondent whereby the appellant undertook to do that work. It is necessary to define the extent of the duty owed by the appellant to the respondent, on which the respondent seeks to make the appellant vicariously responsible for the negligence of the servant of an independent contractor. It is, I think, of the utmost importance to remember that, even adopting the first inference, the services of the independent contractor were retained by the appellant, not to perform work which the appellant was itself obligated to perform, but solely to do work which the respondent required to be done.\nThis is not the usual case in which the claimant is a person who has suffered damage as a result of activities being carried on by another person who has delegated their performance to an independent contractor. Nor does the respondent claim against the appellant in contract on the basis that it undertook to perform the work in question for the respondent and delegated that performance to the independent contractor. This being so, the issue must be as to the extent of the duty owed to a claimant by a person who contracts with an independent contractor to do work, not for himself, but for the claimant, at the claimant's request, if the claimant's own property is then damaged because of negligence on the part of the independent contractor who is working on it. The only connection of the appellant with the matter was the actual hiring of the services of the independent contractor and providing him with the necessary staging from which to do the work. What duty, in these circumstances, does the appellant owe to the respondent?\nIn my opinion, that duty was no more than to exercise reasonable care in the selection of a competent independent contractor to perform the work. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the choice made by the appellant was an improper one and, therefore, there is no evidence of a breach of that duty.\nFor the foregoing reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Parkinson, Gardiner, Roberts, Anderson, Conlin & Fitzpatrick, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: G.

Maritime Rock Products Ltd., [1963] S.C.R. 347\nDate: 1963-06-24\nModern Construction Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nMaritime Rock Products Limited (Defendant) Respondent\n1963: February 22; 1963: June 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA\nMechanics' liens\u2014Whether last work done under contract performed within 45 days of filing of lien as required by statute\u2014Interest in lands\u2014Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 171, s. 23.\nThe plaintiff, a general construction company, entered into a contract whereby it agreed among other things to repair and extend a causeway and convert a ship into a wharf at a certain property where the defendant was carrying on the business of quarrying, selling and shipping stone. It was provided that the work would be substantially completed by June 1 so that the defendant would have its plant and wharf ready for the opening of the shipping season, and a list of the drawings and specifications was set out in the contract. By June 16 the wharf and causeway were temporarily operational. The substantial amount of work that remained to be done in order to bring the contract to completion was started on September 6 and completed on September 27. The plaintiff filed a mechanics' lien on October 17 and brought an action to enforce its claim. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the trial judge granted the defendant's motion for nonsuit on the ground that the last work proved to have been done under the contract was completed on June 16, and therefore not within 45 days of the filing of the lien, as required by s. 23 of the Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 171. The trial judgment having been affirmed on appeal, the plaintiff further appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nBy the terms of the contract the plaintiff assumed an obligation to do everything indicated in the specifications and drawings which included sinking the ship complete with superstructure and extending the causeway to the ship. This work was not completed by providing temporary facilities which were not suitable to withstand the winter weather in the area. The evidence in the case constituted prima facie proof of the fact that the plaintiff had not done all that it promised to do under the contract until about September 27, and that the last work done by it thereunder was accordingly performed within 45 days of the registration of the lien. County of Lambton v. Canadian Comstock Co. et al., [1960] S.C.R. 86, followed.\nAs to the defendant's contention that no prima facie case had been established to show that the defendant had any estate or interest in the lands described in the statement of claim, there was evidence to the effect that work was done and materials were supplied \"in respect of\" lands as to which there was some evidence of the defendant's interest. The validity of the lien was not destroyed by the fact that the descrip- tion in the statement of claim and claim for lien included together with those lands, certain Crown lands to which no lien attached.\nPractice\u2014Judgment granting motion for nonsuit reversed on appeal\u2014Action referred back to trial judge.\nThe trial judge heard the defendant's motion for nonsuit in accordance with the submission of its counsel that he could be prejudiced if he was required to proceed before the Court decided on the issues raised. This left the defendant's counsel in a position where he was entitled to assume that he would be permitted to proceed if the motion were decided against him. In view of these circumstances it would be unjust for the defendant to be precluded from proceeding with its case, and it was therefore directed that the action be referred back to the trial judge so that the trial might proceed in the usual course.

Electric Ry. and Knap, [1946] 1 W.W.R. 232; Yuill v. Yuill, [1945] P. 15, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco, affirming a judgment of McKinnon C.C.J., dismissing appellant's claim in a mechanics' lien action. Appeal allowed.\nA. L. Caldwell, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. R. Moreira, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco affirming a judgment rendered at trial by His Honour Judge A. H. McKinnon whereby he dismissed the appellant's claim for a lien under the Mechanics' Lien Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 171, at the close of the appellant's case on the ground that the evidence then adduced did not establish a prima facie case to prove that the last work done under the contract upon which the claim is based was performed within 45 days of the filing of the lien on October 17, 1961, as required by the provisions of s. 23 of the said Act.\nThe claim is for work and labour done, services rendered and materials supplied by the appellant, which is a company engaged in the general construction business, under a contract dated April 20, 1961, whereby it agreed among other things to repair and extend a causeway and convert a ship into a wharf at a property situate at Malignant Cove, in the County of Antigonish, where the respondent was carrying on the business of quarrying, selling and shipping stone. The making of this contract appears to have been first discussed at a meeting of the directors of the respondent company on April 16, 1961, at which representatives of the appellant were present. At this meeting it was disclosed that the respondent company, which has since become bankrupt, was in serious financial difficulties and that it was necessary for it to have its plant and wharf put in operational condition by the opening of the summer shipping season in June. It was reported also that the Nova Scotia Government had not yet made any final decision on the company's application for a loan of $100,000 \"to take care of building a new wharf and to put the plant at Malignant Cove into operation\", and it was pointed out that this decision might not be made until the middle of May whereas the work had to be done immediately. Some discussion followed concerning an offer by the appellant company to undertake the work forthwith, the upshot of which is perhaps best described in a letter written to the appellant by the respondent on April 20 which reads in part as follows:\nAt a meeting of the Directors on April 15, 1961, it was proposed that Modern Construction Limited, Moncton, be granted a contract in the sum of $75,000 to carry out the construction of a wharf and certain repairs as per instructions which you already have, to the tunnel and conveyor of the Company's premises at Malignant Cove, construction operations to commence immediately and Modern Construction to wait until such time as Maritime Rock Products have completed proper financial arrangements for payment of this contract. It was further decided that if Modern Construction Limited would immediately commence operations and be prepared to await payment at a future date, then in consideration of this valuable service, Maritime Rock Products Limited would cause to be issued to Modern Construction Limited as a bonus, 78,948 shares of common capital stock of the Company at the purchase price of 5 cents per share.\nThe appellant having replied accepting this offer, a contract was prepared and executed by the parties on April 20 which included the following provisions:\nARTICLE I. The Contractor will:\n(a) provide all the materials and perform all the work shown on the Drawings and described in the Specifications \u2026 which have been signed in duplicate by both parties \u2026\n(b) do and fulfill everything indicated by this Agreement, the General Conditions of the Contract, the Specifications, and the Drawings, and\n(c) complete substantially as certified by the architect, all the work by the 1st day of June. ARTICLE II. The following is an exact list of the drawings and specifications referred to in Article I:\n(a) carry out repairs to existing causeway and to extend causeway to ship,\n(b) preparing ship for sinking, towing ship to site and sinking ship complete with superstructure.\n(a) and (b) to be carried out as detailed on attached blueprints designated Schedules \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\".\n* * *\nIt is understood that Maritime Rock Products Limited will supply all materials presently on site cost free to Modern Construction Limited, and it is further understood that Modern Construction Limited will supply all materials not otherwise located on the site.\nARTICLE III. The owner will:\n(a) pay the contractor in lawful money of Canada for the materials and services aforesaid Seventy-five Thousand dollars ($75,000) subject to additions and deductions as provided in the General Conditions of the Contract.\nNo architect was engaged under the contract and the only provision with respect to the method of payment was that it would be made\non receipt of funds from Nova Scotia Government loan or the making of other satisfactory arrangements.\nWork was commenced at the end of April or early in May 1961 and the evidence discloses that by June 16 the wharf and causeway were temporarily operational so that ships were able to come alongside and load the respondent's rock for the opening of the shipping season. It does not, however, appear that any further work was done during the summer months and the appellant's comptroller, the respondent's general manager, and the foreman on the job all testified that the substantial amount of work remaining to be done in order to bring the contract to completion was not started until September 6 and only completed on or about September 27.\nNone of this evidence is contradicted as the respondent's motion for nonsuit was granted at the close of the appellant's case on the ground that the last work proved to have been done under the contract was completed by June 16.\nIt is not disputed that under the provisions of s. 23 of the Mechanics' Lien Act the lien here in question was required to be registered within 45 days after the completion or abandonment of the contract but as has been indicated it is the appellant's contention that the work done in September 1961 was done pursuant to the contract and that registration of the lien on October 17 was therefore in conformity with the statutory requirements. The respondent, on the other hand, contends, as the Courts below have found, that the appellant's contractual obligation was completely fulfilled by having the shipping facilities available for transport and that this was done in the month of June and therefore more than 45 days before the registration of the lien.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Judge McKinnon refers at length to the evidence of Mr. Ingalls, the appellant's comptroller, in which that witness agrees that the two principal items discussed at the directors' meeting of April 15 were that the respondent's wharf be made suitable for accommodating vessels and that the plant had to be made ready for the summer season. The learned trial judge quotes the following excerpts from the cross-examination of Mr. Ingalls regarding these two items:\nQ. Isn't it true that those were substantially done by the 19th of June of that year?\nA. The answer to that has to be a little indirect in that there was such a tremendous rush to get, the plant into operation and take advantage to the shipping contract.\nQ. But those two necessary items we just discussed\u2014they were completed June 19th.\nA. It was possible. I visited the site by that time and. enough had been done that temporarily it was possible to operate the plant for shipping material. It would be shown the shipping date was very quickly achieved.df\nQ. (by the Court): What is the answer to that question. The work contemplated by the agreement was completed by June?\nA. It was possible to begin shipping quickly on a basis that was almost temporary. The company had entered into the contract with Mussens of Canada whereby if the shipping was not moving there would be heavy penalties. It was possible to achieve shipping by that date.\nThe interpretation placed on the contract by Judge McKinnon appears to be based in large measure upon this evidence, as to which he states:\nIt would appear to me that this evidence indicates the full purpose and extent of the contract. It was necessary to get the plant in operation and shipping facilities available for transport at some date in June, or the company would be subject to heavy penalties. That it was this concept which controlled the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge is shown by the following two paragraphs from his decision:\nIt appears that the contract called for substantial compliance with the terms of the contract by June 1st and it would seem from the evidence herein that all the work contemplated by the contract was performed by the plaintiff by the early part of that month, and a careful review of the testimony of Mr. Ingalls, Mr. Chapman, as well as an examination of Schedules \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" under the contract.\nIn September, after the conclusion of the shipping season, the plaintiff proceeded to do further work on the causeway and boat although he must have been fully aware that he had no prospect of payment from the proceeds of a Nova Scotia Government loan as provided in the contract or, as it may be fairly assumed, from any other source. In view of this, it can well be that the defendant has some cause to contend that the plaintiff was simply securing the ship and causeway against the heavy winter weather to be expected in this area and this work had no connection with the purpose for which the contract was entered into.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me from a consideration of the terms of the contract itself that the appellant had thereby assumed an obligation to do everything indicated in the specifications and drawings which included sinking the ship complete with superstructure and extending the causeway to the ship and that this work was not completed by providing temporary facilities which were not suitable to withstand the winter weather in the area. It was no doubt recognized by all concerned with the project that it was necessary for the respondent to have its wharf and causeway in operational condition by the opening of the summer shipping season and it could be inferred from the evidence that the appellant had agreed to bring this about but this does not, in my opinion, justify the further inference that no more work was to be done under the contract or that the wharf and causeway were intended to be temporary structures only.\nMr. Chapman, to whose evidence the learned trial judge refers, was the respondent's general manager and one of the signatories to the contract on its behalf. In the course of his evidence this witness was specifically directed to the contract specifications and the attached drawings, and after referring to them he stated that in the month of September \"approximately 35\u201345% of the rock was yet to be placed in and around the boat and causeway and 15\u201320% piling had to be completed around the back of the boat\" in order to complete the work indicated by those documents. In my view, this evidence was admissible and constituted prima facie proof of work having been done under the contract in September 1961.\nIn affirming the decision of the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice MacQuarrie who delivered the reasons for judgment of the Supreme Court in banco had occasion to say that \"the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in this case indicate the value and importance of the learned trial judge having seen and heard the witnesses. This Court considering all the circumstances should attach great weight to this opinion\".\nThe value and importance of seeing and hearing the witnesses which is enjoyed by the trial judge and denied to an appellate court should never be underestimated, but in the present case as the evidence for the appellant is entirely uncontradicted and as I do not read the learned trial judge's reasons and conclusion as being inconsistent with his having believed this evidence I do not, with respect, feel that this Court is under the same disadvantage as is the case where there is some conflict of evidence or some indication that the demeanour of the witnesses has affected the result. As I interpret the decision of the trial judge, it is based upon his construction of the contract and the fact that he differs in this regard from some of the witnesses does not, in my opinion, indicate that he was influenced by their demeanour.\nIn holding that \"the September work does not confer or revive any lien\", Mr. Justice MacQuarrie made reference to the case of County of Lambton v. Canadian Comstock Company Ltd. et al.1 In that case, Judson J., speaking on behalf of this Court, with respect to s. 21(1) of the Ontario Mechanics' Lien Act, said at pp. 93\u20134:\nThe fact that a contractor, who has substantially completed his work, may sue for the contract price, subject to deductions for minor defects or omissions, if there are any, does not and cannot determine when time begins to run against him under The Mechanics' Lien Act. Completion means what it says. I do not think that time begins to run under s. 21(1) until it can be said that the contractor or sub-contractor has done all that he promised to do and is entitled to maintain his account for the full amount. In my opinion, this language applies with equal force to s. 23 of the Nova Scotia Mechanics' Lien Act and as I have indicated, the evidence in the present case appears to me to constitute prima facie proof of the fact that the appellant had not done \"all that it promised to do\" under the contract here in question until about September 27, 1961, and that the last work done by it thereunder was accordingly performed within 45 days of the registration of the lien on October 17.\nThis does not, however, dispose of this appeal as the respondent's motion for nonsuit was also based on the ground that no prima facie case had been established to show that the respondent had any estate or interest in the lands described in the statement of claim, or that the appellant had contracted to do any work on those lands, or that the amount claimed was owed with respect to work performed thereon.\nThe lands described in the statement of claim are said to be situate \"at or near Malignant Cove, in the County of Antigonish, and to border on the highway leading from Georgeville to Malignant Cove\". This description includes \"a certain causeway\", \"the conveyor to the causeway\", and \"the hull of a sunken ship\", and while denying that it is \"the registered owner of the lands\" the respondent pleaded, by para. 4(f) of its defence:\nIn the further alternative, that the bankrupt is not the owner of the lands and premises referred to \u2026 but is entitled only to the equity of redemption in certain portions thereof, the same (in so far as the bankrupt has any interest therein) being subject to a mortgage the holder whereof is the owner of the legal estate and fee simple in the said lands and premises.\nIn the course of his evidence, Mr. Chapman was asked where the causeway on which the work was done was located, and he replied \"off the causeway and wharf adjacent to the plant and situate at Georgeville, Malignant Cove, Antigonish area\". It will be remembered also that in its letter of April 20 the respondent described the work to be done as \"to carry out the construction of a wharf and certain repairs \u2026 to the tunnel and conveyor to the company's premises at Malignant Cove \u2026\". The attitude adopted by the appellant is made plain in its factum, where it is said:\nThe estate or interest of the defendant in the lands described in the statement of claim is of two kinds:\n(1) actual possession of the causeway and ship located on lands of the Crown, and\n(2) the holder of the equity of redemption in the remaining lands described in the statement of claim and claim for lien.\nAs to the lands other than the Crown lands, although the proof is slim indeed I do not think that it can be said that there is no evidence of the respondent having an estate or interest therein capable of being the subject of a mechanics' lien.\nThe respondent, which held itself out to be the owner of these lands when the contract was made and accepted the work and labour on that basis, is at a grave disadvantage when, having called no evidence to disprove its estate or interest in such lands, it seeks to have the action dismissed on the ground that no such estate or interest has been shown to exist. Under such circumstances, the Court is, in my opinion, entitled to resolve any doubts as to the respondent\u2019s interest in the lands in favour of the lien claimant.\nAs to the ship and causeway, I am not prepared to hold that mere possession without any claim or colour of right coupled with an admission that the lands in question belong to the Crown can give rise to an estate or interest in lands capable of being the subject of a mechanics' lien. In this regard, reference may usefully be had to the reasons for judgment rendered by Laidlaw J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Pankka v. Butchart et al.2\nIt is, however, to be remembered that a lien attaches to \"any estate or interest in the land upon or in respect of which the work or service is done or materials are placed or furnished \u2026\" (s. 1(d) and s. 5) and I am of opinion that there is some evidence to the effect that the work done and materials supplied to the wharf and causeway were done and supplied \"in respect of\" the remaining lands as to which there is some evidence of the respondent's interest, and I do not think that the validity of the lien is destroyed by the fact that the description in the statement of claim and claim for lien includes together with those lands, certain Crown lands to which no lien attaches.\nIn conclusion, I should add that it appears to me that there was also some evidence that the amount claimed in the statement of claim was owed pursuant to work done under the contract hereinbefore referred to.\nIn view of all the above, I would allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court in banco and of the learned trial judge.\nIn his factum, the appellant's counsel asks that judgment be entered for the relief claimed in the statement of claim but we did not hear argument on this phase of the matter and we were referred to no reported case, nor have I been able to find one, establishing the practice in Nova Scotia when a judgment granting a motion for nonsuit is reversed on appeal.\nThe practice under such circumstances appears to be well established in Ontario (see McKee v. Fisher3), Alberta (see Hayhurst v. Innisfail Motors Ltd.4), and in British Columbia (see Cudworth v. Eddy5, and Protopappas v. B.C. Electric Ry. and Knap6), and is well described by Harvey C.J. in the Hayhurst case, supra, where he said at p. 277:\n\u2026 we see no reason why we should not apply the same rule of practice as that of Ontario. It is to be understood therefore that for the future when a defendant applies for a dismissal at the close of the plaintiff's case he does so at the risk of not having the right to give any evidence on his own behalf for if the trial Judge grants his application and the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that it was wrong, it will feel itself at liberty to finally dispose of the case on the evidence already given and will do so unless in its discretion it considers that in the interests of justice some other course should be taken.\nThe English practice in this regard is discussed by Lord Greene in Yuill v. Yuill7, where, after referring to Laurie v. Raglan Building Co. Ltd.8, he goes on to say:\nThe practice which has been laid down amounts to no more than a direction to the judge to put counsel who desires to make a submission of no case to his election, and to refuse to rule unless counsel elects to call no evidence. Where counsel has so elected he is, of course, bound: but if for any reason, be it through oversight or (as here) through a misapprehension as to the nature of counsel's argument, the judge does not put counsel to his election, and no election in fact takes place, counsel is entitled to call his evidence just as if he had never made the submission.\nIn the present case, the learned trial judge explained his reasons for entertaining the respondent's motion for nonsuit on the following basis:\nIt was further contended by the defendant that as none of these essentials were properly and sufficiently established, the case for the defendant could be prejudiced if he was required to proceed before the Court decided on the issues raised. Accordingly, decision was reserved and the trial adjourned until today \u2026\nIt appears to me that the learned trial judge heard the respondent's motion in accordance with the submission of its counsel that he could \"be prejudiced if he was required to proceed before the Court decided on the issues raised\". In my view, this left the respondent's counsel in a position where he was entitled to assume that he would be permitted to proceed if the motion were decided against him.\nIn view of these circumstances, I am of opinion that it would be unjust for the respondent to be precluded from proceeding with its case and I would therefore direct that the action be referred back to the learned trial judge so that the trial may proceed in the usual course.\nThe appellant should have the costs of this appeal and of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco. The costs of the trial, however, should abide the result thereof.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: A. L.

On an application to decide whether the bequest constituted a valid charitable trust, the trial judge held that the bequest was charitable. The Court of Appeal held that it was not. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the bishop did not take beneficially but as trustee and that by virtue of his office, the gift was limited to his charities or works arising from his religious responsibilities as the bishop. The trial judge held that by saying \"mais pour les \u0153uvres qui aideraient la cause des Canadiens fran\u00e7ais dans son dioc\u00e8se\", the testator was merely confining the charities within a certain field and that these were words of limitation in no way affecting the gift as a charity. The Court of Appeal held that these words enlarged the field of application of the bequest, and no longer made it imperative to apply it to purposes strictly charitable. An appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe Court held that this particular gift to the bishop was charitable by virtue of his office and that the testator did not step outside the charitable field in imposing the limitation to work among French Canadians.

Locke, Q.C., and D. G. Blair, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. G. Crepeau, for the plaintiffs, respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The question in this litigation is whether a certain disposition made in the will of the Reverend Father George Emile Touchet, parish priest at Duke Lake, Saskatchewan, dated August 14, 1955, is charitable. The will was in holograph form and written in French in the following words:\nJe d\u00e9signe et nomme Son Excellence Mgr. L\u00e9o Blais, mon \u00e9v\u00eaque, comme mon ex\u00e9cuteur et mon l\u00e9gataire universel. Je lui l\u00e8gue donc tout ce que je poss\u00e8de de biens, (\u00e0 part ce qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu, donn\u00e9 et confi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Jules Couture ou son associ\u00e9 \u00e0 266 ouest St. Jacques, Montr\u00e9al, P.Q.) \u00e0 lui Mgr. L\u00e9o Biais, \u00e9v\u00eaque de Prince Albert, pour ses \u0153uvres, mais pour les \u0153uvres qui aideraient la cause des Canadiens Fran\u00e7ais dans son dioc\u00e8se.\nThe following literal translation into English was accepted by the Court of Appeal:\nI designate and appoint His Excellency Mgr. Leo Blais, my Bishop, as my Executor and my universal Legatee. I therefore give and bequeath to him all the property that I own (except that which has already been provided for, given and entrusted to Mr. Jules Couture or his associate at 266 St. James West, Montreal, P.Q.) to him Mgr. Leo Blais, Bishop of Prince Albert, for his works, but for such of the works as would aid the cause of the French Canadians of his diocese.\nIn the translation attached to the Letters Probate issued on December 15, 1959, \"\u0153uvres\" is translated \"charities\" on each occasion of its use. In the translation accepted by the Court of Appeal it is literally translated as \"works\". McKercher J. held that the bequest was charitable. The Court of Appeal2 held that it was not. The conflict is not as direct as the result might suggest. Both McKercher J. and the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the bishop did not take beneficially but as trustee and that by virtue of his office, the gift was limited to his charities or works arising from his religious responsibilities as the bishop. McKercher J. held that by saying \"mais pour les \u0153uvres qui aideraient la cause des Canadiens fran\u00e7ais dans son dioc\u00e8se\", the testator was merely confining the charities within a certain field and that these were words of limitation in no way affecting the gift as a charity.\nThe Court of Appeal differed on this one point. They held that these words enlarged the field of application of the bequest, and no longer made it imperative to apply it to purposes strictly charitable. As a matter of construction, I cannot adopt this view. To me the construction put upon the bequest by McKercher J. is the correct one. Our task is to determine what this testator meant. He was an educated man and writing in his mother tongue. His bequest was to his bishop as trustee for certain purposes. This bequest to the bishop by virtue of his office is held to be charitable in both Courts. We must assume that the testator knew what he was doing, that he knew the meaning of his own words and the religious responsibilities of the bishop. Dictionary definitions recognize the use of \"\u0153uvre\" in this context. I quote from:\n(a) Larousse du XXe Si\u00e8cle:\nAdmin. Eccl\u00e9s. Fabrique d'une paroisse, revenu affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la construction, \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration des b\u00e2timents, \u00e0 l'achat et \u00e0 l'entretien des objets n\u00e9cessaires au service divin.\n(b) Littr\u00e9, Dictionnaire de la Langue fran\u00e7aise, Tome 5, (1957):\nEn un sens plus restreint, bonnes \u0153uvres, les charit\u00e9s que l'on fait, soit pour soulager les pauvres, soit pour des fondations pieuses ou charitables.\n(c) B\u00e9lisle, Dictionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Langue fran\u00e7aise au Canada:\nToute sorte d'actions morales. Bonnes \u0153uvres, actions inspir\u00e9es par une morale pure et active; les charit\u00e9s que l'on fait.\nWith this well-recognized meaning of the word in the French language and its use in a will by a French-speaking parish priest who knew what he was writing about, it would, in my opinion, be error to hold that because he mentioned the application of the bequest in the terms above quoted, among French Canadians in the diocese, by so doing he stepped outside the charitable field.\nThis problem is one of construction in each particular case. Fine distinctions have been made from time to time and it is not always easy to see why in one case a court would decide that a case fell on the charitable side of the line and in another case on the non-charitable side. Evershed M.R. in In re Rumball3 reviewed all the recent litigation where these problems have arisen. The following is his summary in one of the opening paragraphs of his judgment:\nQuestions of this kind are notoriously difficult and, no doubt, the distinctions illustrated by the cases appear at times very fine. Thus, a gift to the vicar and churchwardens of a particular parish \"for such uses as they shall, in their sole discretion, think fit\"; and a gift \"to His Eminence the Archbishop of Westminster Cathedral, London, for the time being to be used by him for such purposes as he shall, in his absolute discretion, think fit\" have been held to be good charitable gifts (In re Garrard, [1907] 1 Ch. 382, and In re Flinn, [1948] 1 All E. R. 541). But a gift to the Archbishop of Brisbane for such purposes \"as the Archbishop may judge most conducive to the good of religion in this diocese\" has been held by the Privy Council to be bad (Dunne v. Byrne, [1912] A.C. 407). Again, a gift to a vicar \"for parish work\" has been held bad by the House of Lords in Farley v. Westminster Bank [1939] 3 All E.R. 491; but a gift to a vicar to be used by him as he should think fit \"for his work in the parish\" was held in 1946 by Romer J. to be good (In re Simson, [1946] 2 All E.R. 220); and in In re Beddy in 1953, unreported, where the words of the gift bore a resemblance (at least) to those in the present case\u2014for they were a gift \"to the Roman Catholic prelate who shall be Archbishop of Westminster at the time of my death, to use for such purposes in the diocese as he may choose\"\u2014Harman J., expressing himself as not willing to add to the fineness of the distinctions already made, held the gift to be bad.\nA recent author, Keeton in The Modern Law of Charities (1962) p. 65, has commented that this branch of the law of charities is suffering from over-technicality. I join with others who have said that they do not wish to add to it. I therefore follow the line of reasoning in In re Garrad, In re Flinn and In re Rumball and hold that this particular gift to the bishop is charitable by virtue of his office and that the testator did not step outside the charitable field in imposing the limitation to work among French Canadians.\nI would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of McKercher J. In the circumstances, I would direct that the costs of both parties, here and in the Court of Appeal, be paid out of the estate, those of the executor as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Cuelenaere & Hall, Prince Albert.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Crepeau & Simonot, Prince Albert.\n1 (1962), 38 W.W.R. 587, 34 D.L.R.

The defendant insurance company issued to the plaintiff a \"Contractors Public Liability Policy\". Endorsement No. 1 of the policy provided for the payment of \"all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages because of injury to or destruction of property, caused by accident \u2026\". It further provided that \"this endorsement shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim arising or existing by reason of \u2026 (1) liability or obligation assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement \u2026\". As the result of faulty design and miscalculation, portions of the uncompleted superstructure collapsed upon and seriously damaged two of the piers. Under the contract, the plaintiff assumed all responsibility for loss or damage to any portion of the bridge structure, arising out of faulty work or faulty design on its part. The plaintiff admitted that the accident resulted from its negligence and accepted liability and then claimed against its insurer.\nThe trial judge held that the above exclusion clause only excluded liability arising from contract and not claims arising out of concurrent liability in tort. The Court of Appeal held that the liability in question had been assumed by the plaintiff under its contract with the Bridge Authority and that it came squarely within the exclusion and that it was immaterial that such liability was tortous liability independently of contract. \"Liability imposed by law\" and \"liability assumed under contract\" were for one and the same loss. That being so, liability, even though imposed by law, was excluded from the coverage. From this decision the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nFor the reasons given by the Court of Appeal, the Court held that the present claim was within the exclusion clause. The Canadian Indemnity Co. v. Andrews & George Co. Ltd. [1953] 1 S.C.R. 19, followed; Featherstone v. Canadian General Insurance Co., [1959] O.R. 274, disapproved.

Ogilvy, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., and A. D. McEachran, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Dominion Bridge Company Limited sued the Toronto General Insurance Company for a declaration that it was entitled to indemnity in the sum of $358,102.81, being the agreed cost to Dominion Bridge of repairing damage to piers nos. 13 and 14 of the Second Narrows Bridge in Burrard Inlet caused on June 17, 1958, when span no. 4 and partially constructed span no. 5 of the steel superstructure of the bridge collapsed. The trial judge gave judgment in favour of Dominion Bridge for the agreed sum. The Court of Appeal[2] reversed this judgment on the ground that the liability in question came within the exclusion clause in the insurance policy on which the action was brought. Dominion Bridge now seeks restoration of the judgment given at the trial.\nOn August 7, 1957, Dominion Bridge contracted with the British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridges Authority to construct the steel superstructure of Second Narrows Bridge to connect the City of Vancouver with the north shore of the Burrard Inlet. The concrete piers upon which the superstructure was to be placed had already been erected by the Authority but it was the duty of Dominion Bridge to erect any temporary supports, called in the evidence \"falsework\". Under the contract, Dominion Bridge assumed all responsibility for loss or damage to any portion of the bridge structure, which would include the piers, arising out of faulty work or faulty design on its part. Due to faulty design and miscalculation, the falsework buckled and caused portions of the uncompleted superstructure to collapse upon and seriously damage the piers. Dominion Bridge admitted that the accident resulted from its negligence and accepted liability and then claimed against its insurer. The insurance company issued what is called a \"Contractors Public Liability Policy\" for all damages arising out of bodily injury, sickness, disease or death caused by an accident resulting from the work or operations. This was subject to an exclusion of the liability of the insured under the workmen's compensation law and for injuries to employees of the insured arising out of and in the course of the employment. We are not concerned with this aspect of the policy but with endorsement number I which is called \"Contractors Property Damage Endorsement\".\nThe relevant parts of endorsement 1 read:\nIn consideration of an additional premium and subject to the Statements, Exclusions and Special Conditions, hereby further agrees with the Named Insured:\nA. To pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the Insured by law for damages because of injury to or destruction of property, caused by accident occurring within the Policy Period and while this Endorsement is in force and resulting from or while at or about the work or operations of the Insured designated as an insured risk under a Section or Sections of Statement 4.\nThis Endorsement shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim arising or existing by reason of any of the following matters: (1) liability or obligation assumed by the Insured under any contract or agreement; (2) injury to or destruction of (a) property used, owned or occupied by, rented or leased to, or in the care, custody or control of, the Insured \u2026\nThe trial judge held that the first exclusion clause only excluded liability arising from contract and not claims arising out of concurrent liability in tort. The Court of Appeal held that the liability in question had been assumed by Dominion Bridge under its contract with the Bridge Authority and that it came squarely within the first exclusion clause and that it was immaterial that such liability was tortious liability independently of contract. \"Liability imposed by law\" and \"liability assumed under contract\" were for one and the same loss. That being so, liability, even though imposed by law, was excluded from the coverage.\nI agree with and adopt the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal on this point based as it is on the applica- tion of the judgment of this Court in The Canadian Indemnity Co. v. Andrews & George Co. Ltd.[3] and their rejection of the interpretation put on this judgment by the learned trial judge, who had founded his judgment on Featherstone v. Canadian General Insurance Co.[4]. In my respectful opinion, there is direct conflict between the judgment of the learned trial judge in this case and the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Featherstone case on the one hand and the judgment of this Court in Andrews & George, and for the reasons given in the judgment under appeal, I would hold that the present claim is within the first exclusion.\nIt is unnecessary to deal with the second exclusion clause which excludes liability if there is injury to or destruction of (a) property used, owned or occupied by, rented or leased to, or in the care, custody or control of, the insured. The learned trial judge held against this exclusion. In this he was supported in the Court of Appeal in the reasons for judgment of the learned Chief Justice. Sheppard J. A., however, held that the use made of the piers by Dominion Bridge in order to erect its superstructure and as part of its method of construction, constituted such piers \"property used by the Insured\". He therefore held that liability for the damage to these piers was also excluded by the second clause. Davey J.A. expressed no opinion.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Harper, Gilmour, Grey, de Vooght & Levis, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Russell & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1962), 37 W.W.R. 673, 32 D.L.R.

The claim was upon a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, the judgment being in respect of a claim for taxes. As a result of pre-trial hearings it was stipulated that judgment might be entered against the defendant for a stated amount, which was less than the amount originally claimed, and pursuant to this stipulation judgment was entered. An application to set aside the writ and all subsequent proceedings was granted by the judge who heard the motion on the ground that the action was an attempt to enforce the revenue laws of a foreign State. This judgment was upheld unanimously by the Court of Appeal. An appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nA foreign State cannot escape the application of the rule that in no circumstances will the courts directly or indirectly enforce the revenue laws of another country, which is one of public policy, by taking a judgment in its own courts and bringing suit here on that judgment. The claim asserted remains a claim for taxes. It has not, in our courts, merged in the judgment; enforcement of the judgment would be enforcement of the tax claim.\nSimilarly, the argument that the claim asserted was simply for the performance of an agreement, made for good consideration, to pay a stated sum of money also failed. The Court was concerned not with form but with substance, and if it could properly be said that the defendant made an agreement it was simply an agreement to pay taxes which by the laws of the foreign State she was obligated to pay.\nNeither the foreign judgment nor the agreement did more than make certain the fact and the amount of the defendant's liability to the plaintiff. The nature of the liabiliy was not altered. It was a liability to pay income tax.\nAs to the argument that the judge of first instance ought not to have set aside the writ but should have directed that the action proceed to trial, the Court agreed with the view of the judge that it was clear that all the relevant facts were before the Court and nothing would have been gained by directing that the action proceed to trial.\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance (Revenue Division) v. Taylor, [1955] A.C. 491; Peter Buchanan Ld. & Macharg v. McVey, [1955] A.C. 516, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from an order of Maclean J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and J. G. Alley, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. W. de B. Farris, Q.C., and J. M. Giles, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dismissing an appeal from an order of Maclean J. which set aside the writ of summons issued by the appellant against the respondent and all subsequent proceedings.\nThe writ was issued in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 20, 1961. It was specially endorsed. The claim was \"upon a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Central Division, in the United States of America dated and filed the 10th day of March, 1961, and entered the 13th day of March, 1961\". The amount claimed in Canadian currency was $602,919.10.\nBy order dated May 4, 1961, Collins J. gave leave to the respondent to enter a conditional appearance. This order provided that any appearance entered by the respondent should be unconditional unless application were made within ten days to set aside the writ of summons. A motion to set aside the writ and all subsequent proceedings was made within the time limited. On the return of the motion affidavits were read on behalf of both parties and there is no dispute as to the relevant facts.\nOn June 10,1957, an action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that the respondent was indebted for taxes for the year 1945 in the sum of $264,117.23 and for the year 1946 in the sum of $603,844.78. The respondent through her attorney-at-law filed an answer alleging that the deficiency for income tax for the year 1945 was the sum of $96,040.27 and denying that there was any liability for tax for the year 1946.\nAs a result of pre-trial hearings before a district judge it was stipulated that judgment might be entered against the respondent for the sum of $200,037.28 in respect of the year 1945 being the sum of $96,040.27 and interest to March 10, 1961, and for the sum of $439,462.87 in respect of the year 1946 being $219,557.96 and interest to March 10, 1961.\nPursuant to this stipulation judgment was signed on March 10, 1961, and entered on March 13, 1961; an exemplification is produced as Exhibit \"A\" to an affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant. It consists of a single document headed \"Stipulation for Judgment and Judgment\" and shews on its face that it is for taxes assessed upon the income of the respondent for the years 1945 and 1946 for which the respondent is indebted to the appellant, together with interest thereon to the date of the judgment. The judgment as signed orders that the plaintiff recover against the defendant $609,500.15. The obvious error in addition was corrected by a subsequent \"Stipulation and order re amendment of judgment\" to make the judgment read $639,500.15 in place of $609,500.15.\nThe respondent has paid nothing on account of the judgment and is now resident in the Province of British Columbia.\nThe ground set up in the notice of motion to set aside the writ reads: \"that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the claim endorsed thereon\".\nAt the conclusion of the argument of the motion before Maclean J., which occupied three days, that learned judge gave judgment orally setting aside the writ on the ground that the action was an attempt to enforce the revenue laws of a foreign State; he later delivered written reasons examining in detail the arguments of counsel for the appellant and a number of authorities. His judgment was upheld by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal the reasons for which were delivered by Sheppard J.A. Counsel inform us that there is a mistake of fact in the reasons of Sheppard J.A. when, speaking of the proceedings before Maclean J., he says: \"After preliminary objection, it was agreed that the motion be dealt with as a motion for judgment\", and that what actually occurred is correctly stated in the following passage in the reasons of Maclean J.:\nDuring the hearing of the preliminary objection counsel for the plaintiff offered to agree to proceed with this motion as a motion for judgment upon a point of law if the defendant would consent to file an unconditional appearance. This offer was not accepted.\nIt is suggested that this is relevant to the third point argued before us on behalf of the appellant, to which reference will be made later.\nNeither in this Court nor in the Courts below did counsel for the appellant question the well-established general rules (i) that a foreign State is precluded from suing in this country for taxes due under the law of the foreign State, and (ii) that in a foreign judgment there is no merger of the original cause of action. Ample authority for both of these propositions is to be found in the reasons of Sheppard J.A.\nThree arguments were put forward in support of the appeal.\nFirst, it was submitted that although a claim for taxes made by a foreign State would not be entertained in the courts of this country a judgment for payment of those taxes obtained in the courts of the foreign State will be enforced here.\nSecondly, it was submitted that the courts of this country will enforce an agreement by way of compromise made for valuable consideration to pay an amount of money in satisfaction of a claim for foreign taxes.\nThirdly, it was submitted that, in any event, the learned judge of first instance ought not to have set aside the writ but should have directed that the action proceed to trial.\nIn my opinion all these submissions were rightly rejected by the Courts below.\nThe rule that the courts of this country will not entertain a suit by a foreign State to recover a tax has been restated recently by the House of Lords in Government of India, Ministry of Finance (Revenue Division) v. Taylor[3]. At p. 503, Viscount Simonds adopted the following passage from the judgment of Rowlatt J. in The King of the Hellenes v. Brostron[4]:\nIt is perfectly elementary that a foreign government cannot come here\u2014nor will the courts of other countries allow our Government to go there\u2014and sue a person found in that jurisdiction for taxes levied and which he is declared to be liable to in the country to which he belongs.\nAt p. 504, Viscount Simonds also adopted the following from the judgment of Tomlin J., as he then was, in In re Visser, The Queen of Holland v. Drukker[5]:\nMy own opinion is that there is a well-recognized rule, which has been enforced for at least 200 years or thereabouts, under which these courts will not collect the taxes of foreign States for the benefit of the sovereigns of those foreign States; and this is one of those actions which these courts will not entertain.\nVarious reasons have been suggested for this ancient rule. In his speech in Government of India, Ministry of Finance (Revenue Division) v. Taylor, supra, Lord Keith of Avonholm having approved of the judgment of Kingsmill Moore J. in the High Court of Eire in Peter Buchanan Ld. & Macharg v. McVey, reported as a note in [1955] A.C. 516, and particularly of the proposition \"that in no circumstances will the courts directly or indirectly enforce the revenue laws of another country\", goes on at pp. 511 and 512 to suggest two explanations, as follows:\nOne explanation of the rule thus illustrated may be thought to be that enforcement of a claim for taxes is but an extension of the sovereign power which imposed the taxes, and that an assertion of sovereign authority by one State within the territory of another, as distinct from a patrimonial claim by a foreign sovereign, is (treaty or convention apart) contrary to all concepts of independent sovereignties. Another explanation has been given by an eminent American judge, Judge Learned Hand, in the case of Moore v. Mitchell, in a passage, quoted also by Kingsmill Moore J. in the case of Peter Buchanan Ld as follows: 'While the origin of the exception in the case of penal liabilities does not appear in the books, a sound basis for it exists, in my judgment, which includes liabilities for taxes as well. Even in the case of ordinary municipal liabilities, a court will not recognize those arising in a foreign State, if they run counter to the \"settled public policy\" of its own. Thus a scrutiny of the liability is necessarily always in reserve, and the possibility that it will be found not to accord with the policy of the domestic State. This is not a troublesome or delicate inquiry when the question arises between private persons, but it takes on quite another face when it concerns the relations between the foreign State and its own citizens or even those who may be temporarily within its borders. To pass upon the provisions for the public order of another State is, or at any rate should be, beyond the powers of the court; it involves the relations between the States themselves, with which courts are incompetent to deal, and which are intrusted to other authorities. It may commit the domestic State to a position which would seriously embarrass its neighbour. Revenue laws fall within the same reasoning; they affect a State in matters as vital to its existence as its criminal laws. No court ought to undertake an inquiry which it cannot prosecute without determining whether those laws are consonant with its own notions of what is proper.'\nOn either of the explanations which I have just stated I find a solid basis of principle for a rule which has long been recognized and which has been applied by a consistent train of decisions. It may be possible to find reasons for modifying the rule as between States of a federal union. But that consideration, in my opinion, has no relevance to this case.\nIn the same case, at p. 515, Lord Somervell of Harrow recognizes and applies \"the special principle that foreign States cannot directly or indirectly enforce their tax claims here\".\nIn my opinion, a foreign State cannot escape the application of this rule, which is one of public policy, by taking a judgment in its own courts and bringing suit here on that judgment. The claim asserted remains a claim for taxes. It has not, in our courts, merged in the judgment; enforcement of the judgment would be enforcement of the tax claim.\nSimilarly, in my opinion, the argument that the claim asserted is simply for the performance of an agreement, made for good consideration, to pay a stated sum of money must also fail. We are concerned not with form but with substance, and if it can properly be said that the respondent made an agreement it was simply an agreement to pay taxes which by the laws of the foreign State she was obligated to pay.\nNeither the foreign judgment nor the agreement does more than make certain the fact and the amount of the respondent's liability to the appellant. The nature of the liability is not altered. It is a liability to pay income tax.\nThe views, (i) that the application of the rule that foreign States cannot directly or indirectly enforce their tax claims in our courts is not affected by the taking of a judgment in the foreign State, and (ii) that the liability to pay tax does not become converted into a contractual obligation, both appear to me to be supported by the following passage in the speech of Lord Somervell of Harrow in Government of India, Ministry of Finance (Revenue Division) v. Taylor, supra, at pp. 514 and 515:\nIf one State could collect its taxes through the courts of another, it would have arisen through what is described, vaguely perhaps, as comity or the general practice of nations inter se. The appellant was therefore in a difficulty from the outset in that after considerable research no case of any country could be found in which taxes due to State A had been enforced in the courts of State B. Apart from the comparatively recent English, Scotch and Irish cases there is no authority. There are, however, many propositions for which no express authority can be found because they have been regarded as self-evident to all concerned. There must have been many potential defendants.\nTax gathering is an administrative act, though in settling the quantum as well as in the final act of collection judicial process may be involved. Our courts will apply foreign law if it is the proper law of a contract, the subject of a suit. Tax gathering is not a matter of contract but of authority and administration as between the State and those within its jurisdiction. If one considers the initial stages of the process, which may, as the records of your Lordships' House show, be intricate and prolonged, it would be remarkable comity if State B allowed the time of its courts to be expended in assisting in this regard the tax gatherers of State A. Once a judgment has been obtained and it is a question only of its enforcement the factor of time and expense will normally have disappeared. The principle remains. The claim is one for a tax.\nThe fact, I think, itself justifies what has been clearly the practice of States. They have not in the past thought it appropriate to seek to use legal process abroad against debtor taxpayers. They assumed, rightly, that the courts would object to being so used. The position in the United States of America has been referred to, and I agree that the position as between member States of a federation, wherever the reserve of sovereignty may be, does not help.\nThat it is the duty of our courts to go behind the foreign judgment to ascertain the substance of the claim on which it is based is made plain by the reasons of Sheppard J.A. and the authorities to which he refers.\nFor the reasons given by Sheppard J.A. and those I have stated above I would reject the first two arguments urged in support of the appeal.\nAs to the third argument, I agree with the view of Maclean J. that it is clear that all the relevant facts were before the Court and nothing would have been gained by directing that the action proceed to trial. On this point I would adopt the reasoning of Kingsmill Moore J. in Peter Buchanan Ld & Macharg v. McVey, supra, at p. 529 where he says:\nFor the purpose of this case it is sufficient to say that when it appears to the court that the whole object of the suit is to collect tax for a foreign revenue, and that this will be the sole result of a decision in favour of the plaintiff, then a court is entitled to reject the claim by refusing jurisdiction.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Davis, Hossie, Campbell, Brazier & McLorg, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Farris, Stultz, Bull & Farris, Vancouver.\n[1] (1962), 40 W.W.R. 428, 36 D.L.R.

La veuve et les deux fils majeurs de la victime poursuivirent personnellement dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages. En vertu de la loi du Maine, une telle action, lorsque la victime d\u00e9c\u00e8de ab intestat comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, doit \u00eatre prise par et au nom de l'administrateur de la succession. Un des fils avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 administrateur, mais il s'est port\u00e9 demandeur avec les autres comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et non comme administrateur. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur et \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l'action telle que prise. En Cour d'Appel, la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement retenue et cette question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue devant la Cour supr\u00eame. La majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour d'Appel se sont prononc\u00e9s en faveur de la validit\u00e9 de l'action. Le d\u00e9fendeur en a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge Taschereau dissident.\nLe Juge en chef Kerwin et les Juges Cartwright, Fauteux et Abbott: En vertu du droit international priv\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec\u2014lieu o\u00f9 le litige a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis\u2014l'accident \u00e9tait selon les dispositions du Code Civil un acte actionnable comme quasi-d\u00e9lit dans Qu\u00e9bec et selon la loi du Maine un acte actionnable ou punissable dans le Maine. Cet accident a donc donn\u00e9, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des demandeurs, dans Qu\u00e9bec, un droit d'action en dommages contre le d\u00e9fendeur.\nSuivant ce m\u00eame droit international priv\u00e9, la question de savoir si les demandeurs pouvaient poursuivre personnellement doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une question de proc\u00e9dure n'affectant pas la substance du droit donn\u00e9 aux demandeurs par la loi lex loci delicti.\nLa pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve sur la loi du Maine \u00e9tablit que la prescription voulant que l'action soit port\u00e9e par et au nom du repr\u00e9sentant personnel en est aussi une de proc\u00e9dure. Cette disposition n'a que pour seule fin que d'assurer qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule action et que tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires y soient mentionn\u00e9s. Les demandeurs ici sont tous et seuls b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du droit d'action cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la loi du Maine. Il s'en suit que vu que c'est la proc\u00e9dure du for qui r\u00e9git, on doit conclure \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l'action poursuivie conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure.\nLe Juge Taschereau, dissident: En vertu de l'art. 6 du Code Civil, les lois qui r\u00e8glent l'\u00e9tat et la capacit\u00e9 des personnes ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 celui qui n'est pas domicili\u00e9 dans la province. Comme les demandeurs personnellement n'avaient pas la qualit\u00e9 ni la capacit\u00e9 de poursuivre dans le Maine, ils ne pouvaient donc pas instituer une action ici et se substituer \u00e0 l'administrateur qui seul est investi de ce droit. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une question de proc\u00e9dure, mais d'un droit fondamental\u2014le droit de plaider. M\u00eame s'il s'agissait d'une question de proc\u00e9dure, c'est la proc\u00e9dure de Qu\u00e9bec\u2014lieu du proc\u00e8s\u2014qui s'appliquerait; et en vertu de notre loi aucun amendement ne peut \u00eatre admis pour substituer un demandeur \u00e0 un autre. Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de soulever par exception \u00e0 la forme cette absence de qualit\u00e9 des demandeurs, ceci pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 tout autre stade de la proc\u00e9dure.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, affirmant un jugement de Marquis J. Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Taschereau dissident.\nRobert Cannon, c.r., et R. Drouin, pour le d\u00e9fendeur, appelant.\nR. Letarte, pour les demandeurs, intim\u00e9s.\nLe jugement du Juge en Chef Kerwin et des Juges Cartwright, Fauteux et Abbot fut rendu par\nLe Juge Fauteux:\u2014Dans la soir\u00e9e du 20 octobre 1952, Henry L. Holden, domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Jackman dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine, y fut accidentellement et mortellement heurt\u00e9 par une automobile conduite par l'appelant sur la route 201. Il d\u00e9c\u00e9da le lendemain, laissant comme h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux imm\u00e9diats sa veuve et ses deux fils, Milford R. Holden et Harold C. Holden, tous trois intim\u00e9s en cet appel. Dans l'ann\u00e9e du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, soit le 14 octobre 1953, ces derniers, domicili\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis, poursuivirent l'appelant dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 celui-ci avait son domicile, pour lui r\u00e9clamer $4,728.35 dont $728.35 pour frais d'hospitalisation, m\u00e9dicaux et fun\u00e9raires et la somme de $4,000 pour dommages \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9partie entre eux dans la proportion d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la Cour. Aux fins de cette action, les demandeurs invoqu\u00e8rent particuli\u00e8rement, mais sans aucune pr\u00e9cision, la Loi du Maine \u00aben tant qu'applicable \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce\u00bb et produisirent, \u00e0 la suite d'une ordonnance de la Cour, une procuration donn\u00e9e \u00e0 leur avocat, Me Robert Perron, par Milford R. Holden, l'un des demandeurs, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'administrateur nomm\u00e9 suivant la loi du Maine aux fins de ce recours en justice.\nEn d\u00e9fense, l'appelant plaida que la victime avait, par sa faute, rendu cet accident in\u00e9vitable et ajouta que l'action \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit.\nA l'enqu\u00eate, on apporta une preuve circonstanci\u00e9e de l'accident et de ses cons\u00e9quences. On produisit de plus certains extraits de la Loi du Maine et, de part et d'autre, on fit entendre sur la port\u00e9e de la loi de cet \u00c9tat des avocats y exer\u00e7ant, et ce (i) tant sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 que (ii) sur celle de la validit\u00e9 d'une action similaire, e\u00fbtelle \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine par et au nom de ceux au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice desquels elle y est autoris\u00e9e, au lieu de l'\u00eatre suivant une disposition de cette loi par et au nom de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ou de l'administrateur nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 ces fins, pour leur b\u00e9n\u00e9fice.\nAdjugeant sur le premier point, le Juge au proc\u00e8s trouva que le d\u00e9fendeur avait commis une faute causant l'accident en conduisant \u00e0 une vitesse prohib\u00e9e par la loi et en d\u00e9viant vers la gauche pour aller heurter la victime avec violence, lui fracturer le cr\u00e2ne, les jambes, un bras et causer sa mort presque imm\u00e9diate. Cette opinion, partag\u00e9e en appel, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question devant nous par l'appelant.\nSur le second point, le Juge au proc\u00e8s eut d'abord \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les arts. 9 et 10 du chapitre 152 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Maine, 1944, se lisant respectivement comme suit:\nSection 9.\u2014Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then, in every such case, the person who or the corporation which would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as shall amount to a felony.\nSection 10.\u2014Every such action shall be brought by and in the names of the personal representatives of such deceased person, and the amount recovered in every such action, except as hereinafter provided, shall be for the exclusive benefit of the widow or widower, if no children, and of the children, if no widow or widower, and if both, then for the exclusive benefit of the widow and widower and the children equally, and if neither, of his or her heirs. The jury may give such damages as they shall deem a fair and just compensation, not exceeding $10,000, with reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death to the persons for whose benefit such action is brought, and in addition thereto, shall give such damages as will compensate the estate of such deceased person for reasonable expenses of medical, surgical and hospital care and treatment and for reasonable funeral expenses, provided that such action shall be commenced within 2 years after the death of such person.\nLe Juge appr\u00e9cia en outre les t\u00e9moignages contradictoires donn\u00e9s sur la port\u00e9e de la loi de cet \u00c9tat par Mes Wallace A. Bilodeau et Carl Wright, en demande, et par Me John L. Merrill, en d\u00e9fense. Sur le tout, il jugea que, suivant la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, les dispositions prescrivant que l'action r\u00e9sultant d'un d\u00e9c\u00e8s doit \u00eatre intent\u00e9e par un administrateur ou un ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire sont mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure; que la d\u00e9fense doit se plaindre du d\u00e9faut de s'y conformer avant l'instruction au m\u00e9rite par un plaidoyer pr\u00e9liminaire de la nature d'une exception \u00e0 la forme ou d'une inscription en droit; qu'en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure, c'est la \u00ablex fori\u00bb et non la \u00ablex loci delicti\u00bb qui s'applique; que, d\u00e8s lors, cette question doit \u00eatre solutionn\u00e9e, non pas d'apr\u00e8s la Loi de l'\u00c9tat du Maine, mais selon celle de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui exige que, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, l'action soit\u2014comme elle le fut\u2014intent\u00e9e au nom de la veuve et des deux fils du d\u00e9funt. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure fit donc droit \u00e0 l'action des demandeurs.\nEn Cour du banc de la reine2, les Juges, d'accord, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, \u00e0 retenir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant, se sont divis\u00e9s sur la question de la validit\u00e9 de l'action.\nPour la majorit\u00e9, form\u00e9e par M. le Juge en chef Galipeault et lui-m\u00eame, M. le Juge Hyde motive comme suit, en substance, le jugement affirmant la validit\u00e9 d\u00e9 l'action. S'appuyant sur l'autorit\u00e9 de Lafleur, Conflict of Laws, il rappelle que la preuve de la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re est, au Qu\u00e9bec, une question de fait et qu'en l'absence d'une erreur manifeste\u2014qu'il ne peut trouver en l'esp\u00e8ce\u2014, il n'y a pas lieu de modifier l'appr\u00e9ciation qu'en a faite le Juge au proc\u00e8s; notant que ce dernier a jug\u00e9 que l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e par l'appelant est mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure, il s'ensuit que la nullit\u00e9 en r\u00e9sultant est purement relative et non d'ordre public. Retenant de plus que l'appelant ne s'en est pas pr\u00e9valu par exception pr\u00e9liminaire et que tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du recours en dommages, ayant plein exercice de leurs droits, \u00e9taient partie \u00e0 l'action, il consid\u00e8re qu'inclure l'administrateur comme demandeur n'ajouterait rien puisque, suivant l'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve sur la Loi du Maine faite par le Juge au proc\u00e8s, l'administrateur n'est partie \u00e0 l'action que pour faire valoir les droits des demandeurs. Il invoque enfin Hammond v. Augusta Railway Company3, une d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame de cet \u00c9tat cit\u00e9e et produite par l'avocat Wright au cours de l'enqu\u00eate, et conclut au rejet de l'appel.\nDissident, M. le Juge Taschereau estime que les opinions des experts \u00e9tant partag\u00e9es, la Cour n'est pas li\u00e9e par la conclusion du premier Juge; qu'au regard des dispositions de la loi, du t\u00e9moignage de l'expert de la d\u00e9fense et de la jurisprudence par lui cit\u00e9e, il s'agit non pas d'une simple question de proc\u00e9dure comme l'ont pr\u00e9tendu les experts de la demande, mais d'une question de fond et que les demandeurs agissant personnellement n'auraient pu validement, faute de qualit\u00e9, intenter une telle action dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine. Se posant alors la question de savoir si les demandeurs ont qualit\u00e9 pour poursuivre en leur nom personnel, comme ils l'ont fait, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le savant Juge r\u00e9pond n\u00e9gativement et ce, pour deux raisons. Il s'appuie d'abord sur des d\u00e9cisions et trait\u00e9s, respectivement rendues et \u00e9crits en France, pour supporter la proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que suivant le droit international priv\u00e9, la qualit\u00e9 doit s'appr\u00e9cier non pas en fonction de la loi du for mais d'apr\u00e8s la loi qui r\u00e9git le fond du litige. Il convient de signaler, je crois, qu'aucune de ces autorit\u00e9s, post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la codification du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et \u00e9non\u00e7ant la doctrine moderne fran\u00e7aise en droit international priv\u00e9, ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 un cas en tous points similaire \u00e0 celui qui nous occupe. Comme second motif, le savant Juge note que les conditions fondant l'exercice d'un recours en dommages dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 la suite d'un d\u00e9lit commis dans une autre juridiction ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 diverses interpr\u00e9tations, mais que le principe pos\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parent4 para\u00eet bien s'appliquer \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce. Il en conclut que l'appel devait \u00eatre maintenu et les demandeurs d\u00e9bout\u00e9s.\nSur le pourvoi subs\u00e9quent de l'appelant \u00e0 cette Cour, la question de notre juridiction relativement aux intim\u00e9s Milford R. Holden et Harold C. Holden ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par le Juge en chef, l'appelant fit motion pour permission d'appeler; cette motion, du consentement du procureur de ces intim\u00e9s, fut accord\u00e9e mais sans frais.\nLa solution des conflits des lois varie suivant le droit international priv\u00e9 de chaque \u00c9tat; c'est l\u00e0 une cons\u00e9quence de leur ind\u00e9pendance. Niboyet, Manuel du Droit International Priv\u00e9, 2e \u00e9d., 463 et seq. Au Canada, o\u00f9 la souverainet\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative en mati\u00e8re de droit civil appartient exclusivement aux provinces, c'est le droit international priv\u00e9 de la province o\u00f9 le litige est soumis\u2014en l'esp\u00e8ce, la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u2014qui r\u00e9git. La r\u00e8gle de ce droit, en ce qui concerne l'obligation r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit est, suivant une jurisprudence maintenant d\u00e9finitivement arr\u00eat\u00e9e, la m\u00eame, mutatis mutandis, que celle du droit international priv\u00e9 en Angleterre. Voir McLean v. Pettigrew5 et d\u00e9cisions y cit\u00e9es On trouve l'expression de cette r\u00e8gle dans Dicey's Conflict of Laws, 7e \u00e9d., \u00e0 la page 940:\nAn act done in a foreign country is a tort, and actionable as such in England, only if it is both\n(i) actionable as a tort, according to English law, or, in other words, is an act which, if done in England, would be a tort; and\n(ii) not justifiable, according to the law of the foreign country where it was done.\nDans McLean v. Pettigrew, supra, on a rappel\u00e9 que l'expression \u00abactionable\u00bb dans (i) signifie \u00abun acte qui, s'il \u00e9tait fait en Angleterre, donnerait ouverture \u00e0 une action suivant la loi anglaise\u00bb et que l'expression \u00abnot justifiable\u00bb dans (ii) signifie un acte qui n'est pas innocent ou excusable ou, en d'autres mots, \u00abwhich is either actionable or punishable according to the law of the country where it is done\u00bb. Pour juger du droit d'action au lieu du for, on s'arr\u00eate donc \u00e0 la nature et aux cons\u00e9quences juridiques de l'acte et on d\u00e9termine si cet acte est \u00e0 la fois (i) actionnable comme d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit au lieu o\u00f9 il est poursuivi et (ii) ou bien actionnable ou bien punissable au lieu o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. En pr\u00e9sence des dispositions de l'art. 1056 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec d'une part et, d'autre part, des dispositions de l'art. 9 de la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e du Maine, on ne peut mettre en doute qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, ces deux conditions sont pr\u00e9sentes et que l'accident caus\u00e9 par l'appelant dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine donne, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des intim\u00e9s, dans le Qu\u00e9bec, droit d'action en dommages contre lui.\nCes derniers pouvaient-ils, comme ils l'ont fait, se porter personnellement demandeurs pour l'exercice de ce rem\u00e8de \u00e9tabli \u00e0 leur b\u00e9n\u00e9fice? Poursuivant, \u00e0 la page 954, ses explications sur la r\u00e8gle pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e de droit international priv\u00e9 r\u00e9gissant en Angleterre et adopt\u00e9e dans le Qu\u00e9bec, Dicey \u00e9crit ce qui suit:\nTo be, in the traditional sense, \"of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in England\" the act must be of such a kind as would, if done in England, have given rise to a cause of action in favour of the plaintiff who is claiming redress. Thus, if by the lex loci delicti rights resembling those created by the English Fatal Accident Acts were conferred upon relatives of a deceased person who have no such rights under English law, they could not successfully sue in England. On the other hand, if, by the lex loci delicti, the personal representative of the deceased, or a person occupying a position similar to that of a personal representative in the English sense, is entitled to claim such rights for the benefit of the deceased's next-of-kin, any personal representative deriving his title from English letters of administration or an English grant of probate should, it is submitted, be regarded as a proper plaintiff in England. Whether, e.g., the deceased's brother can claim damages by reason of his death, is a matter of substantive law, but who\u2014as personal representative\u2014may act for the dependants is a matter of procedural machinery. Hence the fact that, by the lex loci delicti, a person other than the English personal representative can, in a representative capacity, enforce these rights, should not stand in the way of an action brought in England by the English personal representative.\nThe plaintiff will, however, only succeed, if the right which he claims vests in him by virtue of the lex loci delicti as well as the lex fori. Thus, a dependant claiming damages by reason of the death of a person must satisfy the court that he belongs to the category of relatives entitled to raise this claim both under a statute of the jorum and under a statute in force at the locus delicti.\nCes commentaires de Dicey, \u00e9tay\u00e9s de renvois apparaissant au bas de la m\u00eame page, doivent, aussi bien que la r\u00e8gle qu'ils pr\u00e9cisent, \u00eatre retenus comme l'expression du droit international priv\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec sur la question de la validit\u00e9 de l'action qui nous occupe. Sous cet aspect, suivant ce droit et dans les circonstances de cette cause, la question soulev\u00e9e doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure ou, suivant les termes de Dicey, de \u00abprocedural machinery\u00bb n'affectant pas la validit\u00e9 de l'action poursuivie, en l'esp\u00e8ce, suivant la loi du Qu\u00e9bec.\nD'accord avec le Juge au proc\u00e8s et ceux de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, je dirais que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve sur la Loi du Maine \u00e9tablit que cette disposition de l'art. 10 prescrivant que l'action doit \u00eatre port\u00e9e par et au nom du \u00abpersonal representative\u00bb en est une de proc\u00e9dure. Le caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif de la disposition n'en change pas cette nature; les experts de la demande affirment que le d\u00e9faut de s'y conformer est couvert si on ne s'en est pas plaint avant l'audition au m\u00e9rite par le jury. Tenant de l'opinion contraire, l'expert de la d\u00e9fense a de plus, contrairement aux experts de la demande, affirm\u00e9 que le \u00abpersonal representative\u00bb\u2014en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'administrateur\u2014est oblig\u00e9 d'intenter l'action m\u00eame si ceux au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice desquels elle est autoris\u00e9e expriment la volont\u00e9 d'y renoncer; c'est l\u00e0, \u00e0 mon avis, une opinion extravagante att\u00e9nuant la valeur qu'il convient de donner \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moin comme expert. Au surplus, et de la d\u00e9cision dans Hammond v. Augusta Railway Company, supra, il y a lieu de reproduire, au soutien de l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par les experts de la demande, les extraits suivants sur l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette Loi du Maine par la Cour Supr\u00eame de cet \u00c9tat:\nThe suit is not for the benefit of the estate and creditors have no interest in it. True, such suit is brought in the name of the Administrator but he is merely the nominal party and acts as trustee.\n* * *\nUnder section 10, the party for whose benefit the action is brought depends upon the nature of the family that is left..........But in any event the immediate, absolute and final vesting of the right occurs at the time of the decease, not at the time of bringing suit or of recovery. The beneficiaries have a right of action then or not at all and the facts of each particular case determine which beneficiaries have the right.\n* * *\nUpon her death, therefore, the right of action by the statute, vested solely and exclusively for the benefit of her husband. He alone was entitled to the amount to be recovered, and could hold and dispose of the same at pleasure. Les demandeurs en cette cause sont tous majeurs, usant de leurs droits, et sont tous et seuls b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du droit d'action cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Loi du Maine. La disposition voulant que cette action soit port\u00e9e par et au nom du \u00abpersonal representative\u00bb n'a pour seule fin, suivant la preuve non contredite, que d'assurer qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule action et que tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires y soient mentionn\u00e9s. La qualit\u00e9 en laquelle agirait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le \u00abpersonal representative\u00bb n'est pas, au sens propre, la qualit\u00e9 dont il s'agit dans le cas des tuteurs, curateurs, ex\u00e9cuteurs ou autres agissant pour des incapables ou saisis eux-m\u00eames \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 d'un droit qu'ils doivent faire valoir par action.\nEnfin, et en tout respect pour le Juge dissident, j'ajouterais que rien de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Parent, supra, ne vient en conflit avec les vues qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. Dans cette cause on jugea en somme que la compagnie appelante n'\u00e9tant ni civilement\u2014parce que pr\u00e9alablement et contractuellement lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de toute responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle\u2014ni criminellement responsable de la mort du d\u00e9funt survenue \u00e0 la suite d'un accident dans la province d'Ontario et que l'application territoriale de l'art. 1056 du Code Civil \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la province de Qu\u00e9bec, l'action intent\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec ne pouvait \u00eatre maintenue.\n\u00c9tant d'avis que tant d'apr\u00e8s le droit international priv\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec que d'apr\u00e8s la Loi du Maine, il s'agit en l'esp\u00e8ce d'une question de proc\u00e9dure n'affectant pas la substance du droit donn\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s par la lex loci delicti et que c'est alors la proc\u00e9dure du for, soit du Qu\u00e9bec, qui r\u00e9git, je dois conclure \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l'action poursuivie par les intim\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure.\nPour ces raisons, je renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe Juge Taschereau (dissident):\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s, comme d'ailleurs la plupart des litiges entre personnes qui sont domicili\u00e9es dans des juridictions diff\u00e9rentes. Les faits qui sont essentiels \u00e0 l'intelligence de ce proc\u00e8s peuvent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi:\nLe 20 octobre 1952, Henry L. Holden, domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Jackson dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine, se dirigeait de l'est \u00e0 l'ouest, lorsqu'il fut frapp\u00e9 par une automobile conduite par le d\u00e9fendeur- appelant, domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 L\u00e9vis, P.Q., et qui proc\u00e9dait vers le nord. Holden subit de tr\u00e8s graves blessures qui, le lendemain, devaient entra\u00eener sa mort.\nLes demandeurs, l'\u00e9pouse de la victime Dame Issie Holden et ses deux fils, Milford et Harold, ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9 devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec la somme de $4,728.15, \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9partie entre les trois demandeurs dans la proportion d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la Cour.\nL'honorable Juge Marquis si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, a conclu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant-d\u00e9fendeur, et l'a condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer aux demandeurs la somme de $2,728.35, dont $2,000 payables \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e9pouse de la victime, et $728.35 aux deux autres demandeurs. La Cour d'Appel6 a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, l'honorable Juge Andr\u00e9 Taschereau \u00e9tant dissident.\nLa question de responsabilit\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9sente pas devant cette Cour. Dans son factum en effet, l'appelant admet qu'il y a sur ce point des vues identiques exprim\u00e9es par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel, et ne voit pas comment il pourrait r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 obtenir un jugement diff\u00e9rent sur les faits. D'ailleurs, lors de l'audition, il a formellement abandonn\u00e9 ce moyen.\nMais l'appelant soumet que les demandeurs ne peuvent r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 cause de leur \u00e9tat et de leur capacit\u00e9, et son argument peut se r\u00e9sumer ainsi:\u2014Les trois demandeurs sont domicili\u00e9s dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine o\u00f9 s'est produit l'accident. Ils ont institu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action, et d'apr\u00e8s l'appelant, ils ne pouvaient le faire, car en vertu de la loi de l'\u00c9tat du Maine, c'est l'administrateur nomm\u00e9 comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, qui doit toujours se porter demandeur dans les cas comme celui qui nous occupe.\nL'un des t\u00e9moins experts des demandeurs, M. Carl Wright, commentant les, lois du Maine au sujet du droit de poursuivre, s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nIn the State of Maine before any person has a right for a cause of action, an administrator of the estate must be appointed, and the law only gives that right if an administrator is appointed. If there had been a will the claim of the representative of the estate would have been executor, but there was no will in this particular case, therefore an administrator was appointed and the administrator is given a right to bring an action against the party allegedly causing the accident, for death and also for conscious pain and suffering preceding and up to death. M. Wallace A. Bilodeau, un autre avocat expert entendu par les demandeurs, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens:\nDe par nos lois, il faut que l'action soit commenc\u00e9e par un repr\u00e9sentant personnel de la succession, soit un ex\u00e9cuteur, ou un administrateur de, la succession.\nM. John L. Merrill, avocat entendu comme expert par la d\u00e9fense, s'accorde enti\u00e8rement avec les vues exprim\u00e9es par les t\u00e9moins des demandeurs. Voici ce qu'il dit:\nHe (the administrator) under the terms of our statute, is the only person who may come in and have, standing as a party, a mandate under the Wrongful Act Statute, because the so-called administrator or representative well appointed in the State of Maine could, and no one else, obtain a right under the statute.\nIl me semble clair que si la pr\u00e9sente action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine, comme elle aurait pu l'\u00eatre, l'action n'aurait pu r\u00e9ussir. Le statut qui accorde un recours en dommages dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine, dans les circonstances qui se pr\u00e9sentent actuellement, est une d\u00e9rogation au droit commun qui d\u00e9nie l'action. Il faut que ses prescriptions soient rigoureusement observ\u00e9es. Les dispositions importantes de cette loi (ch. 124 Public Laws 1891) sont les arts. 9 et 10 qui se lisent de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n(9) Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then, and in every such case, the party who, or the corporation which, would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages notwithstanding the death of the person injured and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as shall amount to a felony.\n(10) Every such action shall be brought by and in the names of the personal representatives of such deceased person and the amount recovered in every such action, except as hereinafter provided, shall be for the exclusive benefit of the widow or widower, if no children, and of the children, if no widow or widower, and if both then for the exclusive benefit of the widow or widower and the children equally, and if neither of his or her heirs the jury may give such damages as they shall deem fair and just compensation not exceeding $10,000 with reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting; from such death to the persons for whose benefit such action is brought and in addition thereto shall give damages as will compensate the estate of such deceased person for reasonable expenses of medical surgical and hospital care and treatment, and for reasonable funeral expenses, provided that such action shall be ceommenced within two years after the death of such person.\nCes deux articles permettent donc d'exercer trois recours. En premier lieu, ils autorisent le maintien d'une action pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages qu'aurait eu le droit de r\u00e9clamer la victime si la mort n'avait pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9; en second lieu, le droit d'exiger la perte p\u00e9cuniaire occasionn\u00e9e au demandeur; et en troisi\u00e8me lieu, les frais m\u00e9dicaux, les frais d'hospitalisation et les frais fun\u00e9raires. Mais dans tous les cas, les seuls b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires seront l'\u00e9poux survivant et les enfants s'il y en a. Mais, nous dit l'art. 10, seul l'administrateur d'une succession ab intestat, comme c'est le cas qui nous occupe, peut instituer cette action; et dans le cas de la succession testamentaire, ce sera l'ex\u00e9cuteur qui devra se porter demandeur. \u00c9videmment, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu investir l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, ou l'administrateur suivant le cas, du droit exclusif de poursuivre, afin d'\u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des actions, et qu'une seule ne soit institu\u00e9e, \u00e0 condition qu'elle le soit dans les deux ans du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime.\nComme on peut le voir, ce statut confond dans un m\u00eame article (10) le droit qu'ont les h\u00e9ritiers chez-nous de poursuivre comme h\u00e9ritiers (C.C. 607) pour exercer les actions du d\u00e9funt, et le droit que peuvent avoir le conjoint survivant et les descendants de r\u00e9clamer pour dommages personnels en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 1056 C.C. Les premiers sont des droits patrimoniaux dont sont investis les h\u00e9ritiers, parce qu'ils sont transmissibles, et les seconds sont des droits extra-patrimoniaux qui n'ont une valeur p\u00e9cuniaire que pour leurs titulaires (1056 C.C.) et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne sont pas susceptibles de transmission. (Vide Driver et al. v. Coca-Cola7.)\nCeux qui peuvent r\u00e9clamer ici ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement, comme dans le Maine, les m\u00eames personnes. En effet, les h\u00e9ritiers testamentaires pourront poursuivre sous l'art. 607 du Code Civil, et exercer les droits qu'aurait eus le testateur s'il e\u00fbt v\u00e9cu, mais le droit de r\u00e9clamer sous 1056 sera toujours du droit propre aux ascendants, au conjoint et aux descendants, mais c'est le contraire qui existe dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine o\u00f9 il ne peut y avoir qu'une seule et m\u00eame action, institu\u00e9e au nom de l'administrateur qui, comme je l'ai dit d\u00e9j\u00e0, puise ses droits de la loi de son domicile.\nC'est ainsi que l'a voulu le l\u00e9gislateur. En vertu de l'art. 6 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, l'habitant du Bas-Canada, tant qu'il y conserve son domicile, est r\u00e9gi, m\u00eame lorsqu'il en est absent, par les lois qui r\u00e8glent l'\u00e9tat et la capacit\u00e9 des personnes; mais elles ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 celui qui n'y est pas domicili\u00e9, lesquel reste soumis \u00e0 la loi de son pays quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat et \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9.\nCe principe est universellement reconnu. Ainsi, commentant l'art. 6 du Code Civil, Mignault dit, vol. 1, page 79:\nOn le voit, il ne s'agit nullement de la nationalit\u00e9, c'est le domicile qui suit l'individu partout o\u00f9 il porte ses pas et qui r\u00e8gle sa capacit\u00e9 civile.\nA la page 84, il amplifie:\nJe trouve dans la disposition suivante de l'article 14 (maintenant 79 et 80 C.P.) un d\u00e9veloppement de ce principe.\nEt il ajoute:\nC'est encore que la capacit\u00e9 ou l'incapacit\u00e9 de la personne la suit partout. Si elle est capable d'ester en justice dans son pays, elle le sera \u00e9galement ici.\nTrudel, Trait\u00e9 de droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec, vol. 1, page 41:\nA la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que nos lois personnelles s'appliquent \u00e0 quiconque se trouve dans la province, existe une exception aussi importante que la r\u00e8gle elle-m\u00eame. En effet, l'\u00e9tat et la capacit\u00e9 des personnes sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par la loi de leur domicile et non pas par nos lois locales.\nA la page 46:\nUn curateur nomm\u00e9 en vertu d'une loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re conserve devant nos tribunaux tous les pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par cette loi.\nEn Cour de Revision, dans une cause de Breault et al. v. Wadleigh8, MM. les juges Routhier, Andrews et Larue ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9, et ils citent une nombreuse jurisprudence, ce qui suit:\nAn administrator duly appointed in the State of New Hampshire, to the estate of a person dying there, intestate, but owning property in Canada, is the legal representative of the deceased in this province as well as in New Hampshire; he alone is entitled to administer the estate, and the heirs-at-law here have no right, adversely to him, to obtain payment of any sums due deceased in this province.\nLes demandeurs personnellement ne pouvaient donc pas poursuivre chez eux, et comme le dit M. Bilodeau, un expert entendu au proc\u00e8s pour prouver la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re:\nQ. Monsieur Bilodeau, dans le Maine, si cette action est prise, comme la d\u00e9signation est actuellement, je comprends qu'il y aurait eu des proc\u00e9dures, soit un plaidoyer disant que c'est pas correct; est-ce que la partie pourrait payer les frais, recommencer et continuer? \u2026 ou si l'action aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e?\nR. L'action aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e mais il aurait pu recommencer.\nQ. Si c'\u00e9tait prescrit, est-ce qu'il aurait perdu ses droits?\nR. C'est mon opinion qu'il aurait perdu ses droits.\nComme les demandeurs, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, importent avec eux leur \u00e9tat d'h\u00e9ritiers et la capacit\u00e9 qui en r\u00e9sulte suivant les lois de leur domicile, ils ne peuvent donc pas instituer une action ici, comme celle qui l'a \u00e9t\u00e9, et se substituer \u00e0 l'administrateur qui seul est investi de ce droit.\nLes effets de l'art. 79 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile doivent n\u00e9cessairement se combiner avec ceux de l'art. 6 du Code Civil. L'article 79 est en effet r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nArt. 79. Une corporation ou personne, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger \u00e0 ester en justice, peut exercer cette facult\u00e9 devant tout tribunal de la province.\nCet article donne \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger acc\u00e8s \u00e0 nos tribunaux, et permet \u00e0 ceux-ci d'accueillir l'action de celui qui, dans un pays \u00e9tranger, a la qualit\u00e9 voulue pour se porter demandeur chez lui.\nIl y a \u00e9videmment de nombreuses sortes de \u00abqualit\u00e9s\u00bb. Ainsi, le tuteur agit en qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant de son pupille, le syndic en mati\u00e8re de faillite repr\u00e9sente le failli ou la masse, et l'administrateur agit en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant de ceux pour qui il occupe. C'est \u00e0 eux que donne le droit de plaider dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec l'art. 79 du Code de proc\u00e9dure, quand les demandeurs ont la qualit\u00e9 voulue dans leur pays. Le mot \u00ab\u00e9tat\u00bb se compose des droits inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 une personne, et que la loi civile prend en consid\u00e9ration pour y attacher des effets. La \u00abqualit\u00e9\u00bb au contraire est le titre sous lequel une partie ou un plaideur figure dans un acte juridique ou dans une instance. Chez nous, le mot \u00ab\u00e9tat\u00bb peut se confondre avec le mot \u00abqualit\u00e9\u00bb. Ainsi, la veuve a l'\u00e9tat de veuve et la femme mari\u00e9e a un \u00e9tat diff\u00e9rent, et leur capacit\u00e9 juridique sera cons\u00e9quemment diff\u00e9rente. Le tuteur qui poursuit \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 aura une situation particuli\u00e8re, mais c'est toujours de l'\u00ab\u00e9tat\u00bb ou de la \u00abqualit\u00e9\u00bb que d\u00e9coulent la capacit\u00e9 et le droit de plaider.\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu \u00e0 l'argument qu'il s'agissait ici d'une question de proc\u00e9dure et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, si l'action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e dans l'\u00e9tat du Maine, la Cour aurait pu autoriser un amendement et substituer \u00e0 ceux qui ont poursuivi ill\u00e9galement le nom de l'administrateur. Je ne puis partager ces vues en ce qui concerne la proc\u00e9dure dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. La proc\u00e9dure est en effet l'ensemble des actes accomplis pour parvenir \u00e0 une solution juridictionnelle. C'est, en d'autres termes, la branche de la science du droit qui a pour objet de d\u00e9terminer l'instruction des proc\u00e8s.\nLe droit de plaider est un droit civil fondamental, sur lequel repose la validit\u00e9 d'une action, et il est impossible de dire que ce droit fasse partie de l'ensemble des r\u00e8gles auxquelles sont assujetties les actions en justice pour en arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9termination. Comme le droit au proc\u00e8s par jury, le droit de plaider est un droit sup\u00e9rieur et ind\u00e9pendant de la proc\u00e9dure. Dudemaine v. Coutu9; Picard v. Warren10.\nM\u00eame s'il fallait erron\u00e9ment conclure que ce droit fait partie de la proc\u00e9dure civile, ce serait s\u00fbrement la loi de Qu\u00e9bec qui s'appliquerait, car en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 6, para. 1 du Code Civil, c'est la loi de Qu\u00e9bec qu'il faut appliquer lorsqu'il s'agit de proc\u00e9dure civile. Le paragraphe 1 de l'art. 6 C.C. se lit ainsi:\nLes biens meubles sont r\u00e9gis par la loi du domicile du propri\u00e9taire. C'est cependant la loi du Bas-Canada qu'on leur applique dans le cas o\u00f9 il s'agit de la distinction et de la nature des biens, des privil\u00e8ges et des droits de gage de contestations sur la possession, de la juridiction des tribunaux, de la proc\u00e9dure, des voies d'ex\u00e9cution et de saisie, de ce qui int\u00e9resse l'ordre public et les droits du souverain, ainsi que dans tous les autres cas sp\u00e9cialement pr\u00e9vus par ce code.\nSi l'\u00e9tranger doit importer avec lui son \u00e9tat et sa capacit\u00e9, il n'importe pas la proc\u00e9dure de son pays, et c'est la proc\u00e9dure de la province qui r\u00e8gle la fa\u00e7on de conduire un proc\u00e8s et qui peut autoriser ou refuser les amendements. Peut-\u00eatre que si l'action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e au nom des h\u00e9ritiers dans l'\u00e9tat du Maine, un amendement eut possiblement \u00e9t\u00e9 permis suivant la proc\u00e9dure de la loi du forum, mais je ne connais aucune disposition l\u00e9gale dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui permette, une fois le proc\u00e8s commenc\u00e9, de changer le demandeur. D'ailleurs, et ceci me semble-t-il dispose du litige, l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et aucun amendement n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9. Les demandeurs n'ont done pas la qualit\u00e9 voulue pour plaider devant nos tribunaux.\nEn vertu des dispositions du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, les parties peuvent avant jugement, avec la permission du juge, amender le bref d'assignation, la demande et la d\u00e9fense, ou toute autre pi\u00e8ce de la plaidoirie. On peut ainsi par amendement corriger une simple erreur dans le bref d'assignation: Home Insurance Company of New York v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Coop\u00e9rative11. Mais la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec dans Dufour v. Guay12 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un amendement \u00e0 l'effet de r\u00e9clamer \u00e0 titre d'h\u00e9ritier une cr\u00e9ance r\u00e9clam\u00e9e originairement \u00e0 titre de cr\u00e9ance personnelle, ne peut \u00eatre accueilli. Dans Ellis v. Griab13, M. le Juge Bruneau a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre permis, sous pr\u00e9texte d'amendement, de substituer un d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 un autre, sans recourir \u00e0 la voie ordinaire de l'assignation.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont invoqu\u00e9, pour appuyer leur droit de poursuivre, l'art. 174 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile qui est \u00e0 l'effet que le d\u00e9fendeur peut invoquer par exception \u00e0 la forme, lorsqu'ils lui causent un pr\u00e9judice, les moyens qui r\u00e9sultent de l'incapacit\u00e9 du demandeur ou du d\u00e9fendeur et de l'absence de qualit\u00e9 du demandeur ou du d\u00e9fendeur.\nJe suis clairement d'opinion que le d\u00e9fendeur n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 d'invoquer cette absence de qualit\u00e9 par exception pr\u00e9liminaire. L'article 174 permet de soulever ce moyen par exception pr\u00e9liminaire, mais l'article n'est pas imp\u00e9ratif, et il y a des cas o\u00f9 les moyens peuvent \u00eatre soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 tout stade de la cause. Il serait en effet extraordinaire qu'un mineur qui n'a pas le droit de poursuivre, puisse tout de m\u00eame, sans \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son tuteur, obtenir gain de cause parce que le d\u00e9fendeur aurait n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d'invoquer le moyen de son incapacit\u00e9 par exception \u00e0 la forme. Ainsi en est-il de la femme mari\u00e9e en communaut\u00e9 de biens qui prendrait une action pour r\u00e9clamer une cr\u00e9ance due \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9, quand seul le mari, chef de la communaut\u00e9, est investi du droit de poursuivre. Je ne puis admettre que le Code de proc\u00e9dure, qui ne d\u00e9termine pas les droits, mais qui ne donne que les moyens de les exercer, soit sup\u00e9rieur aux dispositions du Code Civil de la province. C'est r\u00e9soudre la question que de la proposer. D'ailleurs, c'est bien ce que nos tribunaux ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9. La Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, dans un arr\u00eat rendu en 1900 de McFarran v. Montreal Park and Island Ry. Co.14, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'art. 174 n'a pas cette rigidit\u00e9, et M. le juge Taschereau s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nWe are of opinion that the plaintiff's appeal from that judgment should be dismissed upon the ground that she had, as \u00abcommune en biens\u00bb, no right of action, and that the defendant was not obliged to plead it by exception to the form.\nDans la m\u00eame cause, la Cour de R\u00e9vision15 avait ant\u00e9rieurement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nJuge:\u20141. Que la femme qui n'all\u00e8gue et ne prouve pas qu'elle est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, ne peut intenter, m\u00eame avec l'autorisation de son mari, une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour accident, cette action appartenant au mari seul.\n2. Qu'une telle action, prise par la femme, manquant compl\u00e8tement de base, le verdict du jury, en faveur de la demanderesse peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 en r\u00e9vision, m\u00eame si la question d'incapacit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance.\nDans Pouliot v. Thivierge16, M. le juge L\u00e9tourneau, parlant pour la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, d\u00e9clare clairement que si l'exception \u00e0 la forme est permise en vertu du Code, elle n'emp\u00eache pas le d\u00e9fendeur de soulever ce moyen \u00e0 tout stade de la proc\u00e9dure. Voici ce qu'il dit:\nIl me parait certain que ce d\u00e9faut d'autorisation doive entra\u00eener une nullit\u00e9 absolue de la proc\u00e9dure.\nEt si l'on objecte que l'exception \u00e0 la forme n'\u00e9tait pas le moyen qu'aurait d\u00fb prendre l'appelant, je rappelle seulement que cette nullit\u00e9 absolue et qui pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e en tout temps, se rapporte en somme \u00e0 une incapacit\u00e9 de la demanderesse, et que notre Code de proc\u00e9dure nouveau (art. 174, par. 2) permet que cette question d'une incapacit\u00e9 du demandeur soit d\u00e9sormais soulev\u00e9e par exception \u00e0 la forme, et nous ne pourrions que louer le d\u00e9fendeur appelant de s'\u00eatre ainsi pourvu par exception pr\u00e9liminaire, s'il redoutait qu'on soulev\u00e2t la question d'une autorisation tacite r\u00e9sultant de sa contestation au m\u00e9rite, et qui longtemps a \u00e9t\u00e9 controvers\u00e9e.\nDans une cause de Vizien v. Rozon et al.17, M. le juge Surveyer a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le tribunal pouvait, au cours de l'instance, apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9lais dans lesquels on peut faire une objection pr\u00e9liminaire, proprio motu soulever l'objection r\u00e9sultant du fait que la demande est port\u00e9e par la femme autoris\u00e9e par son mari, au lieu qu'elle ne soit institu\u00e9e par le mari lui-m\u00eame, chef de la communaut\u00e9.\nQuand le droit d'action n'existe pas, \u00e0 cause de l'absence de qualit\u00e9 ou de capacit\u00e9 du demandeur, le d\u00e9fendeur pourra sans doute soulever ce moyen par exception pr\u00e9liminaire, mais son d\u00e9faut de le faire n'investit pas le demandeur d'un droit que lui d\u00e9nie le Code Civil.\nPour r\u00e9sumer ma pens\u00e9e, je suis d'opinion que la loi du Maine d\u00e9termine seulement l'\u00e9tat, la capacit\u00e9 ou la qualit\u00e9 des demandeurs; que les demandeurs n'avaient ni la qualit\u00e9 ni la capacit\u00e9 de poursuivre; que seul l'administrateur avait la capacit\u00e9 qui d\u00e9coule de sa qualit\u00e9; que l'action dans l'\u00e9tat du Maine leur serait interdite et par cons\u00e9quent, ici, \u00e0 cause des dispositions imp\u00e9ratives de l'art. 6 C.C.; qu'il ne s'agit pas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'une question de proc\u00e9dure, mais bien d'un droit fondamental qui s'appelle le droit de plaider; qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement si, ce que je ne puis admettre, il s'agissait d'une question de proc\u00e9dure, c'est la proc\u00e9dure de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 a lieu le proc\u00e8s qui devrait s'appliquer, et qu'en vertu de notre loi, aucun amendement ne peut \u00eatre admis ici pour substituer un demandeur \u00e0 un autre. Je crois enfin, suivant une d\u00e9cision de cette Cour, supra, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de soulever par exception \u00e0 la forme cette absence de qualit\u00e9 des demandeurs \u00e0 qui la loi du Maine interdit de plaider, et que ce moyen pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 tout autre stade de la proc\u00e9dure.\nJe suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, l'action rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, le Juge Taschereau dissident.\nProcureur du d\u00e9fendeur, appelant: Ross Drouin, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur des demandeurs, intim\u00e9s: Pierre Letarte, Qu\u00e9bec.\n1 [1961] B.R. 239.\n2 [1961] B.R. 239.\n3 106 Maine 109.\n4 [1917] A.C. 195, 20 C.R.C. 141, 33 D.L.R. 12.\n5 [1945] R.C.S. 62, 2 D.L.R. 65.\n6 [1961] B.R. 239.\n7 [1961] R.C.S. 201, 27 D.L.R.

Cette derni\u00e8re devait fournir les mat\u00e9riaux et s'engageait \u00e0 payer une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de $50,000. La clause 8 du contrat stipulait que la d\u00e9fenderesse pourrait mettre fin au contrat \u00abpour des raisons qu'elle estimera raisonnables\u00bb, et dans ce cas la demanderesse ne pourra r\u00e9clamer aucun dommage. Une autre clause du contrat \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet que le contrat \u00absera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme nul\u00bb si certains octrois n'\u00e9taient pas donn\u00e9s par les autorit\u00e9s provinciales. En novembre 1957, le contrat fut cancell\u00e9 et le m\u00eame jour l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, assez avanc\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0, fut confi\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre entrepreneur.\nLa demanderesse a alors r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et sp\u00e9ciaux de $69,654.54. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action pour la somme de $49,654.54 et ce montant fut r\u00e9duit par la Cour du banc de la reine \u00e0 $5,000. Aucune des deux Cours n'a accept\u00e9 la clause 8 comme \u00e9tant une fin de non recevoir. La demanderesse en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour et la d\u00e9fenderesse a produit un contre-appel.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et le contre-appel maintenu.\nIl n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider, comme l'on fait les deux autres Cours, si la clause 8 du contrat \u00e9tait absolue ou non, parce que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait des motifs raisonnables de changer d'entrepreneur. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la d\u00e9fenderesse fut forc\u00e9e de canceller le contrat vu le refus des autorit\u00e9s de donner les octrois n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 moins que le contrat ne soit allou\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre entrepreneur. Il s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement qu'aucun dommage, soit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou sp\u00e9cial, ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\nAPPEL et Contre-Appel d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, Province de Qu\u00e9bec1, modifiant un jugement de Lizotte J. Appel rejet\u00e9 et contre-appel maintenu.\nGeorges Pelletier, C.R., et Yves Pratte, C.R., pour la demanderesse, appelante. Jean Turgeon, c.r., pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLe Juge Taschereau:\u2014Le 24 juillet 1957, la Cambrai Construction Inc. et la Corporation de l'H\u00f4pital de St-Ambroise de Loretteville ont sign\u00e9 un contrat en vertu duquel cette derni\u00e8re a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante la construction d'un h\u00f4pital \u00e0 Loretteville, dont le co\u00fbt approximatif devait \u00eatre de $750,000.\nPar ce contrat re\u00e7u devant le notaire Andr\u00e9 Cossette, la Compagnie de Construction s'engageait \u00e0 faire les travaux, \u00e0 procurer la main-d'\u0153uvre, et l'h\u00f4pital devait fournir les mat\u00e9riaux et s'engageait \u00e0 payer une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au montant de $50,000 \u00e0 la Compagnie de Construction. Cette derni\u00e8re, tel qu'il est stipul\u00e9 au contrat, agissait comme \u00abagent\u00bb de la Corporation de l'H\u00f4pital de St-Ambroise.\nLe 26 novembre 1957, l'h\u00f4pital intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 ce contrat, et le m\u00eame jour a confi\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, assez avanc\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0, \u00e0 une autre compagnie appel\u00e9e la \u00abKomo Construction Limited\u00bb qui a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 l'ouvrage qui restait \u00e0 faire. L'appelante a alors poursuivi l'intim\u00e9e et a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en dommages la somme de $69,654.54.\nM. le Juge Lizotte de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu cette action jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $49,654.54, mais la Cour d'Appel2 a substantiellement modifi\u00e9 ce jugement et a condamn\u00e9 l'h\u00f4pital \u00e0 payer seulement la somme de $5,000. M. le Juge Rivard, dissident en partie, aurait r\u00e9duit le montant accord\u00e9 par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 $31,655.34.\nEn Cour d'Appel, M. le Juge Casey parlant pour la majorit\u00e9 des membres du tribunal, a rejet\u00e9 l'item des dommages sp\u00e9ciaux et, pour justifier ce rejet, il s'est exprim\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nWhile I have no doubt that the special damage suffered by Respondent would be the profit that it would have made had it been allowed to complete the contract, it does not follow that the stipulated fee of $50,000 was all profit. To earn this Respondent had to spend some money and in addition had to bear the cost of \u00abtoute la machinerie et l'outillage n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat \u00e0 l'exclusion des \u2026\u00bb. Despite the statement (p. 224) that\u2014\u00abLa demanderesse avait droit \u00e0 un profit net de $50,000\u00bb\u2014 some evidence was needed to establish the portion of the $50,000 that should be regarded as profit and recoverable as damage. On this there is no proof with the result that since this type of damage cannot. be presumed and cannot be fixed arbitrarily the Superior Court should have disallowed the item. En ce qui concerne les dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux r\u00e9clam\u00e9s au montant de $25,000, M. le Juge Casey s'accorde avec M. le Juge Lizotte, et croit que la somme de $5,000 est un montant qui, quoique g\u00e9n\u00e9reux, est l\u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 et ne voit pas comment la Cour d'Appel aurait pu intervenir.\nL'une des clauses importantes de ce contrat est la clause 8 qui se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n8. Il est sp\u00e9cialement convenu entre les parties que la Corporation, en aucun temps et de sa seule autorit\u00e9, pourra suspendre, r\u00e9silier et ou annuler le pr\u00e9sent contrat pour des raisons qu'elle estimera raisonnables et sa d\u00e9cision sera finale et sans appel;\nIl sera alors pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent tout ce qui lui est d\u00fb \u00e0 date, suivant les termes du contrat, mais l'agent ne pourra r\u00e9clamer aucun dommage, compensation ou indemnit\u00e9, sous quelque forme que ce soit.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure pas plus que la Cour d'Appel n'a accept\u00e9 cette clause comme \u00e9tant une fin de non recevoir. Les deux tribunaux en sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que l'h\u00f4pital, malgr\u00e9 les mots que l'on trouve \u00e0 l'article 8 \u00abpour des raisons qu'elle estimera raisonnables\u00bb, n'\u00e9tait pas investi du pouvoir de mettre un terme au contrat, et que son droit n'\u00e9tait pas absolu.\nIl est bon de remarquer qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'un contrat \u00e0 forfait. S'il s'agissait d'un semblable contrat, la clause 8 n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire car, par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi, l'art. 1691 du Code Civil aurait trouv\u00e9 son application:\n1691. Le ma\u00eetre peut r\u00e9silier, par sa seule volont\u00e9, le march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait pour la construction d'un \u00e9difice ou autre ouvrage, quoique l'ouvrage soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9, en d\u00e9dommageant l'entrepreneur de ses d\u00e9penses actuelles et de ses travaux et lui payant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats suivant les circonstances.\nMais cet article ne s'applique que lorsqu'il s'agit d'un march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait, et non pas lorsque les parties ont fait un contrat dans le genre de celui qui nous occupe actuellement o\u00f9 l'entrepreneur \u00e9tait \u00abagent\u00bb pour l'h\u00f4pital. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 cause du d\u00e9faut d'application de l'art. 1691 que les parties ont convenu d'intercaler au contrat la clause 8 qui, pour moi, ne pr\u00e9sente aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 vu les faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve.\nIl est certain que cet h\u00f4pital ne pouvait \u00eatre construit \u00e0 moins que les octrois ne soient donn\u00e9s par les autorit\u00e9s provinciales. Le contrat fait mention de ces octrois, et l'une des clauses se lit ainsi:\nIl est entendu entre les parties que le pr\u00e9sent contrat sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme nul si la Corporation n'obtient pas du Gouvernement Provincial l'octroi de Cent cinquante mille dollars \u00e9chu en juin dernier (1957) et l'octroi de Cent mille dollars payable au cours de 1958.\nOr, il est clair que tous ces octrois n'\u00e9taient pas pay\u00e9s quand le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 par l'H\u00f4pital St-Ambroise de Loretteville. M. le Docteur Larochelle, pr\u00e9sident de l'h\u00f4pital, t\u00e9moigne ainsi:\nQ. Quand la corporation a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 la contrat, le 26 novembre 1957, est-ce qu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 la corporation avait recu l'octroi provincial mentionn\u00e9 dans cette clause-l\u00e0?\nR. Non.\nQ. Vous ne l'aviez pas eu?\nPAR LA COUR:\nQ. Aucun octroi?\nPAR Me JULES ROYER:\nQ. Les octrois mentionn\u00e9s ici dans le contrat?\nR. Probablement que nous avions re\u00e7u le premier.\nQ. Il y avait eu des octrois de pay\u00e9s avant?\nR. Oui.\nPlus loin dans son t\u00e9moignage le Dr Larochelle explique que le premier octroi a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 mais que le deuxi\u00e8me ne l'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, qu'il y avait bien une promesse de $150,000 sans arr\u00eat\u00e9 minist\u00e9riel. Il affirme que l'h\u00f4pital \u00e9tait dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de continuer les travaux, car il n'avait pas les fonds voulus et l'octroi de $100,000 n'arrivait pas. L'h\u00f4pital a emprunt\u00e9 de l'argent des banques et s'est engag\u00e9, comme le dit le Dr Larochelle, jusqu'aux limites l\u00e9gales et financi\u00e8res possibles, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 de suspendre les travaux.\nL'h\u00f4pital ne voulait pas entreprendre la construction sans \u00eatre assur\u00e9 des octrois n\u00e9cessaires et, \u00e9videmment, avec la \u00abCambrai Construction\u00bb, les octrois promis n'\u00e9taient pas pay\u00e9s, et l'h\u00f4pital n'avait plus de fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour poursuivre son entreprise.\nLa seule alternative \u00e9tait de changer d'entrepreneur, et le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 avec la \u00abCambrai Construction\u00bb, un nouveau contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 avec la \u00abKomo Construction\u00bb, et des octrois de $1,250,000 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital. Il est certain qu'il fallait un changement d'entrepreneur si les octrois devaient \u00eatre pay\u00e9s. Il me semble \u00e9vident que l'h\u00f4pital ne pouvait continuer dans de semblables conditions, et que le succ\u00e8s de son entreprise, vu l'absence d'octrois, \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieusement compromis.\nM. le Dr Larochelle r\u00e9sume ainsi son t\u00e9moignage:\nQ. C'est que vous voulez dire si vous ne pouviez pas les recevoir finalement ces octrois-l\u00e0, vous n'\u00e9tiez plus capable de marcher?\nR. Exactement.\nEt plus loin, le Dr Larochelle s'exprime ainsi:\nQ. Est-ce que vous voulez dire par l\u00e0, vous, qu'il n'y a aucun h\u00f4pital \u00e0 moins d'avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 de la finance qui ne peut proc\u00e9der sans des octrois?\nR. A moins d'avoir un philanthrope en arri\u00e8re \u2026\nQ. Et le jour m\u00eame que vous r\u00e9siliiez le contrat, vous le donniez \u00e0 une autre compagnie?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Parce que vous \u00e9tiez assur\u00e9s de recevoir vos subsides, n'est-ce pas, sans \u00e7a vous ne l'auriez pas donn\u00e9 si vous n'aviez pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9s de recevoir vos subsides?\nR. C'est exact.\nQ. Et, en fait, vous avez re\u00e7u $1,250,000?\nLe changement d'entrepreneur est la seule raison qui a justifi\u00e9 cette fa\u00e7on d'agir, car l'appelante, nous r\u00e9v\u00e8le la preuve, a tr\u00e8s bien ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 les travaux qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9s. Il n'y a jamais eu de conflit entre les parties.\nL'intim\u00e9e me para\u00eet avoir agi avec clairvoyance, car l'h\u00f4pital qui devait co\u00fbter $750,000 a re\u00e7u en octrois $1,250,000. Ce qui \u00e9videmment inqui\u00e9tait l'intim\u00e9e, c'est que le second octroi de $150,000 n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 l\u00e9galement, et il n'y avait m\u00eame pas de promesse pour l'avenir. Le nouveau contrat a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une nouvelle atmosph\u00e8re dont l'intim\u00e9e a grandement b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9.\nLa Cour d'Appel, comme je l'ai signal\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, a jug\u00e9 que la clause 8 du contrat n'\u00e9tait pas absolue. Quoique l'h\u00f4pital e\u00fbt le droit \u00aben aucun temps et de sa seule volont\u00e9\u00bb de \u00absuspendre, r\u00e9silier ou annuler le contrat\u00bb, il fallait tenir compte des mots \u00abpour des raisons qu'elle estimera raisonnables\u00bb et \u00abcette d\u00e9cision sera finale et sans appel\u00bb, et on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il fallait des raisons et que l'h\u00f4pital ne pouvait pas unilat\u00e9ralement mettre un terme \u00e0 son contrat.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider cette question, car je suis convaincu que l'h\u00f4pital avait des motifs raisonnables de changer d'entrepreneur, afin de lui permet- tre de mener son entreprise \u00e0 bonnes fins, et de la conduire \u00e0 son complet d\u00e9veloppement. Il s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement qu'aucun dommage ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9. Comme l'article 8 du contrat doit trouver toute sa rigide application, parce qu'il constitue la loi des parties, je ne vois pas comment l'appelante peut r\u00e9ussir. L'agent a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 de tout ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9siliation, y compris la proportion des honoraires auxquels il avait droit, et il est convenu que dans le cas d'un telle \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, il ne pourrait r\u00e9clamer aucun dommage ou compensation. Si la clause 8 est absolue, tout recours est \u00e9videmment interdit. Mais si la clause, comme je le crois, justifie la r\u00e9siliation pour des motifs que l'intim\u00e9e a cru raisonnables, alors je suis d'opinion qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 ma satisfaction que des causes suffisantes existaient pour autoriser la r\u00e9pudiation de la convention intervenue.\nA ces raisons qui \u00e0 mon sens justifient le rejet de l'appel principal, je dois ajouter qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si les dommages sp\u00e9ciaux doivent ou non \u00eatre accord\u00e9s. En ce qui concerne les dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, estim\u00e9s \u00e0 $5,000 par le juge au proc\u00e8s et par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel, je crois qu'ils ne peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s pour les motifs qui justifient le rejet de la r\u00e9clamation pour dommages sp\u00e9ciaux.\nPar l'application des termes du contrat (clause 8), qui est la souveraine expression de la volont\u00e9 commune des parties, aucun dommage quel qu'il soit ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9, que ce soit comme r\u00e9sultat de l'absolutisme de ces termes ou de la pr\u00e9sence de motifs raisonnables qui ont justifi\u00e9 sa r\u00e9siliation. Le contrat n'\u00e9tablit aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et les dommages sp\u00e9ciaux.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, de m\u00eame que l'action intent\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours. Le contre-appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens devant cette Cour.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 et contre-appel maintenu.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, appelante: Georges Pelletier, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur de la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e: Jean Turgeon, Qu\u00e9bec.\n1 [1962] B.R. 134.\n2 [1962] B.R. 134.\n"

A notice of the meeting at which the resolution was passed had been sent to the common shareholders but not to the holders of class \u201cA\u201d and class \u201cB\u201d preference shares. The petition was rejected by the trial judge solely on the ground that although only the common shareholders were given voting rights by the letters patent, this did not govern a special meeting of shareholders under s. 10(b) of the Winding-up Act and that all shareholders, preferred as well as common, were entitled to notice and to vote at the meeting.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from this decision and in an unanimous judgment held that the preference shareholders were not entitled to a notice of the meeting and a vote, that the special meeting of shareholders referred to in s. 10(b) was simply a special general meeting of the shareholders within the meaning of s. 101 of the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 53, and, hence, the holders of non-voting preference shares were not entitled to notice or to vote. It was also held that where a majority of the common shareholders have passed a resolution under s. 10(b), any discretion the Court may have to refuse a winding-up order should not be exercised unless it can be shown that the action of the majority shareholders was fraudulent or equivalent to bad faith. Subject to this, the right to decide that a company should be wound up rests with the majority shareholders. By leave of this Court, an appeal was brought from the winding-up order made by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the preference shareholders were not entitled to notice of the meeting and a vote. The submission that there exists in the Court an equitable jurisdiction which in the circumstances of this case should be exercised against the winding-up order failed. The Court has some discretionary power to refuse an order under all subsections of s. 10 with the exception of subs. (a), but where was such a discretion to be found on the application of a preferred shareholder who did not want to be redeemed? Redemption is a normal incident of preference shares. It was true that the \u201cB\u201d shares in contrast to the \u201cA\u201d shares were not redeemable in the ordinary sense. It was also true that they resulted from a reorganization. But the \u201cB\u201d shareholders were really trying to tell the company that in its prosperity it must carry on indefinitely because of their right to participate in the common dividends. A dismissal of the petition would inevitably be an affirmation of this position and would put upon the letters patent a construction that they could not bear, namely, that there could be no winding-up without the consent of the \u201cB\u201d shares.\nSymington v.

Appeal dismissed.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and B.A. Kelsey, for the appellants.\nA.S. Pattillo, Q.C., and D.J. Wright, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal by two shareholders of the respondent company from a winding-up order made by the Court of Appeal1 under s. 10(b) of the Winding-up Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 296, pursuant to a resolution of the common shareholders of the company requiring the company to be wound up. The appellants are the holders of class \u201cB\u201d preference shares of the company. They were granted leave to appeal by this Court on March 16, 1962.\nUnited Fuel Investments Limited was incorporated in 1928 under the provisions of the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 27, for the purpose of acquiring and operating natural and other gas systems and participating in the management and operation of companies with similar undertakings. Immediately after its incorporation it acquired two subsidiaries by the purchase of all the issued shares of these companies. These companies were United Gas Limited and Hamilton By-Product Coke Ovens Limited. The first was a distributing company and the second was a company producing manufactured gas which it sold to the distributing company. I will refer to these three companies from now on as the holding company, the distributing company and the manufacturing company.\nAt incorporation the capital structure of the holding company was as follows:\nAuthorized\nIssued\nPreferred shares, 6 per cent cumulative redeemable $100 par value...............\n250,000\n90,000\nCommon shares no par value...................\n250,000\n100,000\nAll the issued shares, 90,000 preferred and 100,000 common, were issued to a firm of investment dealers for a price of $8,250,000. The preferred shares were sold to the public and the investment dealer retained the 100,000 common shares. These shares, in 1930, it sold to Union Gas of Canada, hereinafter referred to as \u201cUnion Gas\u201d. This was a large company engaged in Western Ontario in the distribution and production of natural gas.\nAs there were 100,000 common shares and only 90,000 preference shares, which only had a vote after four quarterly dividends were in arrear, the control of the holding company was always vested in the holders of the common shares. Because of competitive conditions in the Hamilton area from another company, Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited, neither the distributing company nor the producing company prospered as they might otherwise have done. The result was that Union Gas, as controlling company, the distributing company and Dominion Natural Gas made an agreement to provide for the reorganization of the business, capital and affairs of the holding company. It is unnecessary to go into more detail about this inter-company agreement but in these reasons the reorganization of the capital structure of the holding company is important and it is necessary to deal with it in some detail.\nThe reorganization was approved by order of the Court on January 17, 1939, and embodied in supplementary letters patent dated February 7, 1939. Before its approval, the arrears of dividends on the preference shares amounted to $37. The holder of each 6 per cent preference share of the par value of $100 received as a result of the reorganization:\n(i) 1 6 per cent cumulative redeemable class \u201cA\u201d preference share,\npar value $50;\n(ii) 1 non-cumulative class \u201cB\u201d preference share, par value $25; (iii) a dividend of $2 cash per share, in full payment of $37 in accrued and unpaid dividends.\nThe preference shareholders gave up as a result of this reorganization:\n(a) a capital amount of $25 per share, a total of $2,250,000;\n(b) arrears of dividends of $35 per share, a total of $3,150,000, or\na total of $5,400,000.\nThe following table shows the capital of the holding company before and after reorganization:\nBefore reorganization\nAfter reorganization\n100,000 common shares\nno par value................... $ 100,000\n90,000 common shares,\nwithout nominal or\npar value........................ $ 50,000\n90,000 preference shares,\n$100 par value.............. $ 9,000,000\n90,000, 6 per cent cumu-\nlative redeemable class\n\u201cA\u201d preference shares\nof the par value of\n$50 each........................ $ 4,500,000\n90,000 non-cumulative\nclass \u201cB\u201d preference\nshares of the par value\nof $25 each.................... $ 2,250,000\n$ 9,100,000\n$ 6,800,000\nI have set out these figures in detail because the obvious disparity between the concessions made by the preference shareholders and the common shareholders is urged by counsel for the appellants as a ground for the refusal of the winding-up order. But this reorganization was worked out in 1937 and 1938 and approved by the Court after full consideration in 1939, (Re United Fuels Investments Limited[2]). The dissenting vote was only about one-fortieth of the issued preference shares and the opposition on the motion for approval came from one individual, who did point out that the common shareholders were giving up very little.\nI am concerned here with the rights of the holders of the class \u201cB\u201d preference shares on this reorganization. These rights and their inter-relation with the rights of the class \u201cA\u201d preference shares are set out in the supplementary letters patent as follows:\nClause (a) provides for a 6 per cent cumulative preferential dividend on the class \u201cA\u201d shares and for the non-payment of any dividends on the class \u201cB\u201d and common shares until all arrears of the class \u201cA\u201d shares have been paid.\nClause (b) provides for dividends on the class \u201cB\u201d and common shares in these terms:\n(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of the Class \u201cA\u201d Preference Shares, the moneys of the Company properly applicable to the payment of dividends which the Directors may determine to distribute in any fiscal year of the Company by way of dividends shall be distributed among the holders of the Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares and the Common Shares pro rata according to the number of Shares held.\nClause (c) provides for the priorities of the class \u201cA\u201d shares on a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, gives them an additional $10 per share if the winding-up is voluntary, and denies further participation in the assets.\nClause (d) then deals with the rights of the class \u201cB\u201d shares in the same events in these terms:\n(d) Subject to the rights of the holders of Class \u201cA\u201d Preference Shares the holders of Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares shall have the right on the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or other distribution of assets of the Company among Shareholders (other than by way of dividends out of moneys of the Company properly applicable to the payment of dividends) to repayment of the amount paid up on such Shares, and if such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or distribution be voluntary, to an additional amount equal to $5 per Share before the holders of any of the Common Shares or any other Shares of the Company junior to the Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares shall be entitled to repayment of the amounts or any part thereof paid up on such Common Shares or other junior Shares or to participate in the assets of the Company, but the holders of the said Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares shall not have the right to any further participation in the assets of the Company.\nClause (e) provides for purchase in the market of both the class \u201cA\u201d and class \u201cB\u201d shares at certain prices in these terms:\n(e) The Company, pursuant to Resolution of the Board of Directors, may at any time purchase in the market the whole or from time to time any part of the Class \u201cA\u201d Preference Shares outstanding at a price not exceeding $60 per Shares and unpaid cumulative dividends and costs of purchase, or of the Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares outstanding at a price not exceeding $30 per Share and Costs of purchase. From and after the date of purchase of any Class \u201cA\u201d Preference Shares or Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares under the authority in this paragraph contained, the Class \u201cA\u201d Preference Shares or Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares so purchased shall be deemed to be redeemed and shall be cancelled.\nClauses (f), (g) and (h) provide for the redemption of the class \u201cA\u201d shares at $60 per share on notice.\nClause (i) gives the class \u201cA\u201d shares a right to elect 2 directors if 8 quarterly dividends are in arrears and then deals with the voting rights of both class \u201cA\u201d and class \u201cB\u201d shares in these terms:\nSave as aforesaid, no holder of Class \u201cA\u201d Preference Shares shall have any right to vote at or receive notice of any Annual or Special General Meetings of the Company. No holder of Class \u201cB\u201d Preference Shares shall have any right to vote at or receive notice of any such meetings.\nIt will be seen that the class \u201cA\u201d shares are redeemable both by purchase and on notice. The class \u201cB\u201d shares are only redeemable by purchase. The only other way of paying them off is on a winding-up. The class \u201cA\u201d shares have but limited voting rights and the class \u201cB\u201d shares have none at all unless, as McLennan J. held, they have a right to vote on a winding-up.\nWhen the arrangement was submitted to the shareholders a letter was sent by the President of Union Gas (the controlling company) which held the 100,000 common shares (he was also the President of United Fuels, the holding company) with the following explanation:\nFrom the foregoing and from the enclosed memorandum it will be seen that the proposed arrangement is not primarily a re-organization of capital as between the preferred and common shareholders but is a joint agreement by both classes of shareholders to give up certain rights in order to terminate a disastrous competitive situation with Dominion in the City of Hamilton.\nThe carrying out of the agreement will enable United Gas to control and extend the sale and distribution of all gas now served in the Hamilton area\u2026\nUnder the proposed arrangement, the preferred shareholders will have a preference on dividends to the approximate amount earned on the average during the past ten years. However, their participation in earnings will not be limited as at present because, through the medium of the new Class \u201cB\u201d shares, the preferred shareholders are also enabled to participate equally share per share with the common shareholders in any further distribution made possible by increased earnings.\nI will not concern myself any further with the history of the class \u201cA\u201d shares but between 1942 and 1945, United Fuels (the holding company) purchased for cancellation 20,311 class \u201cB\u201d shares, leaving outstanding 69,689 of these shares.\nIn July 1960, Union Gas, the controlling company, made an offer both to the class \u201cA\u201d and class \u201cB\u201d shareholders. I am not interested in the terms of the offer to the class \u201cA\u201d shareholders. They were redeemable on notice. The offer to the class \u201cB\u201d shareholders was two and a half common shares of Union Gas plus $2.50 for one United Fuel class \u201cB\u201d. Ninety\u2011eight per cent of the class \u201cA\u201d shareholders accepted but only 68 per cent of the class \u201cB\u201d shareholders accepted. The following table shows the particulars of the acceptances, the offer having remained open according to its terms until September 30, 1960:\nShares Out-standing\nShares Exchanged\nShares not Exchanged\nClass \u201cA\u201d...................................\n90,000\n86,814\n3,186\nClass \u201cB\u201d...................................\n69,689\n47,222\n22,467\nThen followed the winding-up proceedings. Union Gas requisitioned the summoning of a meeting for November 8, 1960, to pass a resolution to wind up the company. The company then sent out a notice to the common shareholders but not to the remaining class \u201cA\u201d or class \u201cB\u201d shareholders. Only the common shareholders attended and voted. The vote of the common shareholders was as follows: 89,920 votes for to 8 votes against, with 8 shares not voting. Of the \u201cyes\u201d votes, 89,906 were cast by Union Gas or its nominees. United Fuel then petitioned the Court under s. 10(b) of the Winding-up Act for a winding-up order. McLennan J. rejected the petition solely on the ground that although only the common shareholders are given voting rights by the letters patent, this does not govern a special meeting of shareholders under s. 10(b) of the Winding-up Act and that all shareholders, preferred as well as common, were entitled to notice and to vote at the meeting. The Court of Appeal took a different view. It was a unanimous judgment delivered by Schroeder J.A. They held that the preference shareholders were not entitled to a notice of the meeting and a vote, that the special meeting of shareholders referred to in s. 10(b) is simply a special general meeting of the shareholders within the meaning of s. 101 of the Companies Act and, hence, the holders of non-voting preference shares were not entitled to notice or to vote. They also held that where a majority of the common shareholders have passed a resolution under s. 10(b), any discretion the Court may have to refuse a winding-up order should not be exercised unless it can be shown that the action of the majority shareholders was fraudulent or equivalent to bad faith. Subject to this, the right to decide that a company should be wound up rests with the majority shareholders.\nI agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the preference shareholders were not entitled to notice of the meeting and a vote, and I have nothing to add to the reasons of Schroeder J.A. The main ground of appeal was that there exists in the Court an equitable jurisdiction, which in the circumstances of this case should be exercised against the winding\u2011up order. The common shareholders submit that once they show a resolution of shareholders passed at a meeting properly called and conducted, they are entitled to a winding-up order or, in the alternative, if there is a discretion in the Court to refuse the order, it is exercisable only on very narrow grounds, which do not exist here.\nSections 10 and 13 of the Winding-up Act read:\n10. The court may make a winding-up order,\n(a) where the period, if any, fixed for the duration of the company by the Act, charter or instrument of incorporation has expired; or where the event, if any, has occurred, upon the occurrence of which it is provided by the Act or charter or instrument of incorporation that the company is to be dissolved;\n(b) where the. company at a special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose has passed a resolution requiring the company to be wound up;\n(c) when the company is insolvent;\n(d) when the capital stock of the company is impaired to the extent of twenty-five per cent thereof, and when it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the lost capital will not likely be restored within one year; or\n(e) when the court is of opinion that for any other reason it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up.\n13. The court may, on application for a winding-up order, make the order applied for, dismiss the petition with or without costs, adjourn the hearing conditionally or unconditionally, or make any interim or other order that it deems just.\nI am satisfied that there is some discretionary power under all the subsections with the exception of subs. (a). If the charter has expired or the specified event has occurred a winding-up order must follow the application. There are, however, minor examples of the exercise of discretion under subss. (b), (c) and (d). There is a line of cases, beginning in 1894 and ending in 1918, set out in the footnote[3], where the assets of an insolvent company were being administered under the Assignments and Preferences Act. The Courts asserted a jurisdiction to reject a creditor\u2019s petition for a winding-up order, even where the insolvency was clear, because the application was contrary to the wishes of the majority of the creditors and against convenience and economy in the administration of the assets.\nShareholders\u2019 petitions have been dismissed in cases apparently within the purview of the Act on the ground of triviality of interest and regard for the wishes of the majority[4]. I merely mention these cases in order to put them on one side, for they afford no help in this problem.\nNor do I think that Symington v. Symington[5] and Loch v. John Blackwood Ltd.[6], strongly relied upon in the respondent\u2019s submission, deal with this particular problem. These were concerned with the \u201cjust and equitable\u201d sub-section. Before they were decided it had been held in England that the \u201cjust and equitable\u201d item was merely intended to include cases of the same kind as those covered in previous items of the section, (In re Suburban Hotel Company[7]). Symington v. Symington and Loch v. John Blackwood Ltd. deny this rule of construction and give subs. 10(e) an independent operation which has been widely recognized in a variety of situations. But this independent recognition of the scope of subs. 10(e) does not involve, as counsel for the respondent submitted, the denial of a \u201cjust and equitable jurisdiction\u201d under subss. (b), (c) and (d).\nThe oddity of this case is that a winding-up order is sought for a very prosperous company. It was doing well until 1957 but with the bringing of natural gas into the area served by the company, a period of increasing prosperity and expansion began. The future looks very bright. The class \u201cB\u201d shareholders wish to retain their position and share in this prosperity with the common shareholders. The common shareholders wish to wind up the company and pay the class \u201cB\u201d shareholders off in accordance with the terms of the supplementary letters patent. The class \u201cB\u201d shares, with their right to participate in dividends, have some of the attributes of common shares but they are undoubtedly preference shares with defined rights on a winding-up.\nThe claims of the class \u201cB\u201d shareholders may be summarized as follows:\n(a) That to the extent of their right to participate in dividends, they are in the same position as the common shareholders and should not be eliminated from the company. They assert a right to the continued existence of this company.\n(b) That their sacrifices on the reorganization assured the continued existence of the company.\n(c) That during the period 1947 to 1957, the company retained in the business for the purpose of expansion out of earnings the sum of $3,800,308. These earnings, if the company had not chosen to retain them, would have been available for the declaration of dividends to the \u201cB\u201d and common shareholders. A winding-up will deprive them of any participation in this accumulation.\nThe \u201cB\u201d shareholders also question the reason given by the common shareholders for the winding-up. Union Gas, the common shareholder, says that there is now no reason to continue United Fuel as a holding company with only one subsidiary. In 1959, because of the available supply of natural gas, the Coke company was sold. The result of a winding-up order will be to put all the assets of the holding company and its subsidiary distributing company into Union Gas after payment of all claims. There will undoubtedly be some saving and convenience of administration if this is done. The \u201cB\u201d shareholders answer that this is not the true reason. United Fuel, the holding company, began as a company distributing gas as a result of the operations of two subsidiaries. It is still in the business of distributing gas through the operation of one subsidiary. This one subsidiary, instead of buying manufactured gas from another subsidiary, is buying it from an independent source, Ontario Natural Gas Storage, which happens to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Gas.\nWe have, therefore, on one hand an allegation of a \u201cfreeze-out\u201d; on the other, a submission that convenience of administration justifies the winding-up, and that in any event, the common shareholders are entitled to wind it up. I think the material discloses a good deal of substance in the allegations of the class \u201cB\u201d shareholders concerning the reasons for winding up this company but does this make any difference? They are holders of preference shares. It is true that they are not redeemable by notice but there has always been the right to buy the shares for cancellation and there has always been what, to me, is a clear provision in the constitution of the company for their prior payment on a winding-up and a premium if the winding-up is voluntary.\nWhat does voluntary winding-up mean in these supplementary letters patent? It appears in the conditions relating to the preference shares and the common shares. In a Canadian context it must include a petition based on a shareholders\u2019 resolution under s. 10(b), for the Canadian Act, in contrast to the English Act, does not recognize any winding-up outside the Act.\nTherefore, when the reorganization was put through in 1939, the rights of the \u201cB\u201d shareholders were clearly ascertained. They were subject to redemption on a voluntary winding-up. The supplementary letters patent contemplated the possibility of a voluntary winding-up. It appears very doubtful whether in 1939 anyone thought of a voluntary winding\u2011up because of prosperity but that cannot alter the meaning of the charter of the company.\nI assume that Union Gas is exercising its right, as the common shareholder of this company, to wind up the company in its own self-interest and for convenience and economy of administration. Can a preference shareholder who wants the company to continue prevent this being done?\nWhere can one find a discretion to refuse a winding-up order on the application of a preference shareholder who does not want to be redeemed? It is a normal incident of preference shares that they are subject to redemption. It is true that the \u201cB\u201d shares in contrast to the \u201cA\u201d shares are not redeemable in the ordinary sense. It is also true that they resulted from a reorganization. But the \u201cB\u201d shareholders are really trying to tell the company that in its prosperity it must carry on indefinitely because of their right to participate in the common dividends. A dismissal of the petition would inevitably be an affirmation of this position and would put upon the supplementary letters patent a construction that they cannot bear, namely, that there can be no winding-up without the consent of the \u201cB\u201d shares. This is asking the Court to do what a shareholders\u2019 committee might well have tried to do at the time of the reorganization, if it had been able in 1938 to foresee conditions in 1958. If the company has the right to wind up now, as I think it has, the motives which were so strongly emphasized by counsel for the \u201cB\u201d shareholders have no relevance. Whenever a company chooses to redeem preference shares according to their terms, it is wasting time and effort unless the motive is self-interest.\nCounsel for the class \u201cB\u201d shareholders relied on certain authorities in the United States relating to the dissolution of solvent, prosperous corporations. These cases are: Theis v. Spokane Falls Gaslight Co.[8]; William B. Riker & Son Co. v. United Drug Co.[9]; In re Paine[10]; In re Doe Run Lead Co.[11]; In re Security Finance Co., Rouda v. Crocker[12]. Without going into details, these cases are all concerned with a common problem, an attempt of a majority of common shareholders to get the assets of the corporation into another corporation in which they alone are interested and the minority is not, and to pay off the minority common shareholders in cash. This is an entirely different problem from the right to wind up for the purpose of redeeming preference shares.\nThe dangers inherent in the use of dissolution procedure in such a case are obvious. The first is that the assets may be sold by the majority to themselves under the cloak of a new corporation at an unfair price and the second is the denial to the minority of the opportunity to participate.\nI am not overlooking the case of Castello v. London General Omnibus Co. Ltd.[13], referred to in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal. In that case the Court of Appeal in England refused to restrain a sale of assets to another company exclusively owned by the majority in the old company and compelled the minority in the old company to take a cash payment. It is true that the cash payment was, on its face, a very generous one but the shareholders did not want cash. They wanted to stay with the company instead of being paid off. The case is referred to with approval in the judgment of the Court of Appeal but it is not the present case and I do not think it should receive approval in this Court. As far as I can see, it has never been referred to in any English or Canadian text and has never been judicially noticed either in England or in Canada.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, including the costs of the application for leave to appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, including the costs of the application for leave to appeal.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wright & McTaggart, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blake, Cassells & Graydon, Toronto.\n[1] [1962] O.R. 162, 31 D.L.R.

The respondent attacked the validity of the claim and also denied infringement. The trial judge found that claim 8 was invalid for failure by the appellant to comply with the requirements of s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. He also held that claim 8 had not been infringed.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs found by the trial judge, claim 1 was invalid because, on the evidence, it was improbable that all, or the majority, or even a substantial number of the conceivable substances comprised within the class defined in that claim had the utility referred to in the specification.\nThe question was whether a claimant can satisfy the requirements of s. 41(1) for a claim for a substance, if he has filed a broad process claim for the production of a whole genus of which the substance is but one, if the process claim, because of its generality, is found to be invalid. The Court held that he cannot meet the provisions of the subsection in that way. The subsection was intended to place strict limitations upon claims for substances produced by chemical process intended for food or medicine. Such a substance cannot be claimed by itself. It can only be claimed when produced by a particular process of manufacture. Not only that, the claimant must claim, not only the substance, but that very process by which it is manufactured. To comply with the subsection he must, therefore, make two claims. This meant that he must make valid claims to both the process and the substance, if he is to be entitled, successfully, to claim the latter.\nCommissioner of Patents v. Winthrop Chemical Co. Inc., [1948] S.C.R. 46, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an action for infringement of patent. Appeal dismissed. Christopher Robinson, Q.C., and R. S. Smart, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and I. Goldsmith, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The facts of this case are fully set forth in the careful and comprehensive judgment of the learned trial judge, which is reported in [1962] Ex. CR. 201. It is not necessary, for the purposes of this decision, to repeat them here in detail. The action is by the appellant against the respondent for infringement of the appellant's patent, claiming that the respondent, by selling phenmetrazine hydrochloride tablets, had infringed claim 8 of the patent, which read:\n8. 2-phenyl-3-methylmorpholine, when prepared by the process of claim 1, 2 or 3, or by an obvious chemical equivalent.\nThe appellant's claim was based upon this claim 8, referring only to process claim 1.\nThe material contents of the patent are summarized in the headnote to the report of the case, in 22 Fox Pat. C. 190, as follows:\nPatent No. 543,559 of July 15, 1957, after referring to the known production of substituted morpholines by treating diethanolamines with acids to effect ring closure, and stating the object of the invention to be a process in which ring closure could be carried out under mild conditions, stated the discovery that a specified class of diethanolamines could be ring closed under particularly mild conditions and that the invention related to a process in which diethanolamines of the specified class were ring closed to morpholines by treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid without heating or with dilute acids at moderate temperatures. It then went on to say that \"the morpholines produced according to the invention\" were valuable pharmaceuticals and to describe their pharmacological behaviour \"by the example of one of the compounds of this class, the 2-phenyl-3-methylmorpholine\" (known by the generic name phenmetrazine). Nine examples described the preparation of different members of the class, Examples 2 and 9 describing the preparation of phenmetrazine by two specific processes. Claim 1 was to a process for the production of the defined class of substituted morpholines characterized in that diethanolamines of the defined class are treated in the presence of acids. There were five dependent process claims, a broad product claim to morpholines of the defined class prepared by the claimed process, and finally claim 8 \u2026\nThe respondent attacked the validity of the claim and also denied infringement. The learned trial judge, for various reasons, found that claim 8 was invalid for failure by the appellant to comply with the requirements of s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. He also held that claim 8 had not been infringed.\nHaving reached the conclusion that claim 8 was invalid for failure to comply with s. 41(1), for one of the reasons found by the learned trial judge, it is unnecessary to consider, or express an opinion upon, the other grounds upon which he dismissed the action.\nThe relevant subsections of s. 41 of the Patent Act provide as follows:\n41. (1) In the case of inventions relating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine, the specification shall not include claims for the substance itself, except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents.\n(2) In an action for infringement of a patent where the invention relates to the production of a new substance, any substance of the same chemical composition and constitution shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to have been produced by the patented process.\n(3) In the case of any patent for an invention intended for or capable of being used for the preparation or production of food or medicine, the Commissioner shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary, grant to any person applying for the same, a licence limited to the use of the invention for the purposes of the preparation or production of food or medicine but not otherwise; and, in settling the terms of such licence and fixing the amount of royalty or other consideration payable the Commissioner shall have regard to the desirability of making the food or medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention.\nThe following passages from the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge state the proposition of law upon which, in my opinion, it must be found that claim 8 was invalid:\nIt follows from the foregoing that a patent which includes in its specification a claim which claims more than the inventor has invented purports to grant an exclusive property in more than the inventor has invented and at least in so far as that claim is concerned the patent, in my opinion, is not granted under the authority of the statute and is therefore not lawfully obtained. I think it also follows (even allowing for full scope for the operation of s. 60) that no rights whatever can accrue to the patentee from the presence in the specification of such a claim, either for the purpose of enforcing the property rights thereby purported to be granted or for the purpose of fulfilling a statutory requirement such as that in s 41(1) that a claim for a new substance in a patent to which that subsection applies be limited to the substance when produced by a process which has been \"claimed\". For as I view it, a claim which is invalid because it claims more than the inventor invented is an outlaw and its existence as defining the grant of a property right is not to be recognized as having any validity or effect. Nor is there in the statute any provision for separating what may be good in such a claim, in the sense of what is in accordance with the statute, from what is bad in it, in the sense of what is contrary to or unauthorized by the statute.\n* * *\nI am accordingly of the opinion that if claim 1 is invalid, it cannot serve to fill the requirement of s. 41(1) that a claim for a new substance in a patent to which that subsection applies be accompanied by a claim for the process of producing the substance and be limited to the substance when produced by that process or an obvious chemical equivalent. In this view, the defendant's objections to claim 1 are relevant to the issue of the validity of claim 8.\nThe learned trial judge went on to hold that claim 1 was invalid because, on the evidence, it was improbable that all, or the majority, or even a substantial number of the conceivable substances comprised within the class defined in that claim had the utility referred to in the specification. This finding of the learned trial judge was not challenged before this Court and it was conceded, by counsel for the appellant, that claim 1 was too broad in its terms and was invalid for the reasons given by the learned trial judge.\nThe starting point for the consideration of this issue must be the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Winthrop Chemical Co. Inc.2. It was held in that case that a claim for a substance alone cannot, under s. 41(1) (then s. 40(1)) of the Patent Act, be entertained and that the applicant's specification should describe the method or process by which the substance is prepared or produced and claim a patent therefor in the manner specified in s. 36 (then s. 35).\nCounsel for the appellant contends that this decision goes no further than to hold that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, s. 41 requires a separate claim to be made for the process by which the substance is produced. This, he submits, was done in the present case, because the process claim in claim 1 was for a process applicable to the preparation of the specific substance of claim 8, i.e., 2-phenyl-3-methylmorpholine, which process was incorporated, by reference, into claim 8. Claim 8, he says, if rewritten to include a statement of the process directly rather than by reference, would read:\n2-phenyl-3-methylmorpholine, when prepared by a process characterized in that a diethanolamine of the formula\nH H CH3 C6H5\n| | | |\nHO\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014OH\nis treated in the presence of acids, or by an obvious chemical equivalent.\nHe also points out that a patent was, in fact, issued and contends that the requirements of the Winthrop case have been met if the process has been claimed and that claim has been accepted by the Commissioner of Patents.\nIt should first be noted that claim 8, even if it had been drafted in the way suggested, if it had stood alone would have been invalid. In the Winthrop case there was a recital, in both the description and the claim portions of the specification, of the process by which the claimed substance was produced. There was, however, no claim for that process and the case decided that compliance with s. 41 (1) required that such a claim be made.\nIn the present case there was a claim to a process upon which the appellant relies as being a compliance with the subsection. That claim is claim 1, which is admittedly invalid because it is too broad in its terms and claims more than the appellant was entitled to claim. The question is whether a claimant can satisfy the requirements of s. 41(1) for a claim for a substance, if he has filed a broad process claim for the production of a whole genus of which the substance claimed is but one, if the process claim, because of its generality, is found to be invalid.\nIn my opinion, he cannot meet the provisions of that subsection in that way. The subsection was intended to place strict limitations upon claims for substances produced by chemical process intended for food or medicine. Such a substance cannot be claimed by itself. It can only be claimed when produced by a particular process of manufacture. Not only that, the claimant must claim, not only the substance, but that very process by which it is manufactured. To comply with the subsection he must, therefore, make two claims. In my opinion this means that he must make valid claims to both the process and the substance, if he is to be entitled, successfully, to claim the latter. To interpret the subsection as meaning that all that is necessary is to file a claim for the process, valid or not, would be to defeat its purpose. A person who claims a substance within the subsection, supported only by a process claim which is invalid, is in no better position than was the respondent in the Winthrop case, who, while referring to a process, had not claimed it. In the Winthrop case the claimant had claimed too little. In the present case he has claimed too much. But the result in each case is the same in that there has been no claim filed which results in the claimant's obtaining a valid patented process for the production of the substance which he claims.\nThe view which I have expressed as to the effect of s. 41(1) is, I think, implicit in the reasons for judgment given by this Court in that case and I agree with the view of the learned trial judge in the present case when he said:\nNor do I think the effect of the judgment in the Winthrop case is so limited as Mr. Robinson submits. The case holds that in a case to which s. 41(1) applies, a claim for a new substance must be accompanied by a claim for a process for producing it, but it is, I think, impossible to read the judgment as meaning that a claim for an exclusive property to which the inventor was not entitled and which was therefore illegal and invalid could serve the purpose.\nIn the Winthrop case this Court, in determining the meaning of subs. (1), obtained assistance from the provisions of subss. (2) and (3), which immediately follow it. I think that similar assistance can be obtained in determining the issue in the present case.\nSubsection (2) creates a statutory onus of proof, which applies in actions for infringement of patents relating to the production of a new substance. It provides that any substance of the same chemical composition and constitution shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, \"be deemed to have been produced by the patented process.\"\nSubsection (3) provides, in the case of a patent for an invention intended or capable of being used for the preparation or production of food or medicine, for the granting of a licence, by the Commissioner of Patents, for the use of \"the invention\" for the purpose of the preparation of the food or medicine, and it provides for the fixing by him of a royalty, or consideration, to be paid for such licence. In the Winthrop case, Estey J., who delivered the judgment of the Chief Justice and himself, made the following reference to subs. (2) of what was then s. 40 of the Act, at p. 49:\nMoreover, this construction of section 40(1) is consonant with the use of the phrase \"patented process\" in 40(2). In this subsection Parliament is raising a presumption in favour of a plaintiff with respect to one of the essentials that must be proved in an action for infringement of his patent under section 40(1). In this regard Parliament speaks only of the \"patented process\", which emphasizes the construction already placed upon section 40(1). These subsections read together contemplate among the possible actions one for an infringement with respect to the process in which the substance is new but not patented but do not contemplate a patent for a substance only.\nKellock J., who delivered the judgment of Taschereau J. (as he then was) and himself, makes the following comments with respect to both subss. (2) and (3) at p. 53:\nBy subsection 2 it is provided that in an action for infringement of a patent where the invention relates to the \"production\" of a new substance, any substance of the same chemical composition and constitution is, in the absence of contrary proof, to be deemed to have been produced by the patented process. If the respondent is right in its contention as to the construction of subsection 1, subsection 2 would have no application to a substance within subsection 1 produced by a process not itself the subject of patent. I think it unlikely that such a result was ever intended but rather that the provisions of the two subsections are supplementary.\nAgain when one turns to subsection 3, the same consideration appears. It provides that in the case of a patent for an invention intended for or capable of being used \"for the preparation or production\" of food or medicine, the Commissioner of Patents has power to grant a licence to an applicant therefor limited to the \"use of the invention for the preparation or production\" of food or medicine (i.e. the process) and it is declared that in settling the terms of the licence regard shall be had to the desirability of making the food or medicine (i.e. the substance) available to the public at a proper price. Under this provision it is the invention which is to be the subject of the licence and it is the process which is referred to by the subsection as the invention. If, therefore, subsection 1 is to be interpreted as applying to a substance produced by a process which need not be patentable, no licence could be obtained under subsection 3 for its production. In my opinion no such effect was intended by the legislation.\nRand J., at p. 56, also called in aid the provisions of subss. (2) and (3) and said:\nI agree that ss. (2) could, as a matter of words, be construed to have only a partial application, limited to those cases in which the process itself is patented; but why, if under ss. (1) the process may be old, in the juxtaposition of the two subsections, the procedural benefit should not have been extended to the patentee of a substance restricted in production to an old process, has not been made apparent. I agree, also, that under ss. (3) a license for the process may be deemed to imply a license for the substance itself where that likewise is the subject of patent; but if the substance could be patented along with an old process, it would be a distortion of language to say that a license could issue for the substance alone and the declared purpose of the subsection would be defeated.\nIn my opinion, the reasoning in each of these passages quoted applies with equal force, not only to the specific issue before the Court in the Winthrop case, i.e., must an applicant for a patent for a substance under s. 41(1) make a specific process claim, but also to the issue which is before the Court in this case, i.e., can there be a valid patent for a substance within s. 41(1) if the process claim which has been made for the process of its production is found to be invalid.\nFor the foregoing reasons, in my opinion, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Duncan, Goldsmith, Doran & Caswell, Toronto.\n1 [1962] Ex.

Ces parts, tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans l'option, furent d\u00e9pos\u00e9es entre les mains d'une compagnie de fid\u00e9icommis, le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, qui avisa le demandeur du d\u00e9p\u00f4t et du fait qu'elles seraient d\u00e9tenues par elle selon les termes de l'option. Six mois plus tard, le d\u00e9fendeur Butler, par lettre enregistr\u00e9e, avisa le demandeur que l'option \u00e9tait r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e. Copie de cette lettre fut aussi adress\u00e9e au fid\u00e9icommis. Le demandeur, accompagn\u00e9 d'un notaire, se pr\u00e9senta imm\u00e9diatement aux bureaux du fid\u00e9icommis, offrit l'argent et r\u00e9clama la livraison des parts, ce qui fut refus\u00e9. Le demandeur intenta une action pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au montant de $72,000, \u00e9tant la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix pr\u00e9vu et le prix sup\u00e9rieur pr\u00e9valant \u00e0 ce moment \u00e0 la bourse. Cette action ne proc\u00e9da \u00e9ventuellement que contre Beaudry et le fid\u00e9icommis.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9valua les dommages \u00e0 $68,500, et l'action fut maintenue pour ce montant. Par un jugement majoritaire, la Cour d'appel modifia ce jugement pour condamner conjointement et solidairement les deux d\u00e9fendeurs pour le tout. Les d\u00e9fendeurs et le demandeur aussi appel\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: Les appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s.\nL'entente entre les parties \u00e9tant devenue, tel que voulu, une entente tripartite, ne pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e sans l'intervention du demandeur. Indivisible, elle avait le double objet de consacrer une option unilat\u00e9ralement irr\u00e9vocable, et de consacrer l'obligation du fid\u00e9icommis d'en assurer l'exercice \u00e9ventuel. Il ne peut donc \u00eatre question d'une stipulation pour autrui au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du demandeur puisqu'il \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 cette entente. C'est donc \u00e0 bon droit qu'on a jug\u00e9 que Beaudry et Butler n'avaient aucun droit de r\u00e9voquer, que le fid\u00e9icommis \u00e9tait tenu de livrer les actions lors de l'offre de paiement et qu'il y avait eu rupture de contrat engageant la responsabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9fendeurs. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait conjointe et solidaire puisque la transaction \u00e9tait commerciale et sa r\u00e9vocation dolosive. Il n'appara\u00eet au dossier aucune raison pour modifier le quantum des dommages.\nIl n'y avait pas lieu de demander la r\u00e9solution de la vente, puisque la vente n'a jamais eu lieu. L'offre d'achat n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e. L'action en dommages pour cause de r\u00e9vocation de l'option \u00e9tait donc bien fond\u00e9e.

J. BUTLER\nRegistered copy to\nGeneral Trust of Canada.\n(Pencil Note): No-62826\nCopie de cette lettre, adress\u00e9e au Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, fut re\u00e7ue par Oscar Lauzon, le g\u00e9rant de la division d'administration concern\u00e9e.\nLe lendemain, 15 mars, Randall se pr\u00e9senta au bureau du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, accompagn\u00e9 du notaire John Everett Todd qui, s'adressant au pr\u00e9sident de l'institution, lui offrit en bonne et due forme la somme de $100,000 et r\u00e9clama la livraison des 20,000 parts. A ce prot\u00eat, celui-ci r\u00e9pondit:\u2014\u00abI cannot do it at the present time owing to the revocation of Mr. Randall's option by Mr. Butler\u00bb; et, requis par le notaire de signer sa r\u00e9ponse, il refusa de ce faire. C'est alors que Randall s'adressa aux tribunaux.\nDans son action intent\u00e9e une quinzaine de jours plus tard contre Beaudry, Butler, le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et Aconic Mining Corporation, il invoqua les faits ci-dessus et demanda \u00e0 ce que tous les d\u00e9fendeurs soient condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 lui payer, \u00e0 titre de dommages r\u00e9sultant de rupture de contrat, la somme de $72,000, diff\u00e9rence entre le prix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'option et subs\u00e9quemment offert, et le prix sup\u00e9rieur pr\u00e9valant \u00e0 ce temps \u00e0 la Bourse pour les 20,000 actions.\nCette action en justice ne proc\u00e9da \u00e9ventuellement que contre Beaudry et le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada; Randall s'en \u00e9tant d\u00e9sist\u00e9 dans le cas d'Aconic Mining Corporation et Butler ayant fait cession de ses biens:\nEn d\u00e9fense, Beaudry, d'une part, plaida principalement que l'option \u00e9tait r\u00e9vocable en aucun temps; que donn\u00e9e en consid\u00e9ration de services \u00e0 rendre et subs\u00e9quemment non rendus, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 validement r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e et qu'aucuns dommages n'avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 subis par Randall par suite de cette r\u00e9vocation. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soumit en substance qu'il \u00e9tait simplement d\u00e9positaire de ces actions, qu'il n'avait commis aucune faute, qu'il n'avait contract\u00e9 aucune obligation \u00e0 l'endroit de Randall et qu'entre ce dernier et le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, il n'y avait aucun lien de droit.\nA l'enqu\u00eate, la preuve faite par les parties et retenue par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance se limite, \u00e0 vrai dire, \u00e0 la preuve orale faite pour \u00e9tablir les dommages et aux \u00e9crits ci-dessus reproduits, auxquels \u00e9crits les parties ont donn\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente pour en tirer, en droit, des conclusions oppos\u00e9es.\nDans un jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9, M. le Juge Smith, de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, jugea en somme que l'option donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Randall n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e l\u00e9galement; que le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada avait assum\u00e9 des obligations, non seulement envers Beaudry et Butler mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Randall; qu'il ne pouvait se lib\u00e9rer de ces obligations en l'absence du consentement de ce dernier \u00e0 la r\u00e9vocation de l'option; que le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e9tait tenu de livrer les 20,000 actions lorsque lui fut faite l'offre de paiement de la somme de $100,000; et qu'il y avait eu, de la part des d\u00e9fendeurs, rupture de contrat engageant leur responsabilit\u00e9 pour les dommages en r\u00e9sultant. Consid\u00e9rant la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix de $5 l'unit\u00e9, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'option, et le prix moyen de $8.42 \u00bd pr\u00e9valant, dans ses vues, sur le march\u00e9 aux 14 et 15 mars 1957, il \u00e9valua les dommages \u00e0 la somme de $68,500. Enfin, \u00e9tant d'avis que la transaction entre Beaudry et Butler, d'une part, et Randall, d'autre part, n'\u00e9tait pas d'une nature commerciale, il condamna le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 payer au demandeur $68,500 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats, dont $34,250 conjointement et solidairement avec Beaudry, montant au paiement duquel celui-ci fut lui-m\u00eame condamn\u00e9.\nDe ce jugement, il y eut trois appels, celui de Beaudry et celui du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, tous deux pour obtenir le rejet de l'action de Randall, et celui de Randall contre Beaudry et le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada pour obtenir une augmentation du montant accord\u00e9, en premi\u00e8re instance, pour dommages, et une condamnation conjointe et solidaire des deux d\u00e9fendeurs pour le tout.\nPar un jugement majoritaire, la Cour d'Appel2 rejeta les deux premiers appels et accueillit en partie le troisi\u00e8me, pour modifier, tel que demand\u00e9, la nature de la condamnation.\nDes notes tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9es fournies par chacun des Juges appara\u00eet leur accord \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer, comme l'avait fait le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que sans l'assentiment de Randall, l'option qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par Beaudry et Butler ne pouvait \u00eatre validement r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e et que le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada avait, au moment o\u00f9 on lui offrit la somme de $100,000, l'obligation de livrer les 20,000 parts. MM. les Juges Hyde, Taschereau et Choquette, de la majorit\u00e9, furent en outre d'avis que Randall n'\u00e9tait pas tenu, contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention des d\u00e9fendeurs-appelants, de conclure \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du contrat pour obtenir les dommages; que la transaction intervenue \u00e9tant de nature commerciale et la r\u00e9vocation de l'option \u00e9tant dolosive, les d\u00e9fendeurs devaient \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement au paiement de tous les dommages; que le montant accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 par la preuve et qu'il n'y avait pas lieu de le modifier.\nDissidents, MM. les Juges Rinfret et Badeaux furent d'avis que Randall aurait d\u00fb demander la r\u00e9solution des ententes intervenues et que le d\u00e9faut de ce faire ne permettait pas de faire droit \u00e0 l'action en dommages qu'il avait prise contre les d\u00e9fendeurs. Dans ces vues, n'ayant pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les autres questions, ils auraient maintenu les appels de Beaudry et du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et renvoy\u00e9 celui de Randall.\nCes trois jugements de la Cour d'Appel ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 quatre pourvois devant cette Cour: celui de Beaudry et celui du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada pour faire infirmer le jugement rejetant leur appel respectif, celui de Beaudry \u00e0 l'encontre du jugement accueillant en partie l'appel de Randall, et celui de Randall pour obtenir cette augmentation du montant des dommages que la Cour du banc de la reine refusa de lui accorder sur son appel du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nLa question fondamentale \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est \u00e9videmment celle de la port\u00e9e des engagements assum\u00e9s dans les circonstances par Beaudry et Butler et par le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada par suite des lettres du 29 ao\u00fbt et du 3 octobre 1956. La premi\u00e8re de ces lettres, de Beaudry et Butler \u00e0 Randall, est, en termes expr\u00e8s, confirmative de pourparlers et d'un accord de volont\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement intervenus entre ces trois personnes. Suivant cet accord, Beaudry et Butler donnent \u00e0 Randall, en consid\u00e9ration des services par lui rendus \u00e0 Aconic Mining Corporation, le droit, valable pour un an \u00e0 compter du 29 ao\u00fbt 1956, d'acheter, s'il le d\u00e9sire et au moment de son choix, 20,000 actions d'Aconic Mining Corporation, au prix de $5 l'unit\u00e9; et pour assurer \u00e9videmment l'exercice \u00e9ventuel de ce droit, on pourvoit \u00e0 l'entiercement des actions entre les mains du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada requis, d\u00e8s que mis en possession, d'en aviser Randall et de lui signifier en outre son acceptation de la mission qu'on entend lui confier. Cette lettre, constitutive (i) du titre permettant \u00e0 Randall d'exiger du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et (ii) de l'autorit\u00e9 du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada de faire la livraison de ces actions sur offre du paiement du prix dans le d\u00e9lai imparti, fut remise de main \u00e0 main par Butler \u00e0 Randall l'acceptant, au bureau m\u00eame d'Aconic Mining Corporation o\u00f9 elle appara\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et sign\u00e9e.\nPar la seconde lettre, celle du 3 octobre suivant, le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada avise Randall de la r\u00e9ception de copie de la lettre du 29 ao\u00fbt \u00abby Messrs. Joseph Beaudry and C. J. Butler and yourself\u00bb, de la r\u00e9ception des actions, et lui signifie, tel que requis, l'acceptation de la mission qui lui est confi\u00e9e; le tout \u00e9tant en parfaite ex\u00e9cution des termes de la lettre du 29 ao\u00fbt 1956.\nAinsi donc, les parties \u00e0 l'entente confirm\u00e9e par la lettre du 29 ao\u00fbt 1956, ont jug\u00e9 opportun et convenu, pour en assurer l'ex\u00e9cution \u00e9ventuelle, de recourir \u00e0 l'intervention d'un tiers, soit le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Le Trust, fid\u00e8lement instruit de cette entente en recevant copie m\u00eame de cette lettre, acc\u00e9da \u00e0 leur demande et signifia son assentiment \u00e0 Beaudry et Butler par l'acceptation des actions et \u00e0 Randall par sa lettre du 3 octobre. D\u00e8s lors, l'entente devenait, tel que voulu, une entente tripartite. Cette entente tripartite ne pouvait, sans l'intervention de Randall, \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e. Indivisible, elle avait un double objet, (i) consacrer une option,\u2014de sa nature irr\u00e9vocable sans l'assentiment de Randall, ainsi qu'en ont jug\u00e9 le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance et tous les Juges de la Cour d'Appel en s'appuyant sur une doctrine depuis longtemps arr\u00eat\u00e9e,\u2014et (ii) consacrer l'obligation du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, o\u00f9 on entier\u00e7a les actions, d'assurer l'exercice \u00e9ventuel de cette option irr\u00e9vocable. Dans ces vues, il ne peut \u00eatre question, \u00e0 mon avis, d'une stipulation pour autrui au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Randall puisqu'il \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 cette entente. On ne peut davantage avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 poursuivre la question pour d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure l'obligation ainsi assum\u00e9e par le Trust participe des contrats de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ou de mandat dont elle peut emprunter quelques-uns des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sans n\u00e9cessairement tous les contenir; l'intention des parties contractantes est claire et doit recevoir son effet. Telle est, en somme, la port\u00e9e des engagements assum\u00e9s dans les circonstances par Beaudry et Butler et par le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada par suite des lettres du 29 ao\u00fbt et du 3 octobre 1956. C'est donc \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel ont jug\u00e9 que Beaudry et Butler n'avaient aucun droit de r\u00e9voquer l'option, que le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e9tait tenu de livrer les actions au moment o\u00f9 paiement lui en fut offert, et qu'il y avait eu de leur part rupture de contrat engageant leur responsabilit\u00e9 pour les dommages en r\u00e9sultant. Beaudry pr\u00e9tend \u00e9chapper \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 parce que la lettre de la r\u00e9vocation de l'option ne fut sign\u00e9e que par Butler; cette pr\u00e9tention ne peut \u00eatre retenue; il a donn\u00e9 son accord \u00e0 cette r\u00e9vocation, ainsi qu'il appert de ses admissions aux plaidoiries.\nPartageant \u00e9galement l'avis exprim\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel que la transaction intervenue \u00e9tait de nature commerciale et que la r\u00e9vocation de l'option \u00e9tait, dans les circonstances, dolosive, il s'ensuit, comme on a jug\u00e9, que Beaudry et Butler sont conjointement et solidairement responsables, avec le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, de tous les dommages.\nRandall, par son action, r\u00e9clama $72,000 \u00e0 titre de dommages, en adoptant, comme mesure de son pr\u00e9judice, la diff\u00e9rence, soit $3.60, entre le prix unitaire \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'option et celui pr\u00e9valant au march\u00e9 le 18 mars 1957, cette date \u00e9tant, suivant lui, le premier jour o\u00f9 il lui \u00e9tait possible de vendre ces actions. Le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 prendre en consid\u00e9ration le prix du march\u00e9 obtenant \u00e0 la date de la lev\u00e9e de l'option, soit le 15 mars, mais en l'absence de preuve du prix pour cette date, il a pris en consid\u00e9ration le prix moyen de $8.42 \u00bd pay\u00e9 pour les 17,925 actions transig\u00e9es \u00e0 la Bourse le 14 mars, jour de la r\u00e9vocation de l'option, et accorda ainsi la somme de $68,500. En Cour d'Appel, seuls les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 eurent \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la question. S'appuyant particuli\u00e8rement sur les raisons du Juge Migneault dans The Mile End Milling Company v. Peterborough Cereal Company3, ils ont approuv\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation du pr\u00e9judice suivie par le Juge au proc\u00e8s et donn\u00e9, de plus, leur accord au montant auquel celui-ci s'\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9. Au regard du dossier, il n'appara\u00eet aucune raison d'intervenir pour modifier cette \u00e9valuation du pr\u00e9judice de Randall.\nReste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9tention, retenue en appel par les Juges dissidents, que Randall ne peut obtenir de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour rupture de contrat parce qu'il n'a pas conclu, dans son action, \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de ce contrat.\nLa fid\u00e8le ex\u00e9cution \u00e9ventuelle de l'obligation des promettants-vendeurs fut, en vertu de l'entente tripartite, assum\u00e9e par le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada qui, aux fins de cette ex\u00e9cution, devait agir aux lieu et place des promettants-vendeurs et \u00e0 l'exclusion m\u00eame d'une intervention unilat\u00e9rale de leur part. Ceci \u00e9tait de l'essence m\u00eame de l'entente. B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de cette entente tripartite, Randall \u00e9tait libre, durant la p\u00e9riode impartie pour ce faire, d'accepter la promesse de vente et ce, au moment m\u00eame de son choix. Jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment, il n'y avait encore aucun contrat de vente. Ce contrat ne pouvait se former en l'esp\u00e8ce que par le concours de volont\u00e9s de Randall et du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada agissant, comme ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9, pour les promettants-vendeurs. La notion de concours de volont\u00e9s implique qu'\u00e0 un m\u00eame moment donn\u00e9, deux volont\u00e9s coexistent. Planiol et Ripert, Droit Civil, 2e \u00e9d., tome VI, 241, au n\u00b0 126. Cette simultan\u00e9it\u00e9 de volont\u00e9s ne s'est pas produite, car au moment o\u00f9 Randall signifiait son consentement au Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada par l'offre de paiement et la r\u00e9quisition de livraison des actions, le Trust, en violation de son engagement, donna effet \u00e0 l'intervention et \u00e0 la r\u00e9vocation pr\u00e9alables de Beaudry et Butler. Sans doute, cette inex\u00e9cution de leurs obligations par Beaudry, Butler et le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada constitue-t-elle une source de responsabilit\u00e9 pour les dommages en r\u00e9sultant pour Randall, mais il ne s'ensuit pas que, du fait de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 du retrait de la promesse de vente, le contrat de vente doive \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme conclu. On trouve, sur le point, les commentaires suivants de Planiol et Ripert, supra, \u00e0 la page 152, n\u00b0 132:\nD\u00e8s lors que l'offre comporte obligation de la maintenir pendant un temps, la r\u00e9vocation avant l'expiration de celui-ci est pour l'offrant une source de responsabilit\u00e9, par le fait m\u00eame de la r\u00e9vocation, sans que l'acceptant ait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une faute de l'offrant dans l'exercice de celle-ci, sauf \u00e0 celui-ci \u00e0 prouver l'absence de faute. Mais faut-il d\u00e9clarer la r\u00e9vocation inefficace et consid\u00e9rer l'offre, qui devait \u00eatre maintenue, comme l'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en droit, et par suite consid\u00e9rer le contrat comme n\u00e9cessairement conclu, par la jonction en temps utile de l'acceptation avec l'offre?\nNous ne le croyons pas. Il manque l'accord de volont\u00e9s qui est l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du contrat. Sans doute les conditions pratiques de sa conclusion, lorsqu'il a lieu entre absents, forcent \u00e0 ne pas exiger strictement la co\u00efncidence de cet accord au moment d\u00e9cisif de la formation du contrat. Mais la doctrine d'apr\u00e8s laquelle le contrat serait form\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9vocation conduit \u00e0 dire que le r\u00e9voquant peut lui-m\u00eame invoquer cette formation: ce qui, dans les contrats qui par leur seule formation transportent les risques d'une chose d'une partie \u00e0 l'autre, lui permettrait malgr\u00e9 sa r\u00e9vocation, de mettre la perte de sa chose \u00e0 la charge de l'acceptant. Cette cons\u00e9quence est contraire \u00e0 la bonne foi.\nLe contrat peut sans doute \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 conclu par le juge, mais seulement sur la demande de l'acceptant, et \u00e0 titre de dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'auteur de l'offre sera condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 passer le contrat, et faute de le faire \u00e0 voir le jugement en tenir lieu.\nLa vente ne s'est donc pas form\u00e9e et il n'y avait pas lieu, par cons\u00e9quent, d'en demander la r\u00e9solution.\nEt alors que restait-il de cette entente tripartite, de cette option d\u00e9j\u00e0 p\u00e9rim\u00e9e avant l'instruction de l'action, ou de la possibilit\u00e9, m\u00eame avant sa p\u00e9remption, de l'ex\u00e9cuter suivant sa teneur v\u00e9ritable par suite de la r\u00e9vocation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'acceptation de Randall et \u00e0 laquelle le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada donna effet? Les actions d'Aconic Mining Corporation \u00e9taient, ainsi qu'il appert au dossier, hautement sp\u00e9culatives. Le temps \u00e9tait de l'essence de cette entente tripartite et il appartenait exclusivement \u00e0 Randall de choisir le moment de la lev\u00e9e de l'option. D\u00e8s le retrait ill\u00e9gal de cette promesse de vente, Randall pouvait par action en justice opter pour la possession d\u00e9 ces actions ou une somme d'argent \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'action qu'il a prise implique n\u00e9cessairement qu'il a abandonn\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re alternative-offrant une compensation de mesure al\u00e9atoire\u2014pour opter pour la seconde. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les Juges dissidents et d'accord avec les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, je dirais que, dans les circonstances, l'action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que les trois jugements de la Cour d'Appel doivent \u00eatre maintenus et que les quatre appels devant cette Cour doivent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9s, avec d\u00e9pens dans chacun des cas.\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur du d\u00e9fendeur Beaudry: Edouard Masson, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada: Laurendeau & Laurendeau, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs du demandeur Randall: Hyde & Ahern, Montr\u00e9al.\n1 [1962] B.R. 577.\n2 [1962] B.R. 577.\n3 [1924] R.C.S. 120 \u00e0 132, 4 D.L.R. 716.\n"

It was clearly stipulated in the lease and agreed that there would not be another store in the centre whose business would be devoted primarily towards the sale of candies and nuts. Some time later another store was leased to a company which was in that business. The plaintiff asked for the annulment of the lease on the ground that it had been violated. The trial judge dismissed the action but the Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, annulled the lease. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe prohibition to lease premises to another store in the same business applied only to that portion of the land described in the agreement as the \"centre\", and, as found by the trial judge and the two dissetting judges in the Court of Appeal, the new store leased was outside the boundaries of the centre as contemplated by the parties.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Charbonneau J. Appeal allowed.\nC. A. Geoffrion, Q.C., and M. B. Spiegel, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. F. Chisholm, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014On the 5th of November 1959, the appellant Frego Construction Inc. leased to respondent Mary Lee Candies Limited a store situated on Lafleur Avenue in the City of Lasalle, described in the lease as follows:\nThose certain premises presently being built by the Lessor on Lafleur Avenue, in the City of Lasalle, Province of Quebec, and forming part of a proposed shopping centre to be built by the said Lessor, between the existing building containing the Royal Bank at the comer of Jean Milot Street and Lafleur Avenue, and the existing Steinberg's Supermarket;\nThe said shopping centre being erected on land more fully designated as follows:\u2014\nthat certain block of land in the City of Lasalle, Province of Quebec, situated on the northwest side of Lafleur Avenue, being of irregular shape and composed of the whole of Lots. Nos. 958-19-1-1, 958-19-2, 958-19-3, 958-20-1, 958-20-2 and 958-20-3-1 and part of Lot No. 958-19-1-3 of the Official Cadastre of the Parish of Lachine, Registration Division of Montreal, which said block of land measures two hundred and eight and thirty-eight hundredths (280.38') feet in its southeast line along Lafleur Avenue, two hundred and five (205) feet in its Southeast line and two hundred (200) feet in its northeast line, all measurements being English measure and more or less;\nThe said shopping centre being built by the Lessor shall be referred to hereinafter as 'The Centre';\nThe premises being built as part of the Centre, which is being leased by these presents to the Lessee herein, shall measure ten feet (10') in frontage center to center of walls along Lafleur Avenue, by a depth of sixty feet (60') more or less; i.e. center lines of partitioning walls. (S.M.W.M.F.).\nIt is clearly stipulated in the lease and agreed that there will not be another store in the Centre whose business would be devoted primarily towards the sale of candies and nuts. The Centre was built between The Royal Bank, at the corner of Jean Milot Street and Lafleur Avenue, and the existing Steinberg's Supermarket. Some time later, another store was leased to Laura Secord which company was in the same business. The claim of the respondent is that this had constituted a violation of the agreement and asked that the lease entered into be declared annulled and cancelled, for all future purposes. Mr. Justice Charbonneau of the Superior Court dismissed the action, but the Court of Appeal2, Hyde and Owen JJ. dissenting, came to the conclusion that the trial judge's judgment should be reversed, and annulled the lease entered into between the appellant and the respondent.\nI have reached the conclusion that the prohibition to lease premises to another store selling candies and nuts, applies only to that portion of the land described in the agreement as the \"Centre\".\nI fully agree with the finding of the trial judge, concurred in by Hyde and Owen JJ., that the new store leased to Laura Secord was outside the boundaries of the \"Centre\" as contemplated by the parties.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Spiegel, Shriar & Polak, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: T.

In 1954, it underwrote an issue of preferred and common shares of a company and retained 22,000 of the common shares in an \"investment account\". In 1956, the appellant received the right to acquire one new common share for each four it held. It thus received 5,500 shares which were immediately sold at a profit of $19,250. In 1957, the appellant sold 2,000 of its 22,000 shares at a profit of $57,032.88. The appellant contended that both profits were capital gains, but the Minister assessed them as income derived from business. The assessment was affirmed by the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe shares were not purchased as an investment, they formed part and were received by the appellant as part of an underwriting transaction. They were sold in the course of the appellant's business of underwriting, and any profits arising from their disposition were profits from the appellant's business. It made no difference that they were retained in what the appellant chose to call an \"investment account\". This retention was inseparably connected with the underwriting activity, and the profits derived from this activity, whether immediate or deferred, were subject to income tax.\nThe trial judge erred in rejecting a tender of evidence by the Minister concerning the appellant's financial statements for 1958, 1959 and 1960 and purchases and sales of other securities recorded in the investment account. This was relevant to show a course of conduct and to show that at all times the shares in question were part of the appellant's stock-in-trade.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thorson P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming the appellant's assessment for income tax.\nAlan Sweatmen, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson, Q.C., and J. A. Irving, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The appellant company, among other activities, carries on the business of an investment dealer. In 1954 it agreed to purchase from Trans-Prairie Pipelines Limited a new issue of preference and common shares. It purchased 140,000 preference shares for $700,000, less a commission of $37,500, and 190,000 common shares for $140,000. We are concerned in this appeal with the common shares. The company sold 140,000 of these for $140,000, leaving it with a balance of 50,000 shares. 28,000 of these were used as a bonus on the sale of the preference shares at the rate of one common share for each five preference shares, leaving the appellant with 22,000 common shares which it retained in its investment account.\nIn 1956, Trans-Prairie Pipelines Limited gave its common shareholders the right to purchase one new common share for each four held. The appellant thus became entitled to 5,500 shares, which it immediately sold at a profit of $19,250. Counsel admits that this profit is taxable if the next mentioned profit in the year 1957 is taxable.\nIn 1957, the appellant sold 2,000 shares out of the block of 22,000 common shares which it had retained in its investment account since the 1954 underwriting. On this sale it realized a profit of $57,032.88. Both the profits on the sale of the rights in 1956 and on the sale of the 2,000 shares in 1957 were assessed for income tax as income derived from the appellant's business. The appellant argues that they were capital gains. The judgment of the Exchequer Court 2 was that they were income subject to taxation.\nMuch evidence was heard on the reasons why the appellant retained the block of 22,000 common shares but it is all adequately summarized in the reasons of the learned President of the Exchequer Court when he said that the appellant thought that it was a good investment and hoped that its retention would lead to further business from the issuing company. The ratio of the decision in the Exchequer Court which I wish to affirm is that the appellant did not purchase these shares as an investment. They formed part of and were received by the appellant as part of an underwriting transaction. They were acquired and, to the extent of 2,000 shares, were sold in the course of the appellant's business of underwriting, and any profits arising from their disposition were profits from the appellant's business. The fact that they were retained in what the appellant chose to call an \"investment account\" made no difference. This retention was inseparably connected with the appellant's underwriting activity and the profits derived from this activity, whether immediate or deferred, were subject to income tax.\nI attach no importance to the fact that on the figures that I have quoted above, these 22,000 shares may be regarded as the appellant's commission for the underwriting of the common shares. Even if this had not been so, it would still be a case where the shares had been acquired and sold and the profits made in the course of the appellant's business.\nCounsel for the Minister on this appeal argued that there was error in a ruling on evidence made at the trial. The learned trial judge, against counsel's objection, rejected a tender of evidence and cross-examination on the following matters:\n(a) the financial statements of the appellant for its 1958, 1959 and 1960 taxation years;\n(b) purchases and sales of securities recorded in the investment account in the years subsequent to the years under appeal;\n(c) purchases and sales of securities recorded in the investment account in the 1956 and 1957 taxation years in the cases where the appellant at the end of the 1957 taxation year still held some of these securities.\nIn my opinion, there was error in the rejection of this evidence. It was relevant to show a course of conduct in trading in securities recorded in the investment account, and to show that at all times the shares of Trans-Prairie Pipelines Limited sold in 1956 were part of the appellant's stock-in-trade and that the profit from the sale of these shares arose from the business carried on by the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pitblado, Hoskin & Company, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

During their course of the hearing, the appellant's request for a suspension of the proceedings in order to apply for a writ of certiorari, was granted. The Superior Court judge held that the writ was premature. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe sole question was whether the provisions of the Quebec Medical Act, E.S.Q. 1941, c. 264, as amended, deprived the appellant of any remedy by way of certiorari while proceedings were pending before the Council on Discipline. To acceed the appellant's contention would render otiose the words contained in s. 62 of the Act \"and to the exclusion of any Court\".

On August 24, 1961, he was summoned to appear before the Council on Discipline of the said College to answer a complaint made by the Registrar, alleging that appellant had committed certain acts derogatory to the honour and dignity of his profession. On the date fixed for the hearing, September 14, 1961, appellant appeared, assisted by counsel, before the respondents Gobeil and Beauchesne sitting as members of the said Council.\nAt the outset of the hearing, appellant through his counsel raised certain legal objections to the complaint which were rejected by the Council. The hearing proceeded. During the course of the hearing, appellant asked that the proceedings be suspended in order that he might apply for a writ of certiorari to evoke the proceedings to the Superior Court. The hearing was suspended and on September 28, 1961, appellant, by petition, applied to the Superior Court for the issue of a writ of certiorari, alleging among other things that the respondents were acting without jurisdiction or had exceeded their jurisdiction, that the by-laws in virtue of which the complaint had been made were null and void, and that the proceedings contained grave irregularities.\nBy judgment rendered October 23, 1961, Mr. Justice Andr\u00e9 Montpetit dismissed the application for a writ of certiorari as being premature. The present appeal by leave, is from that judgment.\nThe sole question which arises on this appeal is one of law, namely whether the provisions of the Quebec Medical Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 264, as amended, deprived appellant of any remedy by way of certiorari while proceedings were pending before the said Council on Discipline. This question turns, primarily, upon the effect to be given to ss. 62, 71 and 74 of the said Act which read:\n62. It shall be the duty of the Council on Discipline to inquire into, to consider, hear and decide finally and to the exclusion of any court, subject to appeal to the Provincial Medical Board, every charge or complaint against any member of the College, for infraction of his professional duties or for any act derogatory to the honor and dignity of the profession. 71. The disciplinary penalties which may be imposed by the Provincial Medical Board or by the Council shall be:\n1. Deprivation, for a certain time, of the right to vote at elections of governors and at all general meetings of the members of the College;\n2. Deprivation of the right to be elected to the office of governor;\n3. Deprivation of the right of a member of the Provincial Medical Board to sit at one or more sittings;\n4. Censure;\n5. Dismissal from the Provincial Medical Board;\n6. Suspension from the practice of the profession of medicine and surgery, which entails during suspension the dismissal of such member from the College;\n7. Dismissal from the College.\n74. 1. Every decision of the Council on Discipline entailing suspension or dismissal, shall be subject to appeal to the Provincial Medical Board. Notice of such appeal shall be served by a bailiff upon the registrar who has reported the decision to the member of the College who has been suspended or dismissed, within fifteen days following the date of the service. Such appeal shall be taken into consideration only at a regular session of the Provincial Medical Board.\n2. No member of the Council may sit in appeal from a judgment rendered by the Council of which he is a member.\n3. Articles 237 and 238 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to the members of the Provincial Medical Board sitting in appeal.\n4. The quorum of the members of the Provincial Medical Board sitting in appeal shall be eight members.\n5. The appellant shall deposit with his notice of appeal the sum of fifty dollars on account of the costs occasioned by such appeal.\nIf he succeeds in such appeal the said sum shall be returned to him. The losing party shall be condemned to pay it to the Provincial Medical Board with the other costs occasioned by such appeal.\n6. The Provincial Medical Board shall decide the appeal summarily, and the registrar shall within eight days forward a certified copy of such decision to the appellant, by registered letter.\n7. The only mode of evoking the case before judgment or of having the judgment rendered revised is by means of a writ of certiorari.\nIn essence appellant's contention is that notwithstanding the provisions of s. 62 of the Act, the remedy of certiorari is available to him under art. 1292 of the Code of Civil Procedure while proceedings are pending before the Council on Discipline and that s. 74(7) applies to such proceedings, as well as to those before the Provincial Medical Board.\nI am unable to agree with that contention. To do so it seems to me, would render otiose the words \"and to the exclusion of any court\" contained in s. 62. In my opinion, in that section the Legislature has provided in clear terms that the Council on Discipline has jurisdiction to proceed with and complete, without judicial interference, an inquiry into the matters therein specified. It is not necessary to express any opinion as to what the situation might be after the Council has completed its inquiry and rendered a decision but before an appeal, if any, is taken to the Provincial Medical Board, and I therefore refrain from doing so.\nSubsection 7 of s. 74 must be read in the context in which it is found. It is contained in a section which deals exclusively with appeals to the Provincial Medical Board, from decisions of the Council on discipline which entail suspension or dismissal. The language of the subsection is clear and unambiguous and in my opinion it relates exclusively to proceedings before the Provincial Medical Board either before or after judgment.\nI am in respectful agreement with the learned trial judge that the application for a writ of certiorari while proceedings were pending before the Council on Discipline was premature, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellant: Roger Beaulieu and Guy Favreau, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the respondents and mis-en-cause: Louis-Claude Trudel, Montreal.\n"

Quant \u00e0 l'appel de la sentence, o\u00f9 cette Cour n'a pas juridiction, M. le Juge Owen l'aurait rejet\u00e9 \u00e9tant d'opinion qu'elle \u00e9tait raisonnable, mais MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Taschereau n'ont pas cru devoir se prononcer sur ce point, vu l'opinion qu'ils ont \u00e9mise sur le jugement de culpabilit\u00e9. Ils ont conclu, \u00e0 cause de l'acquittement, que cet appel devait \u00eatre tenu pour non avenu et qu'il devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'accus\u00e9-intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u $1,000 d'Antoine Th\u00e9oret afin de lui obtenir une licence pour la vente de la bi\u00e8re, de la R\u00e9gie des Alcools de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.

St-Michel, d\u00e9clare solennellement que: Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 vous raconter pourquoi j'ai re\u00e7u $1,000 dollars de M. Antoine Th\u00e9oret et aussi je vais vous dire \u00e0 qui devait aller cet argent.\nQ. Avez-vous bien compris la mise en garde?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Depuis combien de temps connaissez-vous M. Antoine Th\u00e9oret?\nR. Je le connais depuis environ 4 ans, car je suis un de ses clients, \u00e0 sa grocerie \u00e0 Ville St-Michel, de plus, j'ai eu l'occasion de le mieux conna\u00eetre, car un peu apr\u00e8s les \u00e9lections de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1960, il est venu me voir pour obtenir une licence de bi\u00e8re pour sa grocerie, je suis all\u00e9 avec lui rencontrer le secr\u00e9taire du d\u00e9put\u00e9 Jean Meunier, c'est-\u00e0-dire M. Raoul Laforte, j'ai recommand\u00e9 M. Th\u00e9oret pour avoir la dite licence. Je dois vous dire qu'auparavant M. Th\u00e9oret m'avait dit qu'il me r\u00e9compenserait, il m'a demand\u00e9 combien cela lui co\u00fbterait et je lui ai dit que d'habitude, pour avoir une licence de bi\u00e8re, \u00e7a co\u00fbtait $1,000, il a fait un signe affirmatif. Par la suite au mois de septembre, j'ai eu des entrevues avec lui, je lui ai dit que des inspecteurs iraient chez lui pour inspection, peut-\u00eatre. Le 28 septembre 1960, M. Th\u00e9oret m'a inform\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du d\u00e9partement des permis et je lui ai dit d'y aller. Le lendemain soir, \u00e0 6.00 p.m., M. Th\u00e9oret est venu chez moi \u00e0 7270, 7\u00e8me avenue, il m'a dit qu'il n'avait pas d'argent et il m'a dit qu'il viendrait au commencement de la semaine prochaine pour r\u00e9gler \u00e7a. Je lui ai dit que j'avais quelqu'un \u00e0 rencontrer en la personne d'un monsieur que je ne lui ai pas nomm\u00e9.\nQ. Voulez-vous nous dire \u00e0 qui devait aller l'argent que nous avons saisi chez-vous?\nR. Une somme de $200 devait me revenir et la balance devait aller \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 B\u00e9langer dont j'ai le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone chez moi, celui-ci m'a dit par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone que le restant \u00e9tait pour la caisse du comt\u00e9.\nsign\u00e9: NORMAND DESPR\u00c9S\nt\u00e9moin: Paul-E.

Le texte anglais emploie le mot \u00abofficial\u00bb pour traduire le mot \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb. Or, l'article 99 (d) et (e) d\u00e9finit ces mots. Cet article se lit ainsi:\n99. d) \u00abcharge\u00bb ou \u00abemploi\u00bb comprend\n(i) une charge ou fonction sous l'autorit\u00e9 du gouvernement;'\n(ii) une commission civile ou militaire; et\n(iii) un poste ou emploi dans un d\u00e9partement public;\ne) \u00abfonctionnaire\u00bb d\u00e9signe une personne qui\n(i) d\u00e9tient une charge ou un emploi, ou\n(ii) est nomm\u00e9e pour remplir une fonction publique;\nJe suis d'opinion que l'accus\u00e9-intim\u00e9, en pr\u00e9tendant exercer de l'influence aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des Liqueurs ou de ses fonctionnaires, a viol\u00e9 les dispositions ci-dessus du Code Criminel. Les fonctionnaires de la Commission des Liqueurs sont nomm\u00e9s pour remplir une fonction publique. La Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par une loi de la L\u00e9gislature. Ses officiers dirigeants sont nomm\u00e9s par le Gouvernement de la province, et tous les profits qui sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par la vente des alcools sont vers\u00e9s dans le fonds consolid\u00e9. Il est vrai que la Commission est une corporation, mais ses activit\u00e9s ne sont qu'un prolongement des activit\u00e9s gouvernementales. Ce serait une erreur de penser qu'il existe au point de vue l\u00e9gal une cloison \u00e9tanche entre le Gouvernement et la Commission. Cette derni\u00e8re, \u00e9videmment, a plus de libert\u00e9 d'action et d'ind\u00e9pendance qu'un autre d\u00e9partement gouvernemental. Elle est une \u00e9manation de la Couronne, et toute personne qui y occupe un poste, tient un emploi dans un d\u00e9partement public, au sens de l'article 99 (d) du Code Criminel.\nLe statut de la Commission des Liqueurs de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 par notre Cour dans la cause de La Commission des Ligueurs de Qu\u00e9bec v. Moore3, alors que Sir Lyman Duff s'est ainsi exprim\u00e9:\nThat the Commission is an instrumentality of government is clear from the circumstances that the members of the Commission are appointed by the Governor in Council and are removable at pleasure (s. 6); that all property in the possession of or under the control of the Commission is expressly declared to be the property of the Crown; and that all moneys received by the Commission at the discretion of the Provincial Treasurer are remissible to him, and, on receipt by him, become part of the consolidated funds of the province (s. 18); that the Commission is accountable to the Treasurer in the manner and at the times indicated by the latter (s. 19). The Commission, moreover, exercises authority respecting the sale of liquor in the province, and infractions of the law dealing with that subject are prosecuted in the name of the Commission or of the municipality where the infraction occured. By s. 13, the employees of the Commission are declared to be public officers, and they are required to take the oath of public service as such.\nDe plus, dans Regina v. Gibson4, la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les structures, les fins, l'objet et les pouvoirs de la Commission des Liqueurs de cette province, en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion suivante:\nApplying that test to the present case, it is clear that the Commission is only a manager for carrying on as an agent or servant of the Government of the Province what has been made by the Act, the business of the Government, or, in other words, the Commission is merely an administrative body appointed by the Government with certain duties and powers entrusted to it for carrying out the administration of the Act, through the instrumentality of which the Government exercises government control over transactions in liquor within the Province.\nJe dois donc n\u00e9cessairement conclure que les employ\u00e9s de la Commission des Liqueurs sont des \u00abofficiers publics\u00bb, et que par l'effet combin\u00e9 des articles 102 et 99 du Code Criminel, toute personne qui pr\u00e9tend exercer de l'influence aupr\u00e8s d'eux, moyennant r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en consid\u00e9ration de l'obtention d'un avantage ou b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, est coupable d'une offense criminelle.\nL'appel de la Couronne doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, et le jugement de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli. Mais comme l'accus\u00e9 a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel de la sentence prononc\u00e9e et que, par suite de l'acquittement, la Cour n'a pas cru devoir se prononcer sur le m\u00e9rite de ce dernier appel, le dossier est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour inf\u00e9rieure pour adjudication d\u00e9finitive, si celle-ci le juge \u00e0 propos.\nAppel maintenu.\nProcureur de l'appelante: Claude Wagner, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l'intim\u00e9: Raymond Daoust, Montr\u00e9al.\n1 [1962] B.R. 567, 38 C.R. 337.\n2 [1962] B.R. 567, 38 C.R. 337.\n3 [1924] R.C.S. 540, 4 D.L.R. 901.\n4 (1954), 20 C.R. 330, 35 M.P.R. 265, 111 C.C.C. 72.\n"

Beaman, [1963] S.C.R. 445\nDate: 1963-04-01\nHer Majesty The Queen Appellant;\nand\nHartley Beaman Respondent\n1963: February 28, March 1; 1963: April 1.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION.\nCriminal law\u2014Arrest\u2014Escaping from lawful custody\u2014Assistant forest ranger making search of vehicle under Game Act\u2014Whether a \"peace officer\"\u2014Whether escape constitutes escape from lawful custody\u2014The Game Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 95\u2014The Forest Service Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 93, s. 7, as amended by 1960 (N.B.), c. 34\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 2(30)(c), 29(2)(b), 110(a), 125(a), 434, 437.\nThe respondent was charged and convicted of escaping from custody contrary to s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code. An \"assistant forest ranger\" stopped a truck driven by the respondent and stated he was going to search it. While the ranger returned to his car to get an axe to pry open a door of the truck, the respondent commenced backing the truck. The officer followed in his car. When the truck stopped after about half a mile, the officer got out of his car, pulled out the truck's ignition key and told the respondent that he was under arrest. The officer had no warrant.\nThe conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the Crown had failed to prove that the respondent was lawfully arrested under the Game Act, and consequently that it could not rely on the Act to support its contention that the respondent was in lawful custody at the time of his escape. The contention of the Crown, which appealed to this Court, was that the assistant forest ranger, being a deputy game warden under the Game Act, was a peace officer under the Criminal Code.\nHeld: The appeal of the Crown should be dismissed.\nThe Game Act gives every game warden, including a deputy as was ex-officio every assistant forest ranger, the powers of a constable and therefore of a peace officer within the meaning of the Code. It is true that these powers are limited to provincial laws and are conferred solely for the purpose of the Game Act, nevertheless any person who wilfully obstructs a game warden in the execution of his duties commits the indictable offence of wilfully obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 110 of the Criminal Code.\nHowever, in 1960, by an amendment to the Forest Service Act, the words \"assistant forest ranger\" were deleted and substituted by \"district forest ranger\" or \"extension forest ranger\". The information described the arresting officer as an assistant forest ranger, and the Crown's case was closed without any evidence to show that, in 1961 at the time of the arrest, the officer held any of the positions upon which the authority of a provincial constable or a game warden was conferred by the statute then in force. Accordingly, the record failed to disclose that the officer was a peace officer or that he had any authority to stop a vehicle for search, or that the respondent in acting as he did committed any offence for which he could be lawfully arrested without a warrant. The respondent was therefore not proved guilty of escaping from lawful custody.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, setting aside the respondent's conviction. Appeal dismissed.\nL. D. D'Arcy, for the appellant.\nDouglas E. Rice, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought with leave of this Court, from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside the conviction of the respondent by the Magistrate for Albert County on the charge that, on the 1st day of December 1961, he did,\nbeing in lawful custody, having been arrested without a warrant by Assistant Forest Ranger Austin Goggin, escape from such custody contrary to s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe Appeal Division found that Austin Goggin was an \"assistant forest ranger\" and that the respondent had escaped from his custody, so that the only question remaining to be determined was \"whether the evidence established a lawful arrest\". The circumstances of the arrest are described in the decision appealed from in the following terms:\nThe facts are Austin Goggin, accompanied by one Babin, another Assistant Forest Ranger, while on game patrol during the evening of December 1, 1961, was driving his car on a highway in the Flint Hill area of the Parish of Elgin in the County of Albert. At about 8.00 p.m., Goggin and Babin got out of the car and stopped a half-ton truck approaching them which was being driven by the defendant who had seated beside him Mrs. Marjorie Robb and her husband Irvine Robb, the owner of the truck, Mrs. Robb being in the centre.\nAfter stopping the truck, Goggin and Babin told the occupants they were going to search it. Goggin then went to his car to get an axe to pry open a plywood door on the truck. While he was doing this, the defendant commenced backing the truck. Goggin got in his car and followed. The evidence is that after the truck had backed up on the road about one-half of a mile it stopped and Goggin placed his car in such a position that the truck could not pass if it attempted to move forward. He then got out of his car, ran to the truck, and reaching in from the passenger side, turned off the ignition switch and pulled out the key. At the same time Goggin said to the occupants \"You're under arrest.\" He had no warrant for the arrest of any of them. Under the provisions of s. 19 of The Game Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 95 (as amended), \"every game warden\" may, without warrant, stop and search any vehicle for evidence of a violation of the provisions of the Act, and s. 1(u) of the same Act provides that unless the context otherwise requires \"game warden\" includes an ex officio deputy game warden under The Forest Service Act.\nOn the assumption that \"the Forest Service Act sets forth that every assistant forest ranger is ex officio a deputy game warden under The Game Act\", Bridges J.A., who rendered the decision of the Appeal Division, concluded that there was \"no question but that Goggin and Babin, as ex officio game wardens, had the authority to stop and search the truck \u2026\", but he went on to hold that \"the Crown failed to prove that the defendant was lawfully arrested without a warrant under The Game Act and cannot rely on such Act to support its contention that he was in lawful custody at the time of his escape\".\nIt was, however, contended by the Crown that in backing up the truck after having been told of the proposed search, the respondent was wilfully obstructing \"a peace officer in the execution of his duty\", contrary to s. 110(a) of the Criminal Code, and was therefore committing an indictable offence and subject to lawful arrest without a warrant by \"any one\" who found him committing it (s. 437 of the Criminal Code).\nBridges J.A. found that by backing the truck as he did the respondent wilfully obstructed Goggin and Babin in the execution of their duty, but that, although he considered them to be \"game wardens\" under The Game Act, they were not \"peace officers\" within the meaning of s. 110(a) of the Criminal Code, and that accordingly no offence had been committed for which the respondent could have been lawfully arrested without a warrant.\nThe application pursuant to which leave to appeal was granted to this Court is limited to this latter finding as it is based upon the following grounds:\n1. The Court having found that the deputy game warden was wilfully-obstructed in the execution of his duty was in error in holding that the said deputy game warden was not a peace officer under s. 2(30)(c) of the Criminal Code.\n2. That there is conflict in the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, in the above noted case and the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Smith, 1942, 3 D.L.R. 764.\nSection 2(30)(c) of the Criminal Code provides that:\nA peace officer includes a police officer, police constable, bailiff, constable or other person employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace, or for the service or execution of civil process.\nThe general powers and authority of a \"game warden\" are described in s. 18 of The Game Act, which reads as follows:\n18. Every warden may and shall for the purpose of this Act, exercise all the powers and authorities of a provincial constable and shall have the same power to ask and require assistance in the performance and execution of his duties as a peace officer or constable in the execution of his duty as such, and every warden shall be ex officio a peace officer within the meaning of any law for the protection of peace officers.\nThe decision of the Appeal Division that such a warden is not a \"peace officer\" as defined by s. 2(30)(c) was expressed by Bridges J.A. in one part of his decision in the following language:\nThis section (i.e., s. 18 of the Game Act) does not make a warden a provincial constable, who comes within the definition of peace officer under the Code. It only purports to give a warden the powers of such a constable when enforcing the Game Act. These powers must, in my opinion, be limited to provincial laws and cannot include the right to arrest for criminal offences without warrant for, although the Province may appoint constables and other law enforcement officers it cannot give them the authority to act in criminal matters, such field of legislation belonging wholly to the Federal Parliament.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that this passage is not altogether clear. In my view, the provisions of s. 18 of The Game Act not only purport to give but do give to every \"game warden\" the powers of a \"constable\" and therefore of a \"peace officer\" within the meaning of ss. 2(30)(c) and 110 of the Criminal Code. I agree that these powers are limited to provincial laws and are conferred solely for the purpose of The Game Act but this does not alter the fact that any person who wilfully obstructs a \"game warden\" in the execution of his duties under that Act is committing the indictable offence of wilfully obstructing a \"peace officer in the execution of his duties\", contrary to s. 110 of the Criminal Code.\nAs has been observed, it is provided by s. 434 of the Criminal Code that \"any one may arrest without warrant a person whom he finds committing an indictable offence\" (the italics are mine), and it is accordingly apparent that the right to arrest without a warrant under these circumstances is not conferred by any provincial law or accorded to a \"game warden\" by virtue of The Game Act but is a right which stems directly from the Criminal Code and is, by that statute, conferred on every citizen.\nThe situation appears to me to be that although the sphere of a game warden's authority is limited to the enforcement of a provincial statute, he is, nevertheless, for that purpose and by that statute, clothed with all the rights, powers and protections afforded to a peace officer by the Criminal Code. With all respect, this does not in my view mean that the province is giving to one of its law enforcement officers \"the authority to act in criminal matters\" and I cannot see that this legislation gives rise to any problem or conflict between the provincial and federal fields.\nThis appears to me to dispose of the question on which the application for leave to appeal is based but it does not determine the matter.\nThe case for the Crown, and much of the decision of the Court of Appeal, is predicated upon the assumption, stated by Bridges J.A., that:\nThe Forest Service Act sets forth that every assistant forest ranger is ex officio a deputy game warden under The Game Act, and s. 1(u) of the latter states that in it, unless the context otherwise requires, \"warden\" or \"game warden\" includes an ex officio game warden under The Forest Service Act.\nThis was a true statement of the law until The Forest Service Act was amended by c. 34 of the Laws of New Brunswick 1960.\nAs enacted by R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 93, s. 7 of The Forest Service Act provided that:\nEvery district forester, assistant forester, forest ranger and assistant forest ranger, has hereby conferred on him all the power and authority of a provincial constable and of a seizing officer under the Crown Lands Act, and he is also ex officio a deputy game warden under The Game Act and a fishery guardian under The Fisheries Act.\nThe 1960 amendment to The Forest Service Act provided for the employment of temporary officers and servants for the purpose of this Act, and it also amended s. 7 as follows:\nSection 7 of the said Act is amended by striking out the words \"assistant forester, forest ranger and assistant forest ranger\" in the first two lines thereof and substituting therefor the words \"district forester, assistant district forester, inspector, district forester ranger, extension forest ranger and forest ranger\".\nAustin Goggin, who was the informant in this case, is described in the Information as an \"assistant forest ranger\", he testified that he was \"an assistant forest ranger\", and the Court of Appeal made an express finding that he was \"an assistant forest ranger\".\nIt is conceivable that the 1960 amendment merely evidenced a change in the title of \"assistant forest ranger\" to that of \"district forest ranger\" or \"extension forest ranger\" but the Crown's case was closed without any evidence being adduced to show that on December 1, 1961, the informant held any of the positions upon which the authority of a provincial constable or a game warden is conferred by the statute then in force, and the time for explanations is now long past.\nAccordingly, the record before us fails to disclose that Austin Goggin was a \"peace officer\" or that he had any authority to stop a vehicle for search, or that the respondent in acting as he did was committing any offence for which he could be lawfully arrested without a warrant.\nIt is true that it has been held on more than one occasion that evidence of a person acting in an official capacity may, under certain circumstances, raise a rebuttable presumption of his due appointment to that office, but this is not a rule of universal application and certainly cannot apply so as to clothe Austin Goggin with the authority of a \"warden\" under The Game Act, since he has testified to the fact that he holds an appointment which does not carry that authority with it.\nIn view of the above, I do not find it necessary to consider the contention that the arrest was unlawful because the respondent was not given notice \"of the reason for the arrest\", as required by s. 29(2)(b) of the Criminal Code.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. D. D'Arcy, Fredericton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D. E: Rice, Petitcodiac\n"

One of its major sources of supply of lumber had been for some years one P Co. In 1952, P Co. was in financial difficulties. The appellant, with the intention of making P Co. a subsidiary as it had done with two other companies in 1943 and 1944, and thus assuring itself of not losing this source of supply, obtained an option to purchase all the issued shares of P Co. for $50,000. Some two months later, the appellant received an offer of $160,000 for those shares from a third party. The option was then exercised and the shares were resold to the third party for $160,000 and other stated considerations. The Minister treated the profit made on the resale as income. The appellant contended that the option to purchase the shares was a capital asset and that the sale of the shares was a realization of that capital asset. The assessment was affirmed by the Exchequer Court, and the taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThis was not a simple purchase and sale of shares. The appellant, having only an option on shares, did not carry out its plan to make the supplier a subsidiary. It exercised the option and sold the shares for cash and other considerations, and this gave both the purchase and sale of the shares a trading character rather than acquisition and realization of a capital asset. The profit was therefore a profit from a business.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming the Minister's assessment. Appeal dismissed.\nP. N. Thorsteinsson and D. J. Johnston, for the appellant.\nT. J. Cross and D. C. H. Bowman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014Hill-Clark-Francis Limited appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer Court2 which held that a profit made on the sale of certain shares in the year 1952 was income and not a capital gain.\nThe appellant was incorporated in 1913 and carries on business in Northern Ontario on a large scale as a general contractor and as a wholesaler and retailer in lumber. It buys and manufactures lumber, some of which it uses in its construction business; some it sells through its retail outlets, and some it sells in wholesale lots.\nA major supplier of lumber to the appellant in 1952 was a company called Poitras Fr\u00e8res Inc. The appellant had contracted in each year since 1943 to purchase the whole annual production of lumber of this company. In the year 1952, Poitras Fr\u00e8res was producing about one-third of the appellant's lumber requirements. To enable Poitras Fr\u00e8res to produce the logs and manufacture the lumber, the appellant made advances from time to time which were to be considered as payments on account of the purchase price of the products.\nIn the winter of 1951-52, Poitras Fr\u00e8res Inc. was in financial difficulties, and in May 1952, the appellant approached the principal shareholder with a view to purchasing all the issued shares of that company. This was done because the appellant feared that if Poitras Fr\u00e8res went out of business, it would lose one of its major sources of supply.\nIn June 1952, the appellant obtained for $100 from Roger Poitras, the principal shareholder, an option exercisable at any time up to November 20, 1952, to purchase all the issued shares of the company for $50,000. The appellant took an option rather than make an outright purchase of the shares at that time because it was temporarily short of cash on account of the seasonal nature of its business.\nIn 1943 and 1944, the appellant had acquired control through the purchase of shares of two other lumber companies. In each case its object in making these purchases was to ensure continuing sources of supply. The appellant still controls these subsidiary companies through share ownership and they continue to supply lumber to the appellant.\nI am prepared to accept the appellant's submission that in purchasing the shares of Poitras Fr\u00e8res Inc., it was intending to make this company its subsidiary just as it had done with the two companies purchased in 1943 and 1944. But, in late August 1952, a Mr. Horace Strong, who was the majority shareholder in Haileybury Lumber Company, began to negotiate with the appellant for the purchase of the Poitras shares and, in September 1952, the appellant accepted his offer of $160,000 for these shares. The appellant then exercised its option and paid the option price of $50,000 to Roger Poitras, took delivery of the shares and then sold them to Mr. Strong for $160,000.\nThe agreement of purchase and sale also provided for:\n(a) the cancellation of all contracts between the appellant and Poitras. This means that the appellant gave up its right to receive the lumber it had contracted for;\n(b) the payment by the appellant of a sum sufficient to reduce the Poitras bank loan to $60,000; (c) repayment of the appellant's advances to Poitras amounting to approximately $280,0000;\n(d) cancellation of the appellant's guarantee of the Poitras bank loan when it was reduced to $60,000.\nIt is apparent from this outline that this was not a simple purchase and sale of shares. On these facts, the conclusions of the learned trial judge, in my respectful opinion, are correct and unassailable. He found that the appellant, having only an option on shares, did not carry out its plan to make Poitras a subsidiary. It exercised the option and sold the shares for cash and the other stated consideration, and this gave both the purchase and sale of the shares a trading character rather than acquisition and realization of a capital asset. He therefore correctly held that the profit so realized was a profit from a business within the meaning of s. 3(c) of the Income Tax Act as defined by s. 139(1)(e), and was properly treated as income.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman & Elliott, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 455\nDate: 1963-10-02\nAlistair Fraser (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen on the information of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1963: February 20, 21, 22; 1963: October 2.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nExpropriation\u2014Land taken as source of rock for causeway\u2014No market for rock apart from building of causeway\u2014Compensation for special adaptability\u2014Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64.\nCertain lands of the defendant, comprising 110.1 acres and having a \"bare ground\" value of about $50 per acre, were expropriated by the Crown for the purpose of opening up a stone quarry on the said lands to provide rock for the building of a causeway. These lands had no value for any purpose other than that for which they were expropriated and there was no prospect of any other commercial exploitation. The Crown later abandoned all the lands with the exception of 12.8 acres and the abandoned lands revested in the defendant. At the time of the expropriation the contract had been let for the construction of the causeway, under authorization of a prior order in council, and there were specific provisions in the contract relating to the rock on the defendant's lands which indicated that these lands were to be the source of the rock for the construction of the causeway and that it would be supplied free to the contractor. The contractor had the right to use rock from any other source that he might choose provided it was equal to or better than the rock contained in the defendant's lands and met with the approval of the engineer.\nAn action was brought to determine the compensation to be awarded to the defendant in respect of the expropriation of his lands. The defendant appealed and the Crown moved to vary the judgment of the trial judge.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The plaintiff's contention that the only potential value of the expropriated lands over and above their \"bare ground\" value was solely and exclusively related to the scheme of constructing the causeway and should accordingly have been excluded in fixing the value for the purposes of compensation failed. Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste, [1914] A.C. 569; Fraser v. City of Fraserville, [1917] A.C. 187; Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. Ltd. v. Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands, [1947] A.C. 565, considered. None of these cases was authority for the proposition that a hitherto undeveloped potentiality of expropriated property is to be entirely disregarded in fixing the value of that property for compensation purposes on the ground that the expropriating authority is the only present market for such potentiality and that it has developed a scheme which involves its use. These cases, however, made it plain that the amount fixed by way of compensation must not reflect in any way the value which the property will have to the acquiring authority after expropriation and as an integral part of the scheme devised by that authority.\nThe exclusion from the Court's consideration of increase in value consequent on the execution of the undertaking to build a causeway and of any value based on the Crown acting under compulsion as a necessitous purchaser did not mean that the value of the special adaptability to the owner at the date of expropriation was to be disregarded. Vyricherla Narayana Gajaptiraju (Raja) v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam, [1939] A.C. 302, followed.\nThe effective date for valuation of this property was the date of expropriation and the reality of the matter was that the Crown was expropriating tons of rock in the ground rather than acres of land in the rough so that the value of the special adaptability of these lands was to be determined on the basis of the value that a willing vendor might reasonably expect to obtain from a willing but not anxious purchaser for the rock in situ at the date of expropriation.\nThe value of the special adaptability was limited to the 12.8 acres which were retained by the Crown. The value of the 97.3 acres revested in the defendant did not enter into the calculation of the compensation except to the extent that the defendant was entitled to interest on the value of the whole 110.1 acres from the date of expropriation to the date of revesting.\nNo amount for compulsory taking was allowed. Drew v. R., [1961] S.C.R. 614, followed.\nPer Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The statements found in numerous authorities, that the person whose property is taken for the public use shall receive no more than the value of that property to him, did not mean that he is to receive less than the market price where that is ascertainable. Lake Erie and Northern Railway. Co. v. Brantford Golf and Country Club (1917), 32 D.L.R. 219, referred to. In relation to a case such as the one at bar where what is expropriated is really building material rather than land, the principle underlying the decisions relied on by the plaintiff (other than in V\u00e9zina v. R.) was that the owner of property taken for the public use shall not receive a price inflated beyond its market value because of the necessities of the scheme for the carrying out of which it is required, not that the owner shall be compelled to take less than the market price which would be paid by any willing purchaser who wanted the material and to whom competitive sources of supply were available. Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju (Raja) v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam, supra, referred to; V\u00e9zina v. R. (1889), 17 S.C.R. 1, disapproved.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: Whatever value this property had, other than its value as waste land, it got from the scheme. These lands had no value for their special adaptability for the purpose of quarrying in general, but only for the purpose of quarrying for the needs of the causeway. The scheme and nothing else created the special adaptability and the expropriating authority was not to be charged for the value which it and it alone brought into being. There was only one possible source of value over and above the bare value of the property, and that must be based, not on value to the owner, but on value to the taker. V\u00e9zina v. R., supra; Cunard v. R. (1910), 43 S.C.R. 88; Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste, supra; Fraser v. City of Fraserville, supra; Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. Ltd. v. Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands, supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and P. M. Troop, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The facts out of which these proceedings arise are set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother Judson and in those of my brother Ritchie. It is unnecessary to repeat them in detail but I wish to summarize them briefly. On July 9, 1952, when the appellant's lands were expropriated for the use of Her Majesty in the right of Canada it was already known (i) that the causeway was to be built, (ii) that approximately 9,000,000 tons of rock, would be required as material to be used in its construction, (iii) that rock admirably suited to this purpose and in excess of the amount required was contained in the appellant's land, (iv) that its location was such that the costs of quarrying and transportation would be less than in the case of any rock in other locations belonging to other persons, and (v) that there were ample other possible sources of supply although because of their location none would be equally economical. The lands of the appellant were not required to form any part of the bed of the causeway or the approaches thereto; the purpose of the expropriation was simply to obtain a suitable supply of rock. Apart from the requirements for the causeway there was no probability of the appellant selling any substantial quantity of his rock in the forseeable future. The value of the expropriated land if all possibility of selling the rock contained in it was disregarded was about $50 per acre. A prudent contractor bidding on a contract the performance of which would require great quantities of rock to be supplied by him would have been willing to offer and pay from 5 cents to 7\u00bd cents per ton for suitable rock in situ in a convenient location.\nOn these facts there are two sharply conflicting views as to what should be paid to the appellant for the 9,000,000 tons of rock taken from what had been his land and used in the building of the causeway. For the appellant it is said that he should get not less than the minimum market price, that is to say, the price which a willing but not necessitous or driven purchaser would pay to a willing seller, for the quantity of rock required. For the respondent it is said that there would have been no market for the rock apart from the building of the causeway and that the appellant is entitled only to the bare value of his land considered as waste land.\nWe must deal with the realities of the situation. What was compulsorily taken from the appellant was intended to be used not as land but as a source of building material for which there was an ascertainable market price. The statements found in numerous authorities, that the person whose property is taken for the public use shall receive no more than the value of that property to him, do not mean that he is to receive less than the market price where that is ascertainable. In Lake Erie and Northern Railway Co. v. Brantford Golf and Country Club2, Duff J., as he then was, said:\nIt does not follow, of course, that the owner whose land is compulsorily taken is entitled only to compensation measured by the scale of the selling price of the land in the open market. He is entitled to that in any event \u2026\nThe words which I have italicized in this passage appear to me to be applicable to the case at bar. Why, it may be asked, should a citizen who happens to own material suitable for use in the building of a public work and in a most convenient location, but of which there are ample available supplies in the hands of other owners, be required to make a gift of his property? I would have thought it plain that the contention of the appellant is the right one were it not for the decision of this Court in V\u00e9zina v. The Queen3. The effect of that judgment, so far as it is relevant to the point before us, is accurately summarized in the first paragraph of the headnote as follows:\nWhere land is taken by a railway company for the purpose of using the gravel thereon as ballast, the owner is only entitled to compensation for the land so taken as farm land, where there is no market for the gravel.\nI do not find it necessary to enter upon the question, which has sometimes been raised but not, I think, as yet decided, whether strictly speaking this Court is now bound under the principle stare decisis by an earlier judgment pronounced by it in a case which was appealable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, for the Court has always been free to reconsider such a judgment if it is found to conflict with a subsequent pronouncement by the Judicial Committee on a point of law. The decision in V\u00e9zina v. The Queen appears to have been founded on the circumstance that the railway company was the only possible purchaser of the appellant's gravel and, in my opinion, it is inconsistent with the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju (Raja) v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam4, which is discussed in the reasons of my brother Ritchie. In relation to a case such as the one before us where what is expropriated is really building material rather than land, the principle underlying the decisions relied on by the respondent (other than that in V\u00e9zina) appears to me to be that the owner of property taken for the public use shall not receive a price inflated beyond its market value because of the necessities of the scheme for the carrying out of which it is required, not that the owner shall be compelled to take less than the market price which would be paid by any willing purchaser who wanted the material and to whom competitive sources of supply were available.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appellant is entitled to be paid the fair market price for the quantity of rock taken from his expropriated land. It may be said with some force that on the evidence this should be not less than 5 cents a ton, but for the reasons given by my brother Ritchie I agree with the figure fixed by him.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Ritchie and those briefly stated above I would dispose of the appeal and cross-appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nFauteux J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brothers Cartwright and Ritchie, I would dispose of the appeal and cross-appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nJudson J. (dissenting):\u2014On July 9, 1952, the Dominion Government expropriated 110.1 acres out of a tract of land comprising 392 acres owned by the appellant. The appellant had inherited this land in 1929. It had been owned by his family, one part since 1897 and the other since 1890.\nThe purpose of the expropriation was to open up a stone quarry on the lands expropriated to provide rock for the building of a causeway across the Strait of Canso from Auld Cove at Cape Porcupine on the south side of the Strait to Balache Point on the north shore of the Strait in Cape Breton Island.\nThere is a good description of the property in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge contained in the following quotation:\nThe lots so owned by the defendant are situated on the south shore of the Strait of Canso which divides Cape Breton from the mainland of Nova Scotia. To the south thereof is the main highway leading from Antigonish to Mulgrave. From that highway, which is about 250 ft. above sea level, the land rises to a height of some 650 ft. above sea level, and at the north dropped abruptly to the shore of the Strait of Canso. The property consisted almost entirely of solid rock with a very shallow overburden of soil in some places. It was and is totally unsuitable for agriculture and such small trees as grew thereon were of no value. The municipal assessment for tax purposes of the entire 392 acres varied over the years from a low of $100 to a high of $300.\nSo far as is known, the property was never put to any use whatever and no improvements of any sort were made, the only expenditure thereon being the municipal taxes. No effort was made to sell any portion of the land or any rock therefrom; and no offer to purchase was ever received. Up to the date of the expropriation, no plan had been formulated by the owner for the opening of a quarry or the development of the property in any way.\nThe reasons of the learned trial judge demonstrate that this land had no value for any purpose other than as a site for the stone quarry needed for the construction of the causeway at the time of the expropriation and that there was no prospect of any other commercial exploitation. We are therefore faced in this appeal with this simple situation: whatever value this property has, other than its value as waste land, it gets from the scheme. It is very difficult to think of an expropriation case where this condition and this condition alone prevails. Usually land has some commercial potential apart from the scheme.\nAn unusual feature of the case is that when the Government expropriated on July 9, 1952, the contract had been let for the construction of the causeway, under authorization of a prior order in council, and there were specific provisions in the contract relating to the rock on the appellant's land which indicated that this land was to be the source of the rock for the construction of the causeway and that it would be supplied free to the contractor who, of course, had to quarry and transport it. The contract estimated the amount of rock fill needed at 9,000,000 tons, for which the contractor was to be paid 59 cents per ton for all rock placed in the causeway.\nThe appellant's land was the most convenient site for the opening up of a quarry for the supply of rock for the causeway and in addition, as the specifications show, the rock was of a better quality than most of the rock in the immediate neighbourhood in that it was harder and contained less material which would be subject to attrition by weather. It could be quarried in large blocks suitable for protecting the sides of the causeway. The contractor had the right to use rock from any other source that he might choose provided it was equal to or better than the igneous rock of Cape Porcupine Hill and met with the approval of the engineer.\nI have not the slightest doubt that the appellant's local knowledge, both geological and geographical, and his awareness of the economic necessity of a better crossing from the mainland to Cape Breton Island always enabled him to conclude that if the Government chose to build a causeway he would be near the site and that they would have to come to him for a supply of rock.\nThere had been much public discussion of the project going back at least to 1943 and probably earlier. In 1943 both the House of Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia and the Maritime Board of Trade passed a resolution asking the Government of Canada to investigate the practicability of constructing a causeway. In 1944 the Dominion Steel and Coal Company Limited made a report on the project. In 1945 the Dominion Government made a geological map of the Strait. In 1949 a board of engineers appointed by the Dominion Government and the Province of Nova Scotia reported that three projects had been studied and recommended the construction of a low-level bridge. This report is known as the Pratley Report and is the first reference that I can find in the evidence to a low-level bridge. In 1950 the Minister of Transport reconvened the Pratley Commission. It had been decided by this time that the low-level bridge was not a practical solution to the problem. On December 8, 1950, the Province of Nova Scotia expropriated the lands of the appellant. In June of 1951 the Pratley Board reported that in view of the elimination of the bridge project and because of the high cost of improving the ferry, the causeway scheme was the only practical solution. The Board also recommended that the site of the causeway be the same as the site of the proposed low-level bridge, and referred to Porcupine Mountain (the appellant's land) as a source of supply for rock. On October 17, 1951, Cabinet approval was given to the construction of the causeway by the Government of Canada. Consulting engineers were then instructed to prepare plans for the design and supervision of the construction of the causeway. These were completed on March 31, 1952. Tenders were then invited and on June 18, 1952, the construction contract was signed, under authorization of an order in council of May 16, 1952. On July 9, 1952, the Province of Nova Scotia abandoned its expropriation and fifteen minutes later the Dominion Government expropriated 110.1 acres by filing the necessary plans and description in the registry office. The Crown indicated its willingness to pay $5,505 for the expropriated lands.\nTherefore, at the time of the Dominion expropriation, the ownership of the property had been in the appellant for a period of fifteen minutes after an interval of eighteen months, and at this time the Dominion Government's scheme for a causeway was fully formulated. The Dominion filed its information on July 30, 1954, and offered $5,505 for compensation. In his defence, filed on March 21, 1955, the appellant claimed $5,000,000 plus 10 per cent for compulsory taking. On July 2, 1955, the Government amended its information and abandoned all the lands except 12.8 acres. The abandoned lands at that time revested in the defendant. The original offer of the Government of $5,505 remained as before. The defendant then amended his defence to reduce his claim to $1,000,000 plus 10 per cent. The task of the trial judge was therefore to determine the value to the owner of the 110.1 acres expropriated in 1952, taking into account, in accordance with s. 24 (4) of the Expropriation Act, the fact of abandonment and revesting in the appellant of a large part of the area.\nCameron J. made an assessment of $40,640. He first determined the market value of the 110.1 acres taken from the appellant on July 9, 1952, without any reference to its special adaptability for use for a quarry site for rock. Taking the evidence as a whole, he concluded that $50 per acre would reasonably represent the full market value of the 110.1 acres exclusive of the value of any special adaptability as a quarry site to be used for the supply of rock for the causeway. He then determined the value of the special potentiality. After reviewing the evidence concerning the history of the causeway and concluding that a willing purchaser, in the circumstances and not acting under compulsion, would, in view of his requirements, pay something in excess of the bare value of the land, and after considering the evidence of two Crown appraisers that the value of the potentiality was from $25,000 to $30,000 he reached the conclusion that the value of this potentiality was hot in excess of, $40,000. He then took into consideration the abandonment and concluded that the value of the 97.3 acres which revested in the appellant was the same as of the date of the expropriation, i.e. $50 per acre and, therefore, he deducted the sum of $4,865 leaving a net amount of $40,640. He rejected the appellant's claim for injurious affection for lack of any evidence as to the value of such loss. He also found that there was no advantage or benefit to the appellant arising out of the construction of the causeway that he should take into account under s. 49 of the Exchequer Court Act. He awarded the appellant an allowance of 10 per cent for compulsory taking together with interest.\nThe Crown submits that any increase in the value above the bare market value of $50 per acre as waste land was entirely attributable to the scheme and should be disregarded in assessing compensation. Cameron J. rejected this and held that he must ascertain the value of whatever potentialities there were and determine what would be paid by a willing purchaser to a willing vendor of the land with its potentialities in the same way that he would ascertain it in a case where there are several possible purchasers, and that he could not confine himself to an award based on the value of the land as waste land.\nIn doing this he followed Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju (Raja) v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam5, which held that this must be done even where the expropriating authority was the only possible purchaser. The judgment in the Indian case was based upon disapproval of the dictum of Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Re Lucas & Chesterfield Gas & Water Board6 and adoption of the contrary opinion of Vaughan Williams L.J. in the same case.\nCameron J. then arrived at a figure of $40,000 for special adaptability: He said that before October 17, 1951, (the date of the order in council) there was always the chance that this land might be needed for a quarry for the causeway, and that before this date a contractor who might expect to tender for the construction contract if ever the causeway scheme were decided upon and tenders called for, might have risked an outlay of between $25,000 and $30,000 on the property and he had some evidence before him to this effect. He next held that after the date of the order in council any increase in the value of the special adaptability of the land to a causeway scheme resulted from the definite adoption of the scheme and was to be disregarded. On this point, in my respectful opinion, he was clearly right. He correctly instructed himself that he had to ascertain value to the owner, including any special adaptability as of the date of expropriation, but he also held, correctly, in my opinion, that there could be no increase in value between the date of the order in council and the date of expropriation. If Cameron J. was entitled to consider and value a special adaptability of this kind immediately before the date of the order in council, I would accept his valuation. To me he made the maximum possible award in favour of this claimant and the question is whether the claimant was entitled even to the $40,000.\nAny increase in value over $50 per acre was entirely the result of the scheme no matter what date one chooses to look at the problem. The $40,000 that the trial judge awarded was just as clearly in this classification as the $1,000,000 which the appellant claimed in his defence. These lands had no value for their special adaptability for the purpose of quarrying in general, but only for the purpose of quarrying for the needs of the causeway. The scheme and nothing else created the special adaptability in this case and I do not think that the expropriating authority is to be charged for the value which it and it alone brought into being.\nThe appellant's case to me depends upon the unacceptable principle that there is a value to him for which he should be compensated because of the needs and purpose of the expropriating authority. These needs and the purpose are unique. No one else had these needs and no one else could have used the rock for that purpose. The Crown was expropriating some 12 acres of land for the purpose of opening up a quarry. It is the purpose and the use of the rock that creates value. Yet the appellant is claiming compensation as though the power of expropriation had not been exercised and he had been left to deal with a private undertaker upon whom he could have imposed his own terms, within the limits of competition. There is only one possible source of value in this case over and above the $50 per acre, and that must be based, not on value to the owner, but on value to the taker.\nA similar problem came up in this Court as early as 1889 in the case of V\u00e9zina v. The Queen7. In that case the land was taken for railway purposes and for a gravel pit in connection with the construction of the railway. Patterson J. said:\nThe learned judge has allowed $807.70 for the land taken, being $100.00 per arpent. This valuation is not complained of so far as the five arpents taken for the track are concerned, and it is not asserted that the three arpents taken for the gravel pit were, as farm lands, of any greater value. But the claimant insists that it shall be valued with reference to the gravel, some 45,000 cubic yards, taken from it, as if he had sold the gravel at so much a yard. The learned judge considered that those three arpents were, to the owner, simply three arpents of his farm, not rendered any more valuable to him by the existence of a bed of gravel under the soil, as there was no market for gravel, and it became of value to the Government only because the railway required it for ballast.\nIn Cunard v. The King8, Duff J. said:\nOne principle by which the courts have always governed themselves in estimating the compensation to be awarded for property taken under compulsory powers is this: you are to apply yourself to the consideration of the circumstances as if the scheme under which the compulsory powers are exercised had no existence. The proper application of that principle to chapter 143, R.S.C., seems to me to be this\u2014you are to estimate the value as if the property were not required for the public purpose to which the Minister, who is taking the proceedings, intends to devote it. The circumstance that it is so required is not to enter into the computation of value as either enhancing or diminishing it.\nThis was written in a dissenting judgment, but I am not aware that the principle so stated is open to any question.\nCedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste9 and Fraser v. City of Fraserville10 are illustrations of this principle. Both were cases of expropriation for the purpose of power development. The expropriated owner happened to be in a favourable situation on the site of the development and without the power of expropriation he was in a position to hold up the scheme and name his own price. In both cases the arbitrator awarded compensation based upon value to the taker and not to the owner. In each case it was held to be wrong to assess compensation on the basis that the expropriated owner had made a proportionate contribution to the development of the power. This is merely one aspect, as was pointed out in the Fraser case, of value to the buyer and not value to the owner. In reviewing the Cedars Rapids case, which had recently been before the Privy Council, Lord Buckmaster said:\nThe principles which regulate the fixing of compensation of lands compulsorily acquired have been the subject of many decisions, and among the most recent are those of In re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board, Cedars Rapids Manufacturing & Power Co. v. Lacoste, and Sidney v. North Eastern Ry. Co. The principles of those cases are carefully and correctly considered in the judgments the subject of appeal, and the substance of them is this: that the value to be ascertained is the value to the seller of the property in its actual condition at the time of expropriation with all its existing advantages and with all its possibilities, excluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired, the question of what is the scheme being a question of fact for the arbitrator in each case. It is this that the Courts have found that the arbitrator has failed to do, and it follows that his award cannot be supported.\nI cannot see that there is any question of these principles or that they are affected in any way by any possible misapprehension of the supposed unanimity of opinion between Vaughan Williams L.J. and Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Lucas and Chesterfield.\nIt is not a question here of a possibility of the Dominion Government acquiring powers of expropriation. It always had these powers and it was the only authority that could exercise them. In this situation it does not create the market and then have to pay for the value so created.\nThe task then is to test how an award of $40,000 plus $50 per acre fits in with the concept of value to the owner as developed in this Court through Irving Oil Co. Ltd. v. The King11, Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King12, and finally in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King13. What would the claimant, as a prudent man at the moment of expropriation, (he then being deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same) pay for the property rather than be ejected from it. Any readiness to pay anything above the value as waste land can only come from the fact that a causeway is to be built.\nIn my opinion, Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co., Ltd. v. Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands14, is directly in point. There an owner was expropriated in Trinidad by the Crown for the purpose of enabling the United States to construct a naval base. On part of the land expropriated there was an operating quarry. The owner was compensated on proper grounds for the quarry as an operating quarry. In addition to this the Court awarded the sum of $15,000 because this quarry was particularly useful to the United States for the construction of its naval base. On this aspect of the award the Privy Council said at p. 572:\nIt follows from this that the question as submitted to the Full Court should have been answered in the negative. But it does not follow that this part of the award can stand. It is well settled that compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land cannot include an increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition. As it was put by Eve J. in South Eastern Ry. Co. v. London County Council: 'Increase in value consequent on the execution of the undertaking for or in connexion with which the purchase is made must be disregarded.' This rule was recognized by the Full Court and, indeed, appears to be the basis of its main conclusion, for in the course of his judgment Blackall C.J., after a reference to Lord Buckmaster's statement of the principle in Fraser v. Fraserville, proceeds: 'In the present case, although a value as a quarry had admittedly been created prior to the acquisition, that value was increased by the fact that a base was being established in the vicinity for which a large quantity of stone in a readily accessible situation was required. In other words, the value was enhanced by the scheme of the party acquiring the land, and that is not a factor for which additional compensation may properly be awarded.'\nMy judgment therefore is that this claimant is entitled to nothing beyond $50 per acre plus interest. The appeal should be dismissed with costs. I would allow the cross-appeal with costs to the extent of eliminating the $40,000 award and the 10 per cent compulsory taking. The result is that the appellant is entitled to an award of $640 for 12.8 acres at $50 per acre plus interest. The appellant should pay the costs of the trial.\nThe judgment of Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014The appellant has appealed and the Crown has moved to vary a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada15 fixing the amount of compensation to be awarded to the appellant in respect of the expropriation of certain of his lands being a part of Porcupine Mountain, so called, at Cape Porcupine in the County of Guysborough, Nova Scotia, which lands were, at the time of the expropriation, known to be the source from which an estimated 9,000,000 tons of rock was to be obtained for use by the Crown in the construction of a causeway between Cape Breton Island and the mainland of Nova Scotia.\nWays and means of joining Cape Breton Island to the mainland had been widely discussed for many years before the Nova Scotia Legislature passed its resolution of April 12, 1943, in the following terms:\nBE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that the Government of Canada be asked by this Legislature to investigate the railroad ferry at the Strait of Canso with a view to the construction of a causeway, thereby eliminating this bottleneck in traffic which has been the greatest drawback to industrial production in Cape Breton Island.\nPorcupine Mountain, at least 110.1 acres of which were owned by the appellant, abuts on the south shore of the Strait of Canso and it appears to have been recognized at an early date as a convenient source of suitable supply of rock if a causeway were to be adopted as a means of crossing the Strait so that the subject of the above resolution was not unrelated to the future value of the appellant's lands.\nBetween 1943 and 1950, the crossing of the Strait of Canso was made the subject of study and report by the Dominion Steel and Coal Company, the Maritime Board of Trade, the Dominion Government and others, and the alternative solutions of a causeway, a low-level bridge, and a tunnel were all considered. The Strait of Canso Board of Engineers had at first reported to the Dominion Government in favour of a low-level bridge but on September 28, 1950, the then Minister of Transport wrote to all the former members of that Board advising them that the engineers of the Canadian National Railways and of the Province of Nova Scotia \"were of the opinion that a low-level bridge was not practicable\" and the Board was accordingly reconvened to review its earlier findings and \"to recommend the best method of improving the present rail and highway transportation facilities across the Strait \u2026\". On December 8, 1950, after the Board had been reconvened, but before its final report was issued, the Province of Nova Scotia acting under the authority of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 91, expropriated certain lands near the Strait including 110.1 acres of the appellant's lands on Porcupine Mountain which were subsequently expropriated by the Dominion Government, and in the following June the Board reported that the causeway scheme was the only practical solution to the problem and that recent borings had confirmed the long held view that Porcupine Mountain contained a suitable supply of rock for its construction.\nOn October 17, 1951, formal Cabinet approval was given to the construction of the causeway and on June 8 of the following year the Crown entered into a contract with Northern Construction Company and J. W. Stewart for the performance of the necessary work which contract contained a provision that\nif the quarry is located south of Auld Cove between Highway No. 4 and the Strait of Canso, the Department will also provide the quarry site without cost to the contractor. If he chooses any other quarry site it shall be provided at his own expense.\nThe quarry site which was to be provided without cost is on the appellant's lands and the total amount of rock fill required was estimated at 9,000,000 tons. The specifications also provide that the contractor was to be paid 59 cents a ton for all rock placed in the causeway. This was presumably compensation for quarrying, transporting and placing the rock.\nAt the time when this contract was entered into title to the land formerly owned by the appellant at Porcupine Mountain was vested in the Province of Nova Scotia pursuant to the expropriation proceedings taken on December 8, 1950, but on July 9, 1952, for reasons which are not explained in the evidence, the Province filed a notice of abandonment which had the effect of revesting title in the appellant so that he was the owner when, 15 minutes after the notice had been filed by the Province, a plan and description of 110.1 acres of this land, signed by the Deputy Minister of Transport, was filed by the respondent thus causing it to be expropriated for the use of Her Majesty the Queen in the right of Canada in accordance with s. 9 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64.\nThe present proceedings were commenced on August 3, 1954, by the Deputy Attorney General of Canada filing an information seeking to have the compensation to be paid for the 110.1 acres expropriated as aforesaid determined by the Exchequer Court in accordance with s. 27 of the Expropriation Act. The Crown offered the appellant the sum of $5,505 in full satisfaction of all claims, and by way of defence the appellant claimed the sum of $5,500,000.\nOn May 9, 1955, all the lands of the appellant so taken, with the exception of 12.8 acres, were declared to be abandoned by Her Majesty under s. 24 of the Expropriation Act and thereby revested in the appellant, but when the Crown amended its information on June 2, 1955, to conform to this abandonment it is somewhat significant to observe that the same compensation ($5,505) was offered in respect of the remaining 12.8 acres as had originally been offered for the 110.1 acres.\nIn amending the information on June 2, 1955, and again on June 20, 1956, the Crown gave an undertaking pursuant to s. 31 of the Expropriation Act to grant to the appellant an easement for the purpose of a right of way from the public highway to the 97.3 acres which had been abandoned to the appellant and thus to enable the appellant to use the 12.8 acres expropriated except the portions thereof occupied by loose rock already quarried on behalf of Her Majesty, in order to remove rock from the lands abandoned to the appellant and to operate a rock crushing plant. On June 7, 1955, and again on September 9, 1957, the statement of defence was amended and the appellant pleaded that he was willing to accept the sum of $1,100,000 by way of compensation for expropriation of the smaller area.\nIn determining the amount of compensation to be paid to the appellant under these circumstances the learned trial judge based his award on the \"bare ground\" or \"agricultural\" value of the land being $50 per acre and he found that the 12.8 acres retained by the Crown had an additional value by reason of its special adaptability as a source of rock which he fixed at $40,000; after deducting the value of the 97.3 acres which had been abandoned by the Crown he thus found the 12.8 acres to have a value of $40,640 to which he added 10 per cent for compulsory taking. He also awarded interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the value which he had found for the lands originally taken ($49,569) from the date of expropriation to the date of abandonment, and on the amount of $44,704 from the date of the abandonment of the 97.3 acres to the date of his judgment. From this award the appellant appeals on the ground that the learned trial judge failed to give sufficient weight to the value of the special adaptability of the lands for causeway construction, that he erred in failing to award any compensation for the increase in the value of the lands between the date when the causeway project was approved by the Cabinet (October 17, 1951) and the date of expropriation, and finally that he erred in holding that the lands had no value for special adaptability as a rock quarry for purposes other than the causeway.\nThe respondent seeks to have the judgment varied so as to exclude any award for special adaptability or in the alternative so as to reduce such an award from $40,000 to $30,000 and, in any event, to set aside the award of 10 per cent for compulsory taking.\nThe respondent's counsel contends that the only potential value of the expropriated lands over and above their \"bare ground\" value was \"solely and exclusively related to the scheme of constructing the causeway\" and should accordingly have been excluded in fixing the value for the purposes of compensation. The leading authorities cited in support of this contention are: Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste16; Fraser v. City of Fraserville17, and Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. Ltd. v. Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands18. None of these cases is, in my opinion, authority. for the proposition that a hitherto undeveloped potentiality of expropriated property is to be entirely disregarded in fixing the value of that property for compensation purposes on the ground that the expropriating authority is the only present market for such potentiality and that it has developed a scheme which involves its use. These cases do, however, make it plain that the amount fixed by way of compensation must not reflect in any way the value which the property will have to the acquiring authority after expropriation and as an integral part of the scheme devised by that authority.\nIn the Cedars Rapids case, supra, Lord Dunedin stated the matter thus, at p. 576:\nWhere, therefore, the element of value over and above the bare value of the ground itself (commonly spoken of as the agricultural value) consists in adaptability for a certain undertaking (though adaptability \u2026 is really rather an unfortunate expression) the value is not a proportional part of the assumed value of the whole undertaking, but is merely the price, enhanced above the bare value of the ground which possible intended undertakers would give. That price must be tested by the imaginary market which would have ruled had the land been exposed for sale before any undertakers had secured the powers, or acquired the other subjects which made the undertaking as a whole a realized possibility.\nIt seems plain that the element of value which Lord Dunedin excluded in fixing compensation was the value as \"a proportional part of the assumed value of the whole undertaking \u2026\". If there were any doubt about this, it is made plain at p. 577, where it is said:\nTheir Lordships have sought in vain in this testimony for any evidence directed to the true question as they have expressed it above. All the testimony is based on the fallacy that the value to the owner is a proportional part of the value of the realized undertaking as it exists in the hands of the undertaker. There are other fallacies as well, but that is the leading one, and is sufficient utterly to vitiate their testimony.\nIn Fraser v. City of Fraserville, supra, the original arbitrator had taken into consideration the value which the lands would have after expropriation as a part of the hydroelectric system to be operated by the City of Fraserville, and Lord Buckmaster observed, at p. 193:\n\u2026 in truth the value which Mr. St. Laurent (the arbitrator) fixed was the value of the property to the person who was buying and not to the person who was selling and it was not this value that he was appointed to determine.\nIn the Pointe Gourde case, supra, which is particularly relied upon by the respondent, the British Crown authorities expropriated the appellant's lands in Trinidad which were required by the United States of America in connection with the establishment of a naval base. The situation was that the appellants owned and operated a stone quarry situate on the expropriated lands which had a special suitability and adaptability for the purpose of producing and marketing quarry products and as such had a market value as quarry land prior to the acquisition. The original award of compensation made due allowance for the value of the quarry as a going concern and for the special adaptability of the land as a quarry but the item in dispute was a special award of $15,000 which related\nnot to the special suitability or adaptability of the land for the purpose of quarrying which existed before the acquisition, but to the special adaptability (to follow the language of the tribunal) which the quarry land possessed after acquisition in that its proximity to the naval base under construction made it specially suited to the needs of the United States.\nIt is to be noted that the \"special suitability\" for which the additional $15,000 award was made could not arise until after the acquisition of the land by the British Crown and after the lands had been leased to the United States Government for the purpose of building the base and that it only came into being because of the \"special needs of the United States\".\nIn giving his reasons for disallowing this item, Lord Macdermott further indicated what he meant by \"an increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme \u2026\" when he said, at p. 572:\nIt is well settled that compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land cannot include an increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition. As it was put by Eve J. in Southeastern Railway Co. v. London County Council [1915] 2 Ch. 252 at 258: \"increase in value consequent on the execution of the undertaking for or in connection with which the purchase is made must be disregarded\".\nEarlier in his judgment, Lord Macdermott had characterized \"the use of the quarry stone in the construction of the naval base\" which is the subject of the disputed item as being \"at most \u2026 but a circumstance which added to the value to the United States of the use of the land as a quarry\".\nThe exclusion from the Court's consideration of \"increase in value consequent on the execution of the undertaking\" to build a causeway and of any value based on the Crown acting under compulsion as a necessitous purchaser, does not mean that the value of the special adaptability to the owner at the date of expropriation is to be disregarded.\nIn this regard, like the learned trial judge, I adopt the reasoning of Lord Romer in the case of Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju (Raja) v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam19 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Indian\" case) where he makes the following comment on the judgment of Rowlatt J. in Sidney v. North Eastern Ry. Co.20 Lord Romer there said, at pp. 322-323:\nIf and so far as this means that the value to be ascertained is the price that would be paid by a willing purchaser to a willing vendor, and not the price that would be paid by a \"driven\" purchaser, to an unwilling vendor, their Lordships agree. But so far as it means that the possibility of the promoter as a willing purchaser, being willing to pay more than other competitors, or in cases where he is the only purchaser of the potentiality, more than the value of the land without the potentiality is to be disregarded, their Lordships venture respectfully to differ from the learned judge.\nFor these reasons, their Lordships have come to the conclusion that, even where the only possible purchaser of the land's potentiality is the authority that has obtained the compulsory powers, the arbitrator in awarding compensation must ascertain to the best of his ability the price that would be paid by a willing purchaser to a willing vendor of the land with its potentiality in the same way that he would ascertain it in the case where there are several possible purchasers and that he is no more confined to awarding the land's \"poramboke\" value in the former case than he is in the latter.\nAlthough recognizing that an allowance must be made for the value of the special adaptability of the property in question as a source of rock for the causeway, the learned trial judge felt himself bound to assess the value in relation to the market which would have ruled if the lands had been put up for sale immediately before October 17, 1951, when Cabinet approval was given to the scheme, and in so doing he was governed by his interpretation of the following quotation from Cripps on Compulsory Acquisition of Land, 10th ed., at p. 4040, where it is said:\nThe value must be tested in relation to the market which would have ruled had the land been exposed for sale before the purchaser had secured any powers or acquired the other subject which made the undertaking a realized possibility.\nThis is implied in the common saying that the value of the land is not to be estimated at its value to the purchaser. But this does not mean that the fact that some particular purchaser might desire the land more than others is to be disregarded.\nIn apparent reliance on this authority, the learned trial judge went on to hold:\nIn Canada, of course, the powers of the Crown to expropriate property for public works are statutory and ordinarily no special Act is required. It seems to me, however, that when Cabinet approval was given to the construction of the causeway on October 17, 1951, the undertaking of the construction thereof became a realized possibility and ceased to be a mere potentiality. The value of the lands expropriated, together with the special adaptability \"must be tested in relation to the market value which would have ruled had the land been exposed to sale prior to that date\". The subsequent preparation of the plan, the call for tenders, and the letting of the contract were merely steps in carrying out the scheme to which the Crown was already committed, and of themselves could not, in the circumstances, be considered as adding to the potential value to the special adaptability. With the greatest respect, I am unable to treat the giving of Cabinet approval to the construction of the cause-way as being equivalent to the exercise of powers of expropriation over the appellant's lands. In the case of an expropriation by the Crown in the right of Canada no question arises of securing special powers and in the present case there was no occasion to acquire the other land upon which the public work was to be constructed as the Strait of Canso was the property of the federal government. For these reasons in applying the language used by Cripps on Compulsory Acquisition of Land to the present circumstances it should, in my opinion, be read as meaning that:\nThe value must be tested in relation to the market which would have ruled had the land been exposed for sale before the powers of expropriation had been exercised.\nThis same view was expressed by Roach J.A. in Agnew v. Minister of Highways21, with reference to the statutory power of expropriation conferred upon the Minister of Highways of Ontario.\nBy giving Cabinet approval to the plan to construct a causeway the Crown made it known that there was a probable rather than a possible market for the appellant's rock at the price which a willing purchaser would pay to a willing vendor, but taking this factor into consideration in fixing the value of the land is by no means the same thing as determining the value on the basis that the use of the appellant's rock as a part of the undertaking for the construction of the causeway had become a realized possibility.\nThe significance of the phrase \"realized possibility\" as employed in the authorities is illustrated by the following excerpt from the reasons for judgment of Lord Romer in the Indian case, supra, at p. 313:\nNo one can suppose in the case of land which is certain, or even likely, to be used in the immediate or reasonably near future for building purposes, but which at the valuation date is waste land or is being used for agricultural purposes, that the owner, however willing a vendor, will be content to sell the land for its value as waste or agricultural land as the case may be. It is plain that in ascertaining its value the possibility of its being used for building purposes will have to be taken into account. It is equally plain, however, that the land must not be valued as though it had already been built upon, a proposition that \u2026 is sometimes expressed by saying that it is the possibilities of the land and not its realized possibilities that must be taken into consideration.\nWhen the property in question was taken from the appellant by the Province of Nova Scotia in 1950, the potential market for the rock which it contained was still a matter of speculation as no decision had been finally made about the causeway but when the lands were reacquired by the appellant on July 9, 1952, the years of speculation, study and planning concerning the building of this causeway had already culminated in the letting of a contract for its construction which contemplated the use of an estimated 9,000,000 tons of rock from these lands, and the potential market for this commodity had thus become a reality before the lands were reacquired by the appellant. It was these lands, with this potentiality, which were expropriated by the Dominion Government, and it is their value at the time of that expropriation which is required to be assessed for the purposes of compensation. In this regard, s. 46 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, provides that:\n46. The Court, in determining the amount to be paid to any claimant for any land or property taken for the purpose of any public work, or for injury done to any land or property, shall estimate or assess the value or amount thereof at the time when the land or property was taken, or the injury complained of was occasioned.\nThe Crown called two expert witnesses who gave their respective opinions as to the value of the land based on the merest possibility of a market existing for the rock which it contained. The nature of the question which they were both asked is reflected in the answer of Mr. Scrivener when he stated the advice which he would have given to a contractor as to what should be paid for the property. He said:\nThen if we put it on the basis that it is just a possibility but the thing has not crystallized very much, what the contractor would be doing in such a case would be investing a little money in the hope of this event coming to pass. It is a speculative investment; I would not suggest in such a case that he invest more than, perhaps, twenty-five, might be thirty thousand dollars on such a speculation, because there are many links between that and his profit from it.\nIn answer to the same question, Mr. Piette said:\nYes, my answer to that would be twenty-five thousand dollars based on the fact that it took about 12.8 acres and that the maximum value that I would give to such a land would be $2,000 per acre. Although the action of the government authorities in making available to the contractor 9,000,000 tons of the appellant's rock before taking any steps to acquire his property does not mean that the land is to be valued for the purpose of compensating the owner as if it were being sold to a necessitous purchaser or as if the rock which it contained were already a part of the causeway, it nevertheless does mean that before the date of expropriation the Crown had disclosed itself in the role of \"a willing purchaser\" and this is the circumstance which appears to me to take the matter out of the field of speculation and to make it altogether unrealistic to value the land as if the market for the rock which it contains \"is just a possibility but the thing has not crystallized very much.\"\nThe learned trial judge concluded that the value of the special adaptability was somewhat in excess of the values placed thereon by Scrivener and Piette because those witnesses were not fully aware of, and had therefore not taken into consideration, all the facts which indicated as of October 17, 1951 \"that the causeway might be built at the place finally chosen\". There is, however, nothing in the judgment appealed from to indicate that the learned trial judge departed from the acreage basis on which the Crown witnesses had valued the special adaptability.\nOn the other hand, with the greatest respect for Mr. Justice Cameron's opinion, I adopt the view that the effective date for valuation of this property is the date of the expropriation and that the reality of the matter is that the Crown was expropriating tons of rock in the ground rather than acres of land in the rough so that the value of the special adaptability of these lands is to be determined for the purpose of fixing compensation for their expropriation on the basis of the value that a willing vendor might reasonably expect to obtain from a willing but not anxious purchaser for the rock in situ at the date of expropriation. In this latter regard, I am much influenced by the evidence of John D. Stirling, a disinterested contractor of high repute and wide experience whose company (E.G.M. Cape & Company) estimated the value of the rock with a view to includ- ing this item in its tender for the contract to construct the causeway. This witness gave the following evidence:\nIn estimating the value of the rock we were not at all certain as to whether we were going to have to pay a royalty to the Dominion Government Department of Transport or not. Based on a good deal of past experience, and not knowing who the owner was, we said: \"Well, we may have to pay ten cents a ton for this if he is a hard man to deal with; if not we may get it for five cents a ton, which is what we had previously paid for rock in various places. We came to the conclusion that we should include the sum of seven and a half cents in our estimate per ton. After that we thought we had better clear up this vague clause in the specification, called the engineers and they told us that there was no charge to be made\u2014no royalty to be paid, and therefore we did not include it.\nThe same witness was then asked:\nQ. What would you say a fair price for that granite would be per ton?\nA. I would have offered five cents.\nQ. Would that be on the high or on the low side?\nA. That would be on the low side. I naturally would not offer any more than I was prepared to pay.\n* * *\nQ. Between a willing purchaser and a willing vendor, what would you expect to get that granite for?\nA. We hoped we would not have to pay more than seven and a half cents, but I hoped we would get it for five. That was our thinking at the time.\nQ. Somewhere between seven and a half and five cents?\nA. Yes.\nQ. If you had tendered on the basis of paying for the rock how much would you have added to your tender?\nA. We would have added seven and a half.\nIf the special adaptability of the lands is to be measured in terms of the value of the rock in situ the quantity involved must, in my opinion, be treated as being the amount of the requirement estimated by the Crown before expropriation, i.e., 9,000,000 tons. This constituted an immediate market for a substantial amount of the appellant's rock, and the unprecedented opportunity to dispose of such a quantity of his supply at one time must, in my view, be treated as a circumstance which would induce a prudent man to willingly accept less than he might expect to receive if he was required to sell the commodity piecemeal but, with all respect, it does not, in my opinion, mean that such a man should be required to accept less than one-tenth of the amount which an experienced contractor would have been prepared to pay if he had had to include the rock in his tender for the contract, and this appears to me to be the effect of the value fixed by the learned trial judge.\nWhile the evidence of Mr. Stirling is not conclusive as to the value of the rock to the owner, I think it must nevertheless be accepted as establishing that in offering to provide \"the quarry site without cost to the contractor\" the respondent was offering free of charge a source for its estimated requirement of 9,000,000 tons of rock for which a most reliable and experienced contractor would otherwise have been prepared to pay at least $450,000.\nHaving regard to all the matters hereinbefore mentioned and taking into account the fact that the value fixed by a contractor as part of a tender may be a very different thing from the value to the owner before expropriation, I have nevertheless reached the conclusion that the appellant would, under the circumstances, have been justified in expecting to obtain a price for his property from a willing purchaser based upon its proven adaptability as a source of the estimated amount of rock required for the causeway being measured in terms of that rock in situ having a value to the owner of four cents a ton at the time of expropriation. I accordingly fix the amount of compensation to which the appellant is entitled in respect of the special adaptability of the expropriated lands as a source of rock at $360,000.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that in applying the provisions of s. 24(4) of the Expropriation Act the 97.3 acres which were abandoned by the Crown and revested in the appellant in 1955 should be treated as having the same \"bare ground\" value which it had at the date of expropriation, i.e. $50 per acre, and that the value of the special adaptability of the property is to be limited to the 12.8 acres which were retained by the Crown and which also had a \"bare ground\" value of $50 per acre, i.e. $640. Section 24(4) of the Act reads as follows:\nThe fact of such abandonment or revesting shall be taken into account, in connection with all the other circumstances of the case, in estimating or assessing the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for the land taken.\nIn a case such as this where the value of the land revested is equal to its value at the time of the initial taking, the owner is in the position of having received in property \"the equivalent in value to him of the property taken as of the date \u2026 of the filing of the plan\", to adopt the words used by Duff J., as he then was, in Gibb v. The King22 which were applied by Abbott J. in Standish Hall Inc. v. The Queen23.\nIt accordingly appears to me that the value of the 97.3 acres revested in the appellant does not enter into the calculation of compensation in this case except to the extent that the appellant is entitled to interest on the value of the whole 110.1 acres, i.e. $5,505, from the date of expropriation to the date of revesting.\nHaving regard to the decision of this Court in Drew v. The Queen24, I would not allow any amount for compulsory taking.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the appellant's claims for injurious affection and loss of right of access to the shore of the Strait of Canso should be disallowed and, like him, I am unable to see any merit in the Crown's contention that the construction of the causeway at a point convenient to the lands retained by the appellant has increased the value of his lands so as to give rise to a set-off in favour of the Crown under the provisions of s. 49 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nIn the result, I would allow this appeal, dismiss the main cross-appeal, and vary the judgment of the learned trial judge by fixing the amount to which the appellant is entitled for the expropriation of his property and for all damages resulting therefrom at the sum of $360,640 together with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the sum of $365,505 from the date of the expropriation (July 9, 1952) to the date of abandonment (May 9, 1955), and on the sum of $360,640 from May 9, 1955, to the date hereof.\nThe appellant should have his costs of this appeal and of the cross-appeal.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs, Judson J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: E.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1963: May 13, 14; 1963: October 2.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA. APPELLATE DIVISION.\nMines and minerals\u2014Participation agreements\u2014Bight to share in net proceeds of production\u2014Nature of participant's interest\u2014Not registrable under The Mines and Minerals Act, 1962, (Alta.), c. 49.\nThe holders of two Crown leases entered into a farm-out agreement with B. Co., whereby the latter was granted the right to earn, by the drilling of a test well in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, a specified interest in the lands involved. B. Co. then entered into two similar participation agreements, one with a syndicate, whose interest was later acquired by the plaintiff company, and the other with an individual, whose interest was obtained on behalf of himself and his brother, both of whom were also plaintiffs. The defendant, B.S. Co., was the assignee of B. Co. Under the provisions of clause 10b of the agreements the company assigned to the participant \"such an undivided interest in the petroleum and natural gas \u2026 as will, upon the said lands being operated by the Company and the production therefrom being sold \u2026 yield to the Participant the percentage of net proceeds of production as herein defined \u2026\" The plaintiffs contended that the said clause gave them an assignable interest in the lands defined in the agreements, capable of registration, and with a right to receive and sell their share of production from the lands. An action to obtain a declaration to that effect was dismissed by the trial judge and an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was dismissed by a unanimous decision. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe essence of each agreement was that, by participating in the cost of drilling a producing well upon the lands in question to the extent of the stipulated percentage of cost, the participant would become entitled to receive the stipulated percentage of the net proceeds of production of such well. \"Net proceeds of production\" as defined referred to an amount of money. The intention of the whole agreement was that the operation of each well and the production and marketing of its products was to be under the sole control of the defendant. The participant had a right only to share in the money proceeds obtained either from the sale of the products by the company or from the sale by the company of the lands themselves. Clause 10b did no more than make the defendant a trustee of the interest which it acquired under the farm-out agreement for the purposes of the participation agreements and the plaintiffs beneficiaries in respect of equitable interests which should be equivalent to their shares of the money proceeds of the sale of production.\nThe plaintiffs did not obtain, by virtue of clause 10b, an undivided interest in land capable of assignment by itself. It was an interest which was tied to an interest in the monies to be derived from the sale of production; an interest which would yield a certain percentage of a part of the income from each producing well in which the participant had participated. It would be capable of assignment only as a part of an assignment by the plaintiffs of their interest in the agreements themselves.\nThe plaintiffs' interest could not be registered under The Mines and Minerals Act, 1962. Clause 10b did not provide for a specified undivided interest in the relevant Crown leases and reservations, but for an indeterminate interest in the petroleum, natural gas, and related hydrocarbons within, upon or under the lands themselves. The interest described was such an interest as would, in certain events, yield a certain percentage of net proceeds of production from such lands. This was not a specified undivided interest in a lease as contemplated by s. 176(1)(b).\nIt also followed that the plaintiffs were not entitled under clause 10b to obtain and market a portion of the actual production of a well.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain J. Appeal dismissed.\nS. J. Helman, Q.C., and R. R. Neve, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ. M. Robertson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent, Bailey Selburn Oil & Gas Ltd.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014By two letter-agreements dated May 18, 1951, and accepted respectively on June 28, 1951, and August 20, 1951, Seaboard Oil Company of Delaware and the British American Oil Company Limited, who were the lessees under two Crown leases, Nos. 76745 and 76746, in respect of lands located in the Buck Lake area in the Province of Alberta and who had applied to have the natural gas rights formerly comprised in Reservations Nos. 531 and 532 reserved from other disposition pending the drilling of a well on the land comprised in the leases, granted to A. G. Bailey Co. Limited and Great Plains Development Company of Canada, Ltd. the right to earn, by the drilling of a test well in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, as to each, an undivided 25 percent interest in the leases and in any natural gas licences that could be obtained out of the reservations.\nThe present litigation affects only the 25 per cent interest acquired pursuant to these agreements by A. G. Bailey Co. Ltd.\nOn July 15, 1951, that company entered into two similar agreements, one with St. Lawrence Syndicate and the other with Theodore W. Bennett. The interest of St. Lawrence Syndicate was later acquired by St. Lawrence Petroleum Limited, one of the appellants in this case. The interest of Theodore W. Bennett was obtained by him on behalf of himself and his brother, James G. Bennett, both of whom are also appellants.\nThe respondent, Bailey Selburn Oil & Gas Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \"the respondent\") is the assignee of A. G. Bailey Co. Limited. The other respondent, H. W. Bass & Sons, Inc., was party to an agreement with the respondent respecting the purchase from the respondent of casinghead gas, and was made a party to the litigation by the appellants only with a view to having that agreement set aside. No other relief was claimed as against it, and it was not represented on this appeal.\nThe case involves the interpretation of the two agreements of July 15, 1951. In each agreement A. G. Bailey Co. Limited was described as \"the Company\" and the other party as \"the Participant\" and those descriptions will be used sometimes hereafter when referring to the contents of the two agreements.\nThe recitals in each agreement refer to the letter-agreements of May 18, 1951, therein and hereafter referred to as \"the Farm-out Agreement\" and to the lands to which they relate. They also recite that:\n\u2026 the Participant desires to participate with the Company in the drilling of the test well and in the further development of the said lands, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;\nClause 1 of these agreements is the definition clause and in para. (c) defines the phrase \"Net proceeds of production\" as follows:\n\"Net proceeds of production\" as used in this agreement and in any Schedule hereto, shall with respect to any well mean the proceeds from the sale of the Company's share of the production therefrom after deduction therefrom of the amount of all royalties and taxes payable or required to be deducted therefrom by the Company or any other person, and the Company's cost of or (as the case may be) reasonable charges for the operation of the said well, and after deducting from the balance then remaining ten percent of such balance. Provided, however, that until the Participant has received pursuant to paragraphs 5 and\/or 9a hereof an amount out of the proceeds of production from such well equal to the total of the Participant's percentage of the drilling costs actually paid by the Participant the \"net proceeds of production\" shall be calculated without deducting the \"ten percent of such balance\" last above referred to. Where such well is, after being placed on production, operated by some person other than the Company, the Company's costs of the operation of such well shall include not only the Company's proportion of the operating costs, but also a reasonable fee to cover operational supervision and management of the Company's share of the production therefrom or proceeds from the sale thereof.\nClause 2 provides as follows:\nThe Company shall in accordance with the provisions of the Farm-out Agrement drill the test well and shall subject to the provision of the Farm-out Agrement conduct all operations, including production operations, at the test well in accordance with good oil field practice and in compliance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and regulations and orders enacted and passed thereunder by any competent body, and shall take production from the said lands to the full extent allowed by government regulations and consistent with good oil field practice and market conditions, and all of such operations shall be under the Company's exclusive management, control and direction, except as otherwise provided by the Farm-out Agreement.\nClause 3 provides that the Participant shall contribute to the drilling costs of the test well, the percentage of such costs set forth in Schedule \"3\" to the agreement. The relevant portions of that schedule provide:\nIn respect of Test Well:\nParticipant's percentage of net proceeds of production from\ntest well ................................................................................................ 20%\nParticipant's percentage of drilling costs ................................................... 20%\nAmount of first contribution to drilling costs .............................................. $15,000.00\nClauses 3, 4 and 4a then go on to provide for the method of payment of the Participant's share of the costs and the consequences which arise from the failure to pay the same when required.\nClause 5 provides:\nSubject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, in the event of production being obtained in the test well, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the percentage of net proceeds of production from the said well set forth in Schedule \"3\" hereto. Clause 6 provides that the Company shall be the sole judge of the character, necessity and extent of the expenses for the drilling and operating of the test well.\nClause 7 provides:\nOn or before the last day of each month the Company shall render to the Participant a statement for the preceding calendar month showing all expenditures for which the Company shall have a right to reimbursement and as to which it shall not then have been reimbursed, and showing also the volume of production of petroleum and natural gas and the income from such products and their derivatives, calculated as herein provided, and the amount if any payable to the Participant for such month, together with a cheque for such amount.\nClause 8 gives to the Participant the right to examine the Company's books of account in reference to operations at the test well at intervals of not less than thirty days.\nClause 9 provides for participation by the Participant in further wells which might be drilled upon the leased lands to the extent of the percentage provided in Schedule \"3\".\nClause 10 gives to the Company the right to grant other rights of participation so long as they do not interfere with the rights of the Participant under the agreement.\nClause 10a provides as follows:\nIf the Company shall make any disposition of any of the said lands with respect to the development of which the Participant would at time of disposition thereof have been entitled to participate pursuant to the combined operation of the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4 and 9 of this Agreement (other than a disposition pursuant to numerical paragraph 10 hereof), then the Participant shall be entitled to receive such percentage of ninety per cent of the net proceeds actually received by the Company from such disposition, as is equivalent to the Participant's \"percentage of net proceeds of production\" as fixed by Schedule C hereof.\nClause 10b will be recited in full later as it is the interpretation of that clause which is the main issue in these proceedings.\nClause 11 provides that the agreement should be subject to the terms and provisions of the reservations, leases, statutes and regulations applicable thereto and to the terms and provisions of the Farm-out Agreement or any more formal Farm-out Agreement substituted therefor.\nClauses 12 and 13 deal with the method of making payments under the agreement by the Company to the Participant. The subsequent clauses of the agreements are not relevant to the issue in this appeal.\nI now revert to clause 10b which provides as follows:\nSubject to the underlying Agreements and subject to the obtaining of any required consent, the Company hereby assigns to the Participant such an undivided interest in the petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons other than coal within upon or under the said lands as will, upon the said lands being operated by the Company and the production therefrom being sold all as in this Agreement provided yield to the Participant the percentage of net proceeds of production as herein defined specified in numerical paragraph 5 hereof. The Company agrees to hold its interest in the said petroleum natural gas and related hydrocarbons in trust for the purposes of this Agreement and the Participant agrees to reassign to the Company from time to time all or such portion of the Participant's said undivided interest as may be necessary to revest such interest in the Company insofar as the same relates to any portion of the said lands in which the Participant ceases by virtue of numerical clause 4 or 9 hereof, to be entitled to a share in the net proceeds of the production therefrom.\nIt is the contention of the appellants that this clause gives to them an assignable interest in the lands defined in the agreements, capable of registration, and with a right to receive and sell their share of production from the lands. They brought this action to obtain a declaration to that effect. The position of the respondent is that under clause 10b the appellants acquired no more than a limited equitable interest, by way of charge, to secure to them the money payments to which, as a matter of contract, they might become entitled under the provisions of the agreements. The respondent contends that the appellants' participation in production from the lands is limited to the receipt of the prescribed portion of the proceeds of sale of production by the respondent.\nThe learned trial judge agreed with the respondent and dismissed the action. At the trial the appellants, contending that the provisions of clause 10b were ambiguous, tendered, subject to objection, extrinsic evidence to support their interpretation of it. The learned trial judge held this evidence to be inadmissible, but went on to hold that even if it had been admissible, his decision would have been the same.\nThe appellants appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Their appeal was dismissed by a unanimous decision of that Court. It is from that judgment that the present appeal is brought. At the conclusion of the argument by counsel for the appellants, counsel for the respondent was advised that it would not be necessary for him to deal with the issue of the admissibility of the extrinsic evidence. This Court agreed with the view of both the Courts below that clause 10b, while presenting difficulties of interpretation, was not ambiguous and that the evidence was inadmissible. Counsel for the respondent was also advised that he would not have to argue the question of equitable estoppel which had been raised in the pleadings by the appellants' reply.\nThe sole issue remaining, therefore, is as to the meaning and effect of clause 10b.\nI have reviewed the contents of the two agreements of July 15, 1951, in some detail because clause 10b must be considered in relation to and as a part of each agreement considered as a whole. The essence of each agreement is that, by participating in the cost of drilling a producing well upon the lands in question to the extent of the stipulated percentage of cost, the Participant would become entitled to receive the stipulated percenage of the net proceeds of production of such well. \"Net proceeds of production\" as defined clearly refers to an amount of money. They are the proceeds from the sale of the Company's share of the production from the well after making those deductions which are provided for in clause 1(c). The Company's share of production referred to in this para. (c), is, obviously, the 25 per cent interest in production which it could earn under the terms of the Farm-out Agreement. The appellants are, therefore, entitled, as a matter of contract, to a percentage of certain monies to be obtained from the sale of the production from any well in respect of whose drilling costs they have contributed their required portions.\nThe Company, under clause 2, is to conduct all operations regarding the well, save as otherwise provided in the Farm-out Agreement, and it is to take the production from the lands to the full extent permitted by Government regulations, good oil field practice and market conditions.\nClause 7 provides for the furnishing of monthly statements by the Company to the Participant showing income from the products and their derivatives, the amount payable to the Participant for such month, together with a cheque for such amount. Clause 10a enables the Company to dispose of lands in respect of which the Participant would have had a right of participation upon payment to the Participant of the stipulated percentage of 90 per cent of the net proceeds of such sale.\nAll of these provisions are consistent only with the Company being in complete control of its interest in the lands acquired pursuant to the Farm-out Agreement, with a right in the Participant only to share in the money proceeds obtained either from the sale of the products by the Company or from the sale by the Company of the lands themselves.\nIt is against this background that clause 10b must be interpreted. Under its provisions the Company presently assigns such an interest in the petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons other than coal within, upon or under the lands in question as will, after production is obtained by the Company's operations and sold, yield to the Participant his percentage of the net proceeds of production from the lands. In my opinion this clause says that the Participant is to have an interest in the petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons equivalent to the percentage of monies constituting the net proceeds of production which he is entitled to receive under the agreement. The purpose of the clause is apparently to provide that the monies to which the Participant becomes entitled under the agreement represent the proceeds of the sale of products in which he has an equivalent interest.\nThe interest created by this clause, however it may be defined, is only an equitable interest, because the clause goes on to provide that the Company shall hold its interest in the petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons in trust for the purposes of the agreement.\nI would, therefore, construe the clause as doing no more than to make the respondent a trustee of the interest which it acquired under the Farm-out Agreement for the purposes of these agreements and to make the appellants beneficiaries in respect of equitable interests which should be equivalent to their shares of the money proceeds of the sale of production. I agree with the conclusion stated by the learned trial judge in the following terms:\nI cannot see that the parties contemplated or agreed to the Participant becoming owner of a fractional interest in the said lands capable of assignment and registration. Had it been intended to convey such an interest it would have been a very simple thing to do in plain and unmistakable words. The effect of Clause 10b cannot do more than confer some intangible equitable interest in the lands occupied by a producing well in which the Participant has participated.\nThe appellants have not obtained, by virtue of clause 10b, an undivided interest in land capable of assignment by itself. It is an interest which is tied to an interest in the monies to be derived from the sale of production; an interest which will yield a certain percentage of a part of the income from each producing well in which the Participant has participated. In my opinion it would be capable of assignment only as a part of an assignment by the appellants of their interest in the agreements themselves.\nThe appellants' interest could not be registered under The Mines and Minerals Act, 1962, (Alta.), c. 49.\nSection 176(1) of that Act permits the registration of a transfer with respect to an agreement in these terms:\n176. (1) A transfer with respect to an agreement that the lessee is not prohibited from transferring or agreeing to transfer by any provision of this Act or any regulation or by the terms of the agreement, may be registered by the Minister if the transfer conveys\n(a) the whole of the agreement,\n(b) a specified undivided interest in the agreement, or\n(c) a part of the location contained in the agreement.\n\"Agreement\" is defined in s. 2(1) (a) as follows:\n\"Agreement\" means any lease, licence, reservation, permit or other agreement made or entered into under\n(i) this Act or the former Act, or\n(ii) The Provincial Lands Act or the Dominion Lands Act and relating to a mineral,\nbut does not include a unit agreement under Part VIII;\nClause 10b does not provide for a specified undivided interest in the relevant Crown leases or reservations, but for an indeterminate interest in the petroleum, natural gas, and related hydrocarbons within, upon or under the lands themselves. The interest described is such an interest as will, in certain events, yield a certain percentage of net proceeds of production from such lands. This, in my view, is cer- tainly not a specified undivided interest in a lease as contemplated by s. 176(1)(b).\nFinally it also follows that the appellants are not entitled under clause 10b to obtain and market a portion of the actual production of a well. The intention of the whole agreement, including clause 10b, is that the operation of each well and the production and marketing of its products is to be under the sole control of the respondent.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Helman, Fleming & Neve, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Bailey Selburn Oil & Gas Ltd.: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\n1 (1962), 35 D.L.R.

The evidence relating to the accident itself was given by one witness who testified that a car going about 70 m.p.h. overtook her own car and cut suddenly in front of her. The right side of the car appeared to rise from the ground and then the car veered to the left side of the road and continued on. The place where this observation occurred was the place where the body of a nine-year old boy was found in the ditch the following morning. The respondent denied any knowledge of the accident and sought to show that neither he nor his automobile had anything to do with it. Debris found at the scene connected his car with the accident. Subsequent to the accident, the respondent kept his car in his garage for two or three days, which was unusual for him to do. Then four days later, he drove to Oshawa during the night and had his car repaired. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: It was a common basis to both sets of reasons for judgment in the Court below that there was no evidence to go to the jury. This was a question of law and it was erroneously decided by that Court. In addition to the witness's description of the driving, there was the subsequent conduct of the respondent which was of real significance when linked with the driving. All this was properly before the jury, so that there was evidence of criminal negligence to go to the jury. Balcerczyk v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 20, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: A reading of the reasons for judgment of Casey J., with which Badeaux J. concurred, where he used the very words of clause (i) of s. 592(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, after which he went on to hold that guilt could not be \"reasonably deduced\" from the evidence, forces the conclusion that the Judge based his judgment on the insufficiency of the evidence rather than the lack of it. It is well settled that if one of the grounds on which a Court of Appeal quashes a conviction is that it cannot be supported by the evidence this Court is without jurisdiction even though the judgment is also based on other grounds raising questions of law in the strict sense. The Queen v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R. 144, referred to.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, quashing the respondent's conviction. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nY.van Mignault, for the appellant.\nLawrence Corriveau, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The conviction of the respondent Russell Taylor on a charge of criminal negligence causing death was set aside by a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side2, from which judgment the Crown now appeals by leave of this Court.\nThe evidence relating to the accident itself was brief and given by only one witness. She was Madame L\u00e9onard Lemieux, who was driving north on Boulevard Henri Bourassa on April 5, 1960, between 7 and 7:15 in the evening. She says that a car overtook her and cut suddenly in front of her. She thought it was going to strike a power pole on the side of the road. The right-hand side of the car appeared to rise from the ground and then the car veered suddenly to the left-hand side of the road and from there went on its way to the north. It did not stop. She estimates its speed at 70 miles an hour. She says she herself was going at 40 miles an hour. The place where this observation occurred was the place where the body of Marcel Berthiaume, a boy of 9 years of age, was found in the ditch the following morning. The boy had left his house in the early evening of April 5 to go on an errand for his mother.\nTaylor's defence was that he had nothing to do with the accident; that he was not at the scene of the accident at the hour in question but was at home with his car in the garage; and that at no relevant time had he given his car into the possession of any other person. This defence could not succeed against the evidence adduced by the prosecution. Debris from a car which was found at the scene of the accident connects Taylor's car with the accident beyond any doubt. Taylor's conduct after April 5, 1960, is also significant. He kept his car in the garage for two or three days with the doors closed. This was an unusual thing to do and was noted by his neighbours at Lac Beauport. On April 9, four days after the accident, he left Lac Beauport at 9 p.m. and drove to Oshawa during the night. He had the car repaired in Oshawa and the explanation he gave for this trip could not possibly be accepted by the jury.\nWhen the case came to appeal the Court concentrated its attention upon the evidence of Madame Lemieux. I take the finding of Casey J. to be that there was no evidence to go to the jury and that, in consequence, he held that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. Rinfret J. held that the learned trial judge ought to have directed a verdict of acquittal. Badeaux J. agreed with both his colleagues and, in my opinion, without any inconsistency for it is a common basis to both reasons for judgment that there was no evidence to go to the jury. This is a question of law and I am of the opinion that the ruling upon it was erroneous.\nEven if the attention of a Court is limited entirely to Madame Lemieux's description of the driving, I cannot agree that there was no evidence of criminal negligence to go to the jury. There was, in addition, Taylor's subsequent conduct which is of real significance when linked with the driving. All this was properly before the jury. Balcerczyk v. The Queen3.\nI would set aside the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, and restore the jury's verdict of guilty. I note from the record that the accused has already been sentenced.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal brought by the Crown, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side4, quashing the conviction of the respondent on a charge of criminal negligence.\nOn April 5, 1960, Marcel Berthiaume died as a result of having been struck by an automobile. It was the theory of the Crown that the respondent was the owner and driver of the car which struck the deceased. The defence was a denial that this was so. The respondent sought to show that neither he nor his automobile had anything to do with the accident.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench was composed of Casey, Rinfret and Badeaux JJ. Casey J. and Rinfret J. each delivered written reasons and Badeaux J. agreed with both of them.\nThe appeal is met in limine by the submission of counsel for the respondent that we are without jurisdiction as the judgment sought to be appealed was based on the ground that the conviction was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence and that the appeal raises no question of law in the strict sense.\nIn my opinion this submission is entitled to prevail.\nThe question whether there is any evidence (as distinguished from sufficient evidence) to support a verdict is a question of law. The answer to the question whether Casey J. decided that as a matter of law there was no evidence or that the evidence was insufficient depends on the construction of the words used by that learned Judge.\nAfter a review of portions of the evidence, Casey J. says:\nIt was the burden of the Crown, to prove that the victim had been struck by appellant's car, that appellant had been driving the automobile and that (CC 191) in his driving he had shown 'wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons'.\nBefore a jury can be called upon to pass judgment, before it can be asked to decide whether there was 'wanton or reckless disregard' there must be some evidence from which the existence of this element can be reasonably deduced. If no such evidence exists then the verdict that finds the accused guilty is one that in the words of CC 592 is 'unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence'. In this case the only person who testifies as to the conduct of the appellant was Mrs. Lemieux. Assuming that the appellant was driving the automobile that struck the victim the evidence of Mrs. Lemieux does not establish facts from which the existence of 'wanton or reckless disregard' can be reasonably deduced.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would maintain this appeal and quash the conviction.\nIt will be observed that the learned Judge used the very words of clause (i) of s. 592(1)(a) of the Criminal Code which must be contrasted with clause (ii). The section reads in part:\n592(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n(a) may allow the appeal where it is of opinion that\n(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or\n(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;\nCasey J. goes on to hold that guilt cannot be \"reasonably deduced\" from the evidence.\nI have reached the conclusion that Casey J. based his judgment on clause (i) quoted above and not on clause (ii). It has already been pointed out that Badeaux J. agreed with Casey J.\nIt is settled by the judgment of this Court in The Queen v. Warner5, that if one of the grounds on which a Court of Appeal quashes a conviction is that it cannot be supported by the evidence we are without jurisdiction even although the judgment is also based on other grounds raising questions of law in the strict sense.\nFor these reasons I have reached the conclusion that we are without jurisdiction to interfere with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, in this case, and I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nAttorney for the appellant: Jean Bienvenu, Quebec.\nAttorney for the respondent: Lawrence Corriveau, Quebec.\n1 [1963] Q.B. 96.\n2 [1963] Q.B. 96.\n3 [1957] S.C.R. 20, 117 C.C.C. 71.\n4 [1963] Que.

Their net outlay for the acquisition of such control was nil. They so arranged the transaction and so manipulated matters that the moneys invested by bond-holders in B P Ltd. became the source of the funds wherewith the accused purchased shares and acquired control of the company. In an indictment containing five counts the accused were charged, inter alia, with conspiring to steal and conspiring to defraud B P Ltd. of approximately $460,000, and that they did \"unlawfully make, circulate or publish\" a false prospectus \"with intent to induce members of the public to advance monies to Brandon Packers Limited\". They were convicted at trial on all five counts. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the Chief Justice dissenting, affirmed the convictions for conspiracy to defraud and issuing a false prospectus, but unanimously quashed the other convictions, including that for conspiracy to steal. The accused appealed to this Court from the convictions for conspiracy to defraud and issuing a false prospectus.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nThe conspiracy to defraud count charged a single conspiracy, existing over a considerable period of time, the object of which was to defraud B P Ltd. of large sums of money by such fraudulent means as presented themselves from time to time. It was not necessary to decide whether each of the six transactions referred to in the particulars was in itself an indictable offence separate from the other five or whether the evidence proved in regard to every one of these items that a crime was actually committed. What the count alleged was that they were all planned in the course of carrying out the single conspiracy and there was evidence to justify the jury in so finding. It was the guilty agreement and not the several acts done in pursuance thereof which constituted the offence charged. It was sufficient to consider the first of the six transactions set out in the particulars. This transaction constituted an offence under s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code and there was ample evidence on which the jury could find the accused guilty of conspiracy to defraud as charged.\nThe convictions for conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to defraud could not both be supported, not because they were mutually destructive, but because if both were allowed to stand the accused would in reality be convicted twice of the same offence. It was the same conspiracy which was alleged in the two counts and it would be contrary to law that the accused should be punished more than once for the same offence. The Court of Appeal had power under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, particularly s. 592(1)(b)(i) and 592(3), to decide that the conviction on the conspiracy to steal count should be quashed and that on the conspiracy to defraud count should be affirmed.\nSection 343(1) (c) creates only one offence, the essence of which is an attempt to induce persons to advance moneys to a company by means of a prospectus known to the accused to be false in a material particular. The making, circulating or publishing of such a prospectus are not separate offences, but are modes in which the one offence may be committed. A prospectus may be \"false in a material particular\" within the meaning of s. 343(1) if it contains a material statement as to the purpose for which the proceeds from the sale of the securities offered in the prospectus are to be used and it is found that the person making the statement had never any intention that the proceeds should be used for that purpose. The test is not whether the statement amounted strictly speaking to a \"false pretence\" but rather whether the conduct of the accused in making it was fraudulent. The expression \"any person\" includes all persons of the class to whom the prospectus was intended to be given although at the time the false prospectus was made the identity of none of these persons was known.\nR. v.

Appeals dismissed.\nH. Monk, Q.C., for the appellant Cox.\nH. Walsh, Q.C., and J. J. Robinette, Q.C., for the appellant Paton.\nA. S. Dewar, Q.C., and K. G. Houston, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014The appellants Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox were tried before Monnin J. and a jury on an indictment containing the following five counts:\n1. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-six and the thirtieth day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully conspire together each with the other to commit an indictable offence, to wit: to steal the monies; valuable securities or other property of Brandon Packers Limited to the value of approximately Four hundred and sixty thousand ($460,000.00) Dollars.\n2. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between the first day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-six and the thirtieth day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully steal the monies, valuable securities or other property of Brandon Packers Limited to the value of approximately Four hundred and forty-eight thousand ($448,000.00) Dollars.\n3. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between the first day of January in the year of our Lord\" one thousand nine hundred and. fifty-six and the. thirtieth day. of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred. and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully conspire together each with the other to commit an indictable offence, to wit: by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited of monies, valuable securities or other property to the value of approximately Four Hundred and sixty thousand ($460,000.00) Dollars.\n4. That they the said Hugh Paton. and D. Hubert, Cox between the first day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-six and the thirtieth day of November in the year of our Lord one. thousand nine hundred and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba, by \"deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defrauded Brandon Packers Limited of monies, valuable securities or other property to the value of approximately Four hundred and forty-eight thousand ($448;000,00) Dollars.\n5. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between the first day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-six and the first day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and-fifty-seven both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully make, circulate or publish a prospectus dated July 14th, 1956 for a four hundred thousand ($400,000.00) Dollar issue of five and one-half (5\u00bd%) per centum sinking fund bonds of Brandon Packers Limited, they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox knowing the said prospectus to be false in a material particular with intent to induce members of the public to advance monies to Brandon Packers. Limited.\nBefore the accused had pleaded to the indictment their counsel moved to quash count 3 on the ground that it was void for uncertainty and to quash count 5 on the ground that it disclosed no offence known to the law since it did not charge an intent to induce an ascertained person or ascertained persons to advance moneys but charged an intent to induce \"members of the public\" to advance moneys. Both of these motions were dismissed by the learned trial judge.\nIn the course of the argument of these motions, which took place in the absence of the members of the jury panel and before the jury had been selected, counsel for the Crown stated that counts 3 and 4 were \"in effect alternative charges to counts 1 and 2\" ; but this was not at any stage of the trial pointed out to the jury.\nNo order, such as is contemplated by s. 497 of the Criminal Code, that the prosecutor should furnish particulars was made; but it appears from the transcript of the argument on the motions referred to above that counsel for the Crown had orally given particulars at the preliminary inquiry and these he repeated in his opening address to the jury at the trial. The particulars stated that the amount of \"approximately $460,000\" referred to in counts 1 and 3 was made up as follows:\n1.Investment by Brandon Packers Limited preferred shares of Fropak Limited;.......................................................................... $200,000.00\n2.Reimbursement to the accused for out-of-pocket expenses; ................................................................................................... 4,219.41\n3.Payment for office space and services in Toronto;................. 8,000.00\n4.Payment of real estate agent's commission in respect of purchase of plant at Lakehead;.................................................. 4,000.00\n5.Management fees; ................................................................. 208,750.00\n6.Loans to companies controlled by accused........................... 38,500.00\n$463,469.41\nThe particulars also stated that the amount of \"approximately $448,000\" referred to in counts 2 and 4 was made up of the same six items except that in the case of the management fees, item 5, the amount actually collected from Brandon Packers Limited was $196,715.24.\nAt the end of the case for the Crown, counsel for the appellants moved to quash counts 1 and 3 on the ground that the evidence disclosed that each of them applied to at least six separate and distinct transactions and not a single transaction. The motion was denied. Towards the end of his charge to the jury the learned trial judge instructed them that they might find a verdict of guilty or not guilty on each of the five counts.\nAt the conclusion of the charge counsel for the accused made the submission, amongst others, that counts 1 and 2 were alternatives to counts 3 and 4 and that the jury should be instructed that they could not convict on both count 1 and count 3 or on both count 2 and count 4. Counsel for the Crown opposed this submission and the learned trial judge did not give the direction asked for.\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty against each of the appellants on all five counts. The learned trial judge imposed sentences of seven years imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.\nThe appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The appeals were heard by a Court composed of Miller C.J.M., Schultz, Freedman and Guy JJ.A. and Bastin J. (ad hoc). The Court unanimously decided that counts 1, 2 and 4 should be quashed and that a verdict of acquittal should be entered on each of them. The majority of the Court (Miller C.J.M., dissenting) dismissed the appeals against the convictions on counts 3 and 5; the sentences were reduced to imprisonment for four years on each of these counts, the sentences to run concurrently.\nMiller C.J.M. dissenting as to counts 3 and 5 would have quashed the convictions and directed verdicts of acquittal to be entered on both of these counts.\nIn the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal it is recited that the Chief Justice dissented \"on the following grounds in law\":\n1. That Count 5 in the Indictment is void for uncertainty in that it charges more than one offence, namely, three separate offences of making, circulating or publishing a false prospectus which form of charge in a single count in the Indictment is prohibited by section 492 of the Criminal Code.\n2. That the learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal on Count 5 in the Indictment when an application for a directed verdict was made by defence counsel at the close of the evidence for the Crown since there was absolutely no evidence adduced that the Appellants made, published or circulated a prospectus, or that the prospectus was false in a material particular to the knowledge of the Appellants.\n3. That there was no evidence adduced at the trial that the Appellants made, published, or circulated a prospectus. 4. That there was no evidence adduced that the prospectus was false in a material particular to the knowledge of the Appellants.\n5. That the verdict of guilty by the jury on Count 5 in the Indictment was perverse.\n6. That Count 3 in the Indictment while alleging a single transaction involved six separate and distinct transactions and that the learned trial Judge erred in failing to quash the said Count 3 or direct the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal thereon.\n7. That the learned trial Judge erred in directing the jury that they could consider the charging of management fees by Great West Saddlery Company Limited to Brandon Packers Limited in the sum of $208,750.00 as indicating a conspiracy to defraud on the part of the Appellants, when there was no evidence of fraud with respect to the said management fees and when the charging and collection of the said management fees did not amount to a crime.\n8. That the verdict of the jury was inconsistent and uncertain in bringing in a verdict of guilty on both Counts 1 and 3 in the Indictment when these were alternative Counts, each containing six separate transactions and that the verdict of the jury was therefore confusing and uncertain in that it could not be ascertained on which item or items the jury had based its finding.\n9. That the verdict of the jury was inconsistent and uncertain and could not be allowed to stand as a conviction on Counts 1 or 3 in the Indictment since it could not be said that the jury convicted the Appellants either of conspiracy to steal or conspiracy to defraud, in connection with the item of $200,000.00 referred to in the particulars of the Counts supplied by the Crown.\n10. Counts 1 and 3 in the Indictment each related to more than a single transaction and as a result the verdict of the jury was ambiguous, inconsistent and improper in that no one knows upon which of the various transactions the jury convicted and upon which of the various transactions the jury acquitted.\n11. Since the jury by its verdict in Counts 1 and 3 found that each Count contained more than a single transaction, some being theft and some fraud, and this being contrary to Section 492 of the Criminal Code all of the said Counts 1 and 3 must be quashed.\n12. The verdict of guilty brought in by the jury on both Counts 1 and 3 in the Indictment is fatal to the maintenance of both convictions.\nBy orders of this Court made on October 29, 1962, leave was granted to both of the accused to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following ground:\nDoes Count 5 in the indictment disclose any offence known to our law since it does not charge that the appellants published a prospectus with intent to induce an ascertained person or ascertained persons to advance monies but charges an intent 'to induce members of the public to advance monies'.\nThe notices of appeal to this Court served by both of the accused were founded on the ground on which leave was granted and on\nthe grounds in law set forth by Miller C.J.M. in his dissent from the judgment of the said Court of Appeal which said grounds of dissent in law are more particularly set out in the reasons for judgment of the said Miller C.J.M. and in the certificate of judgment of the said Court of Appeal.\nBy orders of this Court made on October 29, 1962, leave was granted to the Attorney-General of the Province of Manitoba to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in so far as it quashed the conviction on count 4. The grounds upon which this leave was granted in the case of each accused were:\n1. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that there were six separate and \"distinct transactions involved in the offence set forth in count 4 of the indictment?\n2. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that count 4 in the indictment offended against subsection (1) of section 492 of the Criminal Code in that it did not in general apply to a single transaction?\n3. Did the Court of Appeal err in not affirming the conviction on count 4 in the indictment when it was satisfied that the evidence disclosed that the respondent had by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defrauded Brandon Packers Limited of monies, valuable securities and other property?\nAt the conclusion of the argument in this Court counsel for the Crown stated, in answer to a question from the bench, that in the event of the appeals of the accused as to either count 3 or count 5 being dismissed he did not wish to press the appeals of the Crown as to count 4.\nIn the course of the trial which occupied thirty-nine days more than six hundred exhibits were filed. The lengthy and complex history of the transactions out of which the charges against the appellants arose is outlined in the reasons of Miller C.J.M. and more briefly in those of Freedman J.A. and of Guy J.A. I shall endeavour to state the relevant facts as briefly as is consistent with making clear the questions which arise on these appeals. I will deal first with the circumstances under which the appellants obtained control of Brandon Packers Limited.\nBrandon Packers Limited was incorporated under the Companies Act of Manitoba in 1936. In that year it had sold a debenture issue of $200,000 falling due on December 1, 1956. The indebtedness remaining on this issue in 1956 was $79,100. Joseph C. Donaldson was the principal shareholder in Brandon Packers Limited. He and Miss Minnie E. Peary held 12,535 common shares, of the par value of $5, out of a total issued of 14,530; and Donaldson held 58,120 preferred shares of the par value of $1. Donaldson had been president and a director of the company from its inception and Miss Peary had been a director and secretary-treasurer for a number of years.\nEarly in 1956 Donaldson was considering selling his shares. It was clear that a new bond issue would have to be sold to provide the $79,100 required to pay the bonds maturing in December and the company, while solvent, was in need of additional working capital. Through one Allan Bass, who was acting as agent for Donaldson, the two accused became interested as possible purchasers of Donaldson's shares; in March 1956, they went to Brandon, inspected the company's plant and had a discussion with Donaldson as to the sale of his shares and the issue of bonds by Brandon Packers Limited.\nFollowing negotiations, to which it is unnecessary to refer in detail, an agreement under seal dated June 11, 1956, was entered into between Donaldson as optionor and Paton Corporation Limited as optionee, whereby in consideration of $10,000 paid in cash the optionor granted an option, irrevocable up to September 30, 1956, to purchase all the shares of Brandon Packers Limited \"owned or controlled by the optionor\" namely, 12,535 common shares at a total price of $188,000 and 51,748 preferred shares at a total price of $51,748. If the option was exercised the transaction was to be closed on or before December 2, 1956. The common shares were to be paid for as follows: the $10,000 paid for the option was to be credited on the purchase price, $78,000 was to be paid in cash on closing, and $100,000 \"in bonds to be issued by Brandon Packers Limited on the date of closing\". (It was later arranged between the parties that $178,000 should be paid in cash to Donaldson on closing and that he should use $100,000 thereof to purchase $100,000 of the bonds). The preferred shares were to be paid for on or before December 2, 1957.\nThe option agreement contained the following paragraph:\nIt is the stated intention of the optionee to procure that Brandon Packers Limited will issue bonds to the extent of $400,000.00 for sale and the optionor agrees to use his best endeavors to promote the sale of such bonds of the Company.\nThe evidence is clear that both of the accused were acting together in taking this option and in the various trans- actions which followed. At all relevant times the appellant Paton owned or controlled all the shares in Paton Corporation Limited, and similarly the appellant Cox controlled Leomar Investment Corporation Limited which was described as his personal holding corporation. The $10,000 payable at the time of the signing of the option agreement was paid by a cheque of Leomar Investment Corporation Limited.\nOn September 27, 1956, the appellants exercised their option under the agreement of June 11, 1956. The transaction was closed on November 21, 1956. In July, under circumstances to be mentioned later, a prospectus regarding the issue of $400,000 5\u00bd per cent sinking fund bonds of Brandon Packers Limited had been signed and filed and by November 21, 1956, about $275,000 of the bonds had been sold. Prior to this date the appellants had obtained supplementary letters patent amending the charter of Fropak Limited, a company controlled by them, to permit it to issue preferred shares. On the evidence it was open to the jury to conclude that Fropak Limited had no assets of any value.\nThe purchase of Donaldson's shares was completed in the following way.\nOn November 20, 1956, the appellants met with Donaldson at Brandon in order to close out the transaction.\nOn November 20, 1956, Donaldson made out a cheque of Brandon Packers Limited for $200,000 payable to the Imperial Bank of Canada. This cheque was signed by Donaldson and Miss Peary.\nOn November 21, 1956, Brandon Packers Limited executed a contract to which the seal of the company was affixed, whereby Brandon Packers Limited agreed to purchase from Fropak Limited 2,000 preference shares of the par value of $100 each. This agreement was signed by the appellants on behalf of Fropak Limited and by Donaldson and Miss Peary on behalf of Brandon Packers Limited.\nOn the afternoon of November 21, 1956, the appellants and Donaldson met with John English, manager of the Imperial Bank at Brandon, in his office. At this meeting Donaldson turned over the $200,000 cheque of Brandon Packers Limited to English with a letter stating that the cheque was in payment of 2,000 preferred shares of Fropak Limited. This cheque for $200,000 was deposited to the credit of an internal account in the bank, known as a remittance account. English then drew a cheque on the remittance account for $183,560, in favour of Donaldson which was endorsed by Donaldson, and deposited to the credit of C his account. The balance in the remittance account, $16,440, was remitted by the bank to the Imperial Bank at Toronto to go to the credit of the account of Fropak Limited.\nThe difference between the amount of $183,560 and the $178,000 which, under the option agreement, was to be paid on closing is accounted for by the fact that on November 21, 1956, Donaldson held a total of 12,904 common shares of Brandon Packers Limited, having acquired an additional 369 shares after June 11, 1956. The purchase price of the 12,904 shares at $15 per share was $193,560. The sum of $10,000 had already been paid as a deposit, leaving a balance of $183,560.\nWhile at the office of English on November 21, 1956, Donaldson drew a cheque on his account for the sum of $100,000 payable to Imperial Bank of Canada and delivered it to English to be used in payment for the bonds of Brandon Packers Limited purchased by Donaldson in accordance with the agreement referred to above. Later these bonds were delivered to Donaldson.\nEnglish was given a letter signed by Donaldson and Miss Peary authorizing the bank to turn over to Paton Corporation Limited and Leomar Investment Corporation Limited the 12,904 common shares of Brandon Packers Limited on receipt of the said sum of $183,560, and on November 21, 1956, English delivered these shares to the appellants.\nSome time after November 21, 1956, 2,000 preference shares in Fropak Limited were issued to Brandon Packers Limited and the share certificates were delivered.\nPaton Corporation Limited and Leomar Investment Corporation Limited each signed a promissory note dated November 21, 1956, for $91,780 in favour of Fropak Limited making up the sum of $183,560 which Fropak Limited had advanced to the said two corporations and with which Donaldson's shares were purchased.\nIt is to this transaction that the first item of the particulars of count 3 furnished by the Crown refers. Its true substance and effect are described by Freedman J.A. in the following passage in his reason's, which I wish to adopt:\nPaton and Cox obtained control of Brandon Packers Limited. Their net outlay for the acquisition of such control was exactly nil. Indeed their corporation, Fropak. Limited, emerged from the transaction with a net gain of $6,440, being the difference between $200,000 invested by Brandon Packers Limited in preferred shares of Fropak Limited, less $193,560 paid to Donaldson. The daylight loan from the bank was the apparent but not the actual source of the funds making possible the implementation of the scheme. The real source was the monies in the hands of Brandon Packers Limited that had been obtained from the sale of bonds. It was the existence of these monies which guaranteed. the immediate repayment to the bank of its loan so as to enable its advance safely to be made in the form of a daylight loan. In short, the two accused so arranged the transaction and so manipulated matters that the monies invested by the bondholders in Brandon Packers Limited became the source of the funds wherewith the accused purchased Donaldson's shares and acquired control of Brandon Packers Limited.\nBrandon Packers Limited did acquire preferred stock of Fropak Limited having a purported value of $200,000. Implicit in the entire transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a legitimate, bona fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to make. In fact, however, Fropak Limited was not an operating company and it was entirely without assets. Its charter, which had lapsed, was admittedly revived by the accused for the purposes of this very transaction. At the same time supplementary letters patent were obtained, creating the preferred shares which were required in the implementation of the accused's scheme. For its $200,000 Brandon Packers Limited obtained shares whose worth. was negligible.\nWe were informed that the phrase \"daylight loan\" denotes a loan which is made and repaid on the same day.\nI do not find it necessary to deal in detail with the facts in regard to the remaining five items in the particulars shewing how it was alleged that the total of $460,000 mentioned in count 3 was made up. It is sufficient to say that as to items 2, 3, 4 and 5, the theory of the Crown was that the appellants, who were then in control of Brandon Packers Limited, expressly or by necessary implication represented that these sums were owing by that company to the appellants or to companies controlled by them and obtained payment thereof when they knew that in fact Brandon Packers Limited was not under liability to make any of the payments; and that as regards item 6 the loans made to companies controlled by the appellants were not merely unlawful in the sense that they were unauthorized but that the moneys \"loaned\" were paid over without any intention on the part of the appellants that they would be repaid. Turning now to the grounds on which Miller C.J.M. dissented as to the conviction on count 3, I would first observe that, in my opinion, the appellants are entitled to rely on the particulars given orally by counsel for the Crown to the same extent as if they had been furnished pursuant to an order made under s. 497 of the Criminal Code. On this point I agree with the statement of Beck J.A. in R. v. Carswell1:\nS.859 (a predecessor of S.497) empowers the trial judge to order particulars.\nIf he does so it must be clear that the prosecutor is bound by the particulars which he gives in accordance with the order.\nIf without order he gives particulars he must be equally bound.\nThe grounds of dissent as to count 3 are those numbered 6 to 12 inclusive in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal quoted above. It appears to me that these, other than number 7 which will be considered separately, raise in different words the following two questions of law:\n1. Was count 3 bad on. the ground that it charged not, one offence but six separate offences contrary to s.492(1) of the Criminal Code?\n2. Were the facts that the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both count 1 and count 3 and that this verdict was recorded fatal to the maintenance of either conviction so that as a matter of law both must now be quashed?\nOn the first of these questions I am in agreement with the reasons of Freedman J.A. and will not repeat them at length.\nCount 3 charges a single conspiracy, existing over a considerable period of time, the object of which was to defraud Brandon Packers Limited of large sums of money by such fraudulent means as presented themselves from time to time. It is not necessary on this appeal to decide whether each of the six transactions referred to in the particulars was in itself an indictable offence separate from the other five or whether the evidence proved in regard to every one of these items that a crime was actually committed. Assuming that each was separate from the others and that count 4 was therefore bad, what count 3 alleged was that they were all planned in the course of carrying out the single conspiracy and there was evidence to justify the jury in so finding. It was the guilty agreement and not the several acts done in pursuance thereof which constituted the offence charged in count 3.\nI agree with Freedman J.A. that for the purpose of dealing with the appeal as to count 3 it is sufficient to consider the first of the six transactions set out in the particulars. I have already quoted his summary of the effect of that transaction. I share the view which he expressed (with the concurrence of Schultz J.A. and, on this point, of Bastin J.) and which Guy J.A. expressed in separate reasons that this transaction constituted an offence under s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code and that there was ample evidence on which the jury could find the accused guilty of conspiracy to defraud as charged in count 3.\nIn the course of argument on this branch of the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was no evidence that the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they intended to do so because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false representation made to the company or of any official of the company having been deceived into parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished. Assuming, without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the meaning of s. 597(1) of the Criminal Code, I would reject this argument. I will examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to the $200,000 which is the first item in the particulars. I have already indicated my agreement with the statement of Freedman J.A. that \"implicit in the entire transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to make\" and with his view that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding that this representation was false to the knowledge of the accused. If it deceived Donaldson, who was still nominally at least in control of the company, into paying over the $200,000 to Fropak that would be a fraud on the company. If, on the other hand, it is suggested that Donaldson was not deceived but paid the money over knowing that the transaction was not bona fide, that the Fropak shares were worthless and that their purchase was merely a step in a scheme to enable the accused to buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with its own money, that would simply be to say that Donaldson was particeps criminis. If all the directors of a company should join in using its funds to purchase an asset which they knew to be worthless as part of a scheme to divert those funds to their own use they would, in my opinion, be guilty under s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of those funds. Even supposing it could be said that, the directors being \"the mind of the company\" and well knowing the true facts, the company was not deceived (a proposition which I should find it difficult to accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case the directors would have defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood, by \"other fraudulent means\".\nI turn now to the second question whether the recorded verdict of guilty on both counts 1 and 3 requires that both verdicts be quashed.\nIt has already been pointed out that counts 1 and 3 were expressly stated by counsel for the Crown to be alternative. In my respectful opinion the learned trial judge should have so instructed the jury in his charge and when the jury returned their verdict, instead of having it recorded he should have sent them back to reconsider it, with definite instructions that they must not return a verdict of guilty on both counts 1 and 3.\nOn this ground counsel for the appellants rely particularly on the following decisions: Commonwealth v. Haskins et al.2; Heinze et al. v. State3; and R. v. Mills4.\nThe principle stated in the first two of these cases is summarized in the following passage in the reasons of Delaplaine J., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Maryland in Heinze et al. v. State, at p. 130:\nIt is unquestioned that a finding of guilty on two inconsistent counts is invalid. Thus where a defendant is charged in one count with larceny and in another count with receiving stolen goods, and it plainly appears that the property alleged to have been stolen is that also alleged to have been received, a general verdict of guilty is fatally defective, because in law a thief cannot be guilty of the crime of receiving stolen goods which he himself has stolen, and a guilty receiver of stolen goods cannot himself be the thief, and hence the defendant could not be guilty on both counts.\nR. v. Mills is a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England composed of Byrne, Slade and Salmon JJ. The note is brief and I have not been able to find a fuller report. The whole note reads as follows:\nM. was tried at quarter sessions on an indictment containing four counts, namely, (i) larceny of a motor-car, (ii) taking and driving away the car without the owner's consent, (iii) receiving the car. knowing it to have been stolen, and (iv) larceny of two number plates of the car. He was acquitted of the first two offences and convicted of the last two. The original number plates on the motor-car had been taken off and false number plates substituted. On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal:\nHeld, that the two verdicts of guilty were really mutually destructive. If M. had, as the jury found (owing perhaps to the deputy-chairman's unfortunate failure to give a sufficient direction with regard to possession), received the motor-car, then plainly he had received it with the substituted plates upon it, and he could not be found to have received the motor-car knowing it to have been stolen and at the same time to have stolen the two original number plates, for the two things stood together. Accordingly, the appeal would be allowed.\nIn my opinion, these cases rightly decide that the convictions of an accused (i) of stealing an article and (ii) of receiving the same article knowing it to have been stolen cannot both stand. But in so far as they hold that an Appellate Court has no power to uphold either conviction they appear to be at variance with the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and of this Court in Kelly v. The King5. In that case the jury rendered a verdict of guilty on count 1, theft of money, belonging to the King, count 2, unlawfully receiving money belonging to the King knowing the same to have been stolen and, count 4, obtaining money by false pretences from His Majesty. The convictions on these three counts were upheld by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt appears from p. 228 of the report in this Court that counsel for the accused argued that the accused could not be guilty of all three of these offences that he could not, indeed, be guilty of any two of them and that consequently the whole conviction was bad. This Court was unanimous in dismissing the appeal.\nAnglin J., in whose judgment Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. concurred, said at pp. 261 and 262:\nAlthough the conviction of the appellant on three distinct counts in. an indictment\u2014No. 1, for theft, No. 2, for receiving, and No. 4, for obtaining money by false pretences\u2014was upheld by a majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the Chief Justice, as we understand with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Perdue and Mr. Justice Cameron, said (35 West L.R. 57):\u2014\nIt is difficult to see how the accused should for one crime be found guilty on the first, second and fourth counts. That he has committed a crime seems by the evidence to be clearly established, and it is perhaps best established under the fourth count.\nI assume that the trial judge in pronouncing sentence will consider that the accused was found guilty of but one crime, and in considering the maximum sentence allowed by law I think he should be guided by the lowest maximum fixed by law for either of the three crimes set forth in the first, second and fourth counts.\nThis course being taken, I do not think such substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned at the trial as would justify a new trial under sec. 1019 of the Code.\nThere seems no necessity to interfere with the finding of guilty on the inconsistent counts. He was certainly guilty of one of them and as he will be punished on one only, I would follow the course taken in Rex v. Lockett (1914) 2 K.B. 720, at p. 733.\nThe formal judgment of the court, however, does not direct that the penalty to be imposed shall be so limited; but Mr. Coyne, while vigorously insisting that the conviction on all three counts should be sustained, stated at bar in this Court that, as counsel representing the Crown he submitted to the judgment of the Court of Appeal being dealt with as if it contained a provision under section 1020 of the Criminal Code limiting the penalty as indicated by the learned Chief Justice.\nHaving regard to all the circumstances of the case, and especially to the possible embarrassment which may have been caused by the trial together of five separate counts, and to the fact that the learned trial judge, while he carefully defined each of the offences charged, deemed it advisable to abstain from instructing the jury as to the facts in evidence bearing upon each branch of the indictment, we think the position taken by counsel for the Crown eminently proper and that \"we ought to treat the verdict as a verdict on the lesser charge,\" namely, that of obtaining money by false pretences.\nIn the result the convictions on all three counts were allowed to stand. It seems clear that this Court was of opinion that the conviction on count 4 could be upheld in spite of its inconsistency with the convictions on counts 1 and 2.\nIf, however, it be assumed that the three cases relied on by the appellants were correctly decided they do not appear to me to be applicable to the circumstances of the case at bar. I incline to agree with the view expressed by Freedman J.A. that in the case of each of the six transactions referred to in the particulars the crime, if crime there was, was fraud rather than theft. But suppose it were otherwise and that some of the items particularized constituted fraud and others theft, there may well be a single conspiracy to com- mit a number of different offences; the cases of R. v. Graham6 and R. v. Rose7, referred to by Freedman J.A., are apt illustrations. The reason that the convictions on counts 1 and 3 cannot both be supported is not that they are \"mutually destructive\", as was said of the counts in R. v. Mills, supra, but rather that if both were allowed to stand the accused would in reality be convicted twice of the same offence. It is the same conspiracy which is alleged in the two counts and it would be contrary to law that the accused should be punished more than once for the same offence.\nIn my view, the Court of Appeal has power under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, particularly s. 592(1)(b)(i) and s. 592(3), to decide that the conviction on count 1 should be quashed and that on count 3 affirmed.\nIt remains to consider the ground of dissent numbered 7 set out in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal and quoted earlier in these reasons.\nThis ground is based on the premise that there was no evidence on which it was open to the jury to find that the moneys paid over as management fees were obtained from Brandon Packers Limited by fraud. In my opinion, there was evidence to support a finding that the appellants represented that these fees were owing when to their knowledge Brandon Packers Limited was under no liability to pay them. It was open to the jury to take the view that the services for which the fees purported to be paid were negligible and that the disproportion between the services rendered and the amount paid was so great as to shew that the transaction was fraudulent. The premise on which this ground is based is not established and it should be rejected.\nI would accordingly dismiss the appeals as to the conviction on count 3.\nThe grounds on which the conviction on count 5 is attacked may be summarized as follows:\n1. That the count is void in that it charges not one offence but the three separate offences of (i) making, (ii) circulating, and (iii) publishing a prospectus knowing the same to be false in a material particular with the intent specified in clause (c) of s. 343(1). 2. That there was no evidence that the appellants made, circulated or published the prospectus.\n3. That there was no evidence that the prospectus was false in a material particular to the knowledge of the appellants.\n4. That the count does not disclose any offence known to the law since it does not charge that the appellants published a prospectus with intent to induce an ascertained person or ascertained persons to advance moneys but charges an intent \"to induce members of the public to advance moneys\".\nAs to the first ground it will be observed that the count follows the wording of s. 343(1)(c) of the Criminal Code and it is necessary to consider the effect of s. 492(2)(b) and of s.500(1)(a):\n492(2) The statement referred to in subsection (1) may be\n* * *\n(b) in the words of the enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable offence, \u2026\n500(1) A count is not objectionable by reason only that\n(a) it charges in the alternative several different matters, acts or omissions that, are stated in the alternative in an enactment that describes as an indicable offence the matters, acts or omissions charged in the count \u2026\nIn my opinion, it is clear since the judgment of this Court in Archer v. The Queen1 that these provisions do not render a count good if the words of the enactment which are adopted in framing the count describe more than one offence, and the question to be decided is whether the words of s. 343(1)(c) describe one offence or more than one.\nI have reached the conclusion that s. 343(1)(c) creates only one offence, the essence of which is an attempt to induce persons to advance moneys to a company by means of a prospectus known to the accused to be false in a material particular and that the making, circulating or publishing are not separate offences but are modes in which the one offence may be committed. I would reject this first ground of appeal.\nGround 2 may be shortly dealt with. There is evidence that the issue and sale of the bonds was an integral part of the scheme of the appellants from its inception, that the portion of the prospectus which the Crown claims to be false was drafted by the appellant Paton and approved by the appellant Cox, that it was sent by Paton to Donaldson with the intention that it be incorporated in the prospectus which was filed and circulated and that it was so incorporated. This was sufficient evidence to support a finding that both appellants took part in making the prospectus. I would reject this second ground of appeal.\nAs to the third ground the portion of the prospectus claimed by the Crown to be false in a material particular is that reading as follows:\nPURPOSE OF ISSUE\nThe proceeds to be received by the Company from the sale of $400,000 of First Mortgage Bonds offered by the Prospectus, will be used by the Company for the redemption of outstanding debentures of $79,000, the expansion of its existing business and additions thereto, particularly with respect to the erection of a quick freezing and cold storage plant and for other corporate purposes.\nIf in fact at the time they arranged to have this statement incorporated in the prospectus the appellants had already formed the intention of using a large portion of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds not for any of the purposes stated (other than the redemption of the outstanding bonds) but for the purpose of providing themselves with the funds to purchase the shares of Brandon Packers Limited then, in my opinion, the prospectus was to their knowledge false in a material particular. There was evidence on which it was open to the jury to so find. That such a false statement was likely to induce and was intended to induce persons to purchase the bonds is obvious. As to this ground I am in general agreement with the views expressed by Freedman J.A.\nBefore concluding the examination of this ground of appeal it is necessary to consider the argument of counsel for the appellants that even if at the time of drafting the statement as to the purpose of the bond issue, quoted above, the accused had formed the intention of using a large portion of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds for the purpose mentioned in the preceding paragraph of these reasons, this circumstance did not render the prospectus \"false in a material particular\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in s. 343(1). It is said that an offence under this section is created only if the material particular in which the pros- pectus is false amounts to a false pretence, that is to say is a representation of a matter of fact either present or past ; that, whatever may be the rule in civil cases, a statement of present intention about future conduct does not amount to a false pretence in criminal law.\nIn support of this argument reliance is placed upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Dent8, and particularly the following passage in the reasons of the Court, delivered by Devlin J. and concurred in by Lord Goddard C.J. and Donovan J., at p. 595:\nThe case for the prosecution is that when the appellant entered into each of the contracts in this case, he thereby impliedly represented that he intended to carry it out, whereas in fact he had no such intention. It is, of course, undisputed that to constitute a false pretence the false statement must be of an existing fact. The prosecution contend that a statement of present intention, although it relates to the future, is a statement of existing fact. That was the view expressed by Bowen L.J. in his celebrated dictum in Edgington v. Fitzmaurice:\nThere must be a misstatement of an existing fact: but the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man's mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact.\nEdgington v. Fitzmaurice was an action for deceit. Whatever the position may be in civil cases, we are satisfied that a long course of authorities in criminal cases has laid it down that a statement of intention about future conduct, whether or not it be a statement of existing fact, is not such a statement as will amount to a false pretence in criminal law.\nThe charges on which the accused were convicted in R. v. Dent were all of obtaining moneys by false pretences; the convictions were quashed.\nThis judgment may be contrasted with that of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the following year in the case of R. v. Ingram9. The Court was composed of Lord Goddard C.J., Streatfield and Donovan JJ. The accused was convicted on six counts of obtaining credit by fraud contrary to s. 13(1) of the Debtors Act (1869) which reads as follows:\n13. Any person shall in each of the cases following be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be liable to be imprisoned for any time not exceeding one year with or without hard labour; that is to say,\n(1) If in incurring any debt or liability he has obtained credit under false pretences, or by means of any other fraud; Donovan J. delivered the judgment of the Court. He said at p. 640:\nThe appellant is an electrician, and the fraud alleged against him was this: that he obtained contracts from a number of shopkeepers to erect or renovate electric neon signs at an agreed price. He obtained payment of part of that price in advance, but did not do the work save for insignificant matters of a preparatory nature. He was in financial difficulties, and none of the advance payments was returned.\nThe jury were properly directed that they could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied, inter alia, that in obtaining these advance payments and then failing to do the work he was acting fraudulently, that is to say, that he never had any intention to do the stipulated work at the time when he received payments in advance. The jury, influenced no doubt by what appeared to be a systematic course of conduct on the appellant's part, convicted him, and it must accordingly be taken that they found that when he received part payments at the outset he had no intention to do the work he had undertaken to do. On any view, therefore, his conduct was fraudulent, but he argues that it involved no obtaining of credit and thus no offence under s. 13(1) of the Debtors Act, 1869.\nThe Court then examined and rejected the argument that the conduct, though fraudulent, did not involve obtaining credit and the convictions were affirmed.\nSince two members of the Court which decided R. v. Ingram had taken part in the judgment in R. v. Dent given in the previous year, it can safely be assumed that they were of the view that there was no inconsistency between the two judgments. The reconciliation is found in the circumstance that in R. v. Dent to support the conviction it was necessary to find that there had been a false pretence while in R. v. Ingram it was sufficient to find that, although there had been no false pretence, there had been \"other fraud\".\nIt will be observed that s. 343(1) does not use the phrase \"a false pretence\". I have reached the conclusion that a prospectus may be \"false in a material particular\" within the meaning of the section if it contains a material statement as to the purpose for which the proceeds from the sale of the securities offered in the prospectus are to be used and it is found that the person making the statement had never any intention that the proceeds should be used for that purpose. The test is not, in my opinion, whether the statement amounted strictly speaking to a \"false pretence\" but rather whether the conduct of the accused in making it was fraudulent.\nI would reject this third ground of appeal. As to the fourth ground of appeal which has been set out above it could not be successfully argued that the use of the words \"to induce members of the public\" instead of the words of s. 343(1)(c) \"to induce a person\" misled or embarrassed the defence; but counsel argued that this is of no importance, that the offence created by the section is statutory and that conduct which does not fall within the words as well as within the spirit of the section is not an offence at all. The defence contends that on its true construction s. 343(1)(c) creates an offence only in a case where the intent of the accused is to induce an ascertained person to advance something to a company; emphasis is laid on the circumstance that the words \"whether ascertained or not\" which appear in clauses (a) and (b) of the subsection are omitted in clause (c). Counsel also contrasts the wording of clause (c) with that of s. 323(1) of the Code where the expression is used \"defrauds the public or any person whether ascertained or not \u2026\".\nSection 343(1)(c) is penal and must be strictly construed in favour of the accused, but in construing it, it is the duty of the Court to endeavour to give effect to the intention of Parliament as expressed in the words used. The construction contended for by the defence would render clause (c) virtually inoperative. The evil sought to be prevented is the use of a false prospectus to induce persons to advance moneys to a company. The occasions must be very rare in which a false prospectus is prepared with the purpose of inducing an ascertained individual to advance moneys. The primary purpose of a prospectus is to raise moneys from the public. In my opinion on its true construction s. 343(1)(c) makes it an offence for anyone to make, circulate or publish a prospectus which he knows is false in a material particular with the intent to induce any person to advance moneys to the company on whose behalf the prospectus is issued and the expression \"any person\" includes all persons of the class to whom the prospectus is intended to be given although at the time the false prospectus is made the identity of none of those persons is known. I conclude that count 5 does disclose an offence against s. 343(1)(c) and that this ground of appeal should be rejected.\nIn the result I am of opinion that all the grounds of appeal which are open to the accused on the appeals to this Court must be rejected and that the appeals against the convictions on both count 3 and count 5 must be dismissed.\nIn view of the statement of Crown counsel, mentioned above, that, in the event of the appeals of the accused failing, the Crown did not wish to press the appeals in regard to count 4 those appeals will be dismissed.\nAppeals and cross-appeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant Cox: Monk, Goodwin, Higenbottam & Goodwin, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the appellant Paton: Walsh, Micay & Company, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Deputy Attorney-General for the Province of Manitoba.\n1 (1916), 10 W.W.R. 1027 at 1038.\n2 (1880), 128 Mass. 60.\n3 (1945), 42 A.

He then wrote a number of letters explaining why he had done it, that he was in financial difficulty and did not want his wife to suffer from it. During the afternoon, he attempted suicide by shooting himself. The attempt having failed, he telephoned the police in the evening to tell them what he had done. Three days before, he had secured a permit for the purchase of a revolver, but did not buy any. However, two days before the shooting he did buy a rifle and a box of shells with the intention, he said, of taking his own life.\nAt the trial for capital murder, the defence of insanity was specifically disclaimed by his counsel. However, two medical doctors testified that at the time of the shooting the appellant was suffering from a depressive psychosis resulting in \"impairment of ability to decide even inconsequential things, inability to make up a decision in a normal kind of way\". The trial judge, instead of leaving this medical evidence to the jury for their consideration, quoted from authorities to the effect that the testimony of experts is of slight weight.\nThe appellant was convicted of capital murder. In the Court of Appeal, all the judges were of opinion that there had been misdirection as to the weight to be given to the medical evidence on the appellant's state of mind at the time of the offence. The majority dismissed the appeal on the ground that there had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The dissenting judge would have substituted a verdict of non-capital murder. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: There was very strong evidence that the murder was planned, but the jury could not bring in a verdict of capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was also deliberate. The word \"deliberate\", as used in s. 202A(2)(a), means \"considered not impulsive\". It cannot simply mean \"intentional\" for that is the prerequisite for murder, and the subsection is creating an additional ingredient as a condition of capital murder. On the facts and the evidence as to what happened at the moment of the shooting, it was open to the jury to take the view that the act of the appellant was impulsive rather than considered and therefore was not deliberate. The medical evidence would have had a direct bearing on that question; its weight was a matter for the jury. The enactment of s. 202A(2)(a) has in no way affected the interpretation or application of s. 16 of the Code. The medical evidence was not relied on as raising the question whether the appellant was legally sane, but its importance was that it would assist the jury in deciding whether the shooting was deliberate. On this question of fact, the appellant was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury.\nThe probable result of the unwarranted disparagement of the medical evidence, which was relevant and admissible, was its withdrawal from the jury's serious consideration. On a charge of capital murder, based on an allegation that the killing was planned and deliberate, it was virtually a withdrawal of the whole defence. In these circumstances, it could not be held that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Since the case has never really been considered by the jury on evidence which should have been before it, the appellant was entitled to a new trial.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J., dissenting: It was uncontrovertible on the evidence that the murder was planned, i.e., \"arranged beforehand\", as found by the jury and the majority of the Court of Appeal. All that was done prior to and after the shooting was done in implementation of a plan. There was nothing in the evidence foreign to this plan, suggesting a sudden impulse to kill.\nOn the dictionary definition of the word \"deliberate\", it appears from both the English and French versions of s. 202A(2)(a) that the word qualifies the murder and that a time element is the material feature common to both the definition of \"planned\" and the definition of \"deliberate\". What Parliament intended was to exclude from the offence of capital murder a murder committed on the spur of the moment. There is nothing in the definition of either word which relates to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the arrangement made beforehand or of the predetermination to kill. Irrationality of either may suggest a degree of mental irresponsibility legally apt to relieve from legal responsibility. But that is a matter for s. 16 of the Code. The factual and opinion evidence does not show that the ability of the appellant to think, reason and decide was abolished but impaired. To accept the submission that such an impairment, short of insanity within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code, is a defence, would be tantamount to introducing in the Canadian law a new and secondary text of legal irresponsibility, which Parliament has deliberately refused to adopt. The language of the enactment is inapt to justify such a departure from the system of our criminal law as is contended for by the appellant. It follows that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulting from the direction given by the trial judge as to the weight of the expert medical evidence.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, affirming the appellant's conviction on a charge of capital murder. Appeal allowed, Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J. dissenting.\nJohn A. Scollin, for the appellant.\nG. E. Pilkey, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Fauteux J. was delivered by\nFauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant was indicted and tried for the capital murder of his wife on the 27th day of September 1962 at the City of Transcona in the Eastern Judicial District in the Province of Manitoba.\nThe case as presented to the jury by the Crown and the defence respectively may briefly be stated:\nThe theory of the Crown was that the accused loved his wife but having accumulated heavy debts, of which he had not fully informed her, he became worried and depressed and that, when threatened with legal action which would have disclosed his true financial position to her, he shot her and attempted to commit suicide; on the evidence, the killing of his wife was motivated, intended, planned and deliberate, thus amounting in law to a capital murder under ss. 201(a)(i) and 202A (2)(a) of the Criminal Code. In defence the accused, who admittedly killed his wife on the 27th day of September last, pleaded that at the time he was an automaton, devoid of will, not knowing what he was doing, and that the Crown had failed to prove that the homicide was planned and deliberate; according to expert medical evidence of two psychiatrists called by the defence, the accused was suffering from a diminution of his ability to think, reason, and decide at the time of the offence.\nThere is no evidence to support a defence of insanity under s. 16 of the Criminal Code and indeed after all the evidence had been adduced, such a defence was specifically disclaimed by counsel for the accused.\nThe jury, presided by Nitikman J., found the accused guilty as charged. Required under s. 642A\u2014of which the provisions are applicable in any case of an offence punishable by death\u2014to consider whether a recommendation that he should be granted clemency should be made, the jury so recommended.\nOn the appeal under s. 583 of the Code the verdict of the jury was upheld. The Court2 found that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the weight to be given to the psychiatric expert medical evidence called for by the defence. Miller C.J.M., Schultz, Monnin and Guy JJ.A. found that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred, and upheld the verdict of the jury. Freedman J.A. dissenting considered that the expert evidence was of major importance on the issue whether the murder was planned and deliberate and would have substituted to the verdict of capital murder a verdict of non-capital murder.\nPursuant to s. 597A(a) of the Code, appellant then appealed to this Court on one ground which, as formulated in his notice of appeal to this Court, reads:\nThe learned trial judge so misdirected the jury as to the weight to be attached to the medical evidence called by the defence that the (accused) appellant was not properly convicted of capital murder.\nInvolved in this ground of appeal are three matters to be considered. (i) Whether, upon the evidence it was open to the jury, not only to conclude as they and all the members of the Court of Appeal did, that the shooting of Mrs. More was intended\u2014thus constituting murder under s. 201(a)(i)\u2014but was also planned and deliberate, as they and the majority of the Court of Appeal found\u2014thus constituting capital murder under ss. 201(a)(i) and 202A (2)(a) of the Code; and in the affirmative, (ii) whether impairment of the ability to think, reason and decide, short of insanity within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code, is a defence to the offence charged; and, (iii) whether in the result there was any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThe complete and unchallenged review of the evidence appearing in the reasons for judgment of Schultz J.A. may be summarized as follows: On September 4, 1962, the accused, who had become a free lance photographer, secured part-time employment as a school bus driver, hoping that by undertaking to turn over his wages to Transcona Credit Union, his most urgently pressing creditor, he would avoid legal action being taken against him and his wife, co-signer for the debt. The Credit Union refused his proposal and through its solicitor advised him his wife's wages at Eaton's would be garnisheed on September 28 if the debt were not paid in full before that date. On September 24, which was four days before the deadline set by Credit Union and three days before that of the murder, the accused obtained a permit from the police to convey a revolver from a Sporting Supplies store to his residence. On September 25, shortly after 9:00 a.m. he asked for two days off from his school bus driving employment on the admittedly false pretext that he and his wife had to go east to bring back his father-in-law whom he falsely represented as having had a heart attack. Later the same morning, he went to the Sporting Supplies store to buy a revolver, representing again admittedly falsely, that he required it for use in connection with Sea Cadet activities. He left the store without making a purchase and went to the T. Eaton Company where he purchased a single shot 22 calibre rifle and a box of 50 cartridges. The rifle was taken home and kept there in the cellar without the knowledge of his wife. On September 27, at 6:00 a.m., according to his testimony, his wife while asleep was shot by him through the forehead, the rifle being held not more than 6 inches at the most from the head. Between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. he testified he wrote numerous documents hereafter referred to, which he left on the kitchen table. At 8:00 a.m., according to independent testimony, he telephoned his wife's employer that she would not be in to work that day as she was ill. At 10:00 a.m. he testified that his sister, Mrs. St. Jean, telephoned and asked him to drive her downtown, which he did, mentioning nothing to her on the occasion about the killing of his wife. He testified that around 4:00 p.m. he laid down beside his dead wife, shot himself through the head, and that expecting to die from his serious, though not fatal, wound he stayed lying in the bed. At 8:00 p.m. he telephoned a constable at the Transcona Police Station, identified himself and said:\nI shot my wife this morning and myself this afternoon, but I did not do a good job on myself, so I had better go to the hospital. Come to the side door.\nUpon the arrival of the police he volunteered:\nI shot her this morning, shot myself at about 4:00 o'clock, did not make a good job, financial problems; it is all there,\nand he pointed to the numerous documents lying on the kitchen table. On the way to the hospital in the police car, having been duly cautioned, he said:\nthe only thing I have to say is I have financial problems, and I was going to do away with both of us, that is all.\n'The following day in the hospital and again after being cautioned he declared to the police officers:\nI had some financial problems. It was worrying my wife so much. She was a very nervous type of person. Anything like this would upset her. Actually I had a choice of doing one of two things, either going to personal bankruptcy which would probably upset her so much that it would upset her happiness or doing what I did by trying to take both our lives. That's all there is to it.\nHe testified that when he made the last two statements he was under the impression that he was going to die and trying to be truthful and not hide anything.\nThe substance of the documents written and left by appellant on the kitchen table or mailed by him when he left his home to drive his sister downtown tallies with these voluntary declarations made to the police immediately after the event. The documents also indicate his debts in great detail, the location of his insurance policies and those of his wife, and contained the disposition to be made of his estate. A letter written and mailed to a close friend reads in part:\nPlease read the following very carefully before you do anything.\nI shot Marge early this morning & am now going to do away with myself. Please get Joe Teres Transcona Chief of Police & tell him to come to the house 330 Harvard Ave. W. & here is the key to the side door. Do not come in with him because it is a horrible sight to see, I know because I know what Marge is like & I just hope I have the courage to finish what I have started. We are both in the back bedroom \u2026\nI hope this will do some good some where, & I really don't feel too badly, because Marge & I have had a good life together even if it has been shortened by this act. I'll close now as I must join Marge & I hope to 'Go with God'.\nIn a three-page note to Mrs. St. Jean, her husband and family, he wrote:\nI am sorry to do this, but as far as I can see it is my only way out.\nMarge is so upset and worried lately that it is hurting me deeply. Marge and I love each other very deeply & have had a real good & happy life together & in one way I think I am doing the right & best thing.\nPlease try & not feel too bad about us, because at least we are still together & if there is another world beyond this one I hope Marge & I have as much happiness there as what we have had here on earth.\n* * *\nWell I guess that's it for now. Once again please don't feel badly about us, as we have always been happy together & we will still have our happiness as we are still together.\nIn a further note to Mrs. St. Jean, admittedly written after he had driven her to work, he wrote in part:\n\u2026 When you get the insurance money be sure to straighten out your affairs & do as I asked this morning if you don't have cash for it don't buy it. I just wish I had taken my own advice & this would not be necessary.\nPlease try and find happiness instead of sadness over this, as I'm sure Marge & I will be happy together in the future as we have been in the past \u2026\nI know it's easy to say, but please don't feel badly about us and enjoy your lives as much as Marge & I have.\nWhile on his evidence all the documents were written on the morning of the 27th, after the shooting of his wife, many bear a prior date. At trial he said he back-dated these particular documents, this to overcome any possible suggestion that he might not have been sound of mind when they were written which would cause them to be ineffectual. Two such documents are significant. The first is dated the day before the murder; it is headed \"Last Will and Testament of John P. T. More\", of which the opening words are \"Being of sound mind at the time of writing this, I hereby declare this to be my last will and testament\". The second is dated the 24th, to wit the day he obtained the permit from the police to carry a revolver to his residence; it lists 14 items of expensive photographic equipment and provides for their return partly to a creditor and the balance, not to his wife but to Mrs. St. Jean. Shown this last exhibit at trial, he could give no explanation why it was dated September 24.\nSubject to the consideration of matters raised for the appellant, on this evidence it was manifestly open to the jury to conclude that the killing of Mrs. More was intended, planned and deliberate.\nThat it was intended was found by the jury and all the members of the Court of Appeal. It was also, by necessary implication if not expressly, admitted by appellant who did ask this Court to reduce the verdict of capital murder to one of murder simpliciter. The defence of automatism was rejected by the jury which disbelieved the evidence of the appellant at trial as to what occurred at the moment of the discharge of the rifle. This defence was abandoned in this Court.\nThat the murder was planned, i.e., \"arranged beforehand\"\u2014cf. the Shorter Oxford Dictionary\u2014as found by the jury and the majority of the Court of Appeal is, in my respectful view, uncontrovertible on the above evidence accepted by the jury. There was a plan and one plan only; and all that was done by the appellant, prior to and after the shooting of his wife, was done in implementation of this plan. With deference to my brother Cartwright, I find no evidence, of anything foreign to this plan, suggesting that the accused was suddenly impelled to kill his wife at the moment of the discharge of the rifle. Obviously the jury, having rejected the evidence as to what occurred at the time of the discharge of the rifle, could not rely on or infer from the same evidence impulsivity intervening at that particular moment.\nFrom appellant's factum and the oral argument, the grievance as to the direction of the trial judge with respect to the weight to be attached to expert medical evidence is rather fundamentally related by him to the question whether the murder was deliberate within the meaning he gives to this word under the provisions of s. 202A (2)(a). To dispose of the merits of this appeal, this Court, in my respectful view, must unavoidably determine the meaning of the word \"deliberate\" under these provisions of the Criminal Code and their legal effect in the case. In the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, the word is thus defined:\nDeliberate: well weighed or considered, carefully thought out, done of set purpose, studied, not hasty or rash. Of persons: characterized by deliberation, considered carefully, leisurely, slow, not hurried.\nThe first part of the definition is related to an action; the second part is related to a person. Under the provisions of the section the word \"deliberate\" qualifies not the person charged but his action, i.e. the murder. In the French version of these provisions, the expression \"de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9\" stands for the word \"deliberate\", and, according to the Larousse XXe si\u00e8cle, means \"\u00e0 dessein\u2014de parti pris\u2014de dessein form\u00e9, arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avance\". In Harrap's Standard French and English Dictionary, the expression \"of set purpose\" is translated \"de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, de parti pris\". In the same dictionary, the word \"predetermination\" is translated \"d\u00e9termination prise d'avance; dessein arr\u00eat\u00e9\".\nThus it appears from both the English and French versions, which in the consideration of a federal statute must be read together, Composers, Authors and Publishers of Canada Ltd. v. Western Fair Association3, that a time element is the material feature common to both the definition of the word \"planned\" and the definition of the word \"deliberate\". This feature was not a constitutive element of murder under the state of the law as it was prior to the enactment of s. 202A (2)(a). All of which reasonably indicates that what Parliament intended, by adding it as such, was to exclude from the offence, henceforth categorized as capital murder, a murder committed on the spur of the moment. There is nothing in the definition of either of the words \"planned and deliberate\" which relates to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the arrangement made beforehand or of the predetermination to kill. If, in the context of the relevant part of ss. 201(a)(i) and 202A (2)(a), from which stems the definition of capital murder, the words \"planned\" and \"deliberate\" were held to imply reasonableness, what type of planned and deliberate murder could be held by a jury to be reasonable and when would these provisions have any application, I am unable to say. Irrationality of either, if appearing in a given case, may suggest a degree of mental irresponsibility legally apt to relieve from legal responsibility. The policy of the law in this respect is not stated in s. 202A (2)(a) but in s. 16 of the Code, which appearing in Part 1 of the Code is all-embracing with respect to the question of insanity in criminal matters. Of course it is for the prosecution to show and for the jury to say whether it is shown by the evidence that the offence charged is intended, planned and deliberate. The mental capacity to commit this as well as any other offence is another matter altogether. For it is a matter of defence to displace the presumption created in the imperative terms of s. 16(4)\u2014\"Everyone shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane\". This presumption cannot be displaced by factual or opinion evidence unless such evidence meets the test of legal irresponsibility set forth in s. 16(2), (3). The factual and opinion evidence in this case does not show that the ability of the appellant to think, reason and decide was abolished but impaired. The evidence does not meet the legal test; on the contrary Dr. Adamson affirms that the accused was capable of appreciating his unlawful acts and added that he could not convince himself that the accused did not know the difference between right and wrong at the time of the offence.\nAcceptance of appellant's submission that mental defect or disease not sufficient to render an accused legally irresponsible under s. 16 of the Code may nevertheless operate to reduce the degree of the crime charged is tantamount to introducing in the Canadian law a new and secondary test of legal irresponsibility as was done in England prior to the enactment of the provisions of s. 202A (2)(a) by the Homicide Act 1957, 5 & 6 Eliz. 2, c. 11, of which s. 2(1) and (2) read:\n2. (1) Where a person kills or is a party to the killing of another, he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.\n(2) On a charge of murder, it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged is by virtue of this section not liable to be convicted of murder. Undoubtedly aware of these provisions, the Canadian Parliament deliberately refused to adopt them. If the appellant's submission is accepted, it follows that the Canadian Parliament has adopted rather obliquely a policy more generous than that of the English law. Contrary to what is the case in England, the prosecution in Canada would further have the burden of proving, as a constitutive element of the offence of capital murder, not only that the accused is mentally sane within the meaning of s. 16, but also that his mental responsibility is not affected to a lesser degree for which no legal standard is given. Again on appellant's submission there are two different tests of legal irresponsibility with respect to the offence of capital murder. The first being with respect to intent is defined in s. 16; the other being with respect to planning and deliberation is left to the arbitrament of the jury to define in each case. I am unable to read the section as implying such substantial innovations and changes in our Criminal Law.\nIn the United States, the tests of irresponsibility of the various jurisdictions, in cases involving insanity as a defence to crime, are reviewed in Weihofen, Mental Disorder As A Criminal Defence, at pages 129 et seq. In most of the jurisdictions, it appears that where the law of the State includes specific intent, deliberation or premeditation as constitutive elements of a murder of first degree, it is held that insanity, not sufficient to require an acquittal, may not be shown to negative intent, deliberation or premeditation, and so reduce the crime to murder in second degree.\nThere is a presumption against implicit alteration of the law and one of these is that the Legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares. It is in the last degree improbable that the Legislature would overthrow fundamental principles or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 9th ed., pp. 85 et seq.). In my view, the language of the enactment\u2014which on the above meaning of the words \"planned and deliberate\" is truly related to a time element\u2014is inapt to justify such a departure from the system of our Criminal Law as is contended for by appellant. On that view of the law, impairment of mental capacity short of insanity was not a defence to the crime charged. It follows that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulting from the direction given by the trial judge as to the weight of the expert medical evidence. For while relevant to a defence of insanity\u2014to negative intent or that the murder was planned and deliberate\u2014, in this particular case the evidence adduced was admittedly short of showing insanity to the degree required by law to relieve from legal responsibility. And, again, insanity as a defence was specifically disclaimed. To the extent that it could be relevant to the consideration of a recommendation that the accused should be granted clemency, there was no prejudice, for such a recommendation was made.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and wish to add only a few words on one aspect of the matter.\nIt does not appear to have been argued by counsel for the Crown at any stage of the proceedings that the evidence of Dr. Adamson and of Dr. Thomson was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was guilty of capital murder; and all of the learned judges in the courts below have proceeded on the view that it was relevant. In my opinion they were clearly right in so doing.\nIn the circumstances of this case, the defence of insanity having been expressly disclaimed, there were really only two questions for the jury. The first was whether the appellant meant to cause the death of his wife; if this was answered in the affirmative he was guilty of murder. The second, which arises under s. 202A (2)(a) of the Criminal Code, was whether this murder was planned and deliberate on his part; if this was answered in the affirmative he was guilty of capital murder.\nThe evidence that the murder was planned was very strong, but, as was properly pointed out to the jury by the learned trial judge, they could not find the accused guilty of capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the murder was planned but also that it was deliberate. The learned trial judge also rightly-instructed the jury that the word \"deliberate\", as used in s. 202A (2)(a), means \"considered not impulsive\".\nOther meanings of the adjective given in the Oxford Dictionary are \"not hasty in decision\", \"slow in deciding\" and \"intentional\". The word as used in the subsection cannot have simply the meaning \"intentional\" because it is only if the accused's act was intentional that he can be guilty of murder and the subsection is creating an additional ingredient to be proved as a condition of an accused being convicted of capital murder.\nThe recital of the facts and the evidence of the appellant as to what occurred at the moment of the discharge of the rifle, set out in the reasons of my brother Judson, show that it was open to the jury to take the view that the act of the appellant in pulling the trigger was impulsive rather than considered and therefore was not deliberate. The evidence of the two doctors and particularly that of Dr. Adamson, also quoted by my brother Judson, that, in his opinion, at the critical moment the appellant was suffering from a depressive psychosis resulting in \"impairment of ability to decide even inconsequential things, inability to make a decision in a normal kind of a way\" would have a direct bearing on the question whether the appellant's act was deliberate in the sense defined above; its weight was a matter for the jury.\nI wish to emphasize that all that I have said above is related to the peculiar facts of this particular case.\nSince writing the above, I have had an opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Fauteux and I wish to make it clear that in my opinion the enactment of s. 202A (2)(a) of the Criminal Code has in no way affected the interpretation or application of s. 16. The evidence of the two doctors is not relied on by the defence as raising the question whether the accused was legally sane. Its importance is that it would assist the jury in deciding the question whether the accused's action in pulling the trigger, which so far as this branch of the matter is concerned was admittedly the intentional act of a sane man, was also his deliberate act. This question is one of fact and its solution involves an inquiry as to the thinking of the accused at the moment of acting. If the jury accepted the evidence of the doctors it, in conjunction with the accused's own evidence, might well cause them to regard it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse rather than by consideration. On this question the accused was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Judson.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The Manitoba Court of Appeal4, with Freedman J.A. dissenting, has affirmed the conviction of the appellant on a charge of capital murder. His appeal asks this Court to set aside the verdict of guilty of capital murder and substitute a verdict of guilty of non-capital murder, or, in the alternative, to quash the conviction and order a new trial.\nThe issue in the appeal is sharply defined in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal. All the judges were of the opinion that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury on the weight to be given to the medical evidence called by the defence on the appellant's state of mind at the time of the offence. The majority considered that the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code applied and that there had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice despite the wrong decision of the learned trial judge on a question of law. Freedman J.A., dissenting, held that the appellant was not properly convicted of capital murder but should have been convicted of non-capital murder and would have substituted the latter verdict under s. 592(3) of the Criminal Code. The issue therefore is whether the majority of the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThe accused shot his wife through the head while she was asleep about 5 o'clock on the morning of September 27, 1962. He then wrote a number of letters explaining why he had done it. He concealed his crime during the day and during the afternoon he attempted suicide by shooting himself through the head. Although seriously wounded, he did not die and at 8 o'clock in the evening of September 27, he telephoned the police to tell them what he had done.\nThere is no history of matrimonial discord in this family, either remote or immediate. The accused married his wife in 1942 and the evidence indicates that they lived together happily. From 1942 to 1945 the accused served in the Navy. On his return to civilian life he completed his apprenticeship as an upholsterer and worked at this trade for 12 years in the employment of the Canadian National Railways. He left this employment to start his own business as a photographer. In this he was unsuccessful. He accumulated many debts; he was being hard-pressed by his creditors at the time of the crime; and there is no doubt that he was suffering from some mental disturbance that caused him to do what he did.\nOn September 24 he had secured a permit for the purchase of a revolver. He made some enquiries at a shop about the purchase but did not go through with it. At that time he gave a false reason for his interest in a revolver. On September 25 he bought a rifle and a box of shells with the intention, he said, of taking his own life because of worry about his financial problems and the effect upon his wife of their impending discovery.\nHe was up twice during the night of September 27 thinking about his troubles while his wife was sleeping. He said that the second time he got up was about 5 a.m. and that he sat around smoking and thinking. He gave his description of the shooting in the following words:\nFrom there the only next thing I can remember is standing by the bed with the rifle in my hand and hearing it go off.\nHe also said that immediately before the rifle was discharged he was thinking\nwhat my wife and I had here on earth and what it would be like in a better world ahead, Heaven \u2026 I thought what a better place it would be, that we would not need to think of money problems or anything like that.\nThe letters that he wrote after the shooting of his wife indicated the same kind of mental disturbance. Dr. Gilbert L. Adamson, who had been practising in the field of neurology and psychiatry in Winnipeg since 1931, and who had recently retired as Associate Professor of Medicine in the University of Manitoba, gave the following opinion about the mental condition of the accused at the time of the killing:\nI formed the opinion that on the 27th day of September 1962 he was suffering from an abnormal state of mind, which is referred to as a depressive psychosis, in which the symptoms are severe depression, hopelessness, inability to sleep, loss of appetite, loss of weight, and impairment of volition\u2014that is to say, impairment of ability to decide even inconsequential things, inability to make up a decision in a normal kind of a way. In this state, a person is so hopeless, their feelings are so hopeless, that their judgment becomes distorted, and their thinking confused.\nDr. Ian Blake Thomson, Assistant Medical Superintendent of the Psychiatric Institute in Winnipeg and a lecturer in psychiatry at the University of Manitoba, expressed the following opinion:\n\u2026 I formed the opinion that he had during the course of last year \u2026 suffered from symptoms of depression, and that towards the end of the period in question\u2014that is, in September of last year, during the month of September\u2014his condition deteriorated very markedly, so that the depression deepened and became a severe depression with great feelings of despair and despondency and hopelessness; and he suffered from brooding preoccupation which interfered with his ability to work, to reason, to think, and that at the time of the alleged offence, this condition very probably was one which in medical terms is called a \"psychosis\", which is a major mental illness.\nThis is very important and highly relevant evidence given by men of eminence in their profession. The learned trial judge instead of leaving it to the jury for the consideration to which it was entitled, quoted from Phipson on Evidence, Taylor on Evidence and Lord Campbell, to the effect that the testimony of experts is of slight weight.\nFrom Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 403, he quoted:\nThe testimony of experts is often considered to be of slight value, since they are proverbially, though perhaps unwittingly, biased in favour of the side which calls them, as well as over-ready to regard harmless facts as confirmation of preconceived theories \u2026\nFrom Taylor on Evidence, 12th ed., p. 59, he quoted:\nPerhaps the testimony which least deserves credit with a jury is that of skilled witnesses \u2026 it is often quite surprising to see with what facility, and to what an extent, their views can be made to correspond with the wishes or the interests of the parties who call them. From Lord Campbell's judgment in the Tracy Peerage case5, he quoted:\nSkilled witnesses come with such a bias on their minds to support the cause in which they are embarked that hardly any weight should be given to their evidence.\nI agree with Freedman J.A. that as generalizations, these statements are bad. They could, moreover, have no possible application to the evidence given in this case. All the judges in the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the medical evidence was relevant and admissible and that there was error in the judge's instruction. In the context in which this instruction was given, the only possible reference is to the evidence of Dr. Adamson and Dr. Thomson and the probable result of this unwarranted disparagement of their evidence was its withdrawal from the jury's serious consideration. On a charge of capital murder, based on an allegation that the killing was planned and deliberate, it was virtually a withdrawal of the whole defence.\nI agree with Freedman J.A. that in these circumstances the Court cannot hold that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. I would, however, not substitute a verdict of non-capital murder. This case has never really been considered by the jury on evidence which should have been before it.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction of capital murder and direct a new trial.\nSince writing these reasons, I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Cartwright and I agree with them.\nAppeal allowed and new trial directed, Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pitblado, Hoskin & Company, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Attorney-General for Manitoba.\n1 (1963), 43 W.W.R. 30.\n2 (1963), 43 W.W.R. 30.\n3 [1951] S.C.R. 596, 12 Fox Pat.

Count 1 related to a conspiracy to commit an indictable offence by giving money to a peace officer with intent that the said officer should interfere with the administration of justice. This count was tried separately. All three were acquitted and the Crown\u2019s appeal was abandoned.\nCount 2 related to a conspiracy to effect the unlawful purpose of obtaining from the same peace officer information which it was his duty not to divulge. Counts 3, 4 and 5 related only to W and charged him with paying money to the peace officer with intent that the latter should interfere with the administration of justice. Count 6 related to the keeping of a common gaming house by F and M, to which they pleaded guilty at a later trial.\nAt the second trial, the conspiracy under count 2 was tried as well as the substantive offences against W under counts 3, 4 and 5. The special plea of autrefois acquit and the defence of res judicata were raised not only against count 2 but also by W against the substantive offences. On the conspiracy charge, the trial judge held against the appellants on the plea of autrefois acquit, also that the defence of res judicata did not arise and declined to submit it to the jury. The jury convicted. However, on the three counts against W, the judge gave effect to the defence of res judicata and directed the jury to acquit. The appellants appealed against the conspiracy conviction and the Crown appealed against W\u2019s acquittal. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction on count 2 and ordered a new trial for W on counts 3, 4 and 5. The appellants were granted leave to appeal to this Court on count 2 and W appealed as of right from the order setting aside his acquittal.\nHeld (Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal against the conviction on count 2 should be dismissed as well as the appeal of W against a new trial on counts 3, 4 and 5.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson JJ.: The Court of appeal was right in rejecting the plea of autrefois acquit and in finding that the trial judge was correct in his ruling under s. 518 of the Criminal Code. The conspiracies charged in count 1 and in count 2 were not substantially identical. Count 1 involved not only the payment of money but required proof of the intent that the officer should interfere with the administration of justice. On the other hand, count 2 did not involve as an element the payment of money with the intent mentioned in s. 101(a) but charged the appellants with having conspired for an object which did not necessarily involve an intent that the officer should interfere with the administration of justice.\nThe trial judge was right in ruling that there was nothing to submit to the jury on the defence of res judicata in respect of count 2. An acquittal on a charge of conspiracy does not pronounce against every part of it. There was no issue on which it could be said that the Crown was estopped in the second trial. The two counts charged two conspiracies with different component elements, and it was impossible to say that the substantial basic facts common to both counts had been determined in favour of the appellants in the first trial.\nAs to counts 3, 4 and 5 relating to W, the Court of Appeal was right in ordering a new trial. The verdict at the first trial acquitted W of nothing more than his participation in the conspiracy charged on count 1 and did not of necessity involve a finding that he did not commit the substantive offence against s. 101(b) charged in those counts.\nPer Cartwright and Hall JJ., dissenting: The plea of autrefois acquit was not available to the appellants at the trial on count 2. On their trial on count 1 the appellants could not have been convicted on count 2.\nIt is for the judge to decide as a matter of law whether the defence of res judicata has been made out, and, therefore, the trial judge was right in refusing to admit as an exhibit to go to the jury the complete record of the first trial.\nThe trial judge should have held that the defence of res judicata had been established at the trial on count 2. The Crown was now estopped from questioning that which was (in fact and law) the ratio of and fundamental to the decision in the first trial. Although the two counts differed in language and in their essential elements, in reality they dealt with the same offence. There was only one conspiracy\u2014if there was a conspiracy. The conspirators were not interested in just getting information or in just having the officer give information unlawfully, they wanted the information so as to be forewarned of the impending raids on their gambling clubs. Everything that could be considered unlawful under count 2 was part and parcel of the agreement under count 1. Only one agreement was in evidence and it could not be severed arbitrarily at some point by the Crown so as to create the illusion of two offences from what was in fact only one.\nThe Crown was not estopped by W\u2019s acquittal under count 1 from proceeding to try him for the substantive offences under counts 3, 4 and 5. McDonald v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 186, referred to. However, his acquittal under count 1 negatived the essentially criminal element of these substantive offences\u2014the intent that the officer should interfere with the administration of justice. It would not now be open to the jury to find that the money which W admitted having given was given with that intent. W\u2019s acquittal should be restored.\nAPPEALS by the three appellants from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming their conviction on a conspiracy charge and setting aside a verdict of acquittal in the case of W on charges of corruption.

ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT B. FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario, did unlawfully agree and conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott, a Peace Officer of the Ontario Provincial Police, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(1) (d).\nThe Crown abandoned an appeal against the acquittal and in March 1962, the three appellants were tried before Donnelly J. and a jury on the second count in the indictment, which was:\n2. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario, did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit, to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(2).\nThe judge held against the accused on a special plea of autrefois acquit and they then entered a plea of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d and offered the alternative defence of res judicata. The judge held that this defence did not arise and declined to submit it to the jury. The jury convicted and the conviction was sustained by a unanimous judgment in the Court of Appeal[2]. I adopt in their entirety the reasons of the Court of Appeal in rejecting the defence of autrefois acquit, and their finding that the learned trial judge was correct in his ruling under s. 518 of the Criminal Code. The matter is summarized by Schroeder J.A. in the following paragraph:\nThe conspiracy alleged in count 1 involved not only the payment of money to Constable Scott, but an essential ingredient of the offence was the intent of the alleged conspirators that George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice. Count 2, on the other hand, accuses the appellants of having entered into an entirely different kind of conspiracy. It does not involve as an element the payment of money corruptly to Scott or to any other person with the intent mentioned in s. 101 (a) (iv) but its object or purpose was stated simply to be the obtainment from Constable Scott of information which it was his duty not to divulge. It was established at the trial that the provisions of the Police Act, now R.S.O. 1960, c. 298 and the Regulations passed pursuant thereto prohibited a police officer from disclosing such information to anyone, but the procurement of that breach of duty did not necessarily involve an intent on the part of the procurers that the police officer should interfere with the administration of justice. Count 2 simply charges the commission of the common law offence of \u201cconspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose.\u201d The intent with which the parties are alleged to have entered into the conspiracy charged in count 1, namely, that he (Scott) should interfere with the administration of justice, is not an ingredient of the offence charged in count 2, and its absence is a significant point of distinction between the two offences. They are not substantially indentical or practically the same, and on that ground alone the defence based on the special plea of autrefois acquit cannot prevail.\nOn the defence of res judicata the trial judge treated the case as one in which there was no evidence to go to the jury that the first trial had determined in favour of the accused an issue or issues which would determine the second trial in their favour. But the defence says that the facts proved at both trials were the same or substantially the same, the conspirators were the same, the payments of money were the same and the person to whom the payments were made was the same person in each count. The defence argues from this that all the issues in count 2 have been litigated in favour of the accused by their acquittal on count 1, and that the case should have been submitted to the jury on this basis with an appropriate direction from the trial judge. The argument is supported by reference to the defence put forward at the first trial where everything was admitted in the presentation to the jury except the corrupt intent.\nThe weakness in this submission is in trying to read too much into the verdict of not guilty on count 1 where the two counts charge conspiracy. At the first trial, the jury found that the proven facts did not amount to the conspiracy charged. At the second trial, the jury found that the same or substantially identical facts did amount to the, conspiracy charged in count 2. An acquittal on a charge of conspiracy does not pronounce against every part of it. On what issue is there an estoppel against the Crown? Is it on the agreement or the corruptly giving or the intent in count 1? All that a judge or a jury, if it becomes fit matter for submission to a jury at the second trial, can determine is that the evidence fell short of warranting a conviction on the precise charge. There is no issue on which it can be said that the Crown is estopped in the second trial. This distinguishes the defence of res judicata in this case from the comparatively simple examples of its application in cases where there is an estoppel on issues such as identity of the accused (The King v. Quinn[3]); possession (Sambasivam v. The Public Prosecutor[4]), responsibility for the death of two persons as a result of the same catastrophe, where an acquittal on a charge of manslaughter of A must result in an acquittal on the same charge for the death of B, the whole matter having been litigated, adversely to the prosecution in the first trial (R. v. Sweetman[5]; Gill v. The Queen[6]).\nThese simplicities do not arise when the two counts charge two conspiracies with different component elements. It is impossible in the present case to say that the substantial basic facts common to both counts have been determined in favour of the accused in the first trial. The trial judge was right in his ruling that there was nothing to submit to the jury on this defence and I agree with the reasons of the Court of Appeal in affirming his ruling.\nCounts 3, 4 and 5 in the indictment relate only to the appellant Wright. Count 3 reads:\n3. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on or about the 29th day of February, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $400.00 in money with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 101(b). Counts 4 and 5 are in the same terms but refer to payments on subsequent dates.\nOn these counts, at the second trial, the learned trial judge did give effect to the defence of res judicata and directed an acquittal. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal against this acquittal and it was there held that there was error in law in giving this direction. The Court of Appeal set aside the order of acquittal on these counts and directed that there should be a new trial. I would affirm the order of the Court of Appeal on this aspect of the appeal for the reasons given by them, namely, that the verdict at the first trial acquitted Wright of nothing more than his participation in the conspiracy charged in count 1 and did not of necessity involve a finding that he did not commit the substantive offence against s. 101(b) charged in counts 3, 4 and 5.\nThe result is that the appeal of the three appellants against their conviction on count 2 is dismissed and the appeal of the appellant Wright against the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial on counts 3, 4 and 5 is also dismissed.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusions of my brother Hall and wish to add only a few words.\nIn my respectful view the Court of Appeal[7] erred in considering and comparing the wording of the several counts in the indictment without making a sufficiently careful examination of the evidence adduced and the directions given by the presiding judge at each of the trials. The extracts from the transcripts of the proceedings in the two trials set out in the reasons of my brother Hall appear to me to make plain, what becomes, if possible, even more plain on an examination of the complete records, that in the trial on count 2 the jury were invited to pass upon the very same issue of fact as had already been decided in favour of the appellants by the jury at the trial of count 1.\nThe following words of Douglas J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Sealfon v. U.S.[8] appear to me to be in accordance with our law and applicable to the circumstances of the case at bar:\nIt has long been recognized that the commission of the substantive offence and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct offences, thus with some exceptions, one may be prosecuted for both crimes. But res judicata may be a defence in a second prosecution. That doctrine applies to criminal as well as civil proceedings and operates to conclude those matters in issue which the verdict determined though the offences be different.\nThus the only question in the case is whether the jury\u2019s verdict in the conspiracy trial was a determination favorable to petitioner of the facts essential to conviction of the substantive offence. This depends upon the facts adduced at each trial and the instructions under which the jury arrived at its verdict at the first trial.\nRespondent argues that the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict cannot be known with certainty.\n* * *\nThe instructions under which the verdict was rendered, however, must be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings. We look to them only for such light as they shed on the issues determined by the verdict.\n* * *\nSo interpreted the earlier verdict precludes a later conviction of the substantive offence. The basic facts in each trial were identical.\n* * *\nIt was a second attempt to prove the agreement which at each trial was crucial to the prosecution\u2019s case and which was necessarily adjudicated in the former trial to be non\u2011existent. That the prosecution may not do.\nWith the greatest respect for those who hold a contrary view, after an anxious perusal of the records in the two trials I see no escape from the conclusion that the trial before Donnelly J. was a second attempt by the Crown to prove the agreement which was necessarily adjudicated in the trial before Spence J. to be non-existent. I am in complete agreement with the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States from which I have quoted above that this the prosecution may not do.\nIn The Queen v. King[9], Hawkins J., with the concurrence of Cave, Grantham, Lawrance and Wright JJ., stated, not as a new rule but as one which was long established, that \u201cit is against the very first principles of the criminal law that a man should be placed twice in jeopardy upon the same facts\u201d. I am unable to see how the judgment appealed from can be upheld without a violation of those first principles. I would dispose of the appeals as proposed by my brother Hall.\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014On May 29, 1961, the appellants came before Spence J. and a jury on an indictment as follows:\n1. ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT B. FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(1) (d).\n2. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY between the first day of January, 1960 and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit: to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(2).\n3. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on or about the 29th day of February, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $400.00 in money with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 101(b).\n4. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on or about the 29th day of March, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $200.00 in money with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 101(b).\n5. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on or about the 27th day of April, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George Scott a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $400.00 in money with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 101 (b).\n6. AND FURTHER THAT the said JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY at the Township of Toronto in the County of Peel during the month of May, 1960, and previously, did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common gaming house at the premises situate and known as 2165 Centre Road South in the Township of Toronto in the County of Peel, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 176(1).\nThe Crown elected to proceed with the trial of count 1 only. After a trial which lasted nine days, the jury found the appellants not guilty. An appeal from that verdict was taken by the Crown but later abandoned, so the acquittal on count 1 stands.\nThen on March 12, 1962, the appellants came before Donnelly J. and a jury to be tried on counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\nWhen called upon to plead to count 2, Wright, by his counsel, Mr. O\u2019Driscoll, entered a special plea pursuant to s. 516 of the Code as follows:\nI have a special plea for the accused Wright. Having heard the said indictment read here in Court, the said Robert J. Wright saith that our said Lady the Queen ought not further to prosecute the said Indictment against him, the said Robert J. Wright, because he saith that, heretofore, to wit, on the 9th day of June, 1961, in the Supreme Court of Ontario, in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, before the Honourable Mr. Justice Spence and a Jury, he, the said Robert J. Wright, was lawfully acquitted of the said offence charged in the said Indictment.\nWherefore he, the said Robert J. Wright, prays Judgment and that he may be discharged from the said premises in the said Indictment specified.\nbeing a plea of autrefois acquit.\nMcDermott by his counsel Mr. Brooke entered the same special plea.\nFeeley followed the same course by his counsel Mr. Sedgwick.\nMr. Milligan for the Crown replied as follows:\nIn reply thereto and hereupon I, R.P. Milligan, Crown Counsel who prosecutes for our said Lady the Queen in this behalf, says that by reason of anything in the said plea of the said all three accused above pleaded in bar alleged, our said The Lady, The Queen, ought not to be precluded from prosecuting the said indictment against the said three accused; because she says that the said three accused were not lawfully acquitted of the said offence charged in the said indictment, in manner and form as the said three accused hath above in their said plea alleged; and this he, the said R.P. Milligan prays may be inquired of by the country.\nThe issues of these special plea of autrefois acquit were fully argued by counsel for the accused and counsel for the Crown. Intertwined in the autrefois acquit argument were submissions that the plea of res judicata was also available and that it was being put forward on behalf of the three appellants.\nDonnelly J. gave judgment on the special plea as follows:\nThe three accused rely on a special plea of autrefois acquit. Section 517 of the Code requires that I decide this issue. The three accused were before this Court in May and June, 1961, on the first count in the indictment at which time the jury acquitted all three on the charge on which they were then before the Court.\nIt is now agreed that there will be no new evidence offered if the trial proceeds on the second count. If there was any change in the evidence it will simply be that the Crown will not offer all the evidence which was adduced before. Section 518 of the Code provides that where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit to a count is tried and it appears that the matter on which the accused was given in charge of the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in charge, and that on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been made that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of autrefois acquit is pleaded judgment shall be given discharging the accused in respect of that count.\nIn considering the matter. I must keep in mind the statement of Crown counsel that no new evidence will be offered on the second count. The test is not the similarity of the evidence or the facts in the particular case. The question is whether the charges are identical, or substantially identical. It then remains to consider whether the charges under Count 1 and Count 2 are substantially identical. By Count 1 the accused were charged that they conspired together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to Section 408(1) (d). The second count charges that the accused did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit, to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, information which it was his duty not to divulge contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(2).\nOn behalf of the accused it is urged that the jury having rendered a verdict of not guilty they found that the accused did not conspire together. People, when conspiring, may conspire to do one or more unlawful acts. It does not follow that because the jury found the accused not guilty on a charge of conspiring to do a specific unlawful act that the jury found the accused did not conspire to do any unlawful act.\nOn the first trial the jury was instructed that the essential elements of the offence were, firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly; secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of justice. It is clear that these are the elements of the offence charged in the first count. In order to establish the offence charged in the second count it is not necessary for the Crown to prove any agreement to give or pay money to Scott corruptly. Section 101 makes it an essential part of the offence that the person committing the offence intend that the party offered or receiving the money interfere with the administration of justice. No such intent is required under Section 482. It was argued by counsel for Feeley that Count 1 could have been drawn in such a way that it would have included the second count. If this had been done it is my opinion that the count would be bad for duplicity. I find that the offence charged in the second count is not an offence included in the first count and that it would not have been possible on the former trial, no matter what amendment had been made, to have convicted the accused of the offence charged in the second count.\nIt is well established that a person must not be placed in peril of being convicted twice for the same offence. Here the offences are not the same or substantially the same. The result is that the accused are not being asked to stand trial a second time for the same offence notwithstanding that the evidence will be the same as on the former trial.\nThe accused have failed to establish that the offence charged in the second count is substantially the same as that charged in the first count, or one on which they could have been convicted at. the first trial and the plea of autrefois acquit fails.\nWill you have the prisoners plead, please.\nAnd as to res judicata the record is as follows:\nHIS LORDSHIP: Before leaving the matter I should deal with the question of res judicata. I am of the opinion that this is a defence included in a plea of not guilty and should not be dealt with by me at this time.\nMr. SEDGWICK: SO long as that is clear, that in pleading not guilty res judicata is pleaded as being an included plea.\nHIS LORDSHIP: That is my view.\nMr. SEDGWICK: It is not provided for as an included plea. I intend to stress that as part of the defence.\nHIS LORDSHIP: As far as I am concerned you are free to raise it as part of your plea of not guilty.\nFollowing this counsel for the appellants applied to have count 2 tried separately from counts 3, 4, 5 and 6. Donnelly J. directed the Crown to proceed with count 2 only and the trial proceeded on that basis after pleas of Not Guilty had been directed to be entered by Donnelly J. following similar statements by all three appellants that \u201cI enter no plea at this time.\u201d\nFollowing the selection of a jury the record of the trial before Spence J. was tendered. Donnelly J. dealt with the matter as follows:\nHIS LORDSHIP: I am not going to permit the filing of the evidence. If you wish to file it with the Court I am content that it be filed, but I do not propose to permit these books of evidence or any documents which you have asked to file\u2014I do not propose to permit them to go to the jury. If you wish to file them with the Court for the use of counsel I am content that they be filed for that purpose, but for that purpose only.\nBut the record was not then filed.\nMr. Milligan opened for the Crown. In view of the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants, it is desirable to quote rather fully from Mr. Milligan\u2019s opening statement. He said in part:\nMr. MILLIGAN: Gentlemen of the jury, simply put the offence is this, that the three accused agreed and conspired together to obtain information from a police officer which that constable was not at liberty to give them.\nNow, gentlemen, the Crown alleges that the accused McDermott and Feeley were gamblers, that they are interested in two clubs\u2014chartered clubs where gambling was allowed, that is legal gambling, and the Crown alleges it was suspected at times there was illegal gambling going on in the club. Now, you will appreciate, gentlemen, that the police would want to check these clubs to see if any illegal gambling was going on in these clubs, and to check these clubs there is only one way to do it, and that is not to tell the people they were coming to inspect them because they would certainly not find anything then, but to raid quickly and without notice, to swoop down on the club, walk in and then see if there is any illegal gambling, and if the police did find that there was illegal gambling, of course the club would be charged and probably put out of business. The Crown alleges that naturally McDermott and Feeley would be very interested to know when these clubs would be raided and on what dates so that they would be ready.\nHow would they get that information? I submit to you that the only way they can get the information is to get it from some person in authority who knew the raid was going to take place\u2014was going to be conducted. The Crown alleges that for some time the accused Wright in the year 1953\/1954 was in what is known as an anti-gambling squad of the Ontario Provincial Police. The anti-gaming squad is a branch of the Ontario Provincial Police which deals almost entirely with the suppression of illegal gambling. Wright was on that squad, and you can draw your inferences from the evidence of what connection Wright had with the accused McDermott and Feeley.\nIn any event, in the early part of 1960, in January 1960, the accused Wright was transferred out of the anti-gambling squad to duty in the Town of Belleville. The Crown alleges now that the accused McDermott and Feeley had lost their contact. Wright was now out of the anti-gaming squad, he would not be able to tell them when and at what time the raids would be conducted. Another source of information had to be obtained. The Crown alleges that then the three accused conspired together to obtain that information from a member of the anti-gaming squad, namely Constable Scott.\nScott was approached, and how he was approached will be tendered in evidence, and how information was obtained from him will be tendered in evidence, but the Crown alleges that they did conspire to obtain information from Scott, a member of the anti\u2011gaming squad, that they did obtain information from Constable Scott, and that Constable Scott\u2014and I should say the information they obtained from Constable Scott is unlawful for Constable Scott to give, or for any police officer, of the anti-gaming squad to give.\nNow unfortunately for the three accused Scott was approached and without letting the accused know he reported to his superior officers. The superior officer when Scott was first approached by the accused Wright, who was at that time, as I told you, still a member of the Ontario Provincial Police, stationed at Belleville\u2014but Wright did not say whom he was working for, so the superior officers naturally wanted Scott to play along with Wright because they wanted to find out who Wright was working for. In other words, may I put it this way, they were not so much interested, or they were interested in seeing that Wright was arrested and booked, but they were certainly interested in who Wright was working for, and so Scott was instructed to play along and he did play along, and eventually contact was made, particularly with the accused McDermott, eventually directly by Scott to McDermott, and you will hear evidence of McDermott\u2019s dealings with Scott to obtain information as to when and what times the raid would be made on these clubs. You will hear evidence of the implication of the accused Feeley with the accused McDermott in these clubs, that they were partners and had other dealings together and they were associated together, and the Crown is alleging that on that evidence, which will be submitted to you, there is only one inference you gentlemen can draw\u2014that they were all associated together and that for a common purpose and for a common interest they conspired to obtain information from Constable Scott of the anti-gaming squad, and that for the unlawful purpose as set out in the indictment. (The italics are mine.)\nThe evidence for the Crown was led and received and was similar to the evidence that had been given in the trial before Spence J. except that some of the evidence at the first trial was omitted at the second trial.\nThe next matter of importance to note is what transpired at the conclusion of the Crown\u2019s case. Mr. Hartt on behalf of Wright renewed the application to file as an exhibit the record of the trial before Spence J. The discussion between Donnelly J. and Mr. Hartt is as follows:\nMr. HARTT: I understand at the beginning of this trial an application was made by Mr. Sedgwick, then counsel for Mr. Feeley, that the copy of the transcript of the evidence of the former trial of these three accused persons should be entered as an exhibit in this case. I understand that at that time you made a ruling that you would not allow it in at that stage as an exhibit, but you would allow it to be filed with the Court.\nI subsequently was informed that the copy that had been furnished to you was a copy that had been marked by some other person and I received a copy to-day that was not in that condition from the Court of Appeal and I would ask your lordship to allow me to file that copy with the Court.\nHIS LORDSHIP: As an exhibit?\nMr. HARTT: My application is as an exhibit.\nHIS LORDSHIP: What have you to say as to whether it should be filed as an exhibit or not? I am giving you this opportunity of arguing this. It was argued on behalf of the other accused earlier. In view of the fact you were not present I consider you should have an opportunity of making a presentation at this time.\nMr. HARTT: I will be brief.\nMy submission is that the defence which arises from a plea of not guilty and res judicata is one which I will submit is open to us in this case. With regard to that defence it is my understanding that it is a question, first of all, for your lordship whether or not the evidence in this trial\u2014whether or not the issue in this trial is identical to the issue previously and is judicially determined.\nHIS LORDSHIP: No, that is the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, but not the basis of res judicata. You may have different issues but some essential fact which is common to the two issues on which a decision has been given; it is certainly not the basis of res judicata.\nMr. HARTT: I think res judicata is a wider matter than autrefois acquit. HIS LORDSHIP: In my view it covers the situation entirely. There is some relation but it is a different principle.\nMr. HARTT: If I may put it this way\u2014it is a factual issue which was directly placed before a competent tribunal and it was determined and it is not open to one of the parties to the original inquiry to raise it again. It is my submission to your lordship by reference to the charge in the first trial, to the manner of procedure adopted in relation to that charge, and the issue that eventually went to the jury, the factual issue that went to the jury, realistically went to the jury, that is the same issue that this jury is being asked to determine. If I am right in that, it is my submission that the issue is originally for your lordship, and then if you do not think the jury should be directed in relation to it then it becomes an issue for the jury. On that basis it is my submission that this transcript should be marked as an exhibit in the trial because I see no other way how the jury can ascertain what the real issue was at the first trial, the real factual issue.\nMy application is an alternative one, that it be marked as an exhibit in the trial for all purposes, and if your lordship does not accede to that request that it be marked as an exhibit before the Court in order to allow me to argue the question of defence before your lordship.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Mr. Hartt, I am of the same opinion I was earlier, that the transcript should not be filed as an exhibit. It should not be available to the jury in the jury room. In my opinion that applies even though the evidence in the two trials is exactly the same. It is quite apparent that in this trial there was not as much evidence called as there was in the other trial. Witnesses were called in the other trial who did not testify in this trial. If that evidence was filed as an exhibit the jury would have the evidence of those witnesses before them. In my opinion that would be most improper. If the transcript of the proceedings in the earlier trial went to the jury in their jury room, it is most likely that the jury would dispose of the matter, not on the evidence which they heard at this trial and on which they are sworn to examine the matter, but on the written transcript which they would have before them. Being human beings and having the written transcript of a previous trial, if their memory is at all vague as to what a witness said at this trial, they would consider the evidence which was given at a previous trial.\nThese accused must be tried on the evidence tendered during this trial and not on the evidence during the previous trial. I must refuse your application to have the transcript filed as an exhibit. I told counsel at the opening of the trial, when this matter was argued, I was quite content to have the transcript filed with the Court for use of counsel and the Court but that it would not go to the jury room and I am still content to have that done if you desire it.\nMr. HARTT: I have given to Mr. Bradley a fresh copy of the evidence, if your lordship would refer to that in the course of my argument.\nMy first submission to your lordship is that on the authorities, and on the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada it is clear that res judicata is a defence.\nHIS LORDSHIP: I made that clear at the opening. I consider res judicata was a defence included in a plea of not guilty, and a defence open to the accused in this case\u2014open to them to argue in this case. Mr. Hartt thereupon applied to have Donnelly J. hold that the defence of res judicata had been made out and that the jury be directed to return a verdict of not guilty.\nDonnelly J., in the course of the argument, at p. 1102 of the record, said:\nHIS LORDSHIP: I think in view of the addresses and the charge I must come to the conclusion that the jury in the first trial either found that there was not the intent to interfere with the administration of justice or were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of that ingredient.\nMr. MILLIGAN: Then do I understand your lordship to say that the intent to pervert the course of justice is res judicata?\nHIS LORDSHIP: I would, on the evidence, on the charges and on the addresses, I can come to no other conclusion but that the elements as pointed out by the learned trial Judge, that there must be an agreement to pay Scott money and an intent to interfere with the administration of justice\u2014what other finding would you suggest is warranted by the addresses and the finding of the jury?\nand he gave judgment on this application at p. 1111:\nHIS LORDSHIP: The accused rely on the maxim of res judicata and point out that these three accused were earlier acquitted of an offence that\u2014\nbetween the first day of January, 1960, and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario they did unlawfully conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(1)(d).\nIt would appear that the evidence which was tendered by the Crown on the present charge was tendered together with other evidence on the earlier charge.\nIn his charge to the jury on the trial of the first count in the indictment, the learned trial judge pointed out to the jury that the essential elements of the offence with which the accused were charged were, firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly, secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of justice. In his address to the jury, counsel for the accused Wright admitted that Wright had given to Scott sums of money totalling one thousand dollars, and based his defence solely on the contention that Wright did not have the intention to interfere with the administration of justice. Counsel for McDermott spoke to the jury of the necessity of the intent to interfere with the administration of justice and suggested that McDermott was caught between the two officers who were spying on each other. Counsel for the accused Feeley submitted to the jury that Wright did not have the intent to interfere with the administration of justice, and said that if Wright did not have that corrupt intent, which was an essential element of the charge against all three men, then that was the end of the case against Wright and the end of the case against McDermott and Feeley.\nWhen charging the jury the learned trial judge discussed the payment of money to Scott by Wright, and pointed out that it was admitted by counsel for Wright that he did pay money to Scott and in return passed on information to at least McDermott. In dealing with the question of intention he pointed out to the jury that it was important that they consider whether Wright did this corruptly in order to interfere with the administration of justice, because that was the whole gravamen of the charge.\nIn order for the defence to succeed on a plea of res judicata there must have been in the earlier proceeding a finding adverse to the Crown on some point which it is essential for the Crown to prove on the second charge. Counsel for the accused contend, while the intention to interfere with the administration of justice was an essential element in the first count, it was also an essential element on the second count on which the accused are presently before the Court, and that the finding of the jury acquitting the accused on the charge under the first count establishes a lack of intent on the part of Wright to interfere with the administration of justice. My reading of the addresses and the charge together with the verdict of the jury satisfies me that the finding of the jury turned on the essential element of intention to interfere with the administration of justice. Counsel for the accused contend the acquittal negatives such intent. If the verdict of the jury turned on this vital element, it cannot be said that the jury found that there was no such intent. It may very well have been that the verdict was the result of a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown had proven such intent. While an intent to interfere with the administration of justice is an essential element in the first count of the indictment, in my opinion it is not an essential element in the second count and the Crown need not prove such intention. I must therefore hold that there is no finding which can be taken from the verdict of the jury which deals with any of the essential elements of the second charge. In my opinion a finding of not guilty which would appear to have been based on the failure to prove this essential element in the first charge is not sufficient ground for allowing the motion of the defence on the plea of res judicata, as this element is not essential in this second charge. I must find that the defence has failed to establish res judicata.\nMr. Hartt then submitted to Donnelly J. that he should charge the jury that the Crown was estopped from challenging any of the findings on the first trial and that counsel for the accused should be permitted in addressing the jury to point out to the jury what the issues were in the first trial and the results of the first trial.\nDonnelly J. disposed of the submission as follows:\nHIS LORDSHIP: I do not consider that the accused in their addresses to the jury are entitled to refer to the results of the first trial, or what inferences they consider can be drawn from the verdict of the jury in that trial. In my opinion, as I have indicated, the jury were influenced in arriving at their decision or the verdict at which they did arrive, by a consideration whether or not the Crown had proven the intent which was an essential element of the first charge. In view of my finding that this is not an essential element in the second charge, I find that no reference should be made on behalf of the accused to the jury finding.\nDoes that clear up your problem? Mr. HARTT: I wanted to make perfectly clear we are not entitled to any of the issues in the first trial?\nHIS LORDSHIP: No, this is a different trial, a different charge, a different offence.\nMr. HARTT: Your lordship is taking the defence of res judicata away from the jury?\nHIS LORDSHIP: Yes, that is my judgment.\nMr. MILLIGAN: Your lordship is not saying I am estopped from saying they are related to these clubs?\nHIS LORDSHIP: I make no finding on that. I say the only finding which could reasonably be drawn from the verdict in the first case is that the jury had some doubt whether the Crown had satisfied the onus in regard to proving this intent. Anything further than that would be speculation, as I see it.\nand he dealt with the same matter at p. 1125:\nMr. HARTT: Could I refer to the part of the transcript to show the issues before the last jury and this one?\nHIS LORDSHIP: These are entirely different issues, in my ruling. Possibly I did not make it clear yesterday, but what I intended was this, that neither you nor Mr. Nasso nor Mr. McDermott may mention to the jury the issues in the trial of the first charge or the results of that trial. In my understanding it is my duty to rule on the question of whether res judicata has been successfully established by the defence, and that it is not a matter for the jury. You understand that, Mr. McDermott?\nAfter the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, Mr. Hartt asked the judge to charge the jury that in view of Wright\u2019s acquittal on count 1 it should be put to the jury that Wright did not have an unlawful purpose of conspiring for an unlawful end with McDermott and Feeley.\nMr. Hartt put his request as follows:\nI suggest to your lordship if you accept my premise that I have a rinding he was acting in accordance with the administration of justice then it is impossible for the jury to find that there is an illegal agreement in relation to the accused Wright.\n* * *\nPut it this way, that a previous jury has found Wright did not have this intent and it is not open to this jury to make a contrary finding. Therefore it must be put to the jury that it cannot be found that he had, or Wright had an unlawful intent in relation to what he was doing and that being an essential to the agreement to bring about an unlawful purpose that he cannot be found guilty on that indictment.\nThe Crown\u2019s position was stated by Mr. Milligan on p. 1174:\nI want to comment on Mr. Hartt\u2019s objection; the main one is that he would like your lordship to put the issue of res judicata to the jury. He would like your lordship to put to the jury that a previous jury having found that there was no unlawful purpose, or that Wright did not intend to effect an unlawful purpose they should not consider that. I submit if your lordship put it to them in that way you might as well tell the jury to acquit.\nThe learned judge\u2019s ruling was:\nIn regard to the objection that I must tell the jury that they cannot convict Wright unless they find that he obtained this information or agreed to obtain this information for an unlawful purpose it is not necessary for the Crown to show any unlawful purpose and it is wrong for me to so instruct the jury.\nThe jury found the three appellants guilty as charged on count 2. That left counts 3, 4 and 5 against Wright only and count 6 against McDermott and Feeley to be dealt with. Wright was tried on counts 3, 4 and 5 by Donnelly J. on March 23, 1962. When the counts were read to him, he entered a plea of not guilty. A jury was empanelled. Mr. Milligan for the Crown opened the case to the jury as follows:\nMay it please your lordship. Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the charges read to you by the Clerk of the Assize and in simple language they simply indicate that the Crown alleges that the accused Wright, in 1960, a member of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, had been a member of the Anti-Gaming Squad of that Police and he was transferred to Belleville. On the Anti-Gaming Squad at the same time with Constable Wright was Constable Scott who remained and still is a member of the Anti-Gaming Squad Branch. The Crown alleges that Wright, for the purpose of tipping off gaming houses as to raids on them by the Provincial Police, approached Scott to get the information of these raids.\nThe Crown alleges that he offered Scott money and that Scott then reported to his superior officers and he was told to continue the investigation, in other words, as an underhand man, and Scott then continued his contact with Wright and subsequently Wright on three occasions, the 29th February, 1960, the 29th March, 1960, and the 27th April, 1960, the accused Wright gave Scott\u2014gave him on the first occasion $200, $400, and $200, for payment for tip-offs of raids on gaming houses. Scott took that money to his superior officers after taking note of the money so that he would be able later to identify the money.\nThe Crown alleges that Wright, having received information from Scott of the dates of the raids, passed that information on to the operators and the raids were made on the gaming houses and the gaming houses were ready for the police. The Crown alleges that the accused, in the terms of the charges laid, bribed corruptly Constable Scott for the purpose of perverting the course of justice.\nConstable Scott was the only witness called by the Crown. His evidence was substantially the same as he had given before Spence J. at the first trial in respect of count 1 and before Donnelly J. at the second trial in respect of count 2. The record reads:\nCROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. HARTT:\nQ. Mr. Scott, you gave evidence at the trial which commenced May 29th last before his lordship Mr. Justice Spence?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The accused Wright was one of those accused at that time?\nA. Yes.\nQ. There was also two other accused, a man by the name of McDermott, and Feeley?\nA. Yes.\nQ. I suggest the evidence you gave at the trial was the evidence you have given us to-day?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you also give evidence last week at a trial?\nA. Yes.\nQ. In which this man was accused?\nA. Yes.\nMr. HARTT: That is all, my lord.\nThen Mr. Hartt made the following admissions on behalf of his client:\nMy Lord, for the purpose of the record in this trial I am prepared to admit that Wright, the accused, contacted the officer Scott and obtained information from him. I am also prepared to make admissions on behalf of my client that we paid money\u2014or money was paid to Scott, and a third admission that we are prepared to make for the purpose of this trial, my lord, that the information was passed on to other persons who had been interested in relation to obtaining this information. However, I do wish to make it perfectly clear that we deny the intent which is an essential ingredient of this charge.\nMr. MILLIGAN: In view of the admissions of my learned friend the Crown closes its case.\nMr. Hartt then applied to Donnelly J. to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the three counts 3, 4 and 5 on the grounds Wright, having been acquitted under count 1, the matter was res judicata.\nDonnelly J. gave judgment on the application as follows:\nCounsel for Wright in his address to the jury at the trial on the first count in the indictment admitted to the jury that Wright had paid the various sums of money to Scott, the same sums which were related by Scott in his evidence to-day. Counsel also admitted that information was received from Scott by Wright and the sole defence of Wright on that charge as I understand it on checking the address of his counsel was that he did not have the intention to interfere with the administration of justice. Counsel for McDermott in his address contended that McDermott was caught between two police officers who were spying on each other. Counsel for Feeley based his defence on the contention that there was no intention on the part of Scott to interfere with the administration of justice, and in fact told the jury that McDermott and Feeley were gamblers, at least one of them was associated with the club at Cooksville, that there had been telephone calls from Wright and Scott to McDermott. The defence of Wright was based on the contention by his counsel that the Crown had not proved the intent on the part of Wright to interfere with the administration of justice. The jury were instructed on the law by the learned trial judge. He outlined the essential elements of the offence as, firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly, and secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of justice.\nConsidering the addresses by counsel to the jury and the admissions that were made by them in these addresses together with the instruction given by the learned trial judge I must infer that the jury at least came to the conclusion that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Wright had the intention to interfere with the administration of justice. I fail to see how the verdict of not guilty on the first count in the indictment could have been reached by the jury on any other basis. I must find that the jury trying the first count did find that the Crown had not proven the intention which is an essential element in the three offences with which the accused is charged and on which he is presently on trial.\nWill you bring in the jury, please. I consider that I am bound by Rex v. Quinn, 10 Canadian Criminal Cases, 412.\nHis lordship then charged the jury as follows:\nMembers of the jury, as I informed you very briefly before you retired to your jury room, you are the sole and only judges of the facts, but it is my duty to pass on questions of law. Counsel for the accused has made a motion raising what is known as a plea of res judicata and it is for me to pass on that motion. The three charges against the accused Wright, on which he is presently on trial, are the same except that various amounts of money were paid on different dates. The law in regard to each charge is the same and the essential elements of each charge are the same. The essential elements are, first, that Wright corruptly paid money to Scott. That is admitted. It is also admitted that Scott received money and gave information to Wright that Wright passed on to one or more persons who were interested in receiving that information; second, that Wright had the intention of interfering with the administration of justice, that is an essential element of each of these charges. Wright and others were tried in May and early June, 1961, on a charge that they conspired to commit an indictable offence by corruptly giving money to George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, the same man who is alleged to have received the money in this present trial, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration. You see that in that charge the same money was involved and that same intent which is an essential element.\nHaving read the addresses of counsel to the jury on that trial, the charge which was delivered to the jury by the learned trial judge when he instructed them on the law and reviewed the facts with them, and having considered the verdict of the jury at that trial, I consider that the only inference which I can draw is that at that trial the jury considered that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Wright had this necessary intention of interfering with the administration of justice. It was a judicial decision on that point and it is not now open to the Crown to ask you to come to a different verdict on that point. There is the verdict of the earlier jury and as I have said the only inference I can draw from the addresses and the charge to the jury and the verdict is that the Crown failed to prove the necessary intention. That is an essential element in this charge and before the accused may be found guilty the Crown must prove each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden is on the Crown; it is not on the defence. It is my duty to instruct you that it is my view that the jury on the earlier trial considered that the Crown had not proven this essential element. It is therefore my duty to instruct you that you cannot find the accused guilty on these present charges because it is not open to you to arrive at a different verdict than the other jury on this essential element. I would therefore ask that you, without leaving the jury box, select a foreman and if you agree with my instruction to you that you find the accused not guilty on each one of these charges on which he is presently before the Court. Will you select a foreman, please, from among yourselves.\nHave you arrived at your verdict?\nThe FOREMAN: Yes.\nThe REGISTRAR: Members of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict? On Counts 3, 4 and 5 as charged in this indictment how do you find the accused as directed by his lordship?\nThe FOREMAN: My own\u2014the verdict of the jury\u2014I don\u2019t know.\nHIS LORDSHIP: I had suggested to you that you find the accused not guilty. I had gone further than that; I had instructed you that in my opinion it was impossible for you to arrive at any other verdict.\nThe FOREMAN: We agree he is not guilty.\nHIS LORDSHIP: On each of the counts?\nThe FOREMAN: On each count.\nThe situation at this stage of the proceedings may be summarized as follows:\nAs to count 1: All three appellants had been acquitted.\nAs to count 2: All three appellants had been convicted.\nAs to counts\n3, 4 and 5: The appellant Wright had been acquitted.\nAs to count 6: The appellants McDermott and Feeley had entered a plea of guilty and had been fined. This count does not appear further in the proceedings.\nThe three appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[10] against their conviction on count 2. The appeal was taken upon the following grounds:\n1. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in failing to find that the plea of autrefois acquit was properly pleaded in this case.\n2. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in refusing to place the theory of the defence before the jury.\n3. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in failing to allow to be placed before the jury the fact of the acquittal of the accused on a previous charge in so far as it was relevant to the issue to be determined by the jury in this case.\n4. That the Learned Trial Judge having found that a previous jury had found that it was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the intent that George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice erred in failing to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of the conspiracy charge where the facts were admitted to be the same.\n5. That the Learned Trial Judge having found that a previous jury had found that it was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the intent that George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice erred in failing to place this fact before the jury as a relevant consideration in determining whether the appellant was guilty of the conspiracy charged.\n6. That the verdict of the jury was inconsistent with a previous verdict on the same facts.\n7. Such further and other grounds as Counsel may advise and the Court may deem sufficient grounds of appeal.\nThe Attorney General for Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario against the acquittal of the appellant Wright on counts 3, 4 and 5 on the ground that: \u201cThe learned trial judge erred in law in directing the jury to return a verdict of \u2018not guilty\u2019 on each charge on the ground of res judicata.\u201d\nThese appeals were argued together on September 7, 1962, and judgment was handed down on October 4, 1962. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the appellants in respect of count 2 and allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal in respect of counts 3, 4 and 5 directing that the order of acquittal of the appellant Wright upon those counts be set aside and that there should be a new trial with respect thereto. Schroeder J.A. wrote the judgment in which Laidlaw and Kelly JJ.A. concurred.\nThe three appellants applied to this Court and were given leave on October 22, 1962, to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following points:\n1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding as a matter of law that the learned Trial Judge was correct in holding that the defence of res judicata was not available to the Appellants by reason of their previous acquittal upon count 1 of the indictment?\n2. In the alternative, did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err as a matter of law in holding that the learned Trial Judge was correct in not leaving to the Jury for its determination the defence based upon res judicata?\n3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err as a matter of law in not holding that the learned Trial Judge has misdirected the Jury when he declined to point out to the Jury that by virtue of the acquittal of the accused on the first count of the indictment the Jury was precluded from drawing any inferences by way of motive or otherwise on the matter presented to them at the trial on the second count from the supposition or view that the accused had conspired together to interfere corruptly with the administration of justice?\n4. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the plea of autrefois acquit was not properly pleaded in this case?\nThe appellant Wright appealed to this Court as of right from the order setting aside his acquittal on counts 3, 4 and 5 and directing a new trial.\nAlthough they filed separate factums and were represented by different counsel, all three appellants made common cause in their appeal from conviction under count 2. Wright was alone in the appeal under counts 3, 4 and 5.\nGround of appeal no. 4 dealing with the plea of autrefois acquit may be disposed of under the provisions of ss. 517 and 518 of the Criminal Code which read:\n517. EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY OF CHARGES. Where an issue, on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, is tried, the evidence and adjudication and the notes of the judge and official stenographer on the former trial and the record transmitted to the court pursuant to section 462 on the charge that is pending before that court, are admissible in evidence to prove or to disprove the identity of the charges.\n518. (1) WHAT DETERMINES IDENTITY. Where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict to a count is tried and it appears\n(a) that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in charge, and\n(b) that on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been made that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict be pleaded,\nthe judge shall give judgment discharging the accused in respect of that count.\n(2) ALLOWANCE OF SPECIAL PLEA IN PART. The following provisions apply where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is tried, namely,\n(a) where it appears that the accused might on the former trial have been convicted of an offence of which he may be convicted on the count in issue, the judge shall direct that the accused shall not be found guilty of any offence of which he might have been convicted on the former trial, and\n(b) where it appears that the accused may be convicted on the count in issue of an offence of which he could not have been convicted on the former trial, the accused shall plead guilty or not guilty with respect to that offence. These sections appear to be a code of the law relating to the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict and I am in complete agreement with the views of Schroeder J.A. on this point and do not consider it necessary to review the law on the subject in the light of that judgment. Shortly put, on their trial on count 1 the appellants could not have been convicted on count 2.\nIn dealing with the defence of res judicata as raised in this instance, it is necessary to deal with a preliminary but important question which the appellants urged upon the trial judge, in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, namely, that it was for the jury to decide the issue and that Donnelly J. erred when he refused to admit as an exhibit to go to the jury the complete record of the trial before Spence J. At the beginning of the trial there was some confusion as to what function the jury performed in respect of a plea of res judicata. When the question was first raised, Crown counsel took the position that it was a matter for the jury to decide as stated on p. 47:\nIf you accept the submission of my learned friend, I submit you yourself would be deciding res judicata, and I submit that is a defence which should be submitted to the jury to decide. I submit if your lordship were simply to impanel a jury and instruct them, you have decided it is res judicata and therefore they must not convict, you are really treating the res judicata as a special plea, but doing it indirectly and I submit your lordship should not do that on the issue of res judicata because that is something for the jury to decide.\nDonnelly J. did not then decide the point but did hold that res judicata was not a special plea and that it is a defence included in a plea of not guilty. There the matter rested until at the conclusion of the Crown\u2019s case when Mr. Hartt again asked that the record of the first trial be received in evidence to go to the jury. Donnelly J. refused the application but ordered the record to be filed but not to be available to the jury. He further held that the question as to whether the defence of res judicata had been made out was one of law for him to decide and was not a question for the jury. He thereupon ruled that the defence of res judicata had not been established.\nWhile there are findings of fact involved in determining whether or not the defence of res judicata has been made out in any given case, it is manifest that it would be unrealistic to hand over to a jury the record of a previous trial or to have read to the jury that record which in any specific case might contain evidence inadmissible in the second trial and prejudicial to the accused. On balance, therefore, justice requires that a workable rule consistent with safeguarding the rights of accused persons be formulated and in that regard I think the procedure followed by Donnelly J. is the only reasonable course to follow and which should be followed in the future. It will be for the judge to decide as a matter of law whether the defence of res judicata has been made out. The case of Cowan v. Affie[11] was cited in support of the position taken by Mr. Hartt and agreed to initially by Crown counsel. For the reasons just stated I do not think that Cowan v. Affie, supra, ought to be followed.\nThe appellants urge that the defence of res judicata was available to them and that Donnelly J. and the Court of Appeal were in error in holding that it had not been established.\nThe defence of res judicata differs materially from autrefois acquit or autrefois convict. The principle of res judicata estops the Crown in a second or later legal proceeding from questioning that which was in substance the ratio of and fundamental to the decision in the earlier proceeding. Res judicata is applicable in criminal as well as civil proceedings. This was aptly stated by Holmes J. in United States v. Oppenheimer[12] when he said:\nIt cannot be that the safeguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn reverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt.\nand by Lord MacDermott in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor[13] in the following passage:\nThe effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication. The maxim \u201cRes judicata pro veritate accipitur\u201d is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings.\nThis principle was adopted by this Court in McDonald v. The Queen[14] in both the majority and minority opinions. In view of the reference by Schroeder J.A. to Rex v. Bayn[15], it must now be said that the statement by Haultain C.J.S. in Bayn at p. 90:\n\u2026that there is no rule or principle of the common law, or of the statutory law, on which the principle of res judicata is applicable to criminal cases, which is not founded on the maxims nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa or nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto.\nis not good law.\nAccordingly, what was in substance the ratio of and fundamental to the verdict of acquittal on count 1 before Spence J.? Count 1 and count 2 read:\n1. ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT B. FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(1) (d).\n2. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY between the first day of January, 1960 and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit: to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(2).\nThey are not identical in their essential elements and for that reason the defence of autrefois acquit was not made out but the appellants argue that though differing in language and in their essential elements they do in reality deal with the same offence and that the basic error made by Donnelly J. at the trial and by Schroeder J.A. was that they approached consideration of the case from the standpoint of a comparison of the wording of the two counts and not the realities of the proceedings before Spence J.\nThe question really boils down to whether there were in fact two conspiracies or only one. The appellants argue that what the Crown has done is to make two conspiracies out of the one agreement testified to by Constable Scott by splitting off from the agreement alleged in count 1 a segment and calling it count 2. Accordingly, were there one or two unlawful agreements or conspiracies? Constable Scott\u2019s evidence at the two trials was almost identical. Before Spence J. he testified as to the agreement with Wright in a series of interviews and telephone conversations deposed to from p. 176 to p. 202 of the record culminating in Scott\u2019s statement on pp. 201-202:\nA. Well, Wright said that starting February 15th, he would call me every evening from Belleville between 6.30 and 7.00 p.m.\nQ. And did he give you the name of his alleged contact or the gambler at that time?\nA. No, sir, he didn\u2019t.\nQ. And what conversation, if any, was there about disclosing the names of the contacts to you?\nA. Well, Wright told me that as we developed the trust between us, I would be given much information regarding gambling activities in the Province.\nQ. Any further discussion at this time?\nA. Yes, sir. He again emphasized that the gamblers were only interested in the policy of the Branch towards the Clubs and the time of any raids on the Clubs. He said the only way we could get caught was if one turned the other in. We talked of using a code for our telephone conversations and we decided that we would call the Vets Club north and the Ramsey Club south. Wright said he thought the gamblers should pay the cost of all the long distance telephone calls. He also told me that he thought we could get more money in time to come. It was on this date that I agreed to go along with Wright; that is, I should say accept his proposition as he put it to me.\nThe proposition which Scott has described is at pp. 177-179:\nQ. Apart from any personal conversation, was there any conversation with Wright on this occasion about any proposition?\nA. Yes, sir, there was.\nQ. Yes; what was said?\nA. Well, Wright told me that he had stopped a car for speeding in the Belleville area about two weeks ago. Wright said the driver of this car turned out to be one of the gamblers from Toronto. He said that the gambler was surprised to see him in uniform and put a proposition to him. This proposition was that myself, as an officer on the Anti\u2011Gambling Branch, would find out, or knowing our policies for dates of raids respecting two Clubs operating in the Province, would forward the information regarding policies and raids and dates of raids, I should say, to Wright in Belleville, who in turn would forward the information to the gambler in Toronto. Now, for doing this\u2014providing this information, Wright said that we could obtain\u2014\nQ. Who is \u201cwe\u201d?\nA. Wright and myself.\nQ. Yes?\nA.\u2014$200 each per month. He said that the gambler was only interested in raids on two Clubs and the policies of the Provincial Police towards these two Clubs. Wright said he had been given a number to call in Toronto and he could certify the figure of $200 each per month. When Wright made this approach to me I showed some surprise and laughed at him, but I said, \u201cWell, go ahead and make the phone call.\u201d And Wright went to a pay phone located in the beverage room in the Wallace Hotel and he appeared to dial a number and carry on a conversation. He completed the apparent phone call and returned to our table. And he told me, \u201cThat is right, we can make $200 each.\u201d\nQ. Did you ask him who the gambler or contact was, at that time?\nA. I did, sir.\nQ. And did he tell you at that time?\nA. He did not, sir.\nQ. What else, if anything, was discussed with Wright at this time with reference to this proposition of his?\nA. Well, Wright stated that this information was required only to protect the clientele frequenting the Clubs in that they get\u2014they had big shots as customers in the Clubs. He told me that this would not interfere with my duties and mentioned to me how few raids there were in the past five years.\nQ. You refer to Wright telling you of the information required about two gaming clubs. Did he at this time make\u2014identify them by name?\nA. Well, he identified the Vets Club which was located in Cooksville.\nQ. Yes; and does that cover substantially the conversation you had with Wright at this time\u2014what did you tell him about the proposition?\nA. Well, I might say also that Wright said if I agreed to this proposition we would have a meeting with his contact.\nQ. Yes; what did you tell him?\nA. I told Wright that I would like some time to think it over.\nQ. Yes; and then did you and he leave the hotel and you went home?\nA. Yes, sir, we did.\nThen at the second trial before Donnelly J., Scott testified as to the agreement as appears on pp. 276 to 278 in language almost identical to his testimony on pp. 176 to 179, culminating again in Scott\u2019s statement at pp. 312 and 313 that he \u201cwould be part of this scheme\u201d.\nNo matter how Scott\u2019s evidence at the two trials is scrutinized, there is no escaping that he and Wright entered into only one agreement or proposition and that was as Scott described it at the first trial as set out above and at the second trial as:\nA. Wright explained that the gambler told him that if I did inform Wright of the dates of raids on these two social clubs and the policy of the Provincial Police with regard to the clubs, and Wright in turn forwarded it to the gambler we would each be reimbursed in what he figured would be two hundred dollars each per month. He explained that the situation would be handled in this way:\u2014Upon my finding out that any of the two clubs would be raided I would telephone him, Wright, at Belleville and give him the information and he in turn would phone back to Toronto the information. He explained that\u2014he mentioned how few raids had been made on the clubs in the past five years, saying that it wouldn\u2019t hinder my work at all and the big reason that this information was required was to protect people of reputable standing from being caught in the clubs on a police raid. He wouldn\u2019t name the person with whom he had dealt and he said he had been given a Toronto telephone number and he could phone this number and certify this amount for two hundred dollars each per month. Now, at this time I laughed a bit and said well, he might as well call the number. He went to a pay \u2018phone in the hotel and appeared to dial a number and appeared to carry on a conversation at the telephone. A couple of minutes later he came back to the table and said that that was correct, that we could make the amount of two hundred dollars a month each for this information. I told Wright I wasn\u2019t too keen; I would like some time to think about this matter at this time.\nThe conspirators (if there was a conspiracy) did not agree together just to obtain from Constable Scott information which it was his duty not to divulge\u2014they were not interested in just getting information or just in having Scott give information unlawfully\u2014they wanted the information so as to be forewarned of impending raids on their gambling clubs. That was the conspiracy, if any.\nTherefore, everything that could be considered unlawful under count 2 was part and parcel of the agreement under count 1. There was only one agreement deposed to and it cannot be severed arbitrarily at some point by the Crown so as to create the illusion of two offences from what is in fact only one.\nThe verdict of not guilty under count 1, however unpalatable to the Crown, was a lawful verdict which has not been challenged upon appeal. That verdict dealt with the realities of the crime these appellants were charged with having committed. The Crown is now estopped from questioning that which was (in fact and law) the ratio of and fundamental to the decision in the first trial.\nCrown counsel must have considered the two counts as covering the same offence. This is evident from the similarity of counsel\u2019s opening statement on count 1 before Spence J. as follows:\nIn January, 1960, the Provincial Police transferred the accused Wright to other duties in the Force in Belleville, not associated with the anti-gambling unit. At that time Scott then became the second senior constable under Sergeant Anderson. In February 1960, something like a month following Wright\u2019s transfer, it is alleged that Wright came to see Scott and told him a story about stopping a Toronto gambler for speeding. He told Scott the gambler had offered to pay $400 a month to get information about the policy of the anti-gambling unit and the times of raids. Wright told Scott that here was a chance to make some easy money. Scott told Wright that he would have to think this over, arranged to meet him or talk to him later. He immediately reported the incident to his superiors and was instructed to go along with Wright.\nScott then agreed with Wright to tip him off on raids as requested and supply what information he could. Wright told him that the information that the gamblers or his (Wright\u2019s) contacts wanted was as to raids on what was popularly referred to as the Vets Club at Cooksville and a new Ramsey Club in Niagara Falls. Those were apparently the two main alleged gaming houses or clubs then known to be operating in Ontario.\nwhen compared to Crown counsel\u2019s opening before Donnelly J. previously quoted.\nThe one conspiracy view is further strengthened by the similarity of the language used by Spence J. in his charge to the jury relating to count 1 and Donnelly J\u2019s charge as to count 2.\nSpence J. said at pp. 1261-2 of the record of the first trial:\nSo what the Crown has here charged, put in short words, is that Wright, McDermott and Feeley did agree and conspire together corruptly to give money to Scott, with intent that Scott should interefere with the administration of justice.\nThe essential elements of the offence charged are these. Firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly; secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of justice.\nThe offence is complete with the agreement, the arriving at the agreement or design. That design need not be carried out, as the agreement to do the unlawful act is the offence.\nand at pp. 1280-1:\nMuch of the evidence dealt with the character of these so-called social clubs, the Centre Road Veterans Club and the Ramsey Club, and with those who were in control there. That evidence is relevant only to show, if it does show, that the accused McDermott and Feeley had an interest in the protection of those places from police interference, and therefore an interest in making the illegal conspiracy with Wright with which they are charged in this charge. It is relevant only for that purpose. Even if you are convinced that both of those clubs are illegal gaming houses, it is not sufficient. You must be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that, with the intent to protect them and thus interfere with the administration of justice, the two men agreed to pay Scott money corruptly.\nDonnelly J. dealt with count 2 in his charge as follows at pp. 1144-5 of the record of the second trial:\nThis indictment covers a period between January 1st, 1960 and July 1st, 1960. It is not necessary to show that the accused conspired over this whole period, as long as they conspired at any one time during that period. The conspiracy does not need to cover the whole period. The evidence is that Scott first contacted Wright about February 5th and that Wright was arrested on the 28th of May. You do not have to find that the parties conspired over that whole period; all the Crown has to show is that sometime in the period the three parties were active in the common design\u2014associated in a common design for a common unlawful purpose.\nNow I propose to review the evidence with you in regard to the parties individually. The accused Wright, as you have been told, was a member of the Ontario Provincial Police, and was a member of the Anti-gambling Squad for some years, Scott being a member of that squad or branch during a number of years also. The evidence indicates that Wright was on the Branch before Scott, and in January, 1960, Wright was transferred to Belleville. Scott\u2019s evidence was that on the 5th of February Wright came to his house and after some conversation they went to the Wallace Hotel or some hotel and Scott was told by Wright about some man who had been stopped on the highway by Wright and it turned out he was interested in gambling and that he was interested in obtaining information as to the policy of the Anti-gambling Branch and the times when raids would be made on one or more clubs. Wright told Scott, according to Scott, that if this information was given each of them would receive two hundred dollars a month. Wright and Scott parted after Scott had told Wright that he wanted to think it over. There were subsequent conversations, one or two, very shortly after, in one of which Scott told Wright that he would be a party to the proposition which Wright had made\u2026\nI am, accordingly, of opinion that Donnelly J. should have held that res judicata had been established and he should have directed the jury to acquit the appellants under count 2. The convictions will, therefore, be set aside and the appellants acquitted.\nThat still leaves Wright\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside his acquittal by Donnelly J. on counts 3, 4 and 5 and directing a new trial.\nI agree with Schroeder J.A. that as to these counts charging as they do the commission of substantive offences the Crown was not estopped by Wright\u2019s acquittal under count 1 from proceeding to try Wright for the substantive offences: McDonald v. The Queen[16], per Martland J.\nThat does not, however, dispose of the matter because Wright contends and in my opinion correctly that his acquittal under count 1 negatives the essentially criminal element of the charges, namely, that the various sums of money were given corruptly to Constable Scott \u201cwith intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice\u2026\u201d and that if the charges under counts 3, 4 and 5 are to be let go to the jury the trial judge will be obliged to charge the jury in the light of the admissions made on behalf of Wright before Spence J. that in view of Wright\u2019s acquittal on count 1 it would not be open to them to find that the money which Wright admitted having given Scott was given with intent to interfere with the administration of justice. Such being the case in lieu of upholding the direction for a new trial which must necessarily result in an acquittal, this Court should allow the appeal as to counts 3, 4 and 5 and acquit Wright on these charges.\nAppeals dismissed, Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant Wright: E.P.

I960, c. 410\u2014Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156, s. 2\u2014British North America Act, s. 91 (19).\nAn applicant for relief under The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 410, applied to have revised a certain mortgage transaction with the respondent lender. The mortgage was for a face amount of $2,250 with interest at 7 per cent per annum. The sum actually advanced was $1,500 less a commission of $67.50. The difference between the $1,500 and the face amount of $2,250 was made up of a bonus and other charges. The County Court judge set aside the mortgage in part and revised it to provide for payment of a principal sum of $1,500 with interest at 11 per cent per annum. No constitutional issue was raised before him. The respondent raised this issue for the first time in the Court of Appeal. That Court did not hear argument upon the merits and the right of counsel to make submissions thereon was reserved in case The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act should be held to be intra vires of the legislature. Similarly in this Court the merits were not discussed.\nThe Act empowers the Court to grant specified relief in respect of money lent where it finds that the \u201ccost of the loan\u201d is excessive and the transaction harsh and unconscionable. \u201cCost of the loan\u201d is defined to mean, among other things, \u201cthe whole cost to the debtor of money lent and includes interest, discount, subscription, premium, dues, bonus, commission, brokerage fees and charges\u201d. It was held by the Court of Appeal to be legislation in relation to interest, its essential purpose being to afford a remedy to a borrower to have the contract of loan modified, by having interest, \u201cin the broad sense of the term as compensation for the loan\u201d, reduced. The Court also held that the Act was in direct conflict with s. 2 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156.\nOn appeal to this Court it was submitted: (a) that the Act is legislation in relation to a matter coming within s. 92(13) of the British North America Act, Property and Civil Rights in the Province, the subject-matter being rescission and reformation of a contract of loan under the conditions defined by the Act; (b) that in so far as the Act affects any matter coming within the classes of subjects assigned by the British North America Act to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, it does so only incidentally; (c) that there is no conflict or repugnancy between the provisions of the Act and any validly enacted federal legislation.\nHeld (Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Judson and Hall JJ.: Submissions (a), (b) and (c) are well founded and the Act is within the power of the provincial Legislature. It is not legislation in relation to interest but legislation relating to annulment or reformation of contract on the grounds set out in the Act, namely (a) that the cost of the loan is excessive, and (b) that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. The wording of the statute indicates that it is not the rate or amount of interest which is the concern of the legislation but whether the transaction as a whole is one which it would be proper to maintain as having been freely consented to by the debtor.\nThere was error in the judgment of the Court below in following Singer v. Goldhar (1924), 55 O.L.R. 267, in holding that interest in the wide sense includes bonus instead of following subsequent cases which overrule it.\nReference re Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1944, s. 6, [1947] S.C.R. 394, (affirmed, [1949] A.C. 110); Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. I.O.F., [1949] A.C. 513, distinguished; Asconi Building Corporation v. Vocisano, [1947] S.C.R. 358; Day v. Victoria [1938] 3 W.W.R. 161; Ladore v. Bennett, [1939] A.C. 468, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J.: The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act is legislation in relation to Property and Civil Rights in the Province and the Administration of Justice in the Province rather than legislation in relation to Interest. Its primary purpose and effect are to enlarge the equitable jurisdiction to give relief against harsh and unconscionable bargains which the courts have long exercised; it affects, but only incidentally, the subject-matter of interest specified in head 19 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. Per Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The power of a court, which has jurisdiction in an action for the recovery of a debt, to act under The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act arises only if it has found that the cost of the loan is excessive. It must also find the transaction to be harsh and unconscionable, but it may happen, as it did in the present case, that the judge who hears the case decides that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable because of the excessive cost of the loan. The result is that the very court to which a creditor must resort in order to enforce payment of the interest or discount which the Interest Act says he may exact is, by the provincial legislation, empowered to decide whether that interest or discount is, in all the circumstances, excessive. Furthermore, if that court decides that it is excessive and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable, it may relieve the debtor of the obligation of paying that portion of his obligation which it considers to be excessive, and thus is in a position to relieve him from the payment of an obligation which the Parliament of Canada has stated the creditor is entitled to exact from him. In these circumstances there is a direct conflict between the two statutes and, that being so, the legislation of the Canadian Parliament, validly enacted, must prevail.\nLethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. I.O.F., supra; Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia, [1930] A.C. 111, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which reversed an order of Clark Co. Ct.

Lafleur, for the Attorney-General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Fauteux, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The Attorney-General for Ontario appeals from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal1 which declared The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 410, to be unconstitutional. The Attorney-General for Quebec has intervened and supports the appeal. No other province is represented. The appeal is opposed by Barfried Enterprises Ltd., the lender under the impugned transaction, and by the Attorney General of Canada.\nOne Ralph Douglas Sampson, the borrower, applied in the County Court of the County of Wellington to have revised a certain mortgage transaction with the respondent Barfried. The mortgage is dated September 3, 1959, and was for a face amount of $2,250 with interest at 7 per cent per annum. The sum actually advanced was $1,500 less a commission of $67.50. The difference between the $1,500 and the face amount of $2,250 was made up of a bonus and other charges. The County Judge set aside the mortgage in part and revised it to provide for payment of a principal sum of $1,500 with interest at 11 per cent per annum. No constitutional issue was raised before him.\nBarfried raised this issue for the first time in the Court of Appeal. Briefly, The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act empowers the Court to grant specified relief in respect of money lent where it finds that the \u201ccost of the loan\u201d is excessive and the transaction harsh and unconscionable. \u201cCost of the loan\u201d is defined in the Act to mean, among other things, \u201cthe whole cost to the debtor of money lent and includes interest, discount, subscription, premium, dues, bonus, commission, brokerage fees and charges.\u201d This was held by the Court of Appeal to be legislation in relation to interest, its essential purpose being to afford a remedy to a borrower to have the contract of loan modified, by having interest, \u201cin the broad sense of the term as compensation for the loan\u201d, reduced. The Court also held that the Act was in direct conflict with s. 2 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156.\nThe essence of the judgment appealed from is contained in the following passage from the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal:\nThe statute is applicable to only one kind of contract\u2014a money-lending contract. Its essential purpose and object is to provide a remedy to a borrower to enable him to have the terms of such a contract modified. The end result of an application to the Court in accordance with its provisions, if the borrower is entitled to succeed, must be that the interest in the broad sense of that term, payable as compensation for the loan will be reduced. It matters not, in my opinion, whether this result is achieved through the intervention of a Court order or through the operation of a provision in the Act itself fixing a stated rate or scale of interest. In either case it is unquestionably legislation in relation to interest under the pith and substance rule, and, in my opinion, clearly invalid as an infringement of the exclusive legislative power committed to Parliament. Moreover it is in direct conflict with the provisions of s. 2 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156. Accordingly, it is beyond the province\u2019s legislative competence to enact.\nBoth provinces submit common grounds of error:\n(a) That the Act is legislation in relation to a matter coming within s. 92(13) of the British North America Act, Property and Civil Rights in the Province, the subject-matter being rescission and reformation of a contract of loan under the conditions defined by the Act;\n(b) That in so far as the Act affects any matter coming within the Classes of Subjects assigned by the British North America Act to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, it does so only incidentally;\n(c) That there is no conflict or repugnancy between the provisions of the Act and any validly enacted federal legislation.\nThe powers of the Court are stated in s. 2 of the Act, which reads:\n2. Where in respect of money lent, the court finds that, having regard to the risk and to all the circumstances, the cost of the loan is excessive and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable, the court may,\n(a) re-open the transaction and take an account between the creditor and the debtor;\n(b) notwithstanding any statement or settlement of account or any agreement purporting to close previous dealings and create a new obligation, re-open any account already taken and relieve the debtor from payment of any sum in excess of the sum adjudged by the court to be fairly due in respect of the principal and the cost of the loan;\n(c) order the creditor to repay any such excess if the same has been paid or allowed on account by the debtor;\n(d) set aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter any security given or agreement made in respect of the money lent, and, if the creditor has parted with the security, order him to indemnify the debtor.\nThe terms \u201cmoney lent\u201d and \u201ccost of the loan\u201d are defined as follows:\n\u201cMoney lent\u201d includes money advanced on account of any person in any transaction that, whatever its form may be, is substantially one of money-lending or securing the repayment of money so advanced and includes and has always included a mortgage within the meaning of The Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 402, s. 1; 1960, c. 127, s. 1. \u201cCost of the loan\u201d means the whole cost to the debtor of money lent and includes interest, discount, subscription, premium, dues, bonus, commission, brokerage fees and charges, but not actual lawful and necessary disbursements made to a registrar of deeds, a master or local master of titles, a clerk of a county or district court, a sheriff or a treasurer of a municipality.\nIn my opinion all these submissions are well founded and the Act is within the power of the provincial Legislature. The foundation for the judgment under appeal is to be found in the adoption of a wide definition of the subject-matter of interest used in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act reference[2]. The judgment of this Court is that case was affirmed in the Privy Council[3]. Interest was defined:\nIn general terms, the return or consideration or compensation for the use or retention by one person of a sum of money, belonging to, in a colloquial sense, or owed to, another.\nThis is substantially the definition running through the three editions of Halsbury. However, in the third edition (27 Hals., 3rd. ed., p. 7) the text continues:\nInterest accrues de die in diem even if payable only at intervals, and is, therefore, apportionable in point of time between persons entitled in succession to the principal.\nThe day-to-day accrual of interest seems to me to be an essential characteristic. All the other items mentioned in The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act except discount lack this characteristic. They are not interest. In most of these unconscionable schemes of lending the vice is in the bonus.\nIn the cases decided in this Court under s. 6 of the Interest Act, it is settled that a bonus is not interest for the purpose of determining whether there has been compliance with the Act. Section 6 reads:\n\u2026whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended\u2026, no interest whatever shall be\u2026recoverable..., unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance. Schroeder J.A. cited Singer v. Goldhar[4], as defining interest in wide terms. In Singer v. Goldhar there was no provision for interest in the mortgage but there was a very big bonus. The Court of Appeal held that this infringed s. 6 of the Interest Act, the bonus being the same thing as interest. But in Asconi Building Corporation v. Vocisano[5], Kerwin J. pointed out that London Loan and Savings Co. of Canada v. Meagher[6], had overruled Singer v. Goldhar. It is now established that in considering s. 6 of the Interest Act, a bonus is not interest and the fact that interest may be payable on a total sum which includes a bonus does not involve an infringement of s. 6 of the Act. This was recognized in all the reasons delivered in the Asconi case. It was in this context that the wide definition of interest above referred to was used in the Saskatchewan Reference case. The Court held that the subject-matter of the legislation was interest and that to call it a reduction of principal did not change its character.\nThere is, therefore, error in the judgment of Schroeder J.A. in following Singer v. Goldhar in holding that interest in the wide sense includes bonus instead of following the subsequent cases which overrule it.\nThe Lethbridge Northern Irrigation case[7] and the Saskatchewan Farm Security case[8], do not govern the present case. In the first of these cases, provincial legislation reduced the rate of interest on provincial debentures or provincially-guaranteed debentures. This legislation was concerned with interest in its simplest sense and nothing more and was held to be ultra vires.\nThe Saskatchewan Farm Security case was treated as being on the same subject or matter. Legislation which provided that in case of crop failure as defined by the Act, the principal obligation of the mortgagor or purchaser of a farm should be reduced by 4 per cent in that year but that interest should continue to be payable as if the principal had not been reduced, was held to be legislation in relation to interest. Day v. Victoria[9] and Ladore v. Bennett[10] come much closer to the present problem. In Day v. Victoria, legislation altering the rate of interest of municipal debentures was held to be incidental to a recasting of the city debt structure and was within the competence of the province under s. 92(8) \u201cMunicipal Institutions in the Province\u201d, and s. 92(13) \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Province.\u201d In Ladore v. Bennett a reduction in the rate of interest on municipal debentures was incidental to an amalgamation of four municipalities and a consolidation of their separate indebtedness and the issue by the new municipality of its own debentures in place of the old but at a reduced rate of interest.\nThe issue in this appeal is to determine the true nature and character of the Act in question and, in particular, of s. 2 above quoted. The Act deals with rights arising from contract and is prima facie legislation in relation to civil rights and, as such, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province under s. 92(13). Is it removed from the exclusive provincial legislative jurisdiction by s. 91(19) of the Act, which assigns jurisdiction over interest to the federal authority? In my opinion, it is not legislation in relation to interest but legislation relating to annulment or reformation of contract on the grounds set out in the Act, namely, (a) that the cost of the loan is excessive, and (b) that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. The wording of the statute indicates that it is not the rate or amount of interest which is the concern of the legislation but whether the transaction as a whole is one which it would be proper to maintain as having been freely consented to by the debtor. If one looks at it from the point of view of English law it might be classified as an extension of the doctrine of undue influence. As pointed out by the Attorney-General for Quebec, if one looks at it from the point of view of the civil law, it can be classified as an extension of the doctrine of lesion dealt with in articles 1001 to 1012 of the Civil Code. The theory of the legislation is that the Court is enabled to relieve a debtor, at least in part, of the obligations of a contract to which in all the circumstances of the case he cannot be said to have given a free and valid consent. The fact that interference with such a contract may involve interference with interest as one of the constituent elements of the contract is incidental. The legislature considered this type of contract as one calling for its interference because of the vulnerability of the contract as having been imposed on one party by extreme economic necessity. The Court in a proper case is enabled to set aside the contract, rewrite it and impose the new terms.\nThis legislation raises the very case which the Privy Council refrained from deciding in the Saskatchewan Farm Security case when it said, at p. 126:\nTheir Lordships are not called on to discuss, and do not pronounce on, a case where a provincial enactment renders null and void the whole contract to repay money with interest. Here the contracts survive, and once the conclusion is reached that, as Kerwin J. said, \u201cthe legislation here in question is definitely in relation to interest,\u201d reliance on such a decision as Ladore v. Bennett is misplaced.\nUnder the Ontario statute an exercise of judicial power necessarily involves the nullity or setting aside of the contract and the substitution of a new contractual obligation based upon what the Court deems it reasonable to write within the statutory limitations. Legislation such as this should not be characterized as legislation in relation to interest. I would hold that it was validly enacted, that no question of conflict arises.\nI would therefore reverse the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and hold that the Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act is within the powers of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. The record should be referred to the Court of Appeal to be dealt with on the merits. There should be no order as to costs in this Court.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The constitutional question raised on this appeal and the relevant statutory provisions are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nThe facts with which the learned County Court Judge had to deal may be briefly stated. The applicant for relief under The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, one Ralph Douglas Sampson, had executed a first mortgage to Barfried Enterprises Ltd., dated September 3, 1959, under the terms of which he was obligated to pay $2,250 with interest at 7 per cent per annum as follows:\nThe sum of Twenty-five ($25.00) Dollars shall become due and payable on the 1st day of October, 1959 and on the 1st day of each and every month thereafter up to and including the 1st day of August, 1964.\nThe aforesaid monthly payments shall be applied firstly in payment of interest computed from the 1st day of September, 1959 and calculated half-yearly not in advance as well after as before maturity and both before and after default on the 1st days of March and September in each year until the mortgage is fully paid, and secondly in reduction of principal.\nThe balance of the said principal sum together with interest as aforesaid shall become due and payable on the 1st day of September, 1964.\nThe amount actually advanced to Sampson was $1,432.50; the difference between this amount and the $2,250 being made up of a bonus of $750 and a commission of $67.50. Both of these items would form part of the \u201ccost of the loan\u201d as defined in s.1(a) of The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act. For the reasons given by my brother Judson I am of opinion that neither of these items is \u201cinterest\u201d, within the meaning of that term as used in the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156. If, contrary to this view, the bonus and commission should be held to be interest then it would seem that s. 6 of the Interest Act would prevent the mortgagee from recovering any interest. That section reads as follows:\n6. Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan that involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable on any part of the principal money advanced unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThe Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act appears to me to be legislation in relation to Property and Civil Rights in the Province and the Administration of Justice in the Province, rather than legislation in relation to Interest. Its primary purpose and effect are to enlarge the equitable jurisdiction to give relief against harsh and unconscionable bargains which the courts have long exercised; it affects, but only incidentally, the subject-matter of Interest specified in head 19 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. For this reason and for the reasons given by my brother Judson I agree with his conclusion that The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act is not ultra vires of the Legislature of Ontario.\nParticular cases may arise in which the provisions of the Provincial Act will come into conflict with those of the Dominion Act. In such cases the Dominion Act will of course prevail. The case at bar does not appear to me to be such a case. It has not been suggested that the applicant could have obtained any relief from a bargain to pay interest at 7 per cent on the amount actually advanced to him. It is of the items other than interest making up the \u201ccost of the loan\u201d that complaint is made.\nIn the reasons of the Court of Appeal it is stated that the Court did not hear argument upon the merits and that the right of counsel to make submissions thereon was reserved in case the Act should be held to be intra vires of the legislature. Similarly in this Court the merits were not discussed.\nI would set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and direct that the record should be returned to that Court to deal with the merits. There should be no order as to costs in this Court.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The question in issue in this appeal is as to the constitutional validity of The Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 410, the relevant portions of which provide as follows:\n1. In this Act,\n(a) \u201ccost of the loan\u201d means the whole cost to the debtor of money lent and includes interest, discount, subscription, premium, dues, bonus, commission, brokerage fees and charges, but not actual lawful and necessary disbursements made to a registrar of deeds, a master or local master of titles, a clerk of a county or district court, a sheriff or a treasurer of a municipality;\n(b) \u201ccourt\u201d means a court having jurisdiction in an action for the recovery of a debt or money demand to the amount claimed by a creditor in respect of money lent;\n(c) \u201ccreditor\u201d includes the person advancing money lent and the assignee of any claim arising or security given in respect of money lent;\n(d) \u201cdebtor\u201d means a person to whom or on whose account money lent is advanced and includes every surety and endorser or other person liable for the repayment of money lent or upon any agreement or collateral or other security given in respect thereof; (e) \u201cmoney lent\u201d includes money advanced on account of any person in any transaction that, whatever its form may be, is substantially one of money-lending or securing the repayment of money so advanced and includes and has always included a mortgage within the meaning of The Mortgages Act.\n2. Where, in respect of money lent, the court finds that, having regard to the risk and to all the circumstances, the cost of the loan is excessive and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable, the court may,\n(a) re-open the transaction and take an account between the creditor and the debtor;\n(b) notwithstanding any statement or settlement of account or any agreement purporting to close previous dealings and create a new obligation, re-open any account already taken and relieve the debtor from payment of any sum in excess of the sum adjudged by the court to be fairly due in respect of the principal and the cost of the loan;\n(c) order the creditor to repay any such excess if the same has been paid or allowed on account by the debtor;\n(d) set aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter any security given or agreement made in respect of the money lent, and, if the creditor has parted with the security, order him to indemnify the debtor.\nThe Court of Appeal of Ontario, before which the issue as to the constitutionality of this enactment was first raised, held unanimously that it was ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. Schroeder J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said:\nThe statute is applicable to only one kind of contract\u2014a money-lending contract. Its essential purpose and object is to provide a remedy to a borrower to enable him to have the terms of such a contract modified. The end result of an application to the Court in accordance with its provisions, if the borrower is entitled to succeed, must be that the interest in the broad sense of that term, payable as compensation for the loan will be reduced. It matters not, in my opinion, whether this result is achieved through the intervention of a Court order or through the operation of a provision in the Act itself fixing a stated rate or scale of interest. In either case it is unquestionably legislation in relation to interest under the pith and substance rule, and, in my opinion, clearly invalid as an infringement of the exclusive legislative power committed to Parliament. Moreover it is in direct conflict with the provisions of s. 2 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156. Accordingly, it is beyond the province\u2019s legislative competence to enact. Since, therefore, the learned Judge was without jurisdiction to pronounce the Order in appeal, that order is without effect and must be quashed: Display Service Ltd. v. Victoria Medical Building Ltd., [1958] O.R. 759 at p. 763.\nIt is the contention of the appellant, the Attorney-General for Ontario, supported by the intervenant, the Attorney-General of Quebec, that this legislation is within the jurisdiction of the Province to enact, under subss. 13 and 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, as relating to Property and Civil Rights in the Province and to Matters of a merely local or private Nature in the Province.\nWhether or not this contention could be maintained successfully, in the absence of legislation by the Parliament of Canada in the same field, it is unnecessary for me to consider, since I have reached the conclusion that the provisions of the Act under consideration come into conflict directly with the provisions of s. 2 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156, which provides as follows:\n2. Except as otherwise provided by this or by any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, any person may stipulate for, allow and exact, on any contract or agreement whatsoever, any rate of interest or discount that is agreed upon.\nThat the validity of the provisions of the Interest Act, under s. 91(19) of the British North America Act, is unquestionable was stated by Viscount Caldecote L.C. in Board of Trustees of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. Independent Order of Foresters[11]. Section 2 of that Act, above quoted, provides that, except as provided by that Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, a person may not only stipulate for any rate of interest or discount that is agreed upon, but may exact the same. Parliament has, therefore, given to a creditor, who has agreed with his debtor upon a rate of interest or discount, the legal right to demand and to enforce payment of the same.\nAs Schroeder J.A. has pointed out in the passage from his judgment previously quoted, the Ontario statute applies only to money-lending contracts. It defines \u201ccost of the loan\u201d as including interest and discount. It purports to confer upon a Court, which has jurisdiction in an action for the recovery of a debt, the power, if it finds the cost of the loan to be excessive and the transaction to be harsh and unconscionable, to reopen the transaction and to relieve the debtor from payment of any sum in excess of the sum which it adjudges to be fair and reasonable.\nThe power of the Court to act under this Act arises only if it has found that the cost of the loan is excessive. It is true that it must also find the transaction to be harsh and unconscionable, but it may happen, as it did in the present case, that the judge who hears the case decides that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable because of the excessive cost of the loan. The result is that the very Court to which a creditor must resort in order to enforce payment of the interest or discount which the Interest Act says he may exact is, by the Provincial legislation, empowered to decide whether that interest or discount is, in all the circumstances, excessive. Furthermore, if that Court decides that it is excessive and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable, it may relieve the debtor of the obligation of paying that portion of his obligation which it considers to be excessive, and thus is in a position to relieve him from the payment of an obligation which the Parliament of Canada has stated the creditor is entitled to exact from him.\nIn these circumstances there is a direct conflict between the two statutes and, that being so, the legislation of the Canadian Parliament, validly enacted, must prevail. As Lord Tomlin said in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[12]:\nThere can be a domain in which provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap, in which case neither legislation will be ultra vires if the field is clear, but if the field is not clear and the two legislations meet the Dominion legislation must prevail.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the legislation in question is ultra vires of the Ontario Legislature and this appeal should be dismissed with costs. No costs should be awarded against or in favour of the intervenant.\nAppeal allowed, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.R.

Section 9(6) (d) prohibits an employer from making any deduction from wages of an employee on behalf of a trade union unless the trade union delivers to the employer a statutory declaration that it is complying with and will continue to comply with s. 9(6) (c). Section 9(6) (e) provides that any moneys deducted from the wages of an employee and paid to a trade union that does not comply with this subsection are the property of the employee, and that the trade union is liable to the employe for any moneys so deducted.\nThe plaintiff, a local unit of a trade union, was certified, under the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, as the bargaining agent for a group of employees of the defendant company. Under the provisions of the collective agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, the latter agreed to honour written assignments of wages given by employees in that group in favour of the plaintiff and to remit to the plaintiff each month the amount collected. Following the enactment of subs. (6) of s. 9 of the Act, the defendant advised the plaintiff that it could no longer honour the written assignments unless the plaintiff supplied it with the form of statutory declaration required by para. (d). The plaintiff refused to supply this and sued the company to compel it to honour the assignments, contending and seeking a declaration that paras. (c), (d) and (e) of subs. 6 were ultra vires of the Legislature of British Columbia. The trial judge's decision that the statutory provisions under attack were intra vires of the provincial legislature was affirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. An appeal from that judgment was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The Labour Relations Act materially affected the civil rights of individual employees by conferring upon certified trade unions the power to bind them by agreement and the power to make agreements which compel membership in a union. Such legislation falls within the powers of the provincial legislature to enact, as being labour legislation, and, therefore, relating to property and civil rights in the province. The legislation under attack here did nothing more than to provide that the fee paid as a condition of membership in such an entity by each individual employee cannot be expended for a political object which may not command his support. That individual was brought into association with the trade union by statutory requirement. The same legislature which required this could protect his civil rights by providing that he cannot be compelled to assist in the financial promotion of political causes with which he disagrees. Such legislation was, in pith and substance, legislation in respect of civil rights in the province.\nThe question in issue was not as to the right to engage in political activity, but as to the existence of an unfettered right to use funds obtained in certain ways for the support of a political party or candidate. A trade union, when it becomes certified as a bargaining agent, becomes a legal entity (International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Etc., Local 213 v. Therien, [1960] S.C.R. 265). When the legislature clothes that entity with wide powers for the exaction of membership fees, by methods which previously it did not, in law, possess, it can set limits to the objects for which funds so obtained may be applied.\nReference re Alberta Statutes, [1938] S.C.R. 100; Switzman v. Elbling and Attorney-General of Quebec, [1957] S.C.R. 285, discussed.\nPer Ritchie J.: The addition of subs. (6) to s. 9 of the Act, was directed towards ensuring that legislative machinery involving the adjustment of civil rights which was created for the regulation of relations between employers and employees should not be used for the collection of political party funds or in such manner as to curtail the fundamental political rights of any individual employee. Just as it was within the power of the province under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act to create this legislative machinery for the the purpose of furthering the cause of industrial peace so it was within its power to control its use for the same purpose.\nThe impugned legislation did not in any sense preclude a trade union from indulging in political activity or from collecting political party funds from its members. Its effect on political elections, if any, could only be characterized as incidental and this would not alter the fact that the amendment was a part and parcel of legislation passed \"in relation to\" labour relations and not \"in relation to\" elections either provincial or federal.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The subject-matter of the legislation in question concerned political and constitutional rights, not property and civil rights. Clause (c) had no relationship whatever to trade union action designed to promote collective bargaining, to change conditions of employment or the contract of employment. Its sole object and purpose was to prevent trade unions from making political contributions out of their own moneys.\nThe control of political behaviour did not fall within the field of labour relations and was not within the provincial power. The legislation in question was legislation in relation to federal elections, a field exclusively within the Dominion power.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The effect of the impugned legislation in the known circumstances to which it was to be applied was a virtually total prohibition of the expenditure by a trade union of any of its funds to further the interests of any political party or candidate in a federal election; it was the prohibition of, inter alia, a political activity in the federal field which prior to the enactment was lawful in Canada. The argument that this prohibition of an heretofore lawful and indeed normal political activity in regard to federal elections is ancillary, or necessarily incidental, to any of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act which are within the provincial power was unacceptable.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: Under our constitution, any person or group of persons in Canada is entitled to promote the advancement of views on public questions by financial as well as by vocal or written means. Accordingly, any individual, corporation, or voluntary association such as a trade union, is entitled to contribute financially to support any political activity not prohibited by law.\nWhatever power a provincial legislature may have to regulate expenditures for provincial political activities, it cannot legislate to regulate or prohibit contributions made to assist in defraying the cost of federal political or electoral activities. Similarly, Parliament itself cannot legislate to regulate or prohibit financial contributions for provincial political or electoral purposes except to the extent that such regulation or prohibition is necessarily incidental to the exercise of its powers under s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nSubsection 6 (c) of s. 9 of the Labour Relations Act, could not be supported as being in relation to property and civil rights in the province within s. 92(13) of the British North America Act, nor could it be said to be in relation to matters of a merely local or private nature in the province.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Whittaker J.

Q.C., for the Attorney General of Saskatchewan.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014Prior to its amendment in 1961, s. 9 of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, contained, inter alia, the following provisions:\n9. (1) Every employer shall honour a written assignment of wages to a trade-union certified under this Act, except where the assignment is declared null and void by a Judge or is revoked by the assignor.\n***\n(3) Except where an assignor of wages revokes the assignment by giving the employer written notice of the revocation, or except where a Judge declares an assignment to be null and void, the employer shall remit at least once each month, to the trade-union certified under this Act and named in the assignment as assignee, the fees and dues deducted, together with a written statement containing the names of the employees for whom the deductions were made and the amount of each deduction.\nOn March 27, 1961, the Labour Relations Act Amendment Act, 1961, (B.C.), c. 31, came into effect. It made a number of amendments to provisions of the Labour Relations Act, among which was the addition to s. 9 of a new subs. (6), which provides as follows:\n(6) (a) No employer and no one acting on behalf of an employer shall refuse to employ or to continue to employ a person and no one shall discriminate against a person in regard to employment only because that person refuses to make a contribution or expenditure to or on behalf of any political party or to or on behalf of a candidate for political office.\n(b) No trade-union and no person acting on behalf of a trade-union shall refuse membership to or refuse to continue membership of a person in a trade-union, and no one shall discriminate against a person in regard to membership in a trade-union or in regard to employment only because that person refuses to make or makes a contribution or expenditure, directly or indirectly, to or on behalf of any political party or to or on behalf of a candidate for political office.\n(c) (i) No trade-union and no person acting on behalf of a trade-union shall directly or indirectly contribute to or expend on behalf of any political party or to or on behalf of any candidate for political office any moneys deducted from an employee's wages under subsection (1) or a collective agreement, or paid as a condition of membership in the trade-union.\n(ii) Remuneration of a member of a trade-union for his services in an official union position held by him while seeking election or upon being elected to public office is not a violation of this clause.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act or the provisions of any collective agreement, unless the trade-union delivers to the employer who is in receipt of an assignment under subsection (1) or who is party to a collective agreement, a statutory declaration, made by an officer duly authorized in that behalf, that the trade-union is complying with and will continue to comply with clause (c) during the term of the assignment or during the term of the collective agreement, neither the employer nor a person acting on behalf of the employer shall make any deduction whatsoever from the wages of an employee on behalf of the trade-union.\n(e) Any moneys deducted from the wages of an employee and paid to a trade-union that does not comply with this subsection are the property of the employee, and the trade-union is liable to the employee for any moneys so deducted.\nThe issue in the present case is as to the constitutional validity of paras. (c), (d) and (e) of subs. (6), and primarily we are concerned with para. (c), as paras. (d) and (e) must stand or fall with it.\nThe appellant is a local unit of the Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union and was certified, under the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, as the bargaining agent for a group of employees of the respondent company at its refinery at Ioco, British Columbia. Under the provisions of the collective agreement between the appellant and the respondent company, the company had agreed to honour written assignments of wages given by employees in that group in favour of the appellant and to remit to the appellant each month the amount collected.\nFollowing the enactment of subs. (6) of s. 9 of the Act, the respondent company advised the appellant that it could no longer honour the written assignments unless the appellant supplied it with the form of statutory declaration required by para. (d). The appellant refused to supply this and sued the respondent company to compel it to honour the assignments, contending and seeking a declaration that paras. (c), (d) and (e) of subs. (6) were ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia. Notice was given to the respondent the Attorney-General of British Columbia (hereinafter referred to as \"the respondent\"), who intervened in the proceedings. The position of the respondent company throughout the proceedings has been that it is precluded from honouring the assignments without having received the required statutory declaration, so long as the legislation in question remains in effect. It has taken the position that it is substantially in the position of a stakeholder, with no interest in the proceedings and prepared to abide by the result. The learned trial judge held that the statutory provisions under attack were intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia. This decision was affirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] and it is from that judgment that the present appeal is brought.\nThe appellant contends that the clauses in question are ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, on the ground that the authority to enact them is not to be found within any of the subsections of s. 92 of the British North America Act; that they relate to the subject of federal elections and that they seek to curtial the fundamental rights of Canadian citizens essential to the proper functioning of parliamentary institutions. It is argued that they affect the political activity of trade unions, the right of which to engage in such activity is beyond the powers of a provincial legislature to curtail.\nThe submission of the respondent is that the legislation in question is a limitation only of the power to use certain specified funds for particular purposes by trade unions; that this limitation is valid legislation in respect of the field of labour relations and that the Legislature of British Columbia has the authority to enact it as being within the field of property and civil rights in the province, within s. 92(13) of the British North America Act.\nThat the field of legislation in relation to labour relations in a province is within the sphere of provincial legislative jurisdiction is established beyond doubt in the case of Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[3] This is not disputed by the appellant, which, however, contends that the clauses in question are not in respect of labour relations at all.\nIn order to determine these issues it is necessary to consider the provisions of the Labour Relations Act as a whole and, in particular, to consider the true purpose and effect of those clauses which are under attack.\nThe object of this Act, which is similar to like statutes in other provinces of Canada, may be summarized in the words of MacDonald J., in Re Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia)[4]:\nTo my mind the object of the Act is to facilitate collective bargaining and stabilize industrial relations by enabling a union to establish before the Board its ability to represent a group of employees; and, with this controversial question settled, to require the employer, upon notice from the union, to negotiate with it and (with the aid of conciliation services), to promote the conclusion of an agreement which shall be legally enforceable; and generally to ensure a greater measure of industrial peace to the public. Certification is, of course, not necessary for collective bargaining, but the policy of the Act undoubtedly is to promote it as a means to more orderly bargaining.\nThe instrument for collective bargaining on behalf of employees is a trade union, which is defined, in s. 2(1) of the Act, as follows:\n\"trade-union\" means a local or provincial organization or association of employees, or a local or provincial branch of a national or international organization or association of employees within the Province, that has as one of its purposes the regulation in the Province of relations between employers and employees through collective bargaining, but does not include any organization or association of employees that is dominated or influenced by an employer;\nWhile it is theoretically possible for a collective agreement to be made with an uncertified trade union, it is only possible for a trade union to become the bargaining agent for a unit of employees who are not all members of the union by obtaining certification under the Act. It is clear that the Act is primarily concerned with the procedures necessary to obtain certification and for collective bargaining after certification has been obtained.\nThose procedures materially affect the rights of employees in any unit suitable for collective bargaining and of their employer, who is compelled to bargain collectively with a certified trade union. The primary purpose of the Act is, therefore, to spell out the respective rights and obligations of the employer, the employee and the certified trade union, each of which is subject to its mandatory powers.\nA trade union, as defined in the Act, may obtain certification for a group of employees, in accordance with the statutory requirements. It may apply for certification if it claims to have as members in good standing a majority of the employees in that group. When a trade union has been certified by the Labour Relations Board, it has exclusive authority to bargain collectively on behalf of the unit and to bind the individuals in that unit by a collective agreement. It can require an employer to enter into collective bargaining, with a view to the making of a collective agreement, and such an agreement, when made, is binding, not only upon the trade union which has entered into the agreement, but also upon every employee covered by the agreement. Every person who is bound by a collective agreement is obligated, by the Act, to do everything he is required to do and to refrain from doing anything that he is required to refrain from doing by the provisions of the collective agreement.\nThe position is, therefore, that a trade union can, under the provisions of the Act, become the bargaining agent for all the employees within a particular unit, irrespective of the individual wishes of the minority of employees within that group, and that it can then bind each of such employees by the collective agreement which it makes. It is placed in a position to persuade those employees within the group, who were not members of the union, to seek membership, for it is now their bargaining agent, entering collective agreements on their behalf. In some instances the form of the collective agreement which it makes may compel their contribution to its funds, whether they are members or not. But this is not all. Section 8 of the Act provides as follows:\n8. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preclude the parties to a collective agreement from inserting in the collective agreement a provision requiring, as a condition of employment, membership in a specified trade-union, or granting a preference of employment to members of a specified trade-union, or to preclude the carrying-out of such provisions.\nWhere a collective agreement contains a provision of the kind contemplated in this section, membership in the trade union becomes a condition of employment within the group of employees in question and loss of membership automatically involves loss of employment. A person seeking employment in such a group, or desiring to remain as an employee within it, has no alternative but to obtain membership in the trade union which is its bargaining agent, and, for that purpose, to pay to it such dues as are imposed as a condition of membership in it. I now propose to consider the provisions of the clauses in question in this case. The appellant's attack is mainly upon clause (c) (i), which prohibits a trade union from contributing to, or expending on behalf of, a political party, or a candidate for political office, directly or indirectly, moneys deducted from an employee's wages under the check-off (whether statutory or pursuant to a collective agreement), or paid to it as a condition of membership in the trade union.\nClause (c) (i) deals first with funds obtained by the checkoff, which is imposed under the statute by the provisions of s. 9(1). This right of checkoff was created by the statute and granted as a statutory privilege to the trade union. The legislature which conferred that statutory right could also take it away again and, if the right can be eliminated entirely, in my opinion it is equally possible for the legislature to apply limitations in respect of the exercise of the power thus created.\nThe second method is by check-off authorized by a collective agreement. Again, as already pointed out, the right of a trade union to bind all employees in a specific group, whether members of the union or not, by the collective agreement which it negotiates is one which is conferred by the Act, and the legislature which conferred it could also eliminate it. It seems to me that if the legislature can eliminate that right entirely it can also impose limitations in respect of its use.\nFinally, there is the provision as to membership dues paid by an employee to a trade union as a condition of his membership in it. This is the point on which counsel for the appellant concentrated a good deal, of his argument. Membership fees paid to a trade union were, he contended, its own property, which, as a voluntary association, it is entitled to disburse in such manner as its own constitution permits and as the majority of its membership decides; a trade union is entitled to engage in political activities as a free association of individuals and, therefore, within the limits previously mentioned, could disburse its funds for such purposes, and any attempted interference with such powers by a provincial legislature would be an interference with the democratic process in Canada and, therefore, beyond its powers. This argument would have considerable force as applied to a purely voluntary association. However, the position of a trade union, which has been certified as a bargaining agent under the Act, is substantially different and every association within the definition of a trade union in the Act is empowered to seek certification. Such a union has, as a result of certification, ceased to be a purely voluntary association of individuals. It has become a legal entity, with the status of a bargaining agent for a group of employees, all of whom are thereby brought into association with it, whether as members, or as persons whom it can bind by a collective agreement, even though not members. It must, as their agent, deal with the members of the group which it represents equitably. It is clothed with a power to make binding agreements which can compel membership in it as a condition of employment. I find it difficult to regard as a free, voluntary association of individuals an entity which, by statute, is clothed with a power to require membership in it, and the consequent payment of dues to it as the price which must be paid by an individual for the right to be employed in a particular employment group.\nThe Labour Relations Act has materially affected the civil rights of individual employees by conferring upon certified trade unions the power to bind them by agreement and the power to make agreements which will compel membership in a union. Such legislation falls within the powers of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia to enact, as being labour legislation, and, therefore, relating to property and civil rights in the province. The legislation which is under attack in the present proceedings, in my opinion, does nothing more than to provide that the fee paid as a condition of membership in such an entity by each individual employee cannot be expended for a political object which may not command his support. That individual has been brought into association with the trade union by statutory requirement. The same legislature which requires this can protect his civil rights by providing that he cannot be compelled to assist in the financial promotion of political causes with which he disagrees. Such legislation is, in pith and substance, legislation in respect of civil rights in the province. Considerable reliance was placed by the appellant on the judgment of Chief Justice Duff in respect of the Alberta Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information[5]. In that judgment, which was concurred in by Davis J., Chief Justice Duff dealt with the right of public discussion under the constitution established by the British North America Act and the authority of the Parliament of Canada to legislate for the protection of that right. He said, at p. 134:\nThe question, discussed in argument, of the validity of the legislation before us, considered as a wholly independent enactment having no relation to the Alberta Social Credit Act, presents no little difficulty. Some degree of regulation of newspapers everybody would concede to the provinces. Inded, there is a very wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly are invested with legislative authority over newspapers; but the limit, in our opinion, is reached when the legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada as contemplated by the provisions of The British North America Act and the statutes of the Dominion of Canada.\nIt may be noted, in passing, that he did not decide whether or not the particular legislation which was before him exceeded the limits which he had defined.\nThe test stated is as to whether legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada. The appellant, in this case, contends that the legislation in issue does effect such a curtailment in respect of the right of association for political purposes.\nThe legislation, however, does not affect the right of any individual to engage in any form of political activity which he may desire. It does not prevent a trade union from engaging in political activities. It does not prevent it from soliciting funds from its members for political purposes, or limit, in any way, the expenditure of funds so raised. It does prevent the use of funds, which are obtained in particular ways, from being used for political purposes.\nThe question in issue here is not as to the right to engage in political activity, but as to the existence of an unfettered right to use funds obtained in certain ways for the support of a political party or candidate. I think it is clear that, if such legislation were required, a provincial legislature could prevent the contribution of trust funds for such a purpose and that, equally, it could prevent the use by a corporation, created under provincial law, of funds derived from the sale of its bonds or shares for such a purpose. A trade union, when it becomes certified as a bargaining agent, becomes a legal entity (International Brotherhood of Teamsters Etc., Local 213 v. Therien[6]). When the legislature clothes that entity with wide powers for the exaction of membership fees, by methods which previously it did not, in law, possess, it can set limits to the objects for which funds so obtained may be applied. Legislation of this kind is not, in my view, a substantial interference with the working of parliamentary institutions.\nReference was also made to the decision of this Court in Switzman v. Elbling and Attorney-General of Quebec[7]. In that case it was held that the Act Respecting Communistic Propaganda of the Province of Quebec was ultra vires of the Legislature of that Province. The majority of the Court decided the issue on the basis that the legislation in question was in respect of criminal law and, therefore, within the exclusive competence of the Parliament of Canada. Three members of the Court decided that the legislation was not within any of the powers ascribed to the provinces and that it constituted an unjustifiable interference with freedom of speech and expression essential to the democratic form of government established in Canada.\nOne of the three judges, Rand J., stated the issue at p. 305:\nThe ban is directed against the freedom or civil liberty of the actor; no civil right of anyone is affected nor is any civil remedy created. The aim of the statute is, by means of penalties, to prevent what is considered a poisoning of men's minds, to shield the individual from exposure to dangerous ideas, to protect him, in short, from his own thinking propensities. There is nothing of civil rights in this; it is to curtail or proscribe those freedoms which the majority so far consider to be the condition of social cohesion and its ultimate stabilizing force.\nIn my opinion, the present situation is quite different. What the Legislature has provided here is that, though the civil rights of employees in the Province may be curtailed by enabling a trade union to bargain for them, to make agreements on their behalf, to enter collective agreements which may make union membership a condition of their employment and to collect membership fees by a system of check-off, they cannot be required, by the payment of union dues, to contribute to a political party or candidate selected for them by the trade union itself.\nThe appellant submitted that, even if the legislation were to be considered as, in pith and substance, designed to safeguard the fundamental right of an individual to support the party of his own choice, it would still be ultra vires of a provincial legislature. It was contended that only the Canadian Parliament could legislate in relation to individual political freedom. The submission was that, as a provincial legislature could not legislate to derogate from such rights, conversely it could not legislate for their protection.\nI do not agree with this contention. It is the very fact that provincial legislation, in some instances, has apparently sought to derogate from fundamental political freedoms which has led to the expression of the view by some members of the Court, in cases such as the Alberta Press case and Switzman v. Elbling and Attorney General of Quebec, that it could not be regarded as falling within the sphere of property and civil rights in the province, within s. 92 of the British North America Act. The same reasoning does not apply to legislation which seeks to protect certain civil rights of individuals in a province from interference by other persons also in that province. Legislation of that kind appears to me to be legislation in respect of civil rights within the province.\nThe appellant also contended that the enactment by the Parliament of Canada of s. 36 of c. 26, Statutes of Canada 1908, An Act to amend the Dominion Elections Act, which provision was repeated in s. 10 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1920 (Canada), c. 46, and again in s. 9 of the Dominion Elections Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 53, but repealed in 1930, showed that the legislation in question here must have been an encroachment on the field reserved to the Parliament of Canada. That section provided:\n36. No company or association other than one incorporated for political purposes alone shall, directly or indirectly, contribute, loan, advance, pay or promise or offer to pay any money or its equivalent to, or for, or in aid of, any candidate at an election, or to, or for, or in aid of, any political party, committee, or association, or to or for or in aid of any company incorporated for political purposes, or to, or for, or in furtherance of, any political purpose whatever, or for the indemnification or reimbursement of any person for moneys so used.\nThe argument was that this section clearly indicates that legislation regarding contributions to federal political parties is a matter outside the sphere of provincial legislation. But the section did not enable an association or company to make contributions for political purposes. It, in terms, forbade them. It does not follow that without that provision every association and company did have the legal right to make such contributions. The right of any association or company to do so would depend upon the scope of its lawful authority, which, in certain cases in any event, would depend upon the powers which had been conferred upon them by provincial legislation.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed. The Attorney-General of British Columbia advised that no order as to costs is asked for. The position of the respondent, Imperial Oil Limited, in these proceedings has already been described. No submission was made on its behalf with respect to the constitutional validity of the legislation in question. In view of these circumstances I do not think there should be any order as to costs in favour of this respondent. There should be no order as to costs in favour of or against the intervenant, the Attorney General of Saskatchewan.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts and the relevant statutory provisions are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nI agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and wish to add only a few words.\nThis appears to me to be a case in which it is particularly desirable to recall the words of Sir Montague Smith in Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[8], when, speaking of the duty of the courts to define in the particular case before them the limits of the powers of Parliament and of the provincial legislatures, he said at p. 109:\nIn performing this difficult duty, it will be a wise course for those on whom it is thrown, to decide each case which arises as best they can, without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute (i.e. the British North America Act) than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nThe question to be decided is whether the enactment of clause (c) (i) of subs. 6 of s. 9 of the Labour Relations Act is within the powers of the provincial legislature. The clause is an absolute and unconditional prohibition of the contribution by a trade union to any political party or any candidate for political office of any moneys paid to the union as a condition of membership. It may well be that the Court could take judicial notice of the fact that moneys so paid make up practically the whole of the income of a trade union, but in the case before us there is uncontradicted evidence that, generally speaking, this is so as regards trade unions in British Columbia and that moneys so paid to the appellant union made up more than 99.8 per cent of its total revenue for the year 1960, the year preceding the issue of the writ.\nThe effect of the impugned legislation in the known circumstances to which it is to be applied is a virtually total prohibition of the expenditure by a trade union of any of its funds to further the interests of any political party or candidate in a federal election; it is the prohibition of, inter alia, a political activity in the federal field which prior to the enactment was lawful in Canada.\nThe prohibition, if valid, would be operative even if the forbidden contribution were approved and directed by a unanimous vote of all the members of the union concerned.\nI find myself unable to accept the argument that this prohibition of an heretofore lawful and indeed normal political activity in regard to federal elections is ancillary, or necessarily incidental, to any of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act which are within the provincial power.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Judson.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons of my brother Judson and I desire to add only a few brief comments. In Switzman v. Elbling and Attorney-General of Quebec[9]\u2014as my brother Judson has pointed out\u2014three judges of the Court held that the legislation there in question constituted an unjustifiable interference with the freedom of speech and expression essential under the democratic form of parliamentary government established in Canada.\nIn the Switzman case, I expressed the view that the parliamentary institutions established in Canada by the British North America Act were those institutions as they existed in the United Kingdom in 1867. In the Reference re Alberta Statutes[10] Sir Lyman Duff pointed out that those institutions contemplated a parliament and provincial legislatures working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion, and he expressed the opinion that any attempt to abrogate or suppress the exercise of such right of public debate and discussion was beyond the competence of a provincial legislature. With that view I am in agreement.\nParliamentary institutions as they existed in the United Kingdom in 1867 included the right of political parties to function as a means, whereby persons who broadly speaking share similar views as to what public policy should be, can seek to make those views prevail. It is common knowledge that political activities in general, and the conduct of elections in particular, involve legitimate and necessary expenditures by political parties and candidates, for the payment of which no provision is made out of public funds. That this is so is implicit in the terms of the Canada Elections Act, 1960 (Canada), c. 39.\nThe right to join and to support a political party and the right of public debate and discussion fall within that class of rights categorized by Mr. Justice Mignault in his Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 1, p. 131, as droits publics, and in my opinion, under our constitution, any person or group of persons in Canada is entitled to promote the advancement of views on public questions by financial as well as by vocal or written means. It follows that any individual, corporation, or voluntary association such as a trade union, is entitled to contribute financially to support any political activity not prohibited by law. Whatever power a provincial legislature may have to regulate expenditures for provincial political activities, in my opinion it cannot legislate to regulate or prohibit contributions made to assist in defraying the cost of federal political or electoral activities. Similarly, for the reasons which I expressed in the Switzman case, in my view Parliament itself cannot legislate to regulate or prohibit financial contributions for provincial political or electoral purposes except to the extent that such regulation or prohibition is necessarily incidental to the exercise of its powers under s. 91of the British North America Act.\nThe legislative purpose of subs. 6(c) of s. 9 of the British Columbia Labour Relations Act is clear and unambiguous. That purpose is to prohibit political contributions made directly or indirectly by one class of voluntary organization\u2014a trade union\u2014out of moneys received as a condition of membership, whether or not there is a check-off. Legislation of this character cannot be supported as being in relation to property and civil rights in the province within head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, nor can it be said to be in relation to matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. In my opinion, it is clearly ultra vires.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Judson.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant union sued Imperial Oil Limited for specific performance of the provisions in its collective agreement relating to the right of check-off. The company defended on the ground that certain amendments to the British Columbia Labour Relations Act enacted in 1961 prevented it from giving effect to these provisions. The union claimed that these amendments were beyond the powers of the legislature. The learned trial judge dismissed the action and his dismissal was affirmed on appeal. The defendant company, whose position is that of a stakeholder, has, throughout these proceedings, submitted its rights to the Court and the burden of the defence has been assumed by the Attorney-General of British Columbia. In this Court, of all those who were notified, only the Attorney General of Saskatchewan has filed a factum and he supports the appellant union in its claim that the legislation is ultra vires.\nThe 1961 legislation seeks to make the right of check-off for union dues dependent upon the union's refraining from making contributions to a political party or to a candidate for political office. It was enacted by 1961 (B.C.), c. 31, s. 5, as an addition to s. 9 of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205. Before the amendment s. 9 contained 5 subsections, which read:\n9. (1) Every employer shall honour a written assignment of wages to a trade-union certified under this Act, except where the assignment is declared null and void by a Judge or is revoked by the assignor.\n(2)An assignment pursuant to subsection (1) shall be substantially in the following form:\u2014\nTo [name of employer].\nUntil this authority is revoked by me in writing, I hereby authorize you to deduct from my wages and to pay to [name of the certified trade-union] fees in the amounts following:\u2014\n(1) Initiation fees in the amount of $\n(2) Dues of $ per\n(3) Except where an assignor of wages revokes the assignment by giving the employer written notice of the revocation, or except where a Judge declares an assignment to be null and void, the employer shall remit at least once each month, to the trade-union certified under this Act and named in the assignment as assignee, the fees and dues deducted, together with a written statement containing the names of the employees for whom the deductions were made and the amount of each deduction.\n(4) If an assignment is revoked, the employer shall give a copy of the revocation to the assignee.\n(5) Notwithstanding subsections (1), (2) and (3), there shall be no financial responsibility on the part of an employer for fees or dues of an employee unless there are sufficient unpaid wages of that employee in the employer's hands.\nWith the legislation in this form no one disputes that there was nothing to prevent a trade union from giving financial support to a political party or a candidate for political office and that for this purpose it could use the money it received from the check-off of union dues or paid as a condition of membership. The moneys belonged to the union and it had the right to apply them as it wished, in accordance with its constitution.\nThe amendments of 1961 were introduced by the enactment of a new subsection (6), which was added to s. 9. This new subsection reads:\n(6) (a) No employer and no one acting on behalf of an employer shall refuse to employ or to continue to employ a person and no one shall discriminate against a person in regard to employment only because that person refuses to make a contribution or expenditure to or on behalf of any political party or to or on behalf of a candidate for political office.\n(b) No trade-union and no person acting on behalf of a trade-union shall refuse membership to or refuse to continue membership of a person in a trade-union, and no one shall discriminate against a person in regard to membership in a trade-union or in regard to employment only because that person refuses to make or makes a contribution or expenditure, directly or indirectly, to or on behalf of any political party or to or on behalf of a candidate for political office.\n(c) (i) No trade-union and no person acting on behalf of a trade-union shall directly or indirectly contribute to or expend on behalf of any political party or to or on behalf of any candidate for political office any moneys deducted from an employee's wages under subsection (1) or a collective agreement, or paid as a condition of membership in the trade-union.\n(ii) Remuneration of a member of a trade-union for his services in an official union position held by him while seeking election or upon being elected to public office is not a violation of this clause.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act or the provisions of any collective agreement, unless the trade-union delivers to the employer who is in receipt of an assignment under subsection (1) or who is party to a collective agreement, a statutory declaration, made by an officer duly authorized in that behalf, that the trade-union is complying with and will continue to comply with clause (c) during the term of the assignment or during the term of the collective agreement, neither the employer nor a person acting on behalf of the employer shall make any deduction whatsoever from the wages of an employee on behalf of the trade-union.\n(e) Any moneys deducted from the wages of an employee and paid to a trade-union that does not comply with this subsection are the property of the employee, and the trade-union is liable to the employee for any moneys so deducted.\nThe questioned clauses in this legislation are (c), (d) and (e).\nAfter the amendments came into force the company demanded a statutory declaration provided for in clause (d) and when the union refused to supply it, it ceased to make the usual deductions of union dues.\nClause (c) is framed in the widest terms. Political contributions are prohibited from moneys derived from the check-off and moneys paid as a condition of membership whether or not there is a check-off. This strikes at everything except a voluntary collection for political purposes made outside the machinery of the Act and the collective agreement.\nThe legislation has been held to be intra vires as legislation in relation to property and civil rights in the province under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act. The Attorney-General for British Columbia supports the judgment under appeal as a valid exercise of the provincial power on two grounds: (a) that it assures every individual who is a member of a trade union the right to refrain from supporting any political party without fear of discrimination; and (b) that it prevents money collected by check-off and as a condition of union membership being diverted from the support of normal union activity in the field of labour relations to the more remote field of political activity. He further submits that no intention to hinder the operations of any political party can be imputed to the legislature, that the legislation does not interfere with the right of an individual to engage in political activity either alone or in association with others, and that it is directed to freeing a union member from any obligation to make political contributions of which he disapproves.\nOn the other hand, the union attacks the legislation on 5 grounds:\n1. The matters dealt with in these subsections do not fall within the field of labour relations but are in relation to the political activity of trade unions.\n2. The legislation is legislation in relation to federal elections.\n3. The legislation seeks to curtail fundamental rights of Canadian citizens guaranteed by the British North America Act essential to the proper functioning of Parliamentary institutions.\n4. Even if the legislation should be considered in pith and substance legislation designed to safeguard \"the fundamental right of the individual to give his support to the party of his choice\", (as held in the Courts below), it is still ultra vires the Province.\n5. A trade union, being formed by the voluntary association of its members, does not lose its freedom of choice in political matters by reason of the fact that certain of its activities may be validly regulated by provincial statutes.\nThe issues are not as clear-cut as might at first sight appear. The problem of the use of union funds is entangled with the machinery of the Act relating to collection of dues and with the powers of compulsory representation which the union acquires under the Act when it is certified as a unit that is appropriate for collective bargaining. But it also has a political aspect. The union constitution on file discloses that this local has financial obligations to the international union and also to the Canadian Labour Congress and the British Columbia Federation of Labour. The con- stitution of the New Democratic Party was also filed and it provides for affiliated membership open to trade unions and other groups. It follows from this that the local cannot take this statutory declaration even if it refrains itself from making any political contributions because the prohibition is against direct or indirect contributions. This leaves the only possible participation in political activity requiring financial contributions to the voluntary collection outside the framework of the Act and the collective agreement.\nIn my opinion, the union's submission that the matters dealt with in the questioned clauses do not fall within the field of labour relations but are in relation to the political activity of trade unions is an accurate characterization of this legislation. The subject-matter of the legislation concerns political and constitutional rights, not property and civil rights. Section (c) has no relationship whatever to trade union action designed to promote collective bargaining, to change conditions of employment or the contract of employment. Its sole object and purpose is to prevent trade unions from making these contributions out of their own moneys. The legislation does the following:\n(a) It prohibits trade unions using initiation fees and membership dues, whether paid by payroll deductions (i.e. checked off), or directly to the union, for political purposes (Section 9(6) (c)).\n(b) It prohibits an employer from honouring his checkoff arrangements with a trade union unless he receives a statutory declaration showing that the money being checked off is not being used for political purposes, and will not be used for such purposes in the future (Sec. 9(6) (d)).\n(c) It confers a right of action upon an individual trade union member against his trade union, allowing him to recover all of the money checked off against his wages, whenever his trade union uses it for political purposes contrary to the legislation (Section 9(6) (e)).\n(d) It makes it an offence, punishable by a fine of $250 or more, for a trade union to spend initiation fees or membership dues collected from its members, for political purposes (under s. 60 of the Labour Relations Act any violation of the Act is punishable as an offence).\nThe leading feature of the legislation is the prohibition, found in clause (c), of political contributions by trade unions. The provisions in clauses (d) and (e) are merely ancillary. They are designed to secure obedience to the prohibition laid down by clause (c). Therefore, in the case at bar, in deciding whether the plaintiff was obliged to deliver a statutory declaration under clause (d), the Court must determine the validity of clause (c).\nIn my opinion, it would be a grave and unwarranted extension of principle to hold that the decision in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[11] enables the province to control and curtail the political contributions of the trade union. Any such extension would be in direct conflict with the fundamental basis of the decision in this Court in Switzman v. Elbling and Attorney-General of Quebec[12], where all the judges in the majority were of the opinion that the legislation there in question was outside the provincial power. Five members of the Court held that it was outside the provincial power because it was legislation in relation to criminal law. Three held that it was not within any of the powers specifically assigned to the provinces and that it constituted an unjustifiable interference with freedom of speech and expression essential under the democratic form of government established in Canada.\nI am also of the opinion that this legislation is directly related to elections, including federal elections. Its purpose is not a general restriction on the disposition of funds of trade unions. The provincial legislature has no power to restrict the right of any person or organization within the province to make contributions at federal elections and to federal candidates. There was at one time such a restriction in the Dominion legislation. The Dominion Elections Act, 1920, contained the following provision:\nNo unincorporated company or association and no incorporated company or association other than one incorporated for political purposes alone shall, directly or indirectly, contribute, loan, advance, pay or promise or offer to pay money or its equivalent to, or for, or in aid of, any candidate at an election or to, or for, or in aid of any political party, committee or association, or to, or for, or in aid of any company incorporated for political purposes, or to, or for, or in furtherance of any political purpose whatever, or for the indemnification or reimbursement of any person for money so used.\nThis provision became s. 9 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1927, and was repealed in 1930. The Canada Elections Act, 1960, c. 39, contemplates in terms broad enough to include a trade union the making of contributions to and expenditures on behalf of political parties and candidates for political office. This provincial legislation is really a re-enactment against trade unions in British Columbia of the former prohibition contained in the Dominion Elections Act and repealed in 1930. This is sufficient to characterize the legislation and to put it beyond provincial competence.\nI am confining my reasons for judgment to the two first grounds put forward by the appellant, namely, that the control of political behaviour does not fall within the field of labour relations and is not within the provincial power, and secondly, that this legislation is legislation in relation to federal elections, a field exclusively within the Dominion power.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout against Imperial Oil Limited. The appellant is entitled to the following relief:\n(1) A declaration that clauses (c), (d) and (e) of subsection 6 of section 9 of the Labour Relations Act, as amended by the Labour Relations Act Amendment Act, 1961 are ultra vires the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia.\n(2) Specific performance of the provisions of the Collective Agreement made between the parties requiring the respondent Imperial Oil Limited to honour assignments of wages to the appellant by employees of the said respondent and to remit them to the appellant.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal and the relevant provisions of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, have been set out and analyzed in the reasons for judgment of my brother Martland with which I am in full agreement. As has been indicated in those reasons, each trade union to which the Act applies is a potential bargaining agent capable, when so certified by the Labour Relations Board, of being clothed with the exclusive authority to bargain collectively on behalf of a group of employees some of whom may not be union members and to bind each individual in that group by the terms and conditions of a collective agreement negotiated by it with their employer which may include a provision making membership in the trade union a condition of employment.\nThese provisions of the Labour Relations Act which make it possible for a certified trade union, without regard to the wishes of any dissentient minority within the unit for which it is certified, to enter into a collective agreement requiring the individuals composing such a minority to pay trade union dues as a condition of employment, are a part of the legislative machinery created by the Province of British Columbia, for the limited purpose of regulating within that province the relations between employers and employees through collective bargaining.\nIt is widely accepted that such regulation is greatly facilitated by a single representative being authorized to speak effectively and with finality at the bargaining table on behalf of all the employees concerned and in so far as it may be necessary, in order to achieve this end, to limit the civil rights of a minority of those represented by such authority it is within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature to do so (see Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[13]). In my opinion, it is also within the power of the province to so amend its legislation as to ensure that any such limitation on the civil rights of an individual is not employed for any purpose other than that for which it was imposed.\nEven if it were not for the enactment of s. 9(6) (c) and (d), it would appear to me to be highly unlikely that the provisions of the Act which make it possible for union dues to be collected as a condition of employment were intended to be used for the purpose of facilitating the collection of political party funds in such manner as to have a possible effect on federal elections.\nIt was, however, possible under this Act before the amendment of 1961, for moneys paid by an employee as a condition of employment to be used without his consent for the support of a political party in which he did not believe and for the internal arrangements made by an employer in order to comply with the \"check-off\" to be used for the purpose of assisting in the collection of political contributions to a party to which the employer was opposed.\nThe addition of subs. (6) to s. 9 of the Act in 1961 was, in my opinion, directed towards ensuring that legislative machinery involving the adjustment of civil rights which was created for the regulation of relations between em- ployers and employees should not be used for the collection of political party funds or in such manner as to curtail the fundamental political rights of any individual employee.\nI am of opinion that just as it is within the power of the province under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act to create this legislative machinery for the purpose of furthering the cause of industrial peace so it is within its power to control its use for the same purpose.\nThe impugned legislation does not, in my view, have the effect of in any sense precluding any trade union from indulging in political activity or from collecting political party funds from its members, but the relations between a trade union and the political party of its choice differ fundamentally in character and purpose from the relations between the employees in the unit which it represents and their employer, and as it is for the regulation of this latter relationship that this legislative machinery has been established it appears to me to be within the sphere of provincial jurisdiction to so amend the Labour Relations Act as to recognize this difference in express terms.\nEven if it could be said that the legislation under attack (s. 9(6), (c) and (d)) had any effect on political elections such an effect could, in my view, only be characterized as incidental and this would not alter the fact that the amendment in question is a part and parcel of legislation passed \"in relation to\" labour relations and not \"in relation to\" elections either provincial or federal.\nThe legislation here under attack has the effect of ensuring that associations which have been given a controlling power over their members by provincial legislation are not to be permitted to use that power for the purpose of compelling such members to support a political party not of their own choice.\nFor all these reasons, as well as for those stated by Martland J., I am of opinion that the enactment of s. 9(6) (c) and (d) of the Labour Relations Act Amendment Act, 1961, (B.C.), c. 31, was within the legislative competence of the legislature of that province and I would accordingly dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by Martland J.

Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance consid\u00e9ra qu'une substitution avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e, que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari de la demanderesse avait entra\u00een\u00e9 l'extinction au droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'accroissement subs\u00e9quent, et donc que la demanderesse n'avait droit qu'au cinqui\u00e8me.

Cour fut rendu par\nLe Juge Fauteux:\u2014L'appelante est l'unique h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de James Frederick Judah Burnett, son \u00e9poux, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 21 avril 1925. Parmi les biens composant la succession de ce dernier se trouve la part de biens lui venant de la succession de sa grand-m\u00e8re Sarah Caine. La quotit\u00e9 de cette part est l'objet de ce litige.\nD\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 5 avril 1909, Sarah Caine laissa six enfants. Elle avait, par testament authentique en date du 20 mai 1902, dispos\u00e9 de ses biens, incluant sa part de la communaut\u00e9 de biens avec feu son \u00e9poux, Frederick Thomas Judah. Suivant ces derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s, la testatrice, apr\u00e8s avoir fait certains legs particuliers \u00e0 chacun de ses enfants, disposa ainsi de tous ses immeubles, actions ou autres valeurs:\nELEVENTHLY.\u2014I leave and bequeath all my real estate, bonds, stocks & ready money which I may possess at the time of my death, unto my six children Ida, Amy, Henry, Miriam, Frederick and Sarah, to be by them enjoyed in equal shares during their lifetime, they drawing the revenues, interest and dividends thereof respectively, without being obliged to make any inventory or to give security; and after their death, unto their children par souche; to be by my grandchildren, par souche, owned and enjoyed in full ownership; but the latter shall not have the right to ask for or to have any partition of my estate until after the demise of the last souche.\nIn the event of any souche dying without legitimate issue, I will and direct that his or her share shall accrue to the other souches in equal shares.\nTWELFTHLY.\u2014I will and ordain that the said usufruct or enjoyment of my said children shall be inalienable and insaisissable and in the case of the female children not under marital control.\nTous les enfants de la testatrice lui surv\u00e9curent. Tous sont depuis d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s: Miriam en 1917, Ida en 1918, Frederick James en 1943, Amy en 1951, Henry en 1954 et Sarah en 1956. De tous les six, seules Miriam et Sarah eurent des enfants: la premi\u00e8re, James Frederick Judah Burnett qui, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, devint l'\u00e9poux de l'appelante et d\u00e9c\u00e9da le 21 avril 1925, et la seconde, trois enfants: Celeste, Ogden et Gordon Frederick Glass, tous trois intim\u00e9s en cet appel.\nL'appelante a poursuivi les trois intim\u00e9s personnellement et les deux derniers \u00e9galement en leur qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires.\nLes autres intim\u00e9s \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 sont coex\u00e9cuteurs du testament de Sarah Caine; les mis-en-cause sont h\u00e9ritiers de la succession de Frederick Thomas Judah, l'\u00e9poux de Sarah Caine; enfin, le mis-en-cause \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 est curateur aux substitutions qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le testament de l'\u00e9poux de cette derni\u00e8re.\nPar son action, l'appelante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'il soit ordonn\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der au compte et au partage de la succession de feu Sarah Caine et \u00e0 ce qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle-m\u00eame est propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 et les d\u00e9fendeurs de l'autre moiti\u00e9 des biens de cette succession.\nToutes les parties ont comparu mais seuls les intim\u00e9s contestent.\nTel qu'\u00e9ventuellement arr\u00eat\u00e9 et soumis par l'appelante et les intim\u00e9s, la question \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer se limite \u00e0 savoir si, comme elle le pr\u00e9tend, l'appelante est propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 de la succession de Sarah Caine, ou simplement d'un cinqui\u00e8me, ainsi que le soumettent les intim\u00e9s. Les parties s'accordent \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que le principe de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question se trouve dans les clauses 11 et 12 du testament de Sarah Caine. L'appelante, d'une part, soutient que la clause 11 comporte deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s conjointes, savoir un legs d'usufruit aux enfants de la testatrice et un legs de nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses petits-enfants par souche; la clause 12 \u00e9tant invoqu\u00e9e par l'appelante au soutien de cette interpr\u00e9tation de la clause 11. Les intim\u00e9s, d'autre part, soutiennent qu'aux termes de la clause 11, la testatrice a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire distincte pour chaque souche repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par chacun de ses enfants. De plus et entre autres moyens additionnels, ils invoquent une loi de la L\u00e9gislature, 8 Geo. V. c. 139, o\u00f9 la justesse de leur interpr\u00e9tation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 implicitement reconnue et ils plaident chose jug\u00e9e en s'appuyant sur un jugement, rendu en 1926 par feu M. le Juge Mercier dans une cause o\u00f9 la question fondamentale soulev\u00e9e serait, de son essence, la m\u00eame qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, et suivant lequel le savant Juge, reconnaissant que la testatrice a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une substitution, limita l'\u00e9tendue des droits de l'appelante comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son \u00e9poux, James Frederick Judah Burnett, \u00e0 un cinqui\u00e8me des biens de la succession de Dame Sarah Caine.\nEn Cour sup\u00e9rieure, M. le Juge Salvas consid\u00e9ra que la clause 11 comporte deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s distinctes et successives ayant pour objet la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens de la testatrice; que celle-ci y cr\u00e9a une substitution pour chacune des souches alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par chacun de ses six enfants; que chacun d'eux re\u00e7oit une part de ses biens s'augmentant par accroissement, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, en vertu du testament et de la loi (C.C. 933 et 868), avec charge de rendre cette part \u00e0 ses propres enfants \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s; qu'au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re Miriam, l'\u00e9poux de l'appelante fut imm\u00e9diatement saisi de la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la part de sa m\u00e8re\u2014soit un sixi\u00e8me\u2014et, au m\u00eame temps, du droit \u00e9ventuel \u00e0 l'accroissement stipul\u00e9 au testament, recevant cette part et ce droit de la testatrice elle-m\u00eame; que le 8 mars 1918, Ida \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e sans post\u00e9rit\u00e9, cette souche s'est \u00e9teinte et sa part s'est ajout\u00e9e par accroissement \u00e0 celles des cinq autres souches dont celle de Miriam alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ou continu\u00e9e par l'\u00e9poux de l'appelante, James Frederick Judah Burnett, cette part \u00e9tant ainsi port\u00e9e de un sixi\u00e8me \u00e0 un cinqui\u00e8me en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9; que l'\u00e9poux de l'appelante ayant, le 21 avril 1925, pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 les quatre autres enfants survivant \u00e0 la testatrice, sans laisser d'enfants, son d\u00e9c\u00e8s entra\u00eena l'extinction de la souche Miriam et partant la perte du droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'accroissement effectu\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment entre les souches survivantes. Le savant Juge en conclut que, seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de James Frederick Judah Burnett, l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9, lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, saisie en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la part d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquise par son \u00e9poux dans la succession de Dame Sarah Caine, soit un cinqui\u00e8me des biens de cette succession. Dans ces vues sur le sens et l'effet des clauses 11 et 12, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'eut pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les autres moyens soulev\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s. Il ordonna le partage, d\u00e9clara l'appelante propri\u00e9taire d'un cinqui\u00e8me, r\u00e9serva l'adjudication, si n\u00e9cessaire, des conclusions accessoires de l'action; le tout, chaque partie payant ses frais.\nCe jugement fut port\u00e9 en appel et le dispositif en fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire. Voici, en substance, les vues auxquelles se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s les membres de la Cour2. Sur le sens et l'effet du testament, MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Owen partagent enti\u00e8rement l'opinion du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance alors que MM. les Juges Casey, Rinfret et Badeaux se prononcent\u2014le premier, pour partie, et les deux autres, pour le tout\u2014en faveur des pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelante. MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Casey et Badeaux acceptent comme bien fond\u00e9e la d\u00e9fense de chose jug\u00e9e alors que, par ailleurs, M. le Juge Rinfret exprime l'opinion contraire et que M. le Juge Owen ne juge pas n\u00e9cessaire de se prononcer, vu son opinion sur l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'effet du testament. Ainsi donc et dans le r\u00e9sultat, l'appel fut renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. De l\u00e0 le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour. La distinction entre l'essence de la constitution d'usufruit et celle de la constitution de substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire est clairement expos\u00e9e aux autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es aux raisons de jugement de M. le Juge Bissonnette. Il n'y a pas lieu d'y revenir; sur cette question de droit, il n'y a, entre les parties, aucune controverse. C'est sur l'appr\u00e9ciation des dispositions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es du testament qu'on se divise et o\u00f9 l'on pr\u00e9tend apercevoir, d'une part, la pr\u00e9sence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'usufruit et, d'autre part, ceux de la substitution. Dans Auger v. Beaudry3, le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 a rappel\u00e9 dans les termes suivants, \u00e0 la page 1014, la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 suivre pour d\u00e9terminer l'intention d'un testateur: \u00ab\u2026it is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will.\u00bb Retenant ce crit\u00e8re et apr\u00e8s avoir anxieusement \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les raisons donn\u00e9es en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, en Cour d'Appel, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'argumentation des parties lors de l'audition, je dois dire, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les tenants de l'opinion contraire, qu'il m'est impossible, \u00e0 moins de faire une certaine violence au texte de la clause 11, de voir aux dispositions testamentaires pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es la constitution d'un simple usufruit. Au contraire et d'accord avec les raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le Juge Salvas, \u00e9labor\u00e9es par MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Owen, et auxquelles je ne puis utilement ajouter, je dirais plut\u00f4t que, suivant son texte m\u00eame, la clause 11 comporte deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s distinctes, successives et non simultan\u00e9es, chaque enfant de la testatrice recevant, en premier ordre, sa quote-part des biens et un droit \u00e9ventuel d'accroissement, avec charge, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, de rendre \u00e0 ses propres enfants recevant en second ordre. En somme, la testatrice a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire distincte pour chaque souche repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par chacun de ses enfants.\nAinsi donc, et d\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re, Miriam, en 1917, James Frederick Judah Burnett fut, comme appel\u00e9, saisi de la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la part de celle-ci dans la succession de la testatrice, soit un sixi\u00e8me, et de plus, du droit \u00e9ventuel \u00e0 l'accroissement pourvu au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de la clause stipulant:\nIn the event of any souche dying without legitimate issue, I will and direct that his or her share shall accrue to the other souches in equal shares. Au d\u00e9c\u00e8s subs\u00e9quent d'Ida, c\u00e9libataire, en 1918, cette part de Burnett fut, par suite de cette disposition, port\u00e9e \u00e0 un cinqui\u00e8me. Burnett d\u00e9c\u00e9da lui-m\u00eame sans post\u00e9rit\u00e9 en 1925 entra\u00eenant ainsi l'extinction de la souche Miriam. Cette souche et la souche Ida \u00e9tant \u00e9teintes, l'accroissement pourvu en la clause 11 ne pouvait d\u00e9sormais b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e9ventuellement qu'aux quatre autres enfants survivants de la testatrice. L'appelante argumente que cette clause relative \u00e0 l'accroissement ne dit pas \u00abIn the event of any souche dying without legitimate issue surviving\u00bb, mais simplement \u00abIn the event of any souche dying without legitimate issue\u00bb. Elle en d\u00e9duit une intention de la testatrice d'accorder le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'accroissement aux souches fertiles avec le r\u00e9sultat que les biens doivent \u00eatre partag\u00e9s \u00e9galement entre les deux souches ayant cette qualification, soit la souche Miriam et la souche Sarah. Cette interpr\u00e9tation n'est pas, \u00e0 mon avis, justifi\u00e9e par le texte et est, au surplus, comme le signale M. le Juge Owen, incompatible avec la manifeste intention de la testatrice d'attribuer ses biens en ligne directe \u00e0 ses descendants et non \u00e0 leurs \u00e9poux.\nDans ces vues sur le sens et l'effet des dispositions du testament, il ne para\u00eet pas utile de poursuivre la consid\u00e9ration du litige pour d\u00e9cider du bien ou mal fond\u00e9 des autres moyens invoqu\u00e9s de la part des intim\u00e9s.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, appelante: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s: Lajoie, Gelinas, Lajoie, Bourque & Lalonde, Montr\u00e9al.\n1 [1962] B.R. 187.\n2 [1962] B.R. 187.\n3 [1920] A.C. 1010, 48 D.L.R. 356.\n"

D\u00e8s avant cette date, la compagnie \u00e9tait en d\u00e9faut de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations. Avant que le jugement de la Cour d'appel confirmant l'ordonnance de s\u00e9questre ne soit rendu, la demanderesse devint cessibnnaire du privil\u00e8ge de vendeur et de l'hypoth\u00e8que avec la clause de dation. Apr\u00e8s mise en demeure, la demanderesse pr\u00e9senta une requ\u00eate en retrocession des immeubles en paiement de ses cr\u00e9ances. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance donna effet \u00e0 la clause de dation et d\u00e9clara la demanderesse propri\u00e9taire incommutable. Ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du banc de la reine. Le syndic obtint permission d'appeler devant cette Cour.\nLa clause de dation se lit ainsi en partie: \u2026qu'advenant le d\u00e9faut par le d\u00e9biteur de rembourser \u2026 alors, dans chacun de ces cas, le cr\u00e9ancier aura droit de prendre l'immeuble ci-dessus en paiement de sa cr\u00e9ance ou de toute partie d'icelle non alors acquitt\u00e9e \u2026 la pr\u00e9sente clause de dation en paiement prenant effet automatiquement au cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur ou l'un ou l'autre de ses repr\u00e9sentants ferait cession de ses biens, serait mis en faillite ou tomberait sous le coup d'un concordat \u2026 Cette clause aura effet au choix de cr\u00e9ancier, nonobstant toutes autres clauses ant\u00e9rieures.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe choix du cr\u00e9ancier, mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la clause, \u00e9tait celui de renoncer ou non \u00e0 la dation automatiquement acquise par le fait de la faillite alors que dans les autres cas o\u00f9 la dation pouvait jouer, le choix \u00e9tait d'exiger ou de ne pas exiger la dation. Le d\u00e9biteur avait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au cr\u00e9ancier un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conditionnelle sur les immeubles, droit devant prendre un caract\u00e8re absolu r\u00e9troagissant \u00e0 la date du contrat d\u00e8s l'accomplissement de la condition, soit la faillite. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'argument du syndic que le cr\u00e9ancier aurait perdu le droit d'invoquer la clause de dation parce qu'il n'aurait pas fait ou signifi\u00e9 son choix d'en prendre avantage, ne peut pas \u00eatre retenu, puisqu'elle joue automatiquement dans le cas d'une faillite.\nIl appartenait au syndic de faire la preuve que la demanderesse avait par ses actes renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la dation en paiement. Cette preuve n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nLes faits d\u00e9montrent que les exigences de l'art. 50 de la Loi sur la faillite, prescrivant que le cr\u00e9ancier doit fournir au syndic une preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et asserment\u00e9e de sa r\u00e9clamation, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement couvertes.\nL'argument que la clause de dation en paiement vient en conflit avec l'esprit et les dispositions de la Loi sur la faillite r\u00e9gissant les droits d'un cr\u00e9ancier garanti, ne peut \u00eatre retenu. Le cr\u00e9ancier d'une telle clause est plus qu'un cr\u00e9ancier garanti au sens de l'art. 2(r) de la Loi. Sous notre droit, la dation en paiement \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente, le d\u00e9biteur \u00e9tant oblig\u00e9 de remettre une chose autre que celle qui \u00e9tait due en vertu de l'obligation. D\u00e8s l'av\u00e8nement de la faillite, la demanderesse cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re avait acquis un droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des immeubles revendiqu\u00e9s.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, affirmant un jugement du Juge Marier.

Blain, pour la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLe Juge Fauteux:\u2014L'appelant, syndic \u00e0 la faillite de H\u00f4tel Lapointe Inc., ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9 la compagnie ou la d\u00e9bitrice, se pourvoit en cette qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre d'une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine1 rejetant son appel d'un jugement du Tribunal des Faillites et ce pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par M. le Juge Choquette et partag\u00e9s par MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Hyde, Montgomery et Rivard.\nPar ce jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en faillite, rendu le 28 juin 1961, M. le Juge Marier, donnant effet \u00e0 une clause de dation en paiement dont les immeubles de la d\u00e9bitrice \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s, en d\u00e9clara l'intim\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire incommutable et ordonna les radiations appropri\u00e9es.\nL'appelant a demand\u00e9 et obtenu la permission de se pourvoir \u00e0 cette Cour. Il convient de relater sommairement les faits et les diverses proc\u00e9dures dans la perspective desquels se situent les questions de droit soulev\u00e9es par l'appelant.\nQuelque huit ans avant sa faillite, soit le 31 mars 1952, la compagnie acheta les immeubles en litige, assumant au contrat les charges dont ils \u00e9taient grev\u00e9s, dont (i) un privil\u00e8ge de vendeur avec clause r\u00e9solutoire, r\u00e9sultant d'un acte de vente du 30 mars 1950 et (ii) une hypoth\u00e8que avec clause de dation en paiement, constitu\u00e9e par acte d'obligation pass\u00e9 le 3 octobre 1951. A la date de la requ\u00eate en faillite, le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1960, ces immeubles \u00e9taient encore grev\u00e9s de ces droits r\u00e9els pour des montants consid\u00e9rables. La compagnie \u00e9tait de plus en d\u00e9faut de faire des versements substantiels sur le capital; des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9taient dus; enfin, les taxes scolaires qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es depuis 1956 s'arr\u00e9rageaient \u00e0 la somme de $33,231.45, le 21 juin 1961, lors de l'enqu\u00eate sur la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9trocession. Ainsi donc, et d\u00e8s avant la faillite, la compagnie \u00e9tait en d\u00e9faut de satisfaire aux obligations par elle assum\u00e9es lors de l'acquisition des immeubles en 1952 et ce d\u00e9faut donnait au cr\u00e9ancier du privil\u00e8ge de vendeur et au cr\u00e9ancier de l'hypoth\u00e8que le droit d'invoquer respectivement la clause r\u00e9solutoire et celle de dation en paiement.\nLa requ\u00eate en faillite, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1960 alors que l'appelant fut nomm\u00e9 s\u00e9questre int\u00e9rimaire des biens de la d\u00e9bitrice. Le 5 avril suivant, l'ordonnance de s\u00e9questre fut rendue contre la compagnie et l'appelant fut nomm\u00e9 syndic \u00e0 la faillite. La compagnie interjeta appel du jugement la d\u00e9clarant en faillite et ce n'est que quelque sept mois plus tard, soit le 16 novembre 1960, que cet appel fut rejet\u00e9 par la Cour du banc de la reine.\nAlors que cet appel \u00e9tait pendant, l'intim\u00e9e, la Compagnie de Finance Laval Lt\u00e9e, devint cessionnaire des cr\u00e9ances r\u00e9sultant (i) de l'acte de vente du 30 mars 1950, dont le privil\u00e8ge de vendeur, et (ii) de l'acte d'obligation du 3 octobre 1951, dont l'hypoth\u00e8que avec clause de dation en paiement, le tout en vertu d'actes de cession et transport signifi\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9bitrice. Dans le m\u00eame intervalle, par lettre du 26 avril 1960, l'intim\u00e9e, invoquant le d\u00e9faut de la d\u00e9bitrice d'ex\u00e9cuter les obligations par elle assum\u00e9es, le fait de l'ordonnance de s\u00e9questre rendue contre elle et la clause de dation en paiement, la mit en demeure de lui consentir la r\u00e9trocession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s susdites en paiement de ses cr\u00e9ances.\nSubs\u00e9quemment au jugement de la Cour d'Appel maintenant l'ordonnance de s\u00e9questre, l'appelant fut confirm\u00e9 dans sa fonction de syndic, \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re assembl\u00e9e des cr\u00e9anciers, tenue le 29 novembre 1960. Le 16 mars suivant, il demanda au Tribunal des Faillites que tous droits de l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9aliser ses garanties soient diff\u00e9r\u00e9s jusqu'au 16 mai 1961, et obtint, le lendemain, une ordonnance int\u00e9rimaire ayant cet effet jusqu'\u00e0 adjudication sur sa demande. Celle-ci fut accueillie le 18 avril 1961, vu le consentement de l'intim\u00e9e qui avait elle-m\u00eame log\u00e9, le 12 avril 1961, la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9trocession qui nous occupe. Suspendue, avec l'acquiescement de l'appelant, il ne fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re requ\u00eate que le 20 juin 1961. Dans l'intervalle, l'appelant demanda, le 27 avril 1961, l'autorisation du tribunal de vendre de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 les immeubles en litige \u00e0 une personne qui s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e, moyennant certaines conditions, \u00e0 s'en porter acqu\u00e9reur et \u00e0 signer un contrat de vente dans les trente jours de l'acceptation de son offre. L'intim\u00e9e consentit \u00e0 jugement sur cette requ\u00eate mais sous la r\u00e9serve expresse que ce consentement \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit de contester, advenant\u2014comme ce fut le cas\u2014la non r\u00e9alisation de la vente propos\u00e9e, certaines all\u00e9gations de la requ\u00eate mettant en question son droit \u00e0 la dation en paiement.\nPost\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures, la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9trocession fut entendue au m\u00e9rite et, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, trouv\u00e9e bien fond\u00e9e, tant en Cour de premi\u00e8re instance qu'en Cour d'Appel.\nD'o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nIl convient de citer au texte la clause de dation en paiement sur laquelle se fonde le jugement a quo, d'en souligner les parties essentielles, omettant des diverses circonstances en conditionnant l'application, celles qui n'ont aucune pertinence en l'esp\u00e8ce:\nIl est express\u00e9ment compris, sans quoi les pr\u00e9sentes n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consenties par le cr\u00e9ancier, qu'advenant le d\u00e9faut par le d\u00e9biteur de rembourser \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance le capital emprunt\u00e9 ou tout versement sur icelui convenu; ou de payer ses taxes avant le premier janvier de chaque ann\u00e9e; ou si le d\u00e9biteur faisait d\u00e9faut de .............................................................................................. alors, dans chacun de ces cas, le cr\u00e9ancier aura droit de prendre l'immeuble ci-dessus en paiement de sa cr\u00e9ance ou de toute partie d'icelle non alors acquitt\u00e9e, duquel immeuble il sera et demeurera propri\u00e9taire incommutable sans aucune indemnit\u00e9, ni sans aucun remboursement pour deniers d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7us ou pour toutes impenses et am\u00e9liorations apport\u00e9es audit immeuble, lequel sera et devra \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme franc et quitte de toutes charges, dettes et hypoth\u00e8ques subs\u00e9quentes au pr\u00e9sent acte d'obligation, la pr\u00e9sente clause de dation en paiement prenant effet automatiquement au cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur ou l'un ou l'autre de ses repr\u00e9sentants ferait cession de ses biens, serait mis en faillite ou tomberait sous le coup d'un concordat. Tous locataires, tiers d\u00e9tenteurs ou cr\u00e9anciers subs\u00e9quents dudit immeuble seront sujets et soumis non seulement \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8que consentie en faveur dudit cr\u00e9ancier, mais \u00e0 toutes les clauses ins\u00e9r\u00e9es au pr\u00e9sent acte et sujet \u00e0 la clause de dation en paiement mentionn\u00e9e plus haut, laquelle constitue et conf\u00e8re dans tous les cas, sur l'immeuble sus-d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et d\u00e9pendances, en faveur du cr\u00e9ancier, un droit \u00abin re\u00bb, imm\u00e9diat, r\u00e9troactif, \u00abhic et nunc\u00bb, dans le cas o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier demanderait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur en paiement de sa cr\u00e9ance. Cette clause aura effet au choix du cr\u00e9ancier, nonobstant toutes autres clauses ant\u00e9rieures.\nA l'audition, le syndic a soumis en substance les arguments suivants au soutien de son appel.\nIl a d'abord pr\u00e9tendu qu'aux termes de la derni\u00e8re phrase de la clause pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le jeu de cette clause est conditionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la signification au d\u00e9biteur du choix du cr\u00e9ancier d'en prendre avantage; que ce choix n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ou signifi\u00e9; il en conclut que la clause est demeur\u00e9e sans effet et que le cr\u00e9ancier a perdu le droit de l'invoquer. Pour \u00e9carter cette conclusion, il suffit de dire qu'\u00e0 tout le moins la premi\u00e8re des pr\u00e9misses sur laquelle elle repose, n'est pas fond\u00e9e dans le cas de la faillite du d\u00e9biteur, l'un des cas pr\u00e9vus pour l'application de la clause. I1 est, en effet, clairement stipul\u00e9 que dans ce cas la clause op\u00e8re \u00abautomatiquement\u00bb. Il faut donner effet \u00e0 cette stipulation et pour ce faire interpr\u00e9ter cette derni\u00e8re partie de la clause non pas en la consid\u00e9rant isol\u00e9ment mais avec les autres parties du contexte, en donnant \u00e0 chacune le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de la clause enti\u00e8re. Ainsi consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, il appara\u00eet, comme s'en exprime M. le Juge Choquette avec l'accord de tous ses coll\u00e8gues, que le choix du cr\u00e9ancier, mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin du texte, serait le choix de renoncer ou de ne pas renoncer \u00e0 la dation en paiement automatiquement acquise par le fait de la faillite alors que, dans les autres cas o\u00f9 il peut y avoir lieu \u00e0 dation en paiement, ce choix serait d'exiger ou de ne pas exiger la dation en paiement. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est vraiment la seule susceptible de donner effet \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e des parties. Celles-ci ont envisag\u00e9 et r\u00e9gl\u00e9 d'avance, par contrat, le sort des immeubles dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'une faillite du d\u00e9biteur. Par cette clause, ce dernier a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au cr\u00e9ancier un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conditionnel sur les immeubles affect\u00e9s, droit prenant un caract\u00e8re absolu r\u00e9troagissant \u00e0 la date du contrat d\u00e8s l'accomplissement de la condition, soit l'av\u00e8nement d'une faillite. Par la m\u00eame clause, le d\u00e9biteur a accord\u00e9 au cr\u00e9ancier la facult\u00e9 de renoncer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 au droit ainsi conf\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce premier argument ne peut donc \u00eatre retenu.\nMais, poursuit l'appelant, l'intim\u00e9e a par ses actes renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la dation en paiement. Cette renonciation, dit-il, r\u00e9sulterait virtuellement (i) du consentement donn\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ordonnance du 18 avril 1961 requise par le syndic pour faire diff\u00e9rer \u00e0 deux mois l'exercice des droits de l'intim\u00e9e, (ii) du consentement de cette derni\u00e8re au jugement du 27 avril accueillant la requ\u00eate du syndic pour la vente des immeubles en question, et (iii) du fait que l'intim\u00e9e aurait fait parvenir au syndic un relev\u00e9 de compte dat\u00e9 le 31 mai 1961 indiquant le montant de la dette de la d\u00e9bitrice au 2 juin 1961. Le premier de ces consentements fut donn\u00e9 alors que la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9trocession \u00e9tait et demeurait pendante; de plus, l'audition de cette requ\u00eate fut suspendue avec l'acquiescement de l'appelant. Le second fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la condition expresse que la vente projet\u00e9e soit conclue et sans pr\u00e9judice au droit de l'intim\u00e9e de contester certaines all\u00e9gations de la requ\u00eate du syndic mettant en doute le droit de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la dation en paiement, advenant le cas o\u00f9 la vente n'aurait pas lieu, ce qui, en fait, s'est produit. Quant au relev\u00e9 de compte, l'appelant ne para\u00eet pas en avoir fait \u00e9tat en Cour d'Appel. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve par l'appelant, sous r\u00e9serve des objections de l'intim\u00e9e, relativement \u00e0 une question \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la suggestion d'une renonciation. Le dossier ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le d'ailleurs aucune circonstance permettant d'inf\u00e9rer raisonnablement en l'esp\u00e8ce une renonciation du fait de son envoi au syndic. Pour ces raisons et celles donn\u00e9es en Cour d'Appel, je dirais qu'il appartenait \u00e0 l'appelant de faire la preuve de la renonciation et que cette preuve n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. D'apr\u00e8s une autre pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant, la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9trocession serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et partant mal fond\u00e9e parce que l'intim\u00e9e n'aurait pas fourni au syndic une preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et asserment\u00e9e de sa r\u00e9clamation, suivant les formalit\u00e9s prescrites \u00e0 l'art. 50 de la Loi sur la faillite. Le syndic, comme on l'a not\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, s'est tenu suffisamment inform\u00e9 de la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9e et de la preuve au soutien; il avait \u00e9videmment pris connaissance des titres de l'intim\u00e9e et de la lettre du 26 avril 1961 adress\u00e9e par ce dernier \u00e0 sa d\u00e9bitrice pour demander la r\u00e9trocession des immeubles affect\u00e9s; par sa requ\u00eate du 16 mars 1961, il avait demand\u00e9 que soit diff\u00e9r\u00e9 l'exercice des droits de l'intim\u00e9e afin de pouvoir vendre lui-m\u00eame les immeubles revendiqu\u00e9s; par sa requ\u00eate du 27 avril 1961, c'est lui qui prend encore l'initiative de s'adresser au tribunal pour faire d\u00e9cider en somme que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas droit \u00e0 une dation en paiement. Ces deux requ\u00eates contiennent une description compl\u00e8te des immeubles en litige et des droits qui les gr\u00e8vent. De tous ces faits, la Cour d'Appel a conclu, avec justesse, que les exigences de l'art. 50 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement couvertes.\nEnfin, et c'est l\u00e0 le principal argument soumis \u00e0 l'audition, m\u00eame si la clause de dation en paiement contient une stipulation \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle joue automatiquement dans le cas d'une faillite, une telle clause, dit l'appelant, est ineffective parce qu'elle est incompatible avec l'esprit de la Loi sur la faillite dont l'une des fins est de prot\u00e9ger la masse des cr\u00e9anciers et emp\u00eacher que les uns b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'avantages indus au d\u00e9triment des autres, et que, valide sous le Code Civil, elle est en conflit avec les dispositions de la Loi sur la faillite r\u00e9gissant aux fins ci-dessus les droits d'un cr\u00e9ancier garanti. Rejetant cet argument, la Cour d'Appel a jug\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait, dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, aucun conflit entre la Loi sur la faillite et le Code Civil, que l'intim\u00e9e est en l'esp\u00e8ce plus qu'un cr\u00e9ancier garanti au sens de l'art. 2(r), qu'elle a acquis un droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des immeubles revendiqu\u00e9s et que, d'ailleurs, le syndic n'a offert aucun rachat de ce qu'il appelle la \u00abgarantie\u00bb de l'intim\u00e9e.\nAu soutien de sa pr\u00e9tention, l'appelant a particuli\u00e8rement invoqu\u00e9, en cette Cour comme en Cour d'Appel, les d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec dans les causes suivantes: Laplante, Perras et Berthe Roberto 1953 Montr\u00e9al C.S. 141 (non rapport\u00e9e), Beauchatel Construction Inc. v. Poissant2, et Ireland, Breton v. Gingras et al.3 Une \u00e9tude attentive de ces d\u00e9cisions aussi bien que de l'argumentation de l'appelant r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'une des pr\u00e9misses essentielles sur lesquelles elles se fondent est qu'on consid\u00e8re le cr\u00e9ancier d'une telle clause comme un cr\u00e9ancier garanti au sens de l'art. 2(r) de la Loi sur la faillite et qu'on justifie ainsi l'application des dispositions de cette loi autorisant le rachat de la garantie pour assurer que le patrimoine du failli re\u00e7oive le profit du surplus de sa valeur, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la masse des cr\u00e9anciers. L'article 2(r) d\u00e9finit ainsi le cr\u00e9ancier garanti:\n\u00abcr\u00e9ancier garanti\u00bb signifie une personne qui d\u00e9tient un mortgage, une hypoth\u00e8que, un nantissement, une charge, un gage ou un privil\u00e8ge sur ou contre les biens du d\u00e9biteur, ou toute partie de ces biens, \u00e0 titre de garantie d'une dette \u00e9chue ou \u00e0 \u00e9choir du d\u00e9biteur envers lui, ou une personne dont la r\u00e9clamation est fond\u00e9e sur, ou garantie par, un instrument n\u00e9gociable d\u00e9tenu en garantie subsidiaire et dont le d\u00e9biteur n'est responsable qu'indirectement ou secondairement;\nManifestement, on ne saurait, en vertu de la deuxi\u00e8me partie de cette d\u00e9finition, consid\u00e9rer l'intim\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re garantie en raison de la dation en paiement qu'elle invoque. Et pour que l'intim\u00e9e soit ainsi consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, en vertu de la premi\u00e8re partie, il faudrait que cette clause constitu\u00e2t\u2014ce qui n'est pas\u20141'une des formes de s\u00fbret\u00e9s r\u00e9elles qui y sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es et qui permettent \u00e0 leurs b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de r\u00e9clamer un droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur le prix de vente des biens qui en sont affect\u00e9s, de se faire payer leur dette \u00e0 m\u00eame ce prix avant les autres cr\u00e9anciers et d'\u00e9chapper ainsi \u00e0 la loi du concours r\u00e9gissant les cr\u00e9ances chirographaires, suivant l'art. 1981 du Code Civil. Au contraire et par cette clause, la d\u00e9bitrice, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au cr\u00e9ancier, non pas un droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence accessoirement \u00e0 un droit principal, mais un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conditionnel sur les immeubles affect\u00e9s, droit prenant un caract\u00e8re absolu r\u00e9troagissant \u00e0 la date du contrat d\u00e8s l'accomplissement de la condition, soit, en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'av\u00e8nement de la faillite. Art. 1085 du Code Civil. La Caisse Populaire de Scott v. Guilmette4. Dans Planiol et Ripert, 2e \u00e9d., Droit Civil, vol. 7, p. 658, on d\u00e9finit la dation en paie- ment et on en analyse la nature. La tenant, non comme une s\u00fbret\u00e9 r\u00e9elle garantissant une obligation mais comme mode d'extinction d'obligation, on la rapproche du paiement ou on la ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 la novation par changement d'objet ou encore \u00e0 une vente donnant lieu \u00e0 compensation, l'auteur ajoutant que, sous ce dernier aspect, \u00abTout se passe comme si le d\u00e9biteur vendait un bien \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier pour un prix \u00e9gal au montant de sa dette; le cr\u00e9ancier devient propri\u00e9taire de la chose et le d\u00e9biteur du prix; la compensation vient \u00e9teindre aussit\u00f4t sa dette du prix et la dette dont \u00e9tait tenu le d\u00e9biteur.\u00bb Sous notre droit, la dation en paiement \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente. Art. 1592 du Code Civil. En somme, la d\u00e9bitrice, en consentant \u00e0 cette clause s'est oblig\u00e9e, advenant sa faillite, \u00e0 remettre en paiement \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier une chose autre\u2014soit les immeubles\u2014que celle qui \u00e9tait due en vertu de l'obligation. En exigeant la clause au contrat, le cr\u00e9ancier a pu avoir en vue d'assurer la protection de son patrimoine, mais ceci ne fait pas du moyen qu'il a pris pour ce faire l'une des s\u00fbret\u00e9s r\u00e9elles mentionn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9finition du cr\u00e9ancier garanti. Aussi bien et d'accord avec la Cour d'Appel, je dirais que l'intim\u00e9e est, par suite de cette clause qu'elle invoque, en raison de la faillite, plus qu'une cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re garantie et qu'elle a acquis un droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des immeubles revendiqu\u00e9s.\nL'appelant a fait \u00e9tat de la rigueur de cette clause dont il a par ailleurs reconnu la validit\u00e9, plaidant simplement son inefficacit\u00e9 en raison de la Loi sur la faillite. Il n'appartient pas aux tribunaux mais au L\u00e9gislateur d'y apporter des temp\u00e9raments, si et dans la mesure o\u00f9 il le juge \u00e0 propos.\nJe rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, appelant: E.

Lerner and Buckley's Wholesale Tobacco Ltd., [1963] S.C.R. 625\nDate: 1963-10-01\nHer Majesty The Queen Appellant;\nand\nSydney Lerner and Buckley's Wholesale Tobacco Limited Respondents.\n1963: June 4; 1963: October 1.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nCriminal law\u2014Lotteries\u2014Mail order product distribution plan\u2014Whether scheme contrary to s. 179(1)(e) of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51.\nThe respondents conducted a mail order product distribution plan whereby a participant received three cards which he sold to three friends for $4 each. The participant returned the three cards to the respondents, each card bearing the name and address of one of the friends, together with $12. The original participant would then receive three cartons of cigarettes of his choice. The three friends in turn would receive three cards each and, after repeating the same procedure of selling their cards, would each receive three cartons of cigarettes.\nThe respondents were charged under s. 179(1)(e) of the Criminal Code with conducting a scheme by which any person, upon payment of any sum of money, could become entitled under the scheme to receive a larger sum of money or amount of valuable security than the sum paid by reason of the fact that other persons had paid any sum of money under the scheme. The respondents were convicted, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal of the Crown should be dismissed.\nA participant in the scheme did not receive anything which falls within the term \"valuable security\" within the meaning of s. 179(1)(e) of the Code.\nEven if it could be held, contrary to what was decided by the Court of Queen's Bench, that what the participant obtained under the scheme could be regarded as constituting valuable security, the scheme would not be in contravention of s. 179(1)(e) of the Code. The essence of the scheme was that the respondents were prepared to compensate, in the form of goods, at their own expenses, for the performance of services, such as advertising and distribution of their products, which they obviously considered to be of value to them. The scheme did not, therefore, fall under s. 179(1)(e) of the Code.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, quashing the respondents' convictions on a charge of conducting a lottery. Appeal dismissed. R. Lariv\u00e9e, Q.C., for the appellant.\nF. Kaufman, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec2, which unanimously maintained the present respondents' appeals against their convictions on charges laid against them under s. 179(1)(e) of the Criminal Code which provides as follows:\n179. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years who\n* * *\n(e) conducts, manages or is a party to any scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind by which any person, upon payment of any sum of money, or the giving of any valuable security, or by obligating himself to pay any sum of money or give any valuable security, shall become entitled under the scheme, contrivance or operation, to receive from the person conducting or managing the scheme, contrivance or operation, or any other person, a larger sum of money or amount of valuable security than the sum or amount paid or given, or to be paid or given, by reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under the scheme, contrivance or operation;\nThe scheme conducted by the respondents in respect of which the charges were laid is described in agreed admissions of fact as follows:\nAt material times the above company (i.e. Buckley's Wholesale Tobacco Ltd.) has conducted a mail order product distribution plan that operates as follows:\na) A number of people each receive a written explanation of the company's operation and an offer to participate in that operation, together with three (3) identical beige coloured cards.\nb) Each of the above persons may then explain the company's operation to friends, and sell each of the three cards to a friend for a price of $4.00.\nc) Upon returning the three cards (now completed, with each one bearing the name and address of a new customer) along with the $12.00 collected ($4.00 for each of the 3 cards) to the company, the company sends to the original customer three (3) cartons of cigarettes (of the brand chosen by him), and it sends to each of his friends who has paid $4.00, i.e. each new customer, a set of 3 cards.\nd) Each of the above mentioned participants can then sell his three cards at a price of $4.00 each, and upon sending the completed cards back to the company, receives in turn three cartons of cigarettes (of the brand he chooses).\ne) Thus the orginal participants receive three cartons of cigarettes in return for having sold the 3 cards sent to them, and each subsequent participant receives 3 cartons of cigarettes in return for having purchased a set of cards for $4.00 and having sold those cards to three of his friends.\nf) Participants who succeed in selling 2 cards, but have difficulty with the third, can return their 2 completed cards (together with the $8.00 collected) to the company, and receive in return 2 instead of 3 cartons of cigarettes. If they then succeed in selling the third card, they receive a third carton of cigarettes.\ng) Participants who have bought a set of cards (for $4.00) but who seem to be unsuccessful in selling them are given the opportunity of returning their uncompleted cards to the company, and of choosing a premium from a number of items offered to them by the company, thereby eliminating any chance of loss to them.\nh) Participants may substitute various other products for cigarettes.\ni) Participants who sell their cards promptly may receive special bonuses.\nThe instruction sheet sent by the respondents to their customers read as follows:\nDear Customer:\u2014\nEnclosed you will find 3 cards for which you have paid $4.00.\nPlease follow these instructions:\n(1) Sell these 3 cards to your customer friends at $4.00 each.\n(2) Mail us the 3 cards with the $12.00.\nWe will then mail you the 3 cartons of cigarettes (of your choice), plus 9 cards for distribution to your 3 customer friends. They, in turn, will sell these 3 cards to their friends at $4.00 each and will then receive their 3 cartons of cigarettes.\nYours very truly,\nBUCKLEY'S WHOLESALE\nTOBACCO LIMITED.\nP.S. Do not send cash through the mail. Send money order only, this being your receipt.\nIn the reasons for the judgment from which this appeal is brought, it was held that a participant in this scheme does not receive anything which falls within the term \"valuable security\" within the meaning of s. 179(1)(e) and, in consequence, as a participant does not receive a sum of money or valuable security, the scheme did not contravene that paragraph. I am in agreement with this conclusion.\nFurthermore, I do not think that the scheme would contravene that paragraph even if that which a participant obtains under it could be regarded as constituting valuable security. His entitlement to receive property under the scheme does not arise merely by his payment of money and the property to which he becomes entitled is not received by him \"by reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under the scheme, contrivance or operation\".\nThis is not a scheme such as that which was considered by this Court in Dream Home Contests (Edmonton) Limited v. R.3, under which a number of people purchased tickets and the winner received a prize substantially more valuable than the amount which he had paid for the ticket, as a result of the moneys paid for the tickets paid for by the other contestants. In the present case the typical participant does not become entitled to obtain his cartons of cigarettes or other products upon payment of the $4.00 fee. It is also necessary for him to persuade three other persons to enter into the arrangement which he himself has made. He thereby renders a service to the respondent company which, in turn, derives a benefit by reason of the wider advertising and distribution of the products which it has for sale and for which service it is prepared to compensate the participant in the form of goods of a value exceeding the $4.00 fee. While the scheme in question here is different from that which was considered by this Court in R. v. The Procter and Gamble Company of Canada, Ltd.4, and while the charge in that case was laid under different paragraphs of s. 179(1), the reasoning in that case is, I think, also applicable to the present one. The essence of the matter is that the respondent company is prepared to compensate, in the form of goods, at its own expense, for the performance of services which it obviously considers to be of value to itself. It is not conducting a scheme whereby a prize can be won by a contestant which is provided out of the funds obtained from other contestants under the scheme.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nAttorney for the appellant: R.

Geller Incorporated Respondent.\n1963: March 18; 1963: October 1.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Excise Tax\u2014Tax paid on dressed sheepskins not legally owing \u2014Petition of right to recover amount paid\u2014Whether refundable to dresser or to dealer who reimbursed dresser\u2014Statutory delay for claim\u2014Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, ss. 80A, 105(6).\nPursuant to s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act, N Co. paid some $20,000 in excise tax on dressed sheepskins delivered to the respondent G Co., a dealer in sheepskins. Shortly before that time, this Court had ruled in another case that \"mouton\" was not a fur within the meaning of s. 80A. By petition of right both companies claimed a refund of the tax, now admitted not to have been legally owing. It was admitted also that G Co. had reimbursed to N Co. the tax which the latter had paid.\nThe trial judge dismissed the petition of N Co. on the ground that the claim was not within the two-year period provided by s. 105(6) of the Act, but maintained the petition of G Co. because \"the right to claim a refund is open to any person who has paid moneys which have been taken to account as taxes imposed by the Act.\" The Crown appealed to this Court, but N Co. did not.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, except for a small amount admitted to have been paid by the respondent on imports.\nUnder the Act, the person obliged to pay the tax is the dresser and the person entitled to a refund is the dresser if the tax has been erroneously paid. In this case, the dresser's claim had been rightly denied by the Exchequer Court in view of the terms of s. 105(6) of the Act.\nThe respondent, G Co., had no legal right to claim a refund, even though it reimbursed the dresser for the tax paid. The arrangements between, the two companies were res inter alios acta and could not affect the rights of the Crown.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, maintaining a petition of right claiming a refund of excise tax paid. Appeal allowed.\nPaul Ollivier, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ. J. Spector, Q.C., and S. L. Mendelsohn, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Taschereau J.:\u2014Section 80A, c. 179 (R.S.C. 1927 and amendments) provides that:\n80A. 1. There shall be imposed, levied and collected, an excise tax equal to twenty-five per cent of the current market value of all dressed furs, dyed furs and dressed and dyed furs,\u2014\n(i) imported into Canada, payable by the importer or transferee of such goods before they are removed from the custody of the proper customs officer; or\n(ii) dressed, dyed, or dressed and dyed in Canada, payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of delivery by him.\n2. Every person liable for taxes under this section shall, in addition to the returns required by subsection one of section one hundred and six of this Act, file each day a true return of the total taxable value and the amount of tax due by him on his deliveries of dressed furs, dyed furs, and dressed and dyed furs for the last preceding business day, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Minister.\n3. The said return shall be filed and the tax paid not later than the first business day following that on which the deliveries were made \u2026\nThe respondent M. Geller Inc. is a dealer in sheepskins, and some of this material was dressed in Canada by Nu-Way Lambskin Processors Ltd., both firms operating in the city and district of Montreal.\nNu-Way, as dresser was responsible for the payment of the tax under s. 80A, and paid $20,011.72 to Her Majesty the Queen, and on March 8, 1957, the present respondent and Nu-Way filed a Petition of Right claiming from Her Majesty the Queen the sum of $20,956.74. It is argued that the tax imposed on dressed furs in Canada is illegal because sheepskin is not a fur falling within the meaning of the Act. It is admitted by all parties that M. Geller Inc. reimbursed to Nu-Way the sum of $20,956.74 paid to Her Majesty the Queen by the latter.\nBoth Nu-Way and the respondent M. Geller Inc. claimed a refund of the amount paid. The respondent in the present case alleged that it was the only one that was required to pay the tax, that it paid the tax through the intermediary of Nu-Way Lambskin and that, having made a demand for refund in writing within two years from the date of payment, as required by the Act, it was entitled to such a refund.\nThe learned trial judge2 dismissed the Petition of Right of the suppliant Nu-Way Lambskin on the ground that it failed to apply for a refund within the statutory delay. Section 105(6) provides as follows:\n105(6) If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to His Majesty, any moneys which have been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such moneys shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such moneys were paid or overpaid.\nThe claim of the respondent however was maintained on the ground that the right to claim a refund is open to any person who has paid moneys which have been taken to account as taxes imposed by the Act and that the evidence established that the respondent is in fact the person who paid the moneys in question to Her Majesty.\nIt is clear and admitted that the said sum of $20,956.74 was paid as tax and that it was not legally owing, as this Court decided in several cases and particularly in Universal Furs Dressers and Dyers Ltd. v. Her Majesty the Queen3. In that case it was held by this Court that mouton was not fur and, therefore, not taxable under s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act. Before this Court Nu-Way did not appeal, and we are concerned therefore only with the appeal of Her Majesty the Queen against the present respondent.\nI have reached the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the Petition dismissed in part.\nThe person obliged to pay the tax is the dresser, and the person entitled to a refund is the dresser if the tax has been paid through mistake of law or fact. In the present case, the tax was paid by the dresser Nu-Way and it was the sole person entitled to a refund. This was denied by the Exchequer Court, and rightly in view of the terms of s. 105, para. 6.\nThe respondent has no legal right to claim. It is true that M. Geller Inc. reimbursed Nu-Way, but this payment does not give a right of action to the former, which the law denies.\nThe arrangements made between Geller and Nu-Way are of no concern to the appellant. They are \"res inter alios acta\" and cannot affect the rights of the Crown.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed with costs, and the Petition dismissed except as to an amount of $945.02. It is conceded by the appellant that this sum was paid as excise duty on imports brought into Canada from the United States of America, and that it must be refunded.\nThe appellant will pay the costs in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. A. Driedger, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: J. J. Spector and S. L. Mendelsohn, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Ex. CR. 512, 60 D.V.T. 1189.\n2 [1960] Ex.

(Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nBruce Zien and Field's Welding Supplies Ltd. (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1963: October 22, 23; 1963: December 16.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Breach\u2014Right to rescind claimed\u2014Seriousness of defective performance\u2014Case one for damages and not rescission.\nThe defendant F had a business for the sale and distribution of welding supplies which he sold to the plaintiff Z. One of the terms of the agreement of sale was that at the time of closing, the cash, accounts receivable and inventory would exceed the accounts payable by at least $109,865. At the closing date, the balance was less than this sum by approximately $14,000. The plaintiff, after being in possession of the business for eleven weeks, claimed the right to rescind. He secured this relief at trial and held it on appeal, one member of the Court dissenting. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIn deciding whether the remedy is rescission, with all its consequences or damages, the emphasis should be on the seriousness of the defective performance in the particular contract. While not saying that the breach in the present case was trivial it was necessary to weigh its commercial importance and, having regard to the amount of the shortage, the ascertainable probability of its occurrence at the time of the formation of the contract, the amount involved in the contract and the holdback of the final payment of $50,000 for four months, this was a case for damages and not rescission. To follow this course was not to compel the plaintiff to accept something which differed in an important way from that which he contracted to buy. If the $14,000 were put into the company or if the plaintiff paid $14,000 less, he would be fully compensated.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Brown J. Appeal allowed.\nV. R. Butts, for the defendants, appellants.\nM. M. Grossman, Q.C., and D. R. Sheppard, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014I will refer to the parties to this litigation as Field, on the one hand, and Zien, on the other. Field had a business for the sale and distribution of welding supplies which he sold to Zien. One of the terms of the agreement of sale was that at the time of closing, the cash, accounts receivable and inventory would exceed the accounts payable by at least $109,865. At the closing date, the balance was less than this sum by 14,000 odd dollars. Zien, after being in possession of the business for eleven weeks, claimed the right to rescind. He secured this relief at trial and held it on appeal[2], Davey J.A. dissenting. Field now appeals to this Court.\nThe case was pleaded as one of misrepresentation on five grounds, all of which the trial judge rejected. He did, however, find another misrepresentation that was not pleaded. This, in turn, was rejected by the Court of Appeal. We are, therefore, in this position at this stage, that no misrepresentations have been proved and the argument addressed to us fails to persuade me that there was any error on this point.\nThe Court of Appeal was asked to dismiss the action on this ground alone but all the judges held, correctly in my opinion, that it was still open to the trial judge and to them to consider the effect of clause 5.3 of the contract which I have summarized above. Clause 5.3 of the contract reads:\nAs at the closing hour the aggregate of cash on hand and at bank valued at par, trade accounts receivable at, book value before allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory at lower of cost or market will exceed the accounts payable, the principal amounts owing on the contracts described in paragraphs 5.8.1 and 5.8.2 and the amount payable by you under paragraph 4.6.5 and accrued liabilities of the companies by at least $109,865.00.\nThe contract took the form of a letter from Field to Zien giving him an option to buy. It is dated February 7, 1961, and recites the payment on that date of $1,000 for the option. Zien was to exercise the option before February 26, 1961, by written notice, together with a certified cheque for $24,000. He did this. On the exercise of the option a binding contract for sale and purchase was to come into existence. The price was $175,000, of which $25,000 had already been paid, and a further $100,000 was to be paid at the closing hour (8.30 a.m. March 1, 1961) and the balance of $50,000 four months after the closing hour. Zien paid the $100,000 on the due date and Field transferred the assets of the business. In mid May 1961 the parties discovered that the balance of current assets over current liabilities was approximately $14,000 short of the figure stated in paragraph 5.3. On May 19, 1961, Zien gave notice of rescission of the contract and tendered the business and assets back to the appellants. When the tender was rejected he issued his writ claiming rescission on the ground of misrepresentation, the return of his $125,000 and damages and indemnity and, in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.\nMisrepresentation has now disappeared as an issue in this litigation. All the judgments of the Court of Appeal were founded upon the effect of clause 5.3. This is a term of the contract which promises that on a certain date the working capital will be not less than a certain figure. Both the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal have held that Zien is automatically entitled to rescission because the working capital did not reach that figure on that date. The trial judge said:\nAs to this the defendant says that he is willing to have the purchase price cut by the amount of the deficiency and submits that the clause ought to be interpreted to give him this doubtful privilege. But the predecessor of this clause in an earlier draft specifically drawn to provide for this was rejected on behalf of the plaintiff. It ought to have been evident to the accounting advisers of both the plaintiff and defendant that the so-called planned expansion of the company would make literal compliance with 5.3 impossible; nevertheless the defendant accepted this clause prefaced by he words \"we warrant and represent to you and covenant with you that\", and I must reluctantly hold that the defendant is thereby trapped. In my opinion the conclusion reached by the trial judge does not follow logically from the breach. In deciding whether the remedy is rescission, with all its consequences or damages, the emphasis should be on the seriousness of the defective performance in the particular contract. Nothing in the way of clarity is gained by attaching a label to the clause. The case for Zien, once the element of misrepresentation goes, is that clause 5.3 is a promise that during the period in question the business would show a profitable operation from September 30, 1960, the date of the last balance sheet, to the date of closing. I cannot draw this inference from the clause. Zien knew that there had been material changes in the business since September 30, 1960, such as:\n(a) the occupation of larger premises;\n(b) the taking on of new lines and the expansion of old lines;\n(c) additional personnel;\n(d) reduction in cartage income;\n(e) the setting up of a repair shop; and\n(f) an increase in inventory.\nThese changes involved non-recurring capital expenses of some $11,000 which were involved in the figure stated in clause 5.3, increases in regular operating expenses and nonrecurring expenses in re-organizing and moving the business. All these factors contributed to the deficiency of $14,000 and might have been foreseen by either party. Indeed, the learned trial judge says that the planned expansion ought to have made it apparent to the accountants of both parties that literal compliance with the clause would be impossible.\nIn these circumstances and with the last $50,000 of the purchase price made payable four months after closing, one cannot gather any intention that the parties contemplated that a breach such as the one in question here would give a right of rescission. A breach of this clause might be trivial or serious. I am not saying that this breach is trivial but one must weigh its commercial importance and, having regard to the amount of the shortage, the ascertainable probability of its occurrence at the time of the formation of the contract, the amount involved in the contract and the holdback of the final payment of $50,000 for four months, my conclusion is that the case is one for damages and not rescission, and that to follow this course is not to compel Zien to accept something which differs in an important way from that which he contracted to buy. If this $14,000 is put into the company or if Zien pays $14,000 less, he is fully compensated. If Zien had wanted rescission for any deficiency in this account he could have stipulated for it and it would have been enforced.\nFor these reasons I would follow the dissenting judgment of Davey J.A. and allow the appeal.\nThere is a balance of $50,000 owing to Field, less the sum of $14,134.07. This is the subject of a counter-claim. In view of the fact that the counter-claim contains other items and the appellant asks that the counter-claim as a whole be referred back to the trial judge, I would limit the judgment of this Court to the following points:\n(a) The appeal is allowed and the contract declared valid and binding.\n(b) Judgment for the balance of the purchase price, namely, $50,000, less the damages of $14,134.07. If this sum is not accepted, it must be dealt with on the reference back to the judge.\n(c) A reference back to the trial judge to decide the other items of the counter-claim.\n(d) The appellants should have their costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Gowan & Butts, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Grossman & Miller, Vancouver.\n[1] (1963), 43 W.W.R. 577.\n[2] (1963), 43 W.W.R. 577.\n"

Article 13 of the construction contract provided that the plaintiffs should have access to the work wherever it was in preparation or progress and obligated the contractor to provide proper facilities for such access and for inspection. The plaintiffs visited the premises on a holiday and as no workmen were present arrangements were made with the superintendent that they would return the following week. When the plaintiffs returned on the next working day the superintendent was not on hand, but with the assistance of some workmen they climbed to the roof. There they walked about taking photographs and eventually came to an area where metal sheets were laid out preparatory to being put in their permanent place to be welded. They stepped on the butt ends of metal sheeting not supported by a girder and fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. The trial judge held that the defendant was liable in tort for its negligence and in contract for implied breach of its obligation. He also found the plaintiffs negligent and apportioned the fault 75 per cent against the defendant and 25 per cent against the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal and held that the defendant did not fail in any duty it owed to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was no basis for the application of the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria in this case. Lehnert v. Stein, [1963] S.C.R. 38, referred to.\nIn exercising their rights under Article 13 of the construction contract, the appellants had to act reasonably and with reasonable care on their own part for their own safety. The situation in this case could not be described as one arising from an unusual danger in relation to the appellants. They did not seek out the superintendent but went alone to the partially finished roof. They were in no danger until they ventured upon the unfinished area and that area did not have the appearance of safety and, as found by the trial judge, they should have realized and appreciated this condition. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Landreville J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and R.W. McKimm, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nB.J. Thomson, Q.C., and R.K. Laishley, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 which reversed a judgment of Landreville J. in which he awarded the appellant Foster damages in the sum of $18,273 and the appellant Robillard the sum of $11,859.19 against the respondent, a construction firm which was erecting a shopping centre for McArthur Plaza Shopping Centre Limited in Eastview, Ontario. Foster was President of McArthur Plaza Shopping Centre Limited and Robillard was General Manager. The two men had worked closely together for some three years chiefly with the development of the shopping centre.\nConstruction had progressed to the point that the Structural Steel Company, a sub-contractor, was in the course of laying the roof.\nThe roof was of sheet metal construction, the sheets having a length of fourteen to sixteen feet. The process of laying this roof was in three stages. First the sheets were hauled to the roof, then these sheets were placed crosswise on the steel girders which were six feet apart and lastly the sheets were adjusted in their permanent position, viz.: tongue and lap together on the sides and an overlap at the ends in which position they were spot-welded by an electric welding machine.\nIn the construction contract the following provision appeared:\nArticle 13. Inspection of work.\u2014The Owner or the Architect on his behalf and their representative shall at all times have access to the work wherever it is in preparation or progress and the Contractor shall provide proper facilities for such access and for inspection. Verification and approval of the work of construction was carried out from time to time by the architect. In addition the plaintiff, Robillard, came to the premises almost daily and the plaintiff, Foster, was said to have visited from time to time. Accommodation in a shack at the site was provided for the architect and the owner\u2019s representatives.\nThe facts as found by the learned trial judge are as follows:\n1. On Good Friday, March 27th, 1959, Foster, Robillard, and John Doherty, Secretary\u2011treasurer of the company, attended at the job. This being a holiday, no workmen were there. However, Alcide Thelland, the construction superintendent for the defendant company was present.\n2. That it was arranged between Foster and Thelland that Foster and Robillard would return the following week. He did not accept Thelland\u2019s evidence that on their return Foster and Robillard were not to go on the roof unless escorted by Thelland or an assigned employee.\n3. Foster and Robillard returned the following Monday, March 30th. Thelland was not on hand. Foster busied himself with certain matters and Robillard climbed to the roof. He walked about for approximately 15 minutes without anyone speaking to him. He took a number of photographs.\n4. Robillard returned to ground level where he met Foster. Both then went to a mezzanine floor by way of a ladder being helped by some workmen who assisted them from the mezzanine floor to the roof.\n5. They walked about the roof taking photographs and eventually came to the area where the sheets were laid out preparatory to being put in their permanent place to be welded.\n6. That Foster and Robillard fell to the ground because they walked on the butt ends of the metal sheeting not supported by a girder and in teeter-totter manner they fell to the ground and both were seriously injured.\n7. That the sheets which fell with Foster and Robillard were not in their final place and it was not negligence on the part of the appellants to have so placed the sheets in the then transitory stage of construction.\n8. That the area where Foster and Robillard fell as distinct from other areas of the roof did not have the appearance of safety and Foster and Robillard should have realized and appreciated this condition. The learned judge says of this area \u201cthis area was abnormally dangerous\u201d.\n9. That the area in question was not a trap or a concealed danger, but the sheets were in a position which did not present a situation of obvious danger to Foster and Robillard although the workmen would know it was dangerous to walk on those sheets.\nOn these facts, the learned trial judge held, having regard to Article 13 quoted above, that the respondent was liable in tort for its negligence and in contract for implied breach of its obligation. He also found Foster and Robillard negligent and apportioned the fault 75 per cent against the respondent and 25 per cent against the appellants.\nThe learned trial judge also held that the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria did not apply in this case and with this I agree. The circumstances under which the doctrine applies were fully explored in Lehnert v. Stein[2]. No basis for the application of the doctrine exists here on the facts so found.\nMcGillivray J.A., with whom Porter C.J.O. and Roach J.A. concurred, held that on the facts as found by the learned trial judge the respondent did not fail in any duty it owed to the appellants. With respect, I agree with this conclusion. While the appellants had the right under Article 13 of the construction contract to have access to the work wherever it was in preparation or progress and the contractor was under obligation to provide proper facilities for such access and for inspection, the fact remains that in exercising their rights under this article, the appellants had to act reasonably and with reasonable care on their own part for their own safety. The situation in the instant case cannot be described as one arising from an unusual danger in relation to these appellants. They did not seek out the foreman Thelland but went alone to the roof. Once on the roof, the situation was plain for them to see. Certain areas were totally uncovered, other areas were in an unfinished state, while in a certain portion the sheets had been welded into place. They were in no danger until they ventured upon the unfinished area and that area did not have the appearance of safety and, as found by the learned trial judge, they should have realized and appreciated this condition.\nThe appeal must, accordingly, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Mirsky, Soloway, Houston, Galligan & McKimm, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Hughes, Laishley & Mullen, Ottawa.\n[1] [1962] O.R. 343, 32 D.L.R.

The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 643\nDate: 1963-10-18\nStanley H. Lieberman Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen, on the information of Foster Thurston, Chamberlain of the City of Saint John Respondent.\n1963: February 26; 1963: October 18.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION.\nCriminal law\u2014Constitutional law\u2014Sunday closing\u2014Licensing by-law\u2014Validity of by-law\u2014Whether encroachment on field of criminal law\u2014Whether in conflict with Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171\u2014 Whether in conflict with Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 160, 176\u2014B.N.A. Act, 1867, c. 3.\nThe accused was charged under a by-law passed by the City of Saint John in 1908 with operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Section 3 of this licensing by-law prohibited the operation of a bowling alley between 12 midnight and 6 a.m. on weekdays, \"or on Sunday\". Section 4 prohibited disorderly conduct and gambling on any licensed premises. Penalties were provided for contraventions in the final section.\nThe accused contended that s. 3 of the by-law was invalid as being an encroachment on the field of criminal law. The charge was dismissed by a Police Magistrate on the ground that there was a conflict between s. 3 and the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. On appeal to the County Court, the accused was convicted. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe accused did not question the power of the City of Saint John to make by-laws for the licensing of bowling alleys within its boundaries. The matter of closing hours was also within its jurisdiction. Legislation intended to prevent the profanation of the Sabbath is part of the criminal law reserved to the Parliament by s. 91(27) of the B.N.A Act. However, the impugned by-law was not primarily concerned with preserving the sanctity of the Sabbath, but was directed to the merely local matter of regulating the hours when certain licensed businesses were to close in the city of Saint John. The mere addition of the words \"or on Sunday\" at the end of s. 3 did not afford sufficient evidence to justify the inference that the by-law was directed towards the prevention of the profanation of the Sabbath and that it was thus beyond the ambit of provincial authority. Nor could it be said that s. 3 was inoperative as being in conflict with the Lord's Day Act. If the licensing power vested in the provinces by s. 92(9) of the B.N A. Act was exercised in respect of a local matter and in a manner not repugnant to federal or provincial law, the provincial authority was entitled to attach such conditions and impose such penalties as it might see fit. The fact that these conditions were in conformity with federal legislation in no way invalidated the by-law. For the same reasons, it could not be said that s. 4 of the by-law was in conflict with ss. 160 and 176 of the Criminal Code.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, affirming the conviction of the accused on a charge of operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Appeal dismissed.\nJohn P. Palmer, for the appellant.\nG. T. Clark, Q.C., and E. J. Lahey, for the respondent.\nW. C. Bowman, Q.C., and F. W. Callaghan, for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nJ. W. Anderson, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Alberta.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick2 which affirmed the conviction of the appellant for keeping a bowling alley open on Sunday contrary to the provisions of a by-law duly passed by \"the City of Saint John in common council convened\" on the 13th of July 1908 under the authority of the Charter of that city and entitled \"A law to regulate and license public billiard rooms and pool rooms and bowling alleys in the City of Saint John\".\nThe first section of the by-law in question provides that \"no person shall carry on business as a keeper of a public billiard or pool room or bowling alley without first having obtained a licence therefor\", and the second section empowers the mayor of the city to grant such licences at specified fees.\nThe third and fourth sections read as follows:\n3. No person shall keep open any public billiard or pool room or bowling alley on any week day between the hour of twelve o'clock at night and the hour of six o'clock in the forenoon, or on Sunday. 4. No person licensed under the provisions of this law to keep any such public billiard or pool room or bowling alley shall permit any drunken or disorderly person, or any keeper of a house of ill fame, to resort to or frequent the premises kept by him, in respect to which such license has been granted, or keep, suffer or permit to be kept in such premises any faro bank, rouge et noir, roulette table or any other device for gambling of any kind to be carried on therein, or suffer or permit any noise, disorderly conduct, disturbance or breach of the peace to take place therein.\nThe final section of the by-law provides, inter alia, that \"any person \u2026 who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this law shall forfeit and pay for each and every time such person shall so act in contravention of this law a penalty of twenty dollars to be sued for, prosecuted and recovered in the name of the Chamberlain of the said city for the time being before the police magistrate or sitting magistrate at the police office as provided by law \u2026\".\nIt is admitted that the appellant and one Mortimer L. Bernstein who were licensed keepers of a bowling alley on Union Street in the city of Saint John, kept the said bowling alley open on Sunday, the 23rd day of October 1960, as alleged in the Information but it has been contended throughout on behalf of the appellant that s. 3 of the by-law in question was invalid as constituting an encroachment on the field of criminal law.\nThis charge was dismissed by the police magistrate before whom the Information was laid on the ground that there was a conflict between s. 3 of the by-law and the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. In the course of his reasons for judgment, the learned magistrate said:\nIn other words, the by-law\u2014if it were allowed to remain operative\u2014 would conflict with the federal statute, the Lord's Day Act, in the penalty to be imposed; and the penalty is always considered as part of the statute. On that basis, I would rule that section 3 of the by-law before this Court \u2026 is invalid or inoperative with regard to the matter of Sunday.\nKeirstead C.C.J. before whom an appeal was taken pursuant to the provisions of the Summary Conviction Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 220, convicted the appellant, he being of opinion\nthat the relevant provisions of the Lord's Day Act and the by-law differ in legislative purposes, legal effect and practical effect. The by-law imposes a duty, provides a regulation and control for purposes or objects whose nature and character bona fide fall within the field of provincial competence or authority. In the reasons for judgment dismissing the appellant's appeal delivered by McNair C.J. on behalf of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the matter was put thus:\nThe restrictions in the by-law relating to Sunday operations, viewed in their context, appear intended for other purposes than to compel the observance or prevent the profanation of the Sabbath Day. Like their companion restrictions against night operations they seem in their true nature and character designed to promote purely secular purposes involving protection of the right of people in the community to rest and quiet during the prohibited periods. As such they are, we feel, within the legislative jurisdiction of the province and fit subject matter for municipal legislation.\nThe City of Saint John was incorporated by letters patent issued by the Governor of the Province of New Brunswick in 1785, and the Charter of that city has since been amended by over 500 acts of the New Brunswick Legislature. Under the provisions of that Charter, the common council of the city is given power to make by-laws for, inter alia,\nthe good rule and government of the \u2026 inhabitants and residents of the said city and for the further public good, common profit, trade and better government of the said city \u2026 provided that such laws be not \u2026 repugnant to the laws of \u2026 England or of our said Province.\nSince Confederation the powers so conferred are to be confined to the sphere of authority allotted to the provinces under the British North America Act. As was observed by Lord Watson in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada3:\nSince that date, a provincial legislature cannot delegate any power which it does not possess and the extent and nature of the functions created must depend upon the legislative authority which it derives from the provisions of s. 92 other than no. 8.\nIt is true that s. 15 of the Lord's Day Act, supra, which was first enacted in 1906, provides that\nnothing herein shall be construed to repeal or in any way affect any provisions of any act or law relating in any way to the observance of the Lord's Day Act in force in any province of Canada when this Act comes into force; and where any person violates any of the provisions of this Act and such offence is also a violation of any other act or law the offender may be proceeded against either under the provisions of this Act or under the provisions of any other act or law applicable to the offence charged. In this regard, it is to be noted that although the \"Charter of the City of Saint John\" was enacted before Confederation, the impugned by-law was passed in 1908 and is therefore not a law which was in force at the time when the Lord's Day Act came into force. The power of the City of Saint John to make by-laws for the licensing of public billiard rooms, pool rooms and bowling alleys within its boundaries is not, however, questioned by the appellant.\nThe matter of hours at which shops of a specified class shall close in particular localities in a province is prima facie within the jurisdiction of such province under head 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. As was said by Duff J. in City of Montreal v. Beauvais4, it\nis a matter which is substantially of local interest in the province and which in itself is not of any direct or substantial interest to the dominion as a whole.\nIt has, however, been accepted since the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General of Canada v. Hamilton Street Railway5, that legislation intended for the purpose of preventing the profanation of the Sabbath is a part of the criminal law in its widest sense and is thus reserved to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British North America Act and the immediate question raised by this appeal is whether it can be said that the impugned by-law has for its true object, purpose, nature and character the preservation of the sanctity of the Sabbath or whether it is directed to the merely local matter of regulating the hours when certain licensed businesses are to close in the City of Saint John.\nIn this regard, the submission for the appellant is succinctly stated in the first paragraph of the argument outlined in the factum filed on his behalf as follows:\nIt is submitted that the by-law in question is invalid on the ground that it purports by the simple words \"or on Sunday\" to deal with matters of morals or religious observance which fall within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe prohibition against keeping public billiard rooms, pool rooms and bowling alleys open during the hours specified in s. 3 is not to be read in isolation from the rest of the by-law and when the enactment is read as a whole it will be seen that the impugned section is but one of a number of regulations which the common council has imposed upon the operators of such businesses in the city of Saint John. The nature of the restrictions so imposed by the common council appears to me to reflect nothing more than the opinion of that body as to the manner in which such businesses are to be carried on for the better government of the city.\nIt is not to be lightly assumed that any part of the by-law is directed to a purpose beyond the legislative competence of the enacting authority and I do not think that the inclusion of Sunday in the hours of closing of these businesses necessarily carries with it any moral or religious significance.\nCounsel for the appellant has called to our attention a number of cases in this Court deciding that provincial statutes designed to enforce the observance of days of religious obligation are ultra vires, but in each of these cases the legislation in question carried within itself clear evidence that it was directed to this end.\nIt appears to me to be convenient to indicate the legislation which was before the Court in each of these cases:\n(i) Re Sunday Observance6, in this case the Court was unable to distinguish the draft bill before them from the statute entitled \"An Act to prevent the profanation of the Lord's Day\" which was the subject matter of the decision in Attorney General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway, supra.\n(ii) In Ouimet v. Bazin7, the very title of the Act \"A Law concerning the observance of Sunday\" bespoke its purpose.\n(iii) In St. Prosper v. Rodrique8, the legislation in question was a municipal by-law which forbade the opening of restaurants and the sale of merchandise therein on Sundays, and which contained the following preamble:\nVu qu'il importe dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la paix et des bonnes moeurs de prohiber l'ouverture des restaurants le dimanche, et le commerce des restaurants;. (iv) In Henry Birks & Sons v. City of Montreal and A.G. Quebec9, the impugned legislation was directed towards the closing of businesses on certain feasts of obligation of the Roman Catholic Church other than Sunday, and Kellock J. observed at page 822:\nIf Sunday observance legislation was designed to enforce under penalty the observance of a day by reason of its religious significance, there is no basis for distinction, in my opinion, historically or otherwise, with respect to legislation directed to the enforcement of the observance of other days from the standpoint of their significance in any religious faith.\nIt seems to me that these decisions, dealing as they do with statutes the very language of which invites the conclusion that they were intended for the purpose of enforcing the observance of the religious significance attaching to the Sabbath and to other religious feasts, can have no application to the by-law now under consideration, the attack upon which is limited to the fact that the words \"or on Sunday\" have been added to a list of other times when certain businesses are to be closed.\nThe language employed by Fitzpatrick C.J. in Ouimet v. Bazin, supra, at page 507, appears to me to be significant. He there said of the statute before him:\nIt is impossible for me to believe that the legislature intended, by the enactment in question, to regulate civil rights. On the contrary, the evident object was to conserve public morality and to provide for the peace and order of the public on the Lord's Day. I am confirmed in this belief by the title of the Act which is described as \"A Law concerning the observance of Sunday\"; and, as Sedgewick J., speaking for the majority of this court, said in O'Connor v. Nova Scotia Telephone Co., 22 S.C.R. 276 at page 293: \"We cannot with propriety shut our eyes to the words of the title\".\nAs I have indicated, I have reached the conclusion that the by-law here in question, entitled as it is \"A Law to regulate and license public billiard and pool rooms and bowling alleys in the city of Saint John\" and primarily concerned as it undoubtedly is with secular matters, has for its true object, purpose, nature or character, the regulation of the hours at which businesses of special classes shall close in a particular locality in the Province of New Brunswick which is a matter of a merely private nature in that province. As I have also indicated, I am of opinion that the mere addition of the words \"or on Sunday\" at the end of s. 3 does not afford sufficient evidence to justify the inference that this by-law is directed towards the prevention of the profanation of the Sabbath and that it is thus beyond the ambit of provincial authority.\nNor do I think that it can be said that s. 3 of the by-law is inoperative as being in conflict with the Lord's Day Act. The licensing power vested in the provinces by s. 92(9) is not limited to the shop, saloon, tavern and auctioneer licenses specified in that section, and if that power is exercised in respect of a merely local matter and in a manner which is not repugnant to federal or provincial law the provincial authority is, in my opinion, entitled to attach such conditions and impose such penalties as it may see fit in respect to the manner in which the persons so licensed shall conduct the businesses which are the subject of such licenses. The fact that one or more of the conditions so imposed is in conformity with legislation validly passed by the federal government in no way invalidates the by-law.\nWhat was said by Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling10, concerning the alleged conflict between s. 55(1) of the Highway Traffic Act of Manitoba and s. 221 of the Criminal Code appears to me to have direct application to the conflict here alleged between the by-law and the Lord's Day Act. He there said at page 811:\nThere is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant. The provisions deal with different subject matters and are for different purposes.\nAnd later in the same paragraph:\nEven though the circumstances of a particular case may be within the scope of both provisions (and in that sense there may be an overlapping) that does not mean that there is conflict so that the Court must conclude that the provincial enactment is suspended or inoperative.\nIt was argued before the appeal division that the entire by-law was ultra vires because the provisions of s. 4 were in conflict with ss. 160 and 176 of the Criminal Code. As to this argument, the learned Chief Justice expressed himself as follows:\nSections 3 and 4 of the by-law seem to us separate and distinct as to subject matter, being in no way integrated in object or purpose, and we feel the doctrine of severability aptly applies. Assuming, therefore, without deciding, that section 4 is constitutionally invalid its illegality does not affect the validity of section 3.\nWith the greatest respect, I do not share the doubts expressed by McNair C.J., as I take the view that s. 4 and the penalty which accompanies its breach constitute nothing more than another condition imposed by the city in the exercise of its right to control the manner in which these businesses shall be operated within its boundaries, and the above quoted reasoning of Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling, supra, applies with equal force to this section.\nIn all other respects, I am in agreement with the reasons for judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and I would dismiss this appeal but without costs.\nBy order of this Court, the Attorney General of Canada and the attorneys general of the provinces were served with notice of this appeal together with a copy of the factum of the appellant and the respondent and it was directed that any attorney general who desired to be heard should file a factum in this Court and serve a copy on each of the parties. The Attorney General for the Province of Alberta was, however, the only intervenant.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Teed, Palmer, O'Connell & Leger, Saint John.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 651\nDate: 1963-10-18\nWalter Robertson and Fred Rosetanni (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1963: February 27, 28; 1963: October 18.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Constitutional law\u2014Sunday closing\u2014Bowling alley\u2014Whether infringement of religious freedom\u2014Whether conflict with Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44\u2014Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. The appellants were convicted on a charge that they unlawfully carried on their ordinary calling, to wit, the operation of a bowling alley on a Sunday, contrary to the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. Their appeals were dismissed and they were granted leave to appeal to this Court. Their main attack was that the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, had in effect repealed s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, or, in any event, rendered it ineffective.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The Canadian Bill of Rights was not concerned with \u201chuman rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d in any abstract sense, but rather with such \u201crights and freedoms\u201d as they existed in Canada immediately before the statute was enacted. Legislation for the preservation of the sanctity of Sunday has existed in Canada from the earliest times and has, at least since 1903, been regarded as part of the criminal law in its widest sense. Historically such legislation has never been considered as an interference with the kind of \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights. The effect rather than the purpose of the Lord\u2019s Day Act should be looked to in order to determine whether its application involved the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of religious freedom. There was nothing in that statute which in any way affected the liberty of religious thought and practice. The practical result of this law on those whose religion required them to observe a day of rest other than Sunday was purely secular and financial. In some cases this was no doubt a business inconvenience, but it was neither an abrogation nor an infringement of religious freedom. The fact that it had been brought about by reason of the existence of a statute enacted for the purpose of preserving the sanctity of Sunday could not be construed as attaching some religious significance to an effect which was purely secular insofar as non-Christians were concerned.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The purpose and effect of the Lord\u2019s Day Act are to compel the observance of Sunday as a religious holy day by all the inhabitants of Canada; this is an infringement of religious freedom. Construed by the ordinary rules of construction s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act is clear and unambiguous and infringes the freedom of religion contemplated by the Canadian Bill of Rights. Parliament could not be taken to have been of the view that the Lord\u2019s Day Act did not infringe freedom of religion merely because that Act had been in force for more than half a century when the Canadian Bill of Rights was enacted. To so hold would be to disregard the plain words of s. 5(2) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Where there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act of Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must prevail. Section 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act infringes the freedom of religion declared and preserved in the Canadian Bill of Rights and must, therefore, be treated as inoperative.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the conviction of the appellants on a charge of operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting. J.J. Robinette, Q.C., and S. Paikin, Q.C., for the appellants.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., and F.W. Callaghan, for the respondent.\nT.D. MacDonald, Q.C., and D.H. Christie, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nI.G. Scott, for the Lord\u2019s Day Alliance.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario rendered without formal reasons, which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of Schatz J. dismissing an appeal by the appellants, by way of stated case for the opinion of the Court, against their conviction by a provincial magistrate in and for the County of Hamilton of a charge that they did unlawfully carry on their ordinary calling, to wit, the operation of a bowling alley, contrary to The Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.\nBy the stated case the learned Magistrate raised the following questions:\nWas I right:\u2014\n(a) In holding that the appellants were in contravention of The Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C, 1952, Ch. 171, and not solely in breach of By-Law No. 9252 of the Corporation of the City of Hamilton;\n(b) In assuming that in proper construction and application the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, Ch. 171, is not in conflict with the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, C. 44 and more particularly with Section 2 thereof.\nMr. Justice Schatz having answered both these questions in the affirmative without giving any formal reasons, the sole ground of appeal argued before the Court of Appeal for Ontario was that:\n...in proper construction and application the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C., 1952 Ch. 171 is in conflict with the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, C. 44 and more particularly with Section 2 thereof\u2026 This Court however granted the appellants leave to appeal \u201cat large\u201d and on their behalf argument was directed to the following issues:\n(a) That by the legislative imposition of Sunday observance as a religious value upon the whole Canadian Community, including those whose religious values and precepts permit them to engage in activities thus prohibited, the Lord\u2019s Day Act is in conflict with that human right and fundamental freedom set out in the Bill of Rights as \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d.\n(b) That the effect of Section 2 of the Bill of Rights is, subject to the single qualification set out in that section, to repeal any federal enactments which are in direct conflict with the enumerated \u201c...human rights and fundamental freedoms...\u201d declared and enshrined in the Act.\n(c) That statute law necessary for the regulation of the mode and method in which premises on which bowling is carried on are to be enjoyed, including the conditions as to time and otherwise during which the game and recreation might properly be carried on, is properly the subject of Provincial legislation.\nBy Section 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights it is \u201crecognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,\n(a) The right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property; and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;\n(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;\n(c) freedom of religion;\n(d) freedom of speech;\n(e) freedom of assembly and association; and\n(f) freedom of the press.\u201d\nIt is to be noted at the outset that the Canadian Bill of Rights is not concerned with \u201chuman rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d in any abstract sense, but rather with such \u201crights and freedoms\u201d as they existed in Canada immediately before the statute was enacted. (See also s. 5(1)). It is therefore the \u201creligious freedom\u201d then existing in this country that is safe-guarded by the provisions of s. 2 which read, in part, as follows:\nEvery law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or in- fringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared,...\nIt is accordingly of first importance to understand the concept of religious freedom which was recognized in this country before the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights and after the enactment of the Lord\u2019s Day Act in its present form, and in this regard the following observations of Taschereau J., as he then was, speaking for himself and Kerwin C.J. and Estey J., in Chaput v. Romain[1], appear to me to be significant:\nAll religions are on an equal footing, and Catholics as well as Protestants, Jews, and other adherents to various religious denominations, enjoy the most complete liberty of thought. The conscience of each is a personal matter and the concern of nobody else.\nThe position of \u201creligious freedom\u201d in the Canadian legal system was summarized by Rand J. in Saumur v. The City of Quebec[2], where he said:\nFrom 1760, therefore, to the present moment religious freedom has, in our legal system, been recognized as a principle of fundamental character; and although we have nothing in the nature of an established church, that the untrammelled affirmations of \u2018religious belief\u2019 and its propagation, personal or institutional, remain as of the greatest constitutional significance throughout the Dominion is unquestionable.\nIt is apparent from these judgments that \u201ccomplete liberty of religious thought\u201d and \u201cthe untrammelled affirmation of \u2018religious belief\u2019 and its propagation, personal or institutional\u201d were recognized by this Court as existing in Canada before the Canadian Bill of Rights and notwithstanding the provisions of the Lord\u2019s Day Act.\nIt is to be remembered that the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by the Courts of Canada before the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights and guaranteed by that statute were the rights and freedoms of men living together in an organized society subject to a rational, developed and civilized system of law which imposed limitations on the absolute liberty of the individual. In referring to the \u201cright of public discussion\u201d in Re Alberta Statutes[3], Sir Lyman Duff acknowledged this aspect of the matter when he said:\nThe right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of decency and public order and others conceived for the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in James vs. Commonwealth, (1936) A.C. 578, at 627, \u2018freedom governed by law\u2019.\nAlthough there are many differences between the constitution of this country and that of the United States of America, I would adopt the following sentences from the dissenting judgment of Frankfurter J. in Board of Education v. Barnette[4], as directly applicable to the \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d existing in this country both before and after the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights:\nThe constitutional protection of religious freedom terminated disabilities, it did not create new privileges. It gave religious equality, not civil immunity. Its essence is freedom from conformity to religious dogma, not freedom from conformity to law because of religious dogma.\nIt is against this background that the effect of the provisions of the Lord\u2019s Day Act on \u201creligious freedom\u201d as guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights is to be considered. Section 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act reads as follows:\nIt shall not be lawful for any person on the Lord\u2019s Day, except as provided herein, or in any provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or purchase any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate, or to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling, or in connection with such calling, or for gain to do, or employ any other person to do, on that day, any work, business, or labour.\nThe italics are my own and indicate the offence with which the appellants were charged.\nThere have been statutes in this country since long before Confederation passed for the express purpose of safeguarding the sanctity of the Sabbath (Sunday), and since the decision in Attorney General for Ontario vs. Hamilton Street Railway[5], it has been accepted that such legislation and the penalties imposed for its breach, constitutes a part of the criminal law in its widest sense and is thus reserved to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British North America Act. Different considerations, of course, apply to the power to legislate for the purely secular purpose of regulating hours of labour which, except as to the regulation of the hours of labour of Dominion servants, is primarily vested in the provincial legislatures. See the reference re Hours of Labour[6] and Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Ontario Reference re Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, Minimum Wages Act and Limitation of Hours Act[7].\nThe immediate question raised in this appeal, however, is whether the prohibition against any person carrying on or transacting any business of his ordinary calling on Sunday as contained in the Lord\u2019s Day Act, supra, is such as to \u201cabrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of\u2026\u201d the right of the appellants to freedom of religion.\nIt is said on behalf of the appellants that freedom of religion means \u201cfreedom to enjoy the freedom which my own religion allows without being confined by restrictions imposed by Parliament for the purpose of enforcing the tenets of a faith to which I do not subscribe.\u201d It is further pointed out that Orthodox Jews observe Saturday as the Sabbath and as a day of rest from their labours, whereas Friday is the day so observed by the members of the Mohammedan faith, and it is said that the Lord\u2019s Day Act imposes an aspect of the Christian faith, namely, the observance of Sunday on some citizens who do not subscribe to that faith.\nMy own view is that the effect of the Lord\u2019s Day Act rather than its purpose must be looked to in order to determine whether its application involves the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of religious freedom, and I can see nothing in that statute which in any way affects the liberty of religious thought and practice of any citizen of this country. Nor is the \u201cuntrammelled affirmations of religious belief and its propagation\u201d in any way curtailed.\nThe practical result of this law on those whose religion requires them to observe a day of rest other than Sunday, is a purely secular and financial one in that they are required to refrain from carrying on or conducting their business on Sunday as well as on their own day of rest. In some cases this is no doubt a business inconvenience, but it is neither an abrogation nor an abridgment nor an infringement of religious freedom, and the fact that it has been brought about by reason of the existence of a statute enacted for the purpose of preserving the sanctity of Sunday, cannot, in my view, be construed as attaching some religious significance to an effect which is purely secular in so far as non-Christians are concerned.\nAs has been indicated, legislation for the preservation of the sanctity of Sunday has existed in this country from the earliest times and has at least since 1903 been regarded as a part of the criminal law in its widest sense. Historically, such legislation has never been considered as an interference with the kind of \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights.\nI do not consider that any of the judges in the courts below have so construed and applied the Lord\u2019s Day Act as to abrogate, abridge, or infringe or authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d as guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights, nor do I think that the Lord\u2019s Day Act lends itself to such a construction.\nI dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellants were convicted on February 21, 1962, on the charge that they did, at the city of Hamilton, unlawfully carry on their ordinary calling, to wit, the operation of a bowling alley on January 14, 1962 (which was a Sunday) contrary to the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.\nIt is not questioned (i) that the appellants did in fact carry on their business as charged or (ii) that their so doing was forbidden by s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act or (iii) that that Act is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe conviction is attacked on the ground that the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960, 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 44, has in effect repealed s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act or, in any event, rendered it ineffective.\nThe relevant words of the Canadian Bill of Rights are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie, which I have had the advantage of reading. As applicable to the circumstances of this case the provisions of s. 2 may be put as follows:\nEvery law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgement or infringement of\u2026 freedom of religion.\nThat the Lord\u2019s Day Act is a law of Canada within the intendment of this section is made clear by s. 5(2) of the Canadian Bill of Rights which reads:\n(2) The expression \u2018law of Canada\u2019 in Part I means an Act of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the coming into force of this Act, any order, rule or regulation thereunder, and any law in force in Canada or in any part of Canada at the commencement of this Act that is subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada.\nThe first question to be decided is whether s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act does infringe freedom of religion, within the meaning of those words as used in the Canadian Bill of Rights. In approaching this question it must be borne in mind that it has been decided repeatedly that the constitutional power of Parliament to pass the Lord\u2019s Day Act is found in the fact that it is enacted in relation to religion and prescribes what are in essence religious obligations. It is for this reason that it has been held to fall within head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, the Criminal Law. Conversely it has been decided that legislation affecting the conduct of people on Sunday but enacted solely with a view to promoting some object having no relation to the religious character of that day is within the powers of the Provincial Legislatures.\nIt cannot be doubted that in 1867 and for many years prior thereto laws forbidding or compelling specified conduct on Sunday were regarded as forming part of the criminal law.\nIn Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, vol. IV, p. 63, the learned author says:\nProfanation of the Lord\u2019s day, or sabbath-breaking, is a ninth offence against God and religion, punished by the municipal laws of England. In Fennell et al. v. Ridler[8], Bayley J. delivering the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and referring to An Act for the better observation of the Lord\u2019s Day, commonly called Sunday (1676) 29 Charles II, c. 7, said:\nThe spirit of the act is to advance the interests of religion, to turn a man\u2019s thoughts from his wordly concerns, and to direct them to the duties of piety and religion.\nIn Henry Birks & Sons (Montreal) Ltd. v. Montreal and Attorney General for Quebec[9], the Court was considering the question whether provincial legislation could authorize the enactment of a by-law requiring shops to be closed on certain religious feast-days. Kellock J., with whom Locke J. agreed, said at page 823:\nEven if it could be said that legislation of the character here in question is not properly \u2018criminal law\u2019 within the meaning of s. 91(27), it would, in my opinion, still be beyond the jurisdiction of a provincial legislature as being legislation with respect to freedom of religion dealt with by the statute of 1852, 14-15 Vict., c. 175, Can.\nI can find no answer to the argument of counsel for the appellant, that the purpose and the effect of the Lord\u2019s Day Act are to compel, under the penal sanctions of the Criminal law, the observance of Sunday as a religious holy day by all the inhabitants of Canada; that this is an infringement of religious freedom I do not doubt.\nI agree with my brother Ritchie that the following words which he quotes from the judgment of Frankfurter J. in Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, are appropriate to describe the freedom of religion referred to in the Canadian Bill of Rights:\nIts essence is freedom from conformity to religious dogma, not freedom from conformity to law because of religious dogma.\nBut this passage presupposes that the word \u201claw\u201d which I have italicized means a law which has a constitutionally valid purpose and effect other than the forbidding or commanding of conduct in a solely religious aspect.\nIn my opinion a law which compels a course of conduct, whether positive or negative, for a purely religious purpose infringes the freedom of religion. A law which, on solely religious grounds, forbids the pursuit on Sunday of an otherwise lawful activity differs in degree, perhaps, but not in kind from a law which commands a purely religious course of conduct on that day, such as for example, the attendance at least once at divine service in a specified church.\nIt was argued that, in any event, in the case at bar the appeal must fail because there is no evidence that the appellants do not hold the religious belief that they are under no obligation to observe Sunday. In my view such evidence would be irrelevant. The task of the Court is to determine whether s. 4 of the Act infringes freedom of religion. This does not depend on the religious persuasion, if any, of the individual prosecuted but on the nature of the law. To give an extreme example, a law providing that every person in Canada should, on pain of fine or imprisonment, attend divine service in an Anglican church on at least one Sunday in every month would, in my opinion, infringe the religious freedom of every Anglican as well as that of every other citizen.\nI have reached the conclusion that construed by the ordinary rules of construction s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act is clear and unambiguous and does infringe the freedom of religion contemplated by the Canadian Bill of Rights.\nI cannot accept the argument that because the Lord\u2019s Day Act had been in force for more than half a century when the Canadian Bill of Rights was enacted, Parliament must be taken to have been of the view that the provisions of the Lord\u2019s Day Act do not infringe freedom of religion. To so hold would be to disregard the plain words of s. 5(2) quoted above.\nIt remains to consider the reasons for judgment of Davey J.A. in Regina v. Gonzales[10]. At page 239 of the C.C.C. Reports the learned Justice of Appeal says:\nIn so far as existing legislation does not offend against any of the matters specifically mentioned in clauses (a) to (g) of s. 2, but is said to otherwise infringe upon some of the human rights and fundamental freedoms declared in s. 1, in my opinion the section does not repeal such legislation either expressly or by implication. On the contrary, it expressly recognizes the continued existence of such legislation, but provides that it shall be construed and applied so as not to derogate from those rights and freedoms. By that it seems merely to provide a canon or rule of interpretation for such legislation. The very language of s. 2, \u2018be so construed and applied as not to abrogate\u2019 assumes that the prior Act may be sensibly construed and applied in a way that will avoid derogating from the rights and freedoms declared in s. 1. If the prior legislation cannot be so construed and applied sensibly, then the effect of s. 2 is exhausted, and the prior legislation must prevail according to its plain meaning.\nWith the greatest respect I find myself unable to agree with this view. The imperative words of s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights, quoted above, appear to me to require the courts to refuse to apply any law, coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, which infringes freedom of religion unless it is expressly declared by an Act of Parliament that the law which does so infringe shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights. As already pointed out s. 5(2), quoted above, makes it plain that the Canadian Bill of Rights is to apply to all laws of Canada already in existence at the time it came into force as well as to those thereafter enacted. In my opinion where there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act of Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must prevail.\nWhether the imposition, under penal sanctions, of a certain standard of religious conduct on the whole population is desirable is, of course, a question for Parliament to decide. But in enacting the Canadian Bill of Rights Parliament has thrown upon the courts the responsibility of deciding, in each case in which the question arises, whether such an imposition infringes the freedom of religion in Canada. In the case at bar I have reached the conclusion that s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act does infringe the freedom of religion declared and preserved in the Canadian Bill of Rights and must therefore be treated as inoperative.\nIt follows that I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction. Since I have the misfortune to differ from the other members of the Court as to the result of the appeal it is unnecessary to consider what order I would otherwise have suggested as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: White, Paikin, Foreman & Dean, Hamilton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.J.

The defendant while carrying two passengers in his motor vehicle was involved in a collision with another motor vehicle, as a result of which one of the passengers, the plaintiff J, was seriously injured, and the other passenger, the husband of the plaintiff K, was killed. J and K had made separate arrangements with the defendant whereby the latter agreed to provide them with transportation, at a fixed rate, from their place of employment to their family homes and return on weekends. It was while they were being driven by the defendant pursuant to these agreements that the accident occurred. The trial judge, who held that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant, was of the opinion that at the time of the accident the defendant\u2019s automobile was being \u201coperated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation\u201d, within the meaning of s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nThe principle enunciated in Lemieux v. Bedard, [1953] O.R. 837, that one who enters into an agreement to transport other persons in his automobile on a particular journey, in return for payment of an agreed sum of money, and proceeds to carry out the agreement, makes it his business on that occasion to carry passengers for compensation, and will not be relieved by s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act from liability for his negligence, even if there is no evidence that he has engaged in the business on any other occasion, was correct and applied a fortiori to the present case in which the arrangement was carried out week after week.\nWing v. Banks, [1947] O.W.N. 897, approved; Csehi v. Dixon, [1953] O.W.N. 238, disapproved.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing two judgments of Aylen J. Appeals dismissed.\nAndrew Brewin, Q.C., and Maurice Lacourciere, for the defendants, appellants.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., and F.L. Gratton, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014These appeals, which were argued together, are from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on February 6, 1962, dismissing without recorded reasons appeals from two judgments of Aylen J. pronounced on May 30, 1961.\nOn November 21, 1959, John Johnson and the late James Leo Kennefic were riding as passengers in a motor vehicle owned and driven by the appellant, which came into collision with another motor vehicle on Highway Number 17 in the Town of Copper Cliff in the Province of Ontario. Johnson was seriously injured and Kennefic was killed. Aylen J. held that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the appellant and gave judgment in favour of the respondent Johnson for $14,945.35 and in favour of the respondent Hazel Agnes Kennefic, the widow of the late James Leo Kennefic, for $22,300 apportioned between her and her two infant children.\nIn this Court no question is raised as to the findings of negligence or the assessment of damages. The sole question is whether the appellant is relieved from liability by the terms of subs. 2 of s. 105 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172.\nSection 105 reads as follows:\n105 (1) The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle on a highway unless the motor vehicle was without the owner\u2019s consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner is liable to the same extent as the owner.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from the motor vehicle.\nIn July 1959, the appellant commenced working at Consolidated-Denison Mine near Elliot Lake, Ontario. Johnson and Kennefic commenced work at the same mine early in September 1959.\nOuelette, Kennefic, and Johnson all lived in or near Sudbury which is some 128 miles east of Elliot Lake. It was their usual practice, however, to stay at lodgings provided by the company at the mine head during the work week and to go to and from their family homes in the Sudbury area on week-ends. There was no train connection between Elliot Lake and Sudbury and the only method of transport between the mine and the parties\u2019 homes in Sudbury was by private automobile or by bus. The bus fare was $4.20 for a one-way trip. Before getting work at the Consolidated Denison Mine, Johnson had travelled by bus to Sudbury for the week-end a few times, and both he and Kennefic had driven to Sudbury on a number of occasions with a fellow employee, Dionne, to whom they each paid $2 each way. In September 1959, Ouelette purchased an automobile. The evidence is that thereafter he drove to Sudbury on the week-ends alone on at least three occasions. He said that the cost of gasoline and oil for a one-way trip from Elliot Lake to Sudbury was approximately $4.\nIn late September or early October Johnson asked Ouelette if he would drive him to Sudbury on the weekends. Ouelette agreed to do so. The learned trial judge has found, and his finding is supported by the evidence, that it was agreed that Johnson would pay $2 each way for the week-end trips and that later the same agreement was made between Ouelette and Kennefic. It was while Johnson and Kennefic were being driven by Ouelette pursuant to these agreements that the accident occurred. They had been driven by him under the same agreements on several prior week-ends. The learned trial judge has found that Johnson and Kennefic either paid or obligated themselves to pay for all of these trips at the rate mentioned. He also found that the amount agreed to be paid was not based on the cost of gas or oil but on the amount Johnson had previously paid to Dionne.\nOn these facts the learned trial judge was of opinion that at the time of the accident Ouelette\u2019s automobile was being \u201coperated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation\u201d, within the meaning of s. 105(2), and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. In so doing he followed, inter alia, the case of Wing v. Banks[1], a judgment of Gale J. which was affirmed, without recorded reasons, by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal composed of Fisher, Laidlaw and Roach JJ.A. In my view that case was rightly decided and is indistinguishable from the case at bar. I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge.\nIn the course of the full and helpful arguments addressed to us by both counsel almost all, if not all, of the reported cases dealing with s. 105(2) or its predecessors were examined and discussed. Some of them are not easy to reconcile with others. It is not necessary for the decision of this appeal to examine them as I am satisfied that the facts of the case at bar bring it clearly within the ratio decidendi of those cases of which Wing v. Banks, supra, is a leading example, I wish to add only the following observations. In my opinion the principle enunciated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Lemieux v. Bedard[2] is correct. It is accurately summarized in the headnote as follows:\nOne who enters into an agreement to transport other persons in his automobile on a particular journey, in return for payment of an agreed sum of money, and proceeds to carry out the agreement, makes it his business on that occasion to carry passengers for compensation, and will not be relieved by s. 50(2) (now s. 105(2)) of The Highway Traffic Act from liability for his negligence, even if there is no evidence that he has engaged in the business on any other occasion.\nThis principle applies a fortiori to the case at bar in which the arrangement was carried out week after week.\nI do not wish to be understood as approving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Csehi v. Dixon[3]. In that case the Court accepted the decision in Wing v. Banks but found themselves able to distinguish it on the ground that the amount of the fixed fee agreed to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant for transporting him was arrived at by estimating a portion of the cost of the gasoline and oil used by the defendant. In my respectful view, once it has been determined that the arrangement between the parties was of a commercial nature the manner in which the amount of the fee to be paid was decided upon becomes irrelevant.\nI would dismiss both appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Lacourciere & Lacourciere, Sudbury.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent, John Johnson: Hawkins & Gratton, Sudbury.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents, Gladys Tourigny et al.: Valin & Valin, Sudbury.\n[1] [1947] O.W.N. 897.\n[2] [1953] O.R. 837.\n[3] [1953] O.W.N. 238, 2 D.L.R. 202.\n"

The defendants fraudulently concealed the fact that no permit existed to build a basement suite in the house. The plaintiffs brought an action claiming damages and were awarded judgment for $2,500. The defendants' appeal to the Court of Appeal having been allowed, the plaintiffs, with leave, appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe evidence adduced by the plaintiffs plus the presumption authorized by the authorities that, prima facie, the property was worth the sum paid for it, justified the trial judge in fixing the damages at $2,500, unless evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants rebutted this presumption. There was sound basis for the trial judge's conclusion that the defendants had not succeeded in rebutting the presumption. The plaintiffs then were justified in depending upon the admissions made by the defendant E in his examination for discovery, i.e., that the value of the house with a rentable suite therein, presumed to be $17,700 because of its purchase at that amount, would be reduced by $2,500 if it did not contain such a rentable basement suite.\nMcConnel v. Wright, [1903] 1 Ch. D. 546; Steele v. Pritchard (1907), 7 W.L.R. 108; Rosen v. Lindsay (1907), 7 W.L.R. 115; London County Freehold & Leasehold Properties Ltd. v. Berkeley Property and Investment Co., Ltd., referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, allowing an appeal from a judgment of MacPherson J. Appeal allowed.\nThe Hon. C. H. Locke, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nD. G. McLeod, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSpence J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan dated December 11, 1962. By that judgment the said Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from the judgment at trial of MacPherson J. dated September 26, 1961, granting to the plaintiffs judgment against all defendants for $2,500 and costs. The statement of claim in the action (case p. 1) sets out the purchase by the plaintiffs from the defendants Schaaf through the agency of the defendant Exner of premises known as 1306 Horace Street, Regina, and the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation in reference thereto made by the defendant Exner as agent for the defendants Schaaf. Although the prayer for relief in para. 10, subpara. (a) thereof is for a declaration that the agreement be rescinded, the statement of claim recites that the transaction was closed and that the plaintiffs went into occupation of the premises. It is probably for this reason that MacPherson J., in his reasons for judgment, considered the remedy of damages only. The defendants, in their notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, set out their grounds of appeal as follows:\n1. That the said judgment is against law, evidence and the weight of evidence.\n2. That the learned trial judge erred in holding that the defendants, or any of them, are guilty of deceit. 3. In the alternative, there was no evidence that the defendant, Exner, acted fraudulently or had any knowledge of the matters complained of.\n4. That the learned trial judge misdirected himself with respect to the measure of damages and should have held that there was no evidence on which to base an assessment of damages for deceit against the defendants, or any of them.\n5. That the learned trial judge erred in holding, if he did so hold, that the fraud and deceit, alleged in the plaintiff's statement of claim, had been proven and should have held that the plaintiffs had not established the fraud alleged against the defendants.\nGiving judgment for the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, Maguire J.A. said:\nThe claim of the plaintiff at trial was limited to one of damages, it not being possible to obtain nor grant rescission in that title to the purchaser's former dwelling had been transferred to the vendors in part satisfaction of the purchase price, and subsequently sold, thus preventing the parties being placed back in status quo.\nIt is not necessary, for the purposes of this appeal, to consider the several findings of the trial judge, other than the award of damages set at the sum of $2,500.00.\nThe plaintiffs obtained leave to appeal the judgment from the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan to this Court and the respondents, in their factum, at p. 4, set out the following \"Points in Issue\" (p. 4):\n(1) The Respondents submit that the Learned Trial Judge erred in holding that the Defendants, Exner and Schaaf, perpetrated a fraud by concealment.\n(2) The fraud alleged was not proven.\n(3) The agent, if anything, gave only an innocent misrepresentation and the principal did not deliberately employ an agent in order that an untrue representation would be made.\n(4) The Plaintiffs proved no loss resulting from the alleged fraud.\nCounsel for the respondents submitted argument upon the first three of these propositions but there appears no reason to disturb the finding of MacPherson J. at trial, who said:\nI find that the defendants Exner and Schaaf did perpetrate a fraud on the plaintiffs Hepting by concealing the fact that no permit to build the suite existed.\nTherefore, these reasons are concerned only with whether the plaintiffs have proved damages for the fraudulent misrepresentation found by the learned trial judge. The only evidence upon damages adduced by counsel for the plaintiff at the trial was, firstly, one question and answer put to the plaintiff Gertrude Hepting:\nQ. Have you had any experience in prices and values of houses of this type?\nA. Oh, yes, I've seen enough houses that I know that house isn't worth 17,6, what we paid for it, not without a basement suite. It's not built that good.\nThe Court: No. She has seen houses, Mr. Gerrand.\nMr. Gerrand: Well, I won't press that because I have lots of evidence on that point.\nThat evidence which, of course, was of no weight whatsoever, was not referred to again at the trial or on appeal. Secondly, counsel for the plaintiffs read in as part of the plaintiffs' case, inter alia, the answers of the defendant Exner upon the examination for discovery as follows:\n83. Q. As a real estate agent you would know, I take it, that there would be a substantial difference in value between that house with a properly rentable suite and one where the suite could not be occupied by law?\nA. That is right.\n84. Q. You would agree to that?\nA. Yes.\n85. Q. Would you like to venture an estimate of what the difference might be in value with or without?\nA. Twenty-five hundred dollars.\nand the answer of the defendant Schaaf upon examination for discovery:\n73. Q. Mr. Exner has made an estimate of the value of that property without the right of the rentable suite would be $2500.00 less than with it. Do you agree with those figures?\nA. Yes, I imagine it would be very close.\nGiving judgment for the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, Maguire J.A. quoted those questions and answers and said:\nThe first extract of evidence referred to deals with the varying value of the dwelling depending upon whether it contained a legal, and thus rentable, basement suite or not. It is thus of no help in determining damages within the rule or basis quoted. It does not in any sense go to establish that the purchasers obtained a property of less value than the price paid therefor. The learned justice in appeal was there applying the judgment of Lamont J. in Hasper v. Shauer1 at p. 215:\nThe measure of the plaintiff's damage in an action of deceit is, as stated by the trial judge, the difference between the contract price and the real value of the land (if that value be less) at the time the contract was entered into.\nand also quoted Kerr on Fraud and Mistake, 7th ed., p. 498.\nIn McConnel v. Wright2, the Court of Appeal considered an action for damages for deceit. Collins M.R. said (p. 554):\nThat obliges me to say something as to the principle upon which damages are assessed in these cases. There is no doubt about it now. It has been laid down by several judges, and particularly by Cotton L.J. in Peek v. Derry, 37 Ch. D. 541; but the common sense and principle of the thing is this. It is not an action for breach of contract, and, therefore, no damages in respect of prospective gains which the person contracting was entitled by his contract to expect come in, but it is an action of tort\u2014it is an action for a wrong done whereby the plaintiff was tricked out of certain money in his pocket; and therefore, prima facie, the highest limit of his damages is the whole extent of his loss, and that loss is measured by the money which was in his pocket and is now in the pocket of the company. That is the ultimate, final, highest standard of his loss. But, in so far as he has got an equivalent for that money, that loss is diminished; and I think, in assessing the damages, prima facie the assets as represented are taken to be an equivalent and no more for the money which was paid.\nCozens-Hardy L.J., said at p. 559:\nAs a rule of convenience, and indeed almost of necessity, the property which would have been acquired by the company, if all the statements in the prospectus had been correct, must prima facie be taken to be worth the precise sum paid for the property, neither more nor less. This is the prima facie presumption, and it is sufficient for the decision of the present case, for no evidence has been adduced by the defendant to rebut the presumption.\nThat statement has been accepted in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in Steele v. Pritchard3, and Rosen v. Lindsay4, where, at p. 117, Phippen J.A. said:\nThe law on this point appears to be clearly laid down by the Court of Appeal in England in McConnell v. Wright, [1903] 1 Ch. 554. It is probably most tersely stated by Cozens-Hardy L.J., at p. 559, (and the\nabove quotation is repeated). In London County Freehold & Leasehold Properties, Ltd. v. Berkeley Property and Investment Co., Ltd.5, Slesser L.J., said at p. 1047:\nThe damage will be the difference between \u00a3611,000 paid for the property and the amount which the plaintiffs would have paid had they known the actual circumstances as to these eleven flats.\nIn my view, therefore, the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs plus the presumption authorized by the authorities which I have cited would have justified the learned trial judge in fixing the damages at $2,500, as he did, unless evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants had rebutted the said presumption. The only evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants was the following:\nFirstly, in examination in chief of the defendant Exner:\nQ. Now, the selling price of 1306 Horace Street was $17,700.00. Can you give us your opinion of the value of 1306 Horace?\nA. My opinion as to the value of 1306, was that your question?\nQ. Yes.\nA. It was in line with other three bedroom homes in Rosemont district, as far as selling price, without suites, as just a straight three bedroom bungalow.\nQ. Is 1306 Horace Street a three bedroom bungalow?\nA. Yes.\nand the said counsel requesting and obtaining the recalling of the defendant Exner, asked him for an explanation of his answers upon examination for discovery to questions 83 to 85, quoted aforesaid. In reference thereto, the learned trial judge said:\nExner was asked in his examination for discovery (83 to 85) if there would be a substantial difference in value between that house (i.e. the one sold to the plaintiffs) with a properly rentable suite and one in which the suite could not in law be occupied. He agreed there would be a difference in value and he estimated the difference at $2,500.00. Schaaf in his examination agreed with Exner. The defendants tried to modify these answers at trial but, in my opinion, without success.\nCounsel for the respondents argued that the learned trial judge, in the last sentence just quoted, was referring only to the attempt by counsel for the defence to obtain from the defendant Exner an explanation of his answers to questions 83 to 85 on the examination for discovery. I am of opinion that the learned trial judge's remarks should not be so limited but that rather he expressed therein his view as to all of the evidence in reference to damages given by the defendant Exner and which I have quoted above, whether it be on his examination in chief or when recalled, and that in the result the learned trial judge found that the defendants had not rebutted the presumption arising from the proof that the plaintiffs had purchased these premises for $17,700 and that, therefore, prima facie, the premises, if they had possessed the accommodation represented to the plaintiffs, would have had a value of $17,700.\nI am further of the view that upon the evidence, the learned trial judge was justified in coming to the conclusion that the presumption had not been rebutted. It must be remembered that he had found as a fact that the defendants Schaaf and Exner had \"perpetrated a fraud on the plaintiffs Hepting by concealing the fact that no permit to build the suite existed\" and it would be strange if they sold to the plaintiffs the premises at the price of a house without a rentable suite when they were so anxious to represent the house as one which possessed such a rentable suite. It is true that the defendant Anthony Schaaf had accepted the premises at a valuation of $20,000 very shortly before but in that transaction he was merely taking the premises in trade and in part payment for a hotel building which he was anxious to sell. Evidence of William Johner who acted upon the purchase by the defendant Anthony Schaaf on the premises at 1306 Horace Street, Regina, and who agreed with counsel for the defence in cross-examination:\nQ. Is it fair to say that Mr. Schaaf was selling the hotel rather than buying the house? The principal deal was the sale of the hotel?\nA. Oh, I would say it was.\nAnd the defendant Anthony Schaaf in order to put through the sale of the hotel very quickly waived a term of his offer which required proof that the suite in the basement at 1306 Horace Street was properly rentable. The answer given by the defendant Exner was itself rather equivocal:\nIt was in line with other three bedroom homes in Rosemont district as far as selling price without suites, as just a straight three bedroom bungalow. Q. Is 1306 Horace Street a three bedroom bungalow?\nA. Yes.\nThis might well have meant that the third bedroom in 1306 Horace Street was this basement bedroom which, under the by-laws, could not legally be used as a bedroom, J I have read the evidence throughout and have found no positive statement that there were in 1306 Horace Street three bedrooms above the ground level. The learned trial judge listened to the evidence in court, observed the witnesses and assessed the probative value of their evidence. In my view, there was sound basis for his conclusion that the defendants had not succeeded in rebutting the presumption arising from the sale of the house for $17,700. When that presumption is not rebutted then the plaintiffs are justified in depending upon the admissions made by the defendant Exner in his examination for discovery, i.e., that the value of the house with a rentable suite therein, presumed to be $17,700 because of its purchase at that amount, would be reduced by $2,500 if it did not contain such a rentable basement suite.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, the judgment of the learned trial judge restored; the plaintiffs are entitled to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Gerrand & Gerrand, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Pedersen, Norman, McLeod & Pearce, Regina.\n1 [1922] 2 W.W.R. 212.\n2 [1903] 1 Ch.

The respondents\u2019 appeal from the Local Master to the Supreme Court of Ontario was dismissed; a further appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal. An appeal, by leave of this Court, was then brought by the appellant.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe Master of Title\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to the consideration and determination of what documents should be registered upon the title and therefore who should have the protection of the guaranteed title and the right to claim on the assurance fund. When he determined an application for first registration in favour of the applicant the effect of s. 52 of The Land Titles Act was to give to the first registered owner a fee simple, subject to rectification of the register by proceedings in the ordinary courts under s. 169. In discharging such duty the Master had to act judicially, but such judicial action was necessary to enable him to perform his primary administrative duty and in so acting judicially he did not deprive himself of jurisdiction.\nThe jurisdiction conferred upon the Master of Titles by The Land Titles Act to determine whether an application for first registration under the Act should be granted was not exercised by any officer whatsoever prior to Confederation as the scheme of registration of titles did not exist in Ontario before 1885 and any judicial determinations he made were merely necessarily incidental to the discharge of those duties which, therefore, were not analogous to those of a Superior, District, or County Court.\nAccordingly, the order of the Local Master of Titles was one which he had jurisdiction to make and such jurisdiction was not granted by the provincial legislation in violation of s. 96 of the British North America Act.\nThe Court of Appeal not having considered the grounds for appeal other than that of jurisdiction of the Local Master of Titles, the case was returned for disposal upon the other grounds of appeal.\nRe Mutual Investments Ltd.

Chalmers, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario1 allowing an appeal from Morand J. who had dismissed an appeal from the Local Master of Titles. The Local Master had held that the appellant should be registered as owner of certain lands in the Township of Reach, County and Province of Ontario, as described in the application for first registration. The Local Master of Titles had overruled the objection of the respondent to the description of the lands in the application for first registration which objection was based on a metes and bounds description in the conveyance to the appellant\u2019s predecessor in title. Such metes and bounds description would have limited the area of the lands subject to the application for first registration with the result that part of these lands would have come to the respondent from his predecessor in title. The Local Master of Titles acting, at any rate in part, on what he believed was the admission of the respondent that the boundary between the two parcels of land was the centre line of Beaver Meadow Creek, proceeded to inquire and found as a fact that such centre line of Beaver Meadow Creek was in the position described in the applicant\u2019s application for first registration. The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Ontario and Morand J. by order of October 17, 1961, dismissed the appeal. The respondent appealed from that order to the Court of Appeal and that Court by its judgment of January 23, 1962, allowed the appeal. The appellant now appeals to this Court.\nA perusal of the reasons for judgment of Schroeder J.A., who gave judgment for the Court of Appeal, shows that after reciting the facts the learned Justice of Appeal dealt only with the issue of the jurisdiction of the Local Master of Titles to consider whether the boundary between the lands of the appellant and the respondent should be settled by the line of Beaver Meadow Creek as in the agreement for sale between their predecessors in title in 1861 or at the different line set out in the metes and bounds description in the conveyance, which was expressed to be pursuant to the agreement of 1861. In his reasons, Schroeder J.A. said:\nIt is contended by counsel for the respondent that the Local Master of Titles did not assume the right to adjudicate upon the legal issues raised by the appellant. He maintains that his findings were based upon the appellant\u2019s alleged admission before him that the true boundary line between the properties in question was the centre of Beaver Meadow Creek. It is not easy to understand how such an admission could have been made on behalf of the appellant. It is wholly and utterly inconsistent with the objection based on the serious questions of law to which I have referred, and if the Master purported to deal with this application on a purely factual basis, completely ignoring the serious claims as to title advanced by the appellant, then on that ground alone his Order must be set aside.\nIn this Court, all counsel confined themselves to argument as to the Local Master\u2019s jurisdiction to make his order under these circumstances. Therefore, in these reasons I shall deal only with that topic.\nSchroeder J.A. said:\nCounsel for the appellant contended that the Master did in fact purport to exercise the right and power of determining judicially the question of title between the parties and that in so doing he was acting without jurisdiction; that this was a judicial power which could only be exercised by a Court in the nature of a Superior, County or District Court, and that a provincially appointed officer who purported to exercise such powers was acting in contravention of section 96 of The British North America Act, 1867. That precise point was considered by the Court in re the application of Etta K.E. Winter in an unreported judgment delivered on 8th March, 1961 and was decided favourably to the appellant\u2019s contention. In my opinion the Master did purport to exercise such powers, and in doing so he rejected the argument advanced by counsel for the appellant. If it were otherwise he would not have commented upon some of the appellant\u2019s submissions made upon the hearing of the application. It was settled in Display Service Limited v. Victoria Medical Building Limited, [1958] O.R. 759, affirmed sub nomine Attorney General for Ontario v. Victoria Medical Building Limited, [1960] S.C.R. 32, that a provincially appointed officer was not empowered to exercise powers of this nature. It is also beyond question that lack of jurisdiction to pronounce a judgment or order deprives it of any effect whatsoever, even as against the party who invoked the determination. Archbishop of Dublin v. Trimlistone, (1948) 12 I.R. Eq. R. 251 at page 268; Toronto Railway Company v. Toronto, [1904] A.C. 809 at page 815.\nIn the Display Services case, this Court was concerned with the constitutional validity of s. 31(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 227, which provided:\nThe action shall be tried in the county or district in which the land or part thereof is situate before a judge of the county or district court, provided that where the land is situate wholly in the County of York the action shall be tried before a Master of the Supreme Court or an Assistant Master.\nThe validity of the section was attacked on the ground that the grant of such jurisdiction to the Master was a violation of s. 96 of the British North America Act, which reads:\nThe Governor General shall appoint the Judges of the Superior, District, and County Courts in each Province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\nThe Court adopted the test of the validity of s. 31(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act put by the Judicial Committee in Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd.[2], per Lord Simonds:\nDoes the jurisdiction conferred by the Act on the appellant board broadly conform to the type of jurisdiction exercised by the superior, district, or county courts?\nUsing this test and examining the various provisions of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, the Court concluded, to quote Judson J. at pp. 42-43:\nAll these functions are exercised in an original way and constitute a new type of jurisdiction for the Master which in many aspects is not merely analogous to that exercised by a s. 96 judge but is, in fact, that very jurisdiction, limited only to one particular field of litigation.\nIt would seem that in determining the question of whether the jurisdiction given to \u201cthe proper master of titles\u201d by s. 21 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 197, is in violation of s. 96 of the British North America Act this Court must follow a similar investigation to determine whether the jurisdiction broadly conforms to the type exercised by Supreme, District, or County Courts.\nIt should be noted that the Notice of Constitutional Issue served pursuant to the direction of the late Chief Justice of this Court in the third paragraph gives notice that \u201cthe question will be raised by the respondent as to whether the powers given to the Master of Titles by the Land Titles Act of the Province of Ontario, being R.S.O. 1960, c. 204, are within the constitutional jurisdiction of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario\u201d but the original application for first registration was dated the 8th day of November 1960 and the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1960 only came into force on January 1, 1961 (Proclamation of Governor in Council R.S.O. 1960, vol. 5, p. 311). However, for the purpose of this examination the sections, although differently numbered, are in substantially similar terms.\nSection 21 of The Land Titles Act (now s. 44) provides:\n44. The examination of a title shall be conducted in the prescribed manner, subject to the following:\n1. Where notice has been given, sufficient opportunity shall be afforded to any person desirous of objecting to come in and state his objections to the proper master of titles.\n2. The proper master of titles has jurisdiction to hear and determine any such objections, subject to an appeal to the court in the prescribed manner and on the prescribed conditions.\n3. If the proper master of titles, upon the examination of any title, is of opinion that it is open to objection but is nevertheless a title the holding under which will not be disturbed, he may approve of it or may require the applicant to apply to the court, upon a statement signed by the proper master of titles, for its sanction to the registration.\n4. It is not necessary to produce any evidence that by The Vendors and Purchasers Act is dispensed with as between vendor and purchaser or to produce or account for the originals of registered instruments unless the proper master of titles otherwise directs.\n5. The proper master of titles may receive and act upon any evidence that is received in court on a question of title, or any evidence that the practice of conveyancers authorizes to be received on an investigation of a title out of court, or any other evidence, whether it is or is not receivable or sufficient in point of strict law, or according to the practice of conveyancers, if it satisfies him of the truth of the facts intended to be made out thereby.\n6. The proper master of titles may refer to and act upon not only the evidence adduced before him in the proceeding in which it is adduced but also any evidence adduced before him in any other proceeding wherein the facts to which it relates were or are in question. 7. The proper master of titles may also act upon his own personal knowledge of material facts affecting the title upon making and filing a report, stating his knowledge of the particular facts and the means he had of obtaining such knowlege.\nIt is, of course, necessary to consider not s. 21 in isolation but to have regard for the act as a whole and to consider its various sections, Dupont v. Inglis[3], per Rand J. at p. 539. The Land Titles Act of the Province of Ontario was first enacted in 1885 designed to facilitate and make more economical the registration of ownership and interest in lands within the province. The statute provides for the appointment of officers variously designated as Director of Titles, Master of Titles, Deputy Master of Titles, and Local Master of Titles, and puts upon such officers the duties of examining and approving for registration documents submitted by applicants. Perhaps the most essential feature of the legislation is the grant to the registered owner, whether it be upon first application to be registered as such under The Land Titles Act or by transfer, a title in fee simple free from all estates and interests whatsoever except those listed in the relevant sections (s. 9 in R.S.O. 1950, c. 197, now s. 52, and s. 41 in R.S.O. 1950, c. 197, now s. 86). The rights of those who may be damaged by the acceptance of the document for registration are protected by the following provisions, inter alia:\ns. 21 (now s. 44) provides for opportunity to any person desirous of objecting to the first registration to come in and state his objection to the proper master of titles;\ns. 144 (now. s. 29) provides any person affected by an order or decision of the director, master or local master, may appeal to a judge of the High Court and from them to the Court of Appeal;\ns. 127 (now s. 60) provides for the establishment of an assurance fund;\ns. 128 (now s. 63) provides for a right in damages against the applicant who has obtained the damaging registration and payment of such damages from the fund if he is unable to recover damages from the applicant.\nIt is true s. 131 (now s. 65) excludes from recovery from the fund those who have failed to pursue their rights under ss. 21 and 144 (now ss. 44 and 29) but the right of persons who believe themselves damnified to proceed in the ordinary courts of the province and obtain rectification of the register is preserved fully by s. 119 (now s. 169) which reads:\n169. Subject to any estates or rights acquired by registration under this Act, if a person is aggrieved by an entry made, or by the omission of an entry from the register, or if default is made or unnecessary delay takes place in making an entry in the register, the person aggrieved by the entry, omission, default or delay may apply to the court for an order that the register may be rectified, and the court may either refuse the application with or without costs to be paid by the applicant or may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.\nThe initial words of this section were interpreted in Re Lord and Ellis[4], where at p. 585, Meredith C.J.O. said:\nThese sections are expressly made subject to rights acquired by registration under the Act; that I hold to mean such rights as a purchaser for valuable consideration from the registered owner would acquire. No reason has been suggested, nor can I find any, why justice may not be done between the original parties to the injustice.\nA party damnified by a registration may protect himself against innocent purchasers for consideration by filing a caution under the provisions of s. 74 (now s. 135). It would appear from the consideration of those sections recited aforesaid and from a perusal of The Land Titles Act as a whole that a person claiming an interest in lands can proceed in the ordinary courts without regard for the decisions of the \u201cproper master of titles\u201d and may even protect himself from the intervention of innocent purchasers for value from the registered owner by filing a caution, although to preserve his rights to claim under the Assurance Fund he must proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nThe Master of Title\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to the consideration and determination of what documents should be registered upon the title and therefore who should have the protection of the guaranted title and the right to claim on the Assurance Fund. When the master of titles determines an application for first registration in favour of the applicant the effects of s. 9 (now s. 52) is to give to the first registered owner a fee simple but, despite the very positive words of that section, the register may be rectified by a procedure in the ordinary courts under s. 119 (now s. 169). The objections which the Master \u201chas jurisdiction to hear and determine\u201d (s. 21, para. (2) now s. 44) are objections to the Master\u2019s acceptance of a document for registration. It is, of course, true that in discharging such duty the Master of Titles must act judicially, but such judicial action is necessary to enable him to perform his primary administrative duty and in so acting judicially the Master of Titles does not deprive himself of jurisdiction. Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd., supra, per Lord Simonds, at p. 145; Re Ontario Teachers Federation & Duncan[5], per Aylesworth J.A. at p. 696. I adopt the words of Riddell J. (as he then was) in Re Mutual Investments Ltd.[6]:\nBut it is said that the Master of Titles is a mere administrative officer, that he must register even a document which is a plain violation of the law and leave the person or company registering to take the consequences. I decline to accede to that argument; in view of the very great effect of registering such documents, I think that he may and, where necessary, should pass upon the legality of any document submitted to him.\n(The underlining is mine.)\nI am of the view that the jurisdiction conferred upon the Master of Titles by the provisions of The Land Titles Act of Ontario is, therefore, quite unlike the jurisdiction conferred on the Master of the Supreme Court by The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act of Ontario considered in the Display Service case, supra. There, as I have pointed out, the Court found that jurisdiction was not merely analogous to the jurisdiction of that exercised by s. 96 but in fact that very jurisdiction. Under The Land Titles Act, the Master of Titles has a jurisdiction to determine whether an application for first registration under the Act should be granted and that jurisdiction was not exercised by any officer whatsoever prior to Confederation as the scheme of registration of titles did not exist in Ontario before 1885 and any judicial determinations he makes are merely necessarily incidental to the discharge of those duties which, therefore, are not analogous to those of a Superior, District, or County Court.\nIt would appear this situation bears more resemblance to that considered by this Court in Dupont v. Inglis[7], where the Court was concerned with whether the provisions of The Mining Act in Ontario gave to the Commissioner a jurisdiction which was in violation of s. 96. Rand J., in delivering the judgment of this Court, upheld the validity of the statute in question upon three grounds: firstly, that the jurisdiction was granted to a Crown officer to determine which of two or more competing parties should acquire rights over Crown owned lands; secondly, that a like jurisdiction existed prior to Confederation under The Gold Mining Act and was exercised by a provincially appointed officer so that the continuation of such jurisdiction was protected by s. 129 of the British North America Act; but thirdly, at pp. 544-5, Rand J. states:\nIt was urged that the issue was in reality between the respondents and the individual appellants, but that confuses the matter. The question is the validity of the alleged first staking, and that is a matter between the licensee and the Crown. Its adjudication may affect a subsequent staking by another licensee; but there is no vinculum juris and no lis between the two licensees, and the disputant is before the tribunal only as he is permitted by the statue to have the claim of another put in question before the recorder.\nSimilarly, under The Land Titles Act, the objection is before the Master of Titles only as he is permitted by that statute to have the claim of the applicant for first registration put in question before the said Master.\nCounsel for the respondent cited Heller v. Registrar, Vancouver Land Registration District et al.[8] That case concerned an attempt by a former registered owner of land in the Vancouver Land Registration District to require the Registrar of that district, pursuant to the powers conferred upon him by s. 256 of the Land Registry Act of British Columbia, to cancel a certificate of title for that land which had been issued to the wife of the former owner. Among other things, it was alleged that the wife had wrongfully obtained possession of the transfer, the registration of which had given rise to her title. At p. 235, Martland J. said:\nIn my opinion, it is no part of the function of a Registrar, under this section, to adjudicate upon contested rights of parties, for the determination of which it would be necessary for him to hear, receive and weigh evidence. He can only act upon the material which is before him in his own records.\nI realize that the provisions of para. (c) of s. 256 may appear to be inconsistent with this conclusion. That paragraph relates to a situation where \u201cany registration, instrument, entry, memorandum, or endorsement was fraudulently or wrongfully obtained\u201d. If, however, these words were to be construed in their widest sense, so as to enable a Registrar to act, under the section, upon evidence submitted to him upon which he could make a finding of fraud, I would have grave doubts as to whether this provision could be held to be intra vires of the Legislature of British Columbia. So construed, the Registrar would be clothed with an original jurisdiction to determine questions of title to land in relation to which fraud had been alleged (Attorney-General for Ontario and Display Service Co. Ltd. v. Victoria Medical Building Ltd. et al., [1960] S.C.R. 32, 21 D.L.R. (2d) 97).\nIn the circumstances of that case the Registrar was being asked to exercise the powers for correction of the registry which it was alleged had been conferred upon him by the statute, in order to hear and determine legal issues which had arisen between two parties concerning the title to registered land, which involved allegations of fraud. The decision in that case was that s. 256 of the Act gave him no such powers. It should be observed that no attempt is made in The Land Titles Act of Ontario to clothe the Master of Titles with similar jurisdiction. Part IX thereof deals with fraud and s. 125 (now s. 164) provides that, subject to the provisions of the Act with respect to registered dispositions for valuable considerations, any fraudulent disposition of land is void notwithstanding registration.\nIn the reasons in the Court of Appeal, Schroeder J.A. refers to the then unreported decision of that Court in Re Winter. That judgment now appears at [1962] O.R. 402. That was an appeal from the judgment of Thompson J. who had affirmed the order of the Master of Titles under s. 123 of The Land Titles Act (now s. 167), purporting to rectify the register. Schroeder J.A. held that the Master had no jurisdiction to make the order as by the provisions of the Act itself s. 119 (now s. 169) such power was expressly conferred upon the Court. At p. 405, Schroeder J.A. continues:\nOf even graver import is the fact that the Master of Titles, a provincially appointed officer, purported to exercise a judicial power which could only be exercised by a Court in the nature of a Superior, County or District Court in contravention of s. 96 of the British North America Act, 1867: Display Service Co. v. Victoria Medical Bldg. Ltd., 16 D.L.R. (2d) 1, [1958] O.R. 759, affirmed sub nom. A.-G. Ont. & Display Service Co. v. Victoria Medical Bldg., Ltd., 21 D.L.R. (2d) 97, [1960] S.C.R. 32.\nFor the reasons which I have set out above, I am not willing to accept this view. There is, however, a judgment of this Court in 1962 which is relevant. In Farrell v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board[9], Judson J., delivering the judgment of the Court, considered the opinion of the judge who heard the application in the British Columbia Court, inter alia, that the provisions of s. 76(1) of the British Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act were ultra vires as in violation of s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act, and said:\nThe Court of Appeal ruled against both these grounds and on appeal to this Court, counsel for the applicant abandoned any attack on the Board on the ground of infringement of s. 96 of the British North America Act. It is very questionable whether there could be any profitable argument on this point after the judgments in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R., [1920] A.C. 184, 88 L.J.P.C. 169, Kowanko v. J.H. Tremblay Co., [1920] 1 W.W.R. 787, 51 D.L.R. 174, 30 Man. R. 198, Attorney\u2011General of Quebec v. Slanec and Grimstead, (1933) 54 Que. K.B. 230, 2 D.L.R. 289, Reference re The Adoption Act, [1938] S.C.R. 398, 71 C.C.C. 110, 3 D.L.R. 497, and Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd., [1949] A.C. 134, [1949] L.J.R. 66.\nIn the result, therefore, I have concluded that the order of the Local Master of Titles confirmed by the Director was one which he had jurisdiction to make and such jurisdiction was not granted in violation of s. 96 of the British North America Act.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario not having considered the grounds for appeal other than that dealing with the jurisdiction of the Local Master of Titles, the case should be returned to the Court of Appeal for disposal upon the other grounds of appeal as set out in the notice of appeal to that Court, and also for the disposition of costs other than costs of appeal to this Court. I am of the opinion that in view of all the circumstances of this case, there should be no costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed; no costs in this Court.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Greer & Kelly, Oshawa.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Blake, Cassells & Graydon, Toronto.\n[1] [1962] O.R. 449, 32 D.L.R.

In February 1957, the lessee was advised by the City that its application for a permit, required to operate a theatre, was refused on the ground that the premises did not have the washroom and toilet facilities required under the City's by-laws. The lessee took action for cancellation of the lease and damages, and the landlord sued for arrears of rent. The lessee's action was dismissed at trial, and the landlord's maintained. Both judgments were reversed on appeal. The landlord appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nThe premises were suitable for use only as a theatre and were leased as such. It was established that they were not equipped with the facilities required under the by-laws. The obligation to provide these facilities, without which no permit could be issued, was one imposed upon the landlord and not upon the lessee. The landlord had failed to perform that obligation, and the lessee was therefore entitled to rescission under art. 1641(2) of the Civil Code.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing judgments of Deslauriers J. Appeals dismissed.\nR. Turgeon, Q.C., and Harry H. Kliger, Q.C., for the appellants.\nF. Aquin, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014These two appeals are from judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench2 unanimously reversing two judgments of the Superior Court, the one dismissing an action taken by respondents asking for cancellation of a lease and damages, the other maintaining an action by appellants claiming arrears of rent and reimbursement of certain expenses. The two actions were tried together, the same facts being involved. At the hearing before us, leave to appeal to this Court was granted in the action in which appellants were the plaintiffs, the amount in issue in that action being less than $10,000.\nThe facts are fully recited in the reasons of Hyde J. who delivered the unanimous opinion in the Court below. For the purpose of this appeal they can be shortly stated.\nIn October 1956, the corporate respondent leased from appellants, for a period of ten years, a moving picture theatre in the City of Montreal which had previously been operated for some forty years by one of the appellants. Among other conditions the lease provided that the tenant was to take the premises in their actual state and condition and was to make all tenant's repairs during the term of the lease. The individual respondents intervened in the lease to guarantee payment of the rent and the fulfilment of the other obligations of the tenant thereunder.\nAfter operating the theatre for some two months the corporate respondent closed it in January 1957, after having complained that the heating system was defective and that the building was infested with rats.\nA permit from the City of Montreal is required for the operation of a moving picture theatre in that city, and appellants had held such a permit for a number of years. Any transfer of such permit requires the approval of the city authorities. On February 18, 1957, the corporate respondent was advised in writing by the city that its application for a permit was refused. The ground for such refusal appears to have been that the theatre did not have the washroom and toilet facilities required under the city by-laws for such an establishment.\nOn March 27, 1957, the respondents took action against appellants asking for cancellation of lease, reimbursement of expenses incurred and damages. In the meantime, on February 26, 1957, appellants had sued the respondents claiming unpaid rent and other items. Subsequently on September 6, 1957, they filed an incidental demand claiming additional rent and other payments, their total claims amounting to $3,116.77. As I have said, the learned trial judge dismissed respondents' action to cancel the lease and maintained appellants' action and incidental demand to the extent of $3,106.77, both judgments being reversed on appeal.\nThe judgments in the Court below were based upon the sole ground that since the theatre did not have the sanitary facilities required by law, the appellants had failed to perform one of their principal obligations as lessors, namely, to deliver the thing leased in a fit condition for which it had been leased (art. 1612 of the Civil Code), and that respondents were therefore entitled to rescission under para. 2 of art. 1641 of the Civil Code.\nThe premises were suitable for use only as a theatre and were leased as such to the corporate respondent. Although appellants denied this in their plea, it was established that the premises were not equipped with the washroom and toilet facilities required under the city by-laws. Without a permit the premises could not be used legally as a theatre and the obligation to provide the required washroom and toilet facilities was one imposed upon the owners and not upon the tenant. In my opinion the respondents were entitled to ask for cancellation of the lease by reason of the failure of appellants to perform that obligation.\nFor the foregoing reasons as we'll as for those expressed by Hyde J. in the Court below with which I am in agreement, I would dismiss both appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the appellants: Harry H. Kliger, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the respondents: Long & Aquin, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que. Q.B. 806.\n2 [1961] Que. Q.B. 806.\n"

It was following and trying to overtake a truck which was owned by A. Ursel and was being driven by H. Dormuth in a very erratic manner. The occupants of the Meikle car knew Dormuth and had good reason to suspect that he was not in fit condition to drive. Their purpose in trying to overtake him was to persuade him to discontinue driving. They did not succeed.\nThe Dormuth truck interfered in some way with an oncoming car owned and driven by M. Muskovitch. The latter was forced on to the shoulder of the road and then came across the road to the wrong side and struck the Meikle car head on. Mr. Untereiner was killed and Mrs. Untereiner, Meikle and another passenger, Chamberlain, were injured. Muskovitch was also injured.\nMeikle, Chamberlain and Mrs. Untereiner sued to recover damages for their injuries. Mrs. Untereiner also sued under The Fatal Accidents Act for herself and five young children. The defendants in each action were Dormuth, Ursel and Muskovitch. Muskovitch also sued Dormuth and Ursel and in this action Meikle was brought in as defendant by counterclaim. The actions were all tried together and the result was that the trial judge found that both Dormuth and Muskovitch were at fault. He apportioned the fault two-thirds to Muskovitch and one-third to Dormuth. He found that Meikle was free of blame.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed this apportionment and made Dormuth two-thirds responsible and Muskovitch one-third responsible. They also exonerated Meikle. In this Court Dormuth and Ursel appealed against liability on. the ground that their truck was not the one involved in the accident. Muskovitch cross-appealed to ask that he be freed from blame on the ground that he acted reasonably in an emergency created by the bad driving of Dormuth.\nIn the action under The Fatal Accidents Act the trial judge made an award of $37,500. The Court of Appeal, as a result of a cross-appeal by Mrs. Untereiner, increased this award to $60,000. On the question of damages, the appellants applied to this Court to adduce new evidence on the hearing of the appeal pursuant to s. 67 of the Supreme Court Act. The evidence sought to be introduced was a marriage certificate disclosing that subsequent to the trial but prior to the hearing before the Court of Appeal Mrs. Untereiner had remarried.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting in part): The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The appellants failed in their contention that the Courts below were wrong in finding that the truck driven by Dormuth was the vehicle seen by Meikle and his passengers just before the accident, and the degree of fault, as apportioned by the Court of Appeal, was correct.\nThe special grounds required in an application made under the proviso to s. 67 of the Supreme Court Act include being able to show that the evidence could not have been discovered by reasonable diligence before the conclusion of the hearing in the Court of Appeal and being able also to satisfy this Court that the evidence, if accepted, would be practically conclusive. Here there was nothing to suggest that the evidence of remarriage could not have been discovered before the appeal by the exercise of reasonable diligence. Nor was the evidence of Mrs. Untereiner's remarriage standing alone \"practically conclusive\" of any issue in the case. The application should therefore be dismissed, and, as there were no circumstances shown that would justify an interference with the award of damages made by the Court of Appeal, that award would not be disturbed.\nVarette v. Sainsbury, [1928] S.C.R. 72; Gootson v. R., [1948] 4 D.L.R. 33; K.V.P. Co. Ltd. v. McKie, [1949] S.C.R. 698; Brown v. Dean, [1910] A.C. 373; Henes v. Kennedy, [1941] S.C.R. 384; Lehnert v.

Pollard and Murphy, [1957] S.C.R. 858, applied.\nPer Judson J., dissenting in part: There was no ground for interfering with the concurrent findings of the Courts below that the Dormuth truck was the one involved, and that both Dormuth and Muskovitch were at fault. Also, the Court of Appeal was correct in attributing the greater part of the blame to Dormuth.\nThe Court of Appeal was in error in increasing the award in the action under The Fatal Accidents Act. There was no error in principle on the part of the trial judge nor was the award so inordinately low as to call for interference, as being a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages, and on this ground alone the assessment of the trial judge should be restored. Accordingly, it was unnecessary to consider the application to introduce evidence to show that Mrs. Untereiner had remarried subsequent to the trial but prior to the hearing before the Court of Appeal.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, allowing the appeals of the respondents Muskovitch and Untereiner and dismissing the appeal of the appellants Dormuth and Ursel from a judgment of Thomson J. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting in part. A. W. Embury, Q.C., and B. J. Thomson, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., and J. Stein, for the plaintiff, respondent, Ruth V. Untereiner.\nR. M. Barr, Q.C., and M. Newman, for the defendant, respondent, Martin Muskovitch.\nF. A. Alexander, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent, Grant W. Chamberlain.\nE. D. Bayda, for the plaintiff, respondent, Larry Meikle.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan which allowed the appeals of the respondents Martin Muskovitch and Ruth Untereiner and dismissed the appeal of the appellants Dormuth and Ursel from a judgment of Thomson J. sitting without a jury on the joint trial of four actions arising out of the same automobile accident.\nThe accident in question occurred on Sunday afternoon (on July 15, 1958) when Larry Meikle was driving his 1947 Chevrolet in a southerly direction on Highway No. 11 in the Province of Saskatchewan, on his way back to Regina from an abortive fishing expedition at Long Lake, in company with Mr. and Mrs. Untereiner who were in the back seat of the car, and Grant Chamberlain who shared the front seat with Meikle. Both Courts below are agreed that there was no negligence on the part of Meikle which caused or contributed to the accident, which happened when a 1956 Ford sedan, owned and operated by Muskovitch and travelling in a northerly direction on the same highway, to use the language of the learned trial judge:\n\u2026 plunged across the roadway directly into the path of the oncoming car driven by Meikle, with which it collided practically head on. Meikle was well on his own side of the road and the suddenness and speed with which the Muskovitch car came across the road gave him no chance to take evasive action of any kind. All of the occupants of the cars involved in the collision were injured and Ignace Untereiner died shortly after reaching the hospital from injuries which he sustained in said accident. Muskovitch's explanation of the erratic behaviour of his vehicle is that immediately before the accident he had been travelling on his own side of the road when a truck, which is alleged to have been owned by the appellant Ursel and driven by the appellant Dormuth and which he had observed for some 200 yards approaching him in a \"snake way\", suddenly pulled at least partially onto its left-hand side of the highway whereupon he (Muskovitch) pulled hard over to the right and applied his brakes with the result that his right wheels dropped onto the soft shoulder of the highway, and that, when he pulled to the left to get back on to the hard top, his car plunged across into Meikle's path. The truck did not stop.\nUnder these circumstances, Mrs. Untereiner brought two actions against Muskovitch, Dormuth and Ursel. In one she claimed damages for her own personal injuries and in the other she claimed under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 102, on behalf of herself and her five children in her capacity as executrix of the estate of her late husband. Grant Chamberlain and Larry Meikle also brought separate actions against Muskovitch, Dormuth and Ursel, and in the Meikle action Muskovitch counter-claimed against Meikle, Dormuth and Ursel.\nAfter a most extensive review of the evidence, the learned trial judge gave judgment for Mrs. Untereiner in both her actions and for Chamberlain and Meikle against the defendants, Muskovitch, Dormuth and Ursel, but he divided the fault between the last named defendants, finding Muskovitch liable to the extent of 70 per cent and Dormuth and Ursel to the extent of the remaining 30 per cent. The counter-claim of Muskovitch against Dormuth and Ursel was allowed to the extent of 30 per cent thereof. The general damages in Mrs. Untereiner's action under The Fatal Accidents Act were fixed at $37,500.\nFrom this finding the defendant Muskovitch appealed on the ground that the evidence did not justify a finding of any negligence against him, or in the alternative, that if he was negligent he was negligent in a lesser degree than Dormuth. He also claimed that the respondent Meikle was negligent.\nBefore the Court of Appeal, Mrs. Untereiner in her representative action sought to vary the quantum of damages alleging that it should be raised to at least $60,000 and Dormuth and Ursel sought to have the action against them dismissed on the ground that Dormuth driving Ursel's truck was some miles away from the scene of the accident when it happened.\nThe effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is that it reduces the degree of fault attributable to Muskovitch to 30 per cent and correspondingly increases that attributable to Dormuth and Ursel to 70 per cent, and allows the appeal of Mrs. Untereiner in her representative capacity by increasing damages awarded in respect of her husband's death to $60,000. From this judgment Dormuth and Ursel appealed to this Court contending that both the Courts below erred in not finding that the Ursel vehicle driven by Dormuth was some miles away from the scene of the accident when it happened, or in the alternative, that the trial judge's apportionment of percentages of fault and his award to Mrs. Untereiner in her representative action should be restored.\nThe respondent Muskovitch moved to vary the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the ground that he was entirely blameless and should not have been found 30 per cent at fault and that the action against him should therefore have been dismissed and his counterclaim against Dormuth and Ursel should have been allowed in full. If he should be found partially at fault, Muskovitch further takes the position that the award of damages fixed by the learned trial judge should not have been disturbed.\nThe occupants of the Meikle vehicle were familiar with Ursel's red. Ford half ton pick-up truck which the male members of the party had been trying to push out of the sand at the fishing grounds at Long Lake earlier on the afternoon of the accident, and they were all well satisfied that this was the truck which they had watched ahead of them on Route 11 for some miles as it weaved from right to left and finally as it caused Muskovitch to take the avoiding action which resulted in the accident.\nDormuth did not give evidence at the trial, but on examination for discovery, he had admitted that he had driven the Ursel truck over Highway No. 11 on his way back from Long Lake to Regina on the afternoon of the accident and that he had had difficulty in steering because the truck pulled to the right and had to be pulled sharply back to the left.\nThe Dormuth-Ursel defence is based in large measure on evidence to the effect that Dormuth and his companion Matity had left the fishing area at Long Lake 30 or 40 minutes ahead of the Meikle party and it is argued that having regard to the distance involved and the respective speeds at which Dormuth and Meikle were said to be travelling, it could not possibly have been the Ursel truck which was seen by Meikle and his passengers immediately before the accident.\nAlthough no member of the Meikle party actually saw Dormuth driving the truck ahead of them, there is no reason to disbelieve their description of the colour, make and size of the vehicle which they did see and it follows that the defence based on the time element, which was so fully argued on behalf of Dormuth and Ursel, involves also an acceptance of the extraordinary coincidence that there were two red half ton Ford pick-up trucks, each with two occupants, each with a low box and each weaving from right to left, travelling in the same direction over the same highway on the same afternoon within 30 or 40 minutes of each other.\nIt is true that there are discrepancies as to times and speeds which remain unexplained, but it appears to me that the probabilities weigh heavily against the happening of such a coincidence, and I am far from convinced that the two Courts below were wrong in finding that the Ursel truck driven by Dormuth was the vehicle seen by Meikle and his passengers just before the accident.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that Muskovitch, who had noticed the erratic behaviour of the approaching truck at a distance of 200 yards, should have taken greater precautions to prepare for the potential danger. Although Brownridge J.A., in the decision which he rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, found that Muskovitch reduced his speed to between 30 and 35 miles per hour when he first sighted the truck, he nevertheless held that, under the circumstances, it was negligent not to have reduced it further at that time, and I am not prepared to interfere with the concurrent findings in this regard. The learned trial judge however took the view, that to take the action which Muskovitch did in trying to get back on the asphalt before slowing his speed materially\u2014\n\u2026 was to court trouble and highly negligent, especially as he did not look to see whether there was any other vehicle in the way. It was his duty to look and make sure that what he was about to do could be done in safety before taking the dangerous course he adopted. There was no need whatever to get back to the black top in a hurry. He was confronted with no new danger or obstruction requiring him to leave the shoulder and if he had continued as he was until he had his car under control he would have had no trouble and there would have been no accident. (The italics are mine.)\nIn my view a critical analysis of the second to second reactions of a driver in the course of avoiding an immediate peril created by the negligence of another user of the highway is at best a very doubtful yardstick by which to measure degrees of fault.\nI agree with Brownridge J.A. that \"the immediate peril\" in the present case was occasioned not when the truck was first sighted but when it suddenly turned across the centre line of the highway. It was then only 30 yards away from the Muskovitch car and the combined speed of the vehicles must have been at least 70 miles per hour. Under these circumstances, it appears to me, with the greatest respect for the views expressed by the learned trial judge, that it is unrealistic to assess the actions of Muskovitch in terms of his having deliberately \"adopted\" a dangerous course. In my view his method of driving before and after he succeeded in avoiding the truck was conditioned by the imminent danger in which he had been placed through Dormuth's negligence and I agree that the fault should be apportioned in the manner directed by the Court of Appeal.\nOn the question of damages, the appellants applied to this Court to adduce new evidence on the hearing of the appeal pursuant to s. 67 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259.\nThe evidence sought to be introduced is a marriage certificate issued by the Division of Vital Statistics of the Department of Health of Saskatchewan on March 8, 1962, which discloses that Ruth Violet Untereiner was married to one James Edward Cherry on October 15, 1960. This certificate is produced as an exhibit to an affidavit of one Brown who describes himself as a \"Branch Superintendent\" and deposes that he is \"acquainted with\" the respondent Ruth Violet Untereiner and that she has informed him that she is remarried to \"Mr. Cherry\" and that he verily believes her to be the person named in the certificate.\nSection 67 of the Supreme Court Act reads as follows:\nThe appeal shall be upon a case to be stated by the parties, or, in the event of difference, to be settled by the court appealed from, or a judge thereof, and the case shall set forth the judgment objected to and so much of the pleadings, evidence, affidavits and documents as is necessary to raise the question for the decision of the Court; but the Court may, in its discretion, on special grounds, and by special leave, receive further evidence upon any question of fact, such evidence to be taken in the manner authorized by this Act, either by oral examination in Court, by affidavit, or by deposition, as the Court may direct:\nThe words in italics were first introduced in 1928, (S.C. 1928, c. 9, s. 3) prior to which time the rule of this Court was firmly established that once the case had been settled it could not be amended \"by adding what would be equivalent to new evidence\". See Confederation Life Association of Canada v. O'Donnell1; The Exchange Bank of Canada v. Gilman2; Red Mountain Railway Co. v. Blue3, and other cases cited in the note prepared by Mr. E. R. Cameron to be found in 10 Cameron's Supreme Court Cases at p. 18.\nThe case of Varette v. Sainsbury4, although decided shortly before the proviso was added to s. 67, indicates the general view of this Court respecting the effect to be given to the discovery of new evidence. That was an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal of Ontario granting a new trial on account of new evidence and Rinfret J. who delivered the reasons for judgment allowing the appeal on behalf of the Court, had occasion to say at p. 76:\nOn an application for a new trial on the ground that new evidence has been discovered since the trial, we take the rule to be well established that a new trial should be ordered only where the new evidence proposed to be adduced could not have been obtained by reasonable diligence before the trial and the new evidence is such that, if adduced, it would be practically conclusive.\nThe same test was adopted in Gootson v. The King5, which was an appeal to this Court from a judgment of O'Connor J. in the Exchequer Court. That was a case in which a servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his employment had fainted while in control of his automobile with the result that it ran on to the sidewalk hitting and injuring the suppliant. There was some evidence as to the driver having previously suffered from an epileptiform seizure but the trial judge found that there was no proof of negligence and dismissed the claim. On appeal to this Court it was contended that the burden lay upon the respondent to show affirmatively that its servant had not been subject to epileptic fits and it was also contended that he had in fact been so subject and that the accident ocurred as the result of such a fit.\nOn a motion being made for leave to adduce further evidence under the provisions of s. 68 (now s. 67), Kerwin J. (as he then was) said at pp. 34-35:\nIt was never intended by this enactment that the Court should admit further evidence under circumstances such as are here present and counsel for the suppliant, apparently realizing this, sought to expand his motion to include an order for a new trial under Section 47 of the Supreme Court Act \u2026 Presuming that the latter part of that section permits the Court to order a new trial on the ground of discovery of new evidence, it must be shown that it could not have been discovered by the appellant by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the trial and that the new evidence is such that, if adduced, it would be practically conclusive.\nSee also: K.V.P. Co. Ltd. v. McKie et al.6, per Kerwin J. at pp. 700-701.\nThe above statements were made with respect to the role of a court of first appeal in relation to evidence discovered after the trial but, in my view the same considerations apply when evidence is tendered for the first time before this Court on appeal from a provincial Court of Appeal. The special grounds required in an application made under the proviso to s. 67 include, in my opinion, being able to show that the evidence could not have been discovered by reasonable diligence before the conclusion of the hearing in the Court of Appeal and being able also to satisfy this Court that the evidence, if accepted, would be practically conclusive.\nThe special grounds upon which the present application is made are stated to be that (1) subsequent to the trial but prior to the hearing before the Court of Appeal, the respondent Ruth V. Untereiner was remarried; (2) evi- dence of this remarriage was not before the Court of Appeal, and (3) the Court of Appeal increased the general damages, and the evidence of the second marriage is material for the purpose of considering the quantum of damages.\nIt is to be noted that the affidavit filed in support of this application makes no reference to reasonable diligence having been exercised to discover the new evidence before the hearing was concluded in the Court of Appeal on March 7, 1962. In this regard as was pointed out by my brother Hall in the course of the hearing of this appeal, it is significant that the marriage certificate now sought to be introduced was issued on March 8, 1962, and that the relationship between Dormuth and Mrs. Untereiner is described by the learned trial judge in the following terms:\nThe Untereiners were well acquainted with Dormuth and were on close and intimate terms with his son Tony Dormuth who was married to one of Mrs. Untereiner's sisters.\nThere is nothing before us to suggest that the evidence of remarriage could not have been discovered before the appeal by the exercise of reasonable diligence and indeed the circumstances which have been disclosed make it seem probable that Dormuth, who is one of the applicants, knew of the remarriage of his son's sister-in-law with whom he was well acquainted, some time between the date when it took place (October 15, 1960) and March 7, 1962, when the hearing was concluded in the Court of Appeal.\nNor do I think that the evidence of Mrs. Untereiner's remarriage standing alone is \"practically conclusive\" of any issue in the present case. It is relevant only to the question of damages and there are many other factors, such as the earning power, stability and health of the husband and his attitude towards the five step-children which would have a distinct bearing on the question of damages and which are in no way disclosed by proof of the marriage alone.\nIn this regard it is to be noted that in the leading case of Brown v. Dean7, Lord Loreburn L.C. observed, at p. 374 that \"When a litigant has obtained a judgment in a court of justice \u2026 he is by law entitled not to be deprived of that judgment without very solid grounds; and where \u2026 the ground is the alleged discovery of new evidence, it must at least be such as is presumably to be believed, and if believed would be conclusive\".\nIt is true that in that case Lord Shaw did not agree with the last words of that sentence and that modern English cases, many of which are reviewed in Braddock v. Tollotson's Newspapers Ltd.8, have proceeded on the view that \"conclusive\" is too strong a word to use in this context. (See also Ladd v. Marshall9, per Lord Denning at p. 1491.) But the phrase \"practically conclusive\" has been employed more than once in this Court and I see no reason for departing from it.\nOur attention has been directed also to the case of Curwen v. James and others10, where a widow who had been awarded damages in respect of the death of her husband, remarried on the same day as the notice of appeal was filed and the Court of Appeal, acting on the evidence of the remarriage which was introduced before it, proceeded to cut the damage award made by the trial judge in half. The evidence in that case was admitted under the provisions of Order 58, Rule 9 (2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court in England which differ materially from s. 67 of our own Supreme Court Act. No question arose as to whether or not reasonable diligence had been exercised to discover the evidence before the conclusion of proceedings in the lower Court and the decision is based in large degree on the assumption that, to use the language of Sellers L.J. \"the fact of the marriage would lead to the conclusion that there is some benefit to be gained financially by the plaintiff and that she would have some of the hardship of the loss of her husband's earnings ameliorated by the benefit she gets from the marriage\". I do not think that any such assumption necessarily arises in the present case.\nI am accordingly of opinion that the application of Dormutil and Ursel based on the discovery of new evidence should be dismissed and as I am not satisfied that any circumstances have been shown that would justify an interference with the award of damages made by the Court of Appeal, I would not disturb that award.\nThe case of Lang et al. v. Pollard and Murphy11, was one in which the award of damages had been increased by the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick, and Cartwright J., speaking for himself and Taschereau J., as he then was, had occasion to say, at p. 862:\nUnder these circumstances where no error of principle and no misapprehension of any feature of the evidence is indicated I think that the rule which we should follow is that stated by Anglin J., as he then was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court, in Pratt v. Beaman, [1930] S.C.R. 284 at 287:\nThe second ground of appeal is that the damages allowed for pain and suffering by the trial judge, $1,500, should not have been reduced, as they were on appeal, to $500. While, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King's Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\nThis decision was followed in the unanimous judgment of this Court, delivered by Kerwin J., as he then was, in Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al., [1941] S.C.R. 384.\nThe principle appears to me to be equally applicable whether the first appellate Court has increased or decreased the general damages awarded at the trial.\nIn the same case, Kerwin C.J., speaking for himself and Fauteux J., after referring to Pratt v. Beaman and two other cases in which the provincial Court of Appeal had reduced damages, went on to say:\nWhile in these last three cases a provincial Court of Appeal had reduced the damages awarded by the trial judge, the same principle is applicable and that is, particularly in Canada where estimates of damages may differ in the various Provinces, that this Court will not, except in very exceptional circumstances, interfere with the amounts fixed by the Court of Appeal where they differ from the damages assessed by the trial judge.\n(See also Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al.12, and Lehnert v. Stein13.)\nIn view of all the above I would dismiss the appeal of Dormuth and Ursel as against all the respondents with costs and I would dismiss the cross-appeal of Muskovitch as against all other parties thereto with costs.\nThe application based on discovery of new evidence is dismissed as against all respondents except Muskovitch with costs but as I understood counsel for Muskovitch to lend support to the application he should not in my view be entitled to any costs in respect thereof.\nJudson J. (dissenting in part):\u2014There were three-vehicles involved in the collision which gives rise to this litigation. There was first a car travelling towards Regina owned and operated by Larry Meikle, in which Mr. and Mrs. Untereiner were passengers. It was following and trying to overtake a half ton truck which was owned by Adam Ursel and was being driven by Henry Dormuth in a very erratic manner. The occupants of the Meikle car knew Dormuth and had good reason to suspect that he was not in fit condition to drive. Their purpose in trying to overtake him was to persuade him to discontinue driving. They did not succeed.\nThe trial judge found that the Dormuth truck interfered in some way with an oncoming car owned and driven by Martin Muskovitch, that Muskovitch was forced on to the shoulder of the road and then came across the road to the wrong side and struck the Meikle car head on. Mr. Untereiner was killed and his wife, Meikle and another passenger, Grant W. Chamberlain were injured. Muskovitch was also injured.\nMeikle, Chamberlain and Mrs. Untereiner sued to recover damages for their injuries. Mrs. Untereiner also sued under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 102, for herself and five young children. The defendants in each action were Dormuth, Ursel and Muskovitch. Muskovitch also sued Dormuth and Ursel and in this action Meikle was brought in as defendant by counterclaim. The actions were all tried together and the result was that the learned trial judge found that both Dormuth, the truck driver, and Muskovitch, the driver of the oncoming car, were at fault. He apportioned the fault two-thirds to Muskovitch and one-third to Dormuth. He found that Meikle was free of blame.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed this apportionment and made Dormutil two-thirds responsible and Muskovitch one-third responsible. They also exonerated Meikle. In this Court Dormuth and Ursel appeal against liability on the ground that their truck was not the one involved in the accident, Muskovitch cross-appeals to ask that he be freed from blame on the ground that he acted reasonably in an emergency created by the bad driving of Dormuth. Both Courts have found that the Dormuth truck was the one involved, and that both Dormuth and Muskovitch were at fault. These are concurrent findings of fact and there is no ground for interference. I would also sustain the judgment of the Court of Appeal in attributing the greater part of the blame to Dormuth. On the ground of liability, therefore, I would not interfere with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIn Mrs. Untereiner's action under The Fatal Accidents Act, the trial judge awarded $37,500, but delayed in making any apportionment between her on the one hand and the five children on the other. This apportionment still has not been made. The Court of Appeal, as a result of a cross-appeal by Mrs. Untereiner, increased this award to $60,000 and in my respectful opinion there was error in so doing. I cannot find that there was error in principle on the part of the learned trial judge or that the award was so inordinately low as to call for interference, as being a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages, and on this ground alone I would restore the assessment of the learned trial judge.\nI set out in full that part of the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge dealing with the assessment of Mrs. Untereiner's damages under The Fatal Accidents Act:\nThe deceased Ignace Untereiner was married to the plaintiff, Ruth V. Untereiner, in April of 1949. At that time he was just a taxi driver but later became a truck driver. In 1956 he entered the service of North Star Oil Limited as the driver of a heavy duty oil truck and in 1957 purchased the truck he had been driving and entered into a contract with the said company under which he was paid on a gallonage basis. As a truck driver he had been working regularly and had been earning about $375.00 per month. As an independent operator, however, his earnings were larger. His income tax return for 1957 shows a net income for that year of $11,609.18. The income tax return filed by Mrs. Untereiner on his behalf for the six and one-half months of 1958, however, shows a net income of $3,067.36 for that period which indicates a somewhat lower income.\nUpon the death of her husband, Mrs. Untereiner employed a driver for the truck and continued to transport oil under the contract her husband had made with North Star Oil Limited until the month of September of 1959. In that year, however, the said company changed its policy. It appears that at or about that time the Railway Companies made a new deal with the Oil Companies to transport petroleum products in tank cars at special rates and the Oil Companies discontinued the transport of their products by truck except to those places which could not be served by the railway. As a result North Star Oil Limited cancelled its contracts with all of its truckers and Mrs. Untereiner, as administratrix of her husband's estate, sold the truck and equipment. It is a reasonable inference that, even if Untereiner had survived, his contract would have been cancelled and he would then have had to find other employment which might not have been so remunerative. It is clear from the evidence of the Branch Manager of North Star Oil Limited, however, that Untereiner was a good and thoroughly efficient operator and I am satisfied that he would have found profitable employment even though his earnings might have been somewhat reduced.\nI gather from the evidence that the handling of these heavy trucking outfits is strenuous and exacting work and somewhat hazardous. Mr. Barber, the Branch Manager of North Star Oil Limited, admitted under cross examination that his company ordinarily would not hire men for this work who were more than fifty years of age unless they were in first class physical condition and as a rule did not hire men who were more than fifty-five years of age as drivers of such equipment. He expressed the opinion that these men, if physically fit, could carry on until they reached me age of fifty-five years or possibly in some cases sixty years. It would seem, therefore, that the early age of retirement is something that should be taken into consideration in fixing damages in this case.\nAt the time of his death Untereiner was thirty-six years of age and in good health. He was survived by Mrs. Untereiner and five children whose names and ages were correctly set out in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim. The evidence indicates that he was a good father and an excellent husband and as his earnings increased he made better provision for his wife and family. He, however, left an estate of relatively small value. According to the schedule filed for Succession Duty purposes the total value of his estate was only $13,078.67 from which must be deducted debts and liabilities estimated at $6,930.74, leaving a net worth before making any allowance for costs of administration of only $6,147.93. The principal asset was the house and lot which I understand was the family home. This property was valued at $6,000.00 and really represents the net equity in the estate. The title thereto, however, was registered in the names of the deceased and his wife as joint tenants and if the value of this house property be deducted there is practically nothing left in the estate.\nThe principles which apply in assessing damages under The Fatal Accidents Act are not in doubt. They are outlined and explained in detail by the learned author of Charlesworth on Negligence, 3rd Edition, at pages 557 to 565 inclusive. In dealing with the measure of damages the said author at page 557 says:\nThe measure of damages is the pecuniary loss suffered by the dependants as a result of the death. \"What the court has to try to ascertain in these cases is: How much have the widow and family lost by the father's death?\" No damages can be given for the mental sufferings they have undergone, or by way of solatium for their wounded feelings or the pain and suffering of the deceased. The pecuniary loss in question means the actual financial benefit of which the dependants have in fact been deprived, whether the benefit was a result of a legal obligation or of what may reasonably have been expected to take place in the future. It is the amount of the pecuniary benefit which it is reasonably probable the dependants would have received if the deceased had remained alive.\nApplying as best I can the principles set forth in Charlesworth on Negligence and approved in Pollock (otherwise Bruno) v. Marsden Kooler Transport Limited and Piche, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 66; Royal Trust Company v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company [1922] 3 W.W.R. 24 (P.C.) and Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway Company [1951] 2 W.W.R. (N.S.) 665 (P.C.), I assess the general damages to which the plaintiff and the children of the deceased are entitled at $37,500.00. Counsel have agreed that the special damages of the plaintiff in this action amount to $616.37. She, however, has received $232.50 from the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office on account thereof which must be deducted. That would leave a balance of $383.87 to which the plaintiff is entitled as special damages. The plaintiff, Ruth V. Untereiner, as administratrix of her husband's estate, will, therefore, have judgment on behalf of herself and her children against the defendants for the total sum of $37,883.87 and the costs of and incidental to her action.\nThe eldest of the Untereiner children is only ten years and the youngest three years of age. This is a case in which no apportionment of the amount allowed as general damages should be made until someone is appointed to represent these infants. See remarks of Gordon, J.A., in McKenna and Kargus v. Noland and McQuatt, 28 W.W.R. (N.S.) 572 at p. 573. I will, therefore, defer the apportionment so that arrangements can be made for the appointment of a guardian or, failing that, for the official guardian to appear on behalf of these children. The interested parties will have leave to apply further as may be necessary for the proper disposition of the matter. As indicated by Gordon, J.A., in McKenna and Kargus v. Noland and McQuatt, supra, the defendants are not interested in this phase of the matter and need not appear on any such application.\nThe Court of Appeal appears to have increased the assessment on two grounds. They were of the opinion that the learned trial judge had erred in restricting his estimate of the probable earnings of the deceased to what he might have earned as a truck driver, with its incidence of early retirement, and that he underestimated the probability that Untereiner would have been self-employed, with many productive years ahead of him, unhampered by compulsory retirement.\nAs to this ground, it seems to me that the learned trial judge clearly contemplated the prospect that the deceased might find employment in other walks of life, and that he properly considered the contingency that such other employment \"might not have been so remunerative\".\nFurther, the Court of Appeal held that \"The evidence established that in all probability he would have been an employer rather than an employee, and as such not obligated either to find suitable employment, or to retire as an employee\".\nAs to this finding, my respectful opinion is that the evidence falls short of establishing a probability that the deceased would have continued as an employer, and that in any event the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge cannot be construed as showing that he disregarded the occupational alternatives facing the deceased. This makes it unnecessary to consider the application made for the first time in this Court to introduce evidence to show that Mrs. Untereiner remarried on October 15, 1960. The trial judgment is dated March 31, 1960. Muskovitch appealed to ask for complete exoneration on the ground that he was not negligent. Mrs. Untereiner cross-appealed. The appeal was heard on the 5th, 6th and 7th days of March, 1962, and the judgment delivered on August 20, 1962. Apparently it never came to the attention of the Court of Appeal that Mrs. Untereiner had remarried. Remarriage while an appeal is pending has recently been considered in a limited way in Curwen v. James and others1. I wish to say nothing about this problem until it arises squarely for decision.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs in so far as Meikle and Chamberlain and Muskovitch are concerned. The cross-appeal of Muskovitch should be dismissed with costs in so far as Dormuth, Ursel, Meikle and Chamberlain are concerned. As to Mrs. Untereiner she succeeds both on the appeal and cross-appeal on the question of liability but fails on the question of quantum. On this, I would allow the appeal and restore the trial judge's assessment of $37,500. There should be no order for costs to or against her.\nThe motion to introduce new evidence should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs; application based on discovery of new evidence dismissed with costs as against all respondents except Muskovitch, the latter not entitled to any costs in respect thereof; Judson J. dissenting in part as to quantum.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Noonan, Embury, Heald & Molisky, Regina.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent, Ruth V.

The radio was stolen by one Corbin and hidden by him somewhere in the lower town of Montreal. A few hours later, in the evening, Corbin and two other persons were in an automobile driven by the appellant who was accompanied by one Whitworth. The car was driven towards the lower town and stopped in the vicinity of the place where Corbin had hidden the radio. At that time or a few minutes earlier Corbin told the appellant that he had something to give him. Corbin went to get the radio and brought it back, hiding it under his coat. After dropping off Corbin and his two companions, the appellant drove Whitworth to a place where the latter hid the radio. The appellant testified that during the trip he had declared \"Moi je veux rien avoir avec \u00e7a\".\nThe Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge held that it has not been established that the appellant had had physical possession or control of the radio. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether there was in the record legal proof justifying the conclusion that he had had possession within the meaning of s. 296 of the Criminal Code.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe evidence reasonably established that the trial judge could judicially conclude\u2014as he did\u2014that the appellant knew that the article given to him by Corbin was the radio, that he knew that this was a stolen article and that he had possession at least for an appreciable time. If the declaration of the appellant, as testified to by him, justified the trial judge to conclude that the appellant knew that this was a stolen article, the trial judge was free to believe or disbelieve that the appellant had really made that declaration. Having regard to ss. 3(4) and 300 of the Code and having regard to the record, nothing could justify-to validly set aside the verdict of guilty.\nDroit criminel\u2014Possession d'un objet vol\u00e9\u2014Preuve de possession au sens de l'art. 296 du Code Criminel.\nL'appelant fut trouv\u00e9 coupable d'avoir eu en sa possession un radio d'automobile sachant qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9. Ce radio fut vol\u00e9 par un nomm\u00e9 Corbin qui le cacha dans le bas de la ville de Montr\u00e9al. Quelques heures plus tard, dans la soir\u00e9e, Corbin et deux autres personnes prirent place dans le nord de la ville dans l'automobile de l'appelant qui \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 d'un nomm\u00e9 Whitworth. Ils descendirent vers le bas de la ville pour s'arr\u00eater dans le voisinage de l'endroit o\u00f9 Corbin avait cach\u00e9 le radio. A ce moment ou quelques instants auparavant Corbin informa l'appelant qu'il avait quelque chose \u00e0 lui donner. Corbin alla chercher le radio et le rapporta en le cachant sous son manteau. Apr\u00e8s avoir laiss\u00e9 Corbin et ses deux compagnons en cours de route, l'appelant conduisit Whitworth \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 celui-ci cacha le radio. L'appelant t\u00e9moigna qu'au cours de la randonn\u00e9e il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9: \u00abMoi je veux rien avoir avec \u00e7a\u00bb.\nLa Cour d'Appel, par un jugement majoritaire, rejeta l'appel. Le juge dissident jugea qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que l'appelant avait eu la possession physique ou le contr\u00f4le du radio. L'appelant a obtenu permission d'appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de savoir s'il y avait au dossier une preuve l\u00e9gale justifiant la conclusion qu'il y avait eu possession au sens de l'art. 296 du Code Criminel.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nL'ensemble de la preuve \u00e9tablit raisonnablement que le juge au proc\u00e8s pouvait judicieusement conclure\u2014comme il le fit\u2014que l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit don \u00e9tait le radio, qu'il savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet vol\u00e9, et qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un temps appr\u00e9ciable, la possession. Si la d\u00e9claration de l'appelant, rapport\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage, permettait au juge de d\u00e9duire qu'il savait alors qu'il s'agissait d'un objet vol\u00e9, le juge \u00e9tait libre de croire ou de ne pas croire que l'appelant avait v\u00e9ritablement fait cette d\u00e9claration. Au regard des arts. 3(4) et 300 du Code et du dossier, rien ne permet d'\u00e9carter validement la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, confirmant le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 contre l'appelant. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nN. Losier, pour l'appelant.\nJ. Bellemare, pour l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLe Juge Fauteux:\u2014Accus\u00e9 d'avoir \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le 30 mars 1961, (i) vol\u00e9 un radio d'automobile, d'une valeur de $135, et (ii) eu en sa possession ce radio, sachant qu'il \u00e9tait vol\u00e9, l'appelant, \u00e0 l'issue du proc\u00e8s, fut acquitt\u00e9 du vol et trouv\u00e9 coupable de recel.\nIl appela de cette condamnation \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine2 si\u00e9geant en appel, o\u00f9 il soutint en somme que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du recel n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9s. Cette pr\u00e9tention fut rejet\u00e9e comme non fond\u00e9e par MM. les Juges Taschereau et Owen, formant la majorit\u00e9. M. le Juge Bissonnette, dissident, fut d'avis qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tabli que l'accus\u00e9 avait eu la possession physique ou le contr\u00f4le du radio. L'appel fut rejet\u00e9.\nDans un pourvoi subs\u00e9quent \u00e0 cette Cour, l'appelant invoqua la dissidence prononc\u00e9e en Cour d'Appel et soumit particuli\u00e8rement, comme grief d'appel, suivant la permission d'appeler par lui obtenue, qu'il n'y a au dossier aucune preuve l\u00e9gale justifiant la Cour de conclure que l'appelant a eu la possession de ce radio au sens de l'art. 296 du Code Criminel sous lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9.\nLes t\u00e9moins entendus sur les circonstances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant et accompagnant le fait reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant sont tous plus ou moins impliqu\u00e9s en l'affaire. Leurs t\u00e9moignages, non d\u00e9pourvus de r\u00e9ticences ou de contradictions, permettent d'en faire ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nDans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 30 mars 1961, Fernand Corbin vola le radio en question alors qu'il \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 une automobile stationn\u00e9e dans le bas de la ville en arri\u00e8re d'un immeuble de la rue St-Denis, pr\u00e8s de la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes, v\u00e9hicule qu'il avait ill\u00e9galement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 aux fins de ce vol. Il cacha le radio dans une cour priv\u00e9e attenante \u00e0 la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes et dont l'acc\u00e8s \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par une cl\u00f4ture. Le m\u00eame jour, vers les neuf heures du soir, Corbin, Marcel Plante et Charles Vincent, se trouvant alors dans le nord de la ville, prirent place dans une automobile conduite par l'appelant, en compagnie duquel se trouvait d\u00e9j\u00e0 Wayne Whitworth. Tous ces occupants de la voiture, \u00e0 l'exception de Rotondo qui \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s de quarante ans, \u00e9taient des jeunes gens de quinze \u00e0 dix-neuf ans. Ils descendirent tous vers le bas de la ville pour s'arr\u00eater dans le voisinage imm\u00e9diat de l'endroit o\u00f9 Corbin avait cach\u00e9 le radio. C'est alors que Corbin, muni d'outils, se rendit dans la cour priv\u00e9e, prit le radio et le rapporta \u00e0 l'automobile en le cachant sous son manteau. Repartis de cet endroit, les occu- pants de la voiture, \u00e0 l'exception de Rotondo et Wayne Whitworth, se firent laisser \u00e0 une salle de pool et Rotondo conduisit Whitworth \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 celui-ci cacha le radio. A un certain moment, avant ou au moment d'arriver \u00e0 la cour priv\u00e9e, Corbin informa Rotondo qu'il avait quelque chose \u00e0 lui donner. Il ne fait aucun doute, suivant la preuve, que ce quelque chose \u00e9tait le radio que Corbin avait rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'automobile avec ses outils, au vu de certains sinon de tous les occupants de la voiture. Sans entrer dans le d\u00e9tail et la discussion des t\u00e9moignages rendus par ces jeunes gens et l'appelant, l'ensemble de la preuve faite par ces t\u00e9moins, dont la tenue en Cour aussi bien que les t\u00e9moignages ont pu \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s par le Juge au proc\u00e8s, \u00e9tablit raisonnablement que ce dernier pouvait judicieusement conclure\u2014comme il le fit\u2014que l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit don \u00e9tait le radio, qu'il savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet vol\u00e9, et enfin qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un temps appr\u00e9ciable, la possession. Entendu comme t\u00e9moin, pour sa propre d\u00e9fense, Rotondo admit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 pour vol avec effraction et recel. Il t\u00e9moigna qu'\u00e0 un moment, au cours de cette randonn\u00e9e en automobile, il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9:\u2014\u00abMoi je veux rien avoir \u00e0 faire avec \u00e7a\u00bb. Si cette d\u00e9claration, rapport\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage, permettait au Juge de d\u00e9duire que Rotondo savait alors qu'il s'agissait d'un objet vol\u00e9, le Juge \u00e9tait libre de croire ou de ne pas croire que Rotondo avait v\u00e9ritablement fait cette d\u00e9claration au cours de l'affaire. La section 4 de l'art. 3 du Code Criminel d\u00e9finit ainsi la possession:\nAux fins de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\na) Une personne est en possession d'une chose lorsqu'elle l'a en sa possession personnelle ou que, sciemment,\n(i) elle l'a en la possession ou garde r\u00e9elle d'une autre personne, ou\n(ii) elle l'a en un lieu qui lui appartient ou non ou qu'elle occupe ou non, pour son propre usage ou avantage ou celui d'une autre personne; et\nb) Lorsqu'une de deux ou plusieurs personnes, au su et avec le consentement de l'autre ou des autres, a une chose en sa garde ou possession, cette chose est cens\u00e9e sous la garde et en la possession de toutes ces personnes et de chacune d'elles.\nEt l'article 300 \u00e9dict\u00e9:\nPour l'application de l'article 296 et de l'alin\u00e9a b) du paragraphe (1) de l'article 298, l'infraction consistant \u00e0 avoir en sa possession est consomm\u00e9e lorsqu'une personne a, seule ou conjointement avec une autre, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le d'une chose mentionn\u00e9e dans ces articles ou lorsqu'elle aide \u00e0 la cacher ou \u00e0 en disposer, selon le cas.\nAyant attentivement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la preuve et tous les moyens de droit soulev\u00e9s de la part de l'appelant, je dirais qu'au regard de la loi et du dossier, rien ne permet d'\u00e9carter validement la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre l'appelant en premi\u00e8re instance et confirm\u00e9e par le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine si\u00e9geant en appel.\nJe renverrais l'appel.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureur de l'appelant: Norbert Losier, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l'intim\u00e9e: Michael Franklin, Montr\u00e9al.\n1 [1962] B.R. 653.\n2 [1962] B.R. 653.\n"

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nNorthern Sales Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1963: March 12, 13; 1963 : December 16.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA, QUEBEC ADMIRALTY DISTRICT.\nShipping\u2014Charterparty\u2014Arbitration clause in case of dispute\u2014Motion to dismiss action on charterparty or stay proceedings\u2014Jurisdiction of Exchequer Court to entertain action\u2014Matter of substance or procedure\u2014Whether arbitration clause void as against public policy\u2014Whether arbitration proceedings in foreign country a bar to action in Canada\u2014Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 94(3).\nBy a charterparty signed at New York, the defendant undertook that its ship would proceed to Montreal and there load a cargo of wheat. The vessel failed to do so, and the plaintiff, alleging that as a result it was unable to ship wheat it had contracted to deliver and was obliged to pay damages to the purchaser, sued for damages for breach of contract. The charterparty provided for the settlement of any dispute by arbitration at New York. The defendant moved before the Exchequer Court, Quebec Admiralty District, for the dismissal of the action on the main ground that the Court had no jurisdiction, or alternatively, for a stay of proceedings because of lis pendens in New York, where the Courts of that State had ordered the plaintiff to appoint an arbitrator. The trial judge rejected the motion as unfounded. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting) The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: Without the presence of the arbitration clause in the charterparty, the Court below had jurisdiction, both ratione materiae and ratione loci, to hear and determine this case by virtue of ss. 18(3)(a)(i) and 20(1)(e) of The Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1, and Rule 20(b) of the General Rules and Orders in Admiralty. That jurisdiction could not be interfered with by the arbitration clause. The object of such a clause is not to modify the rights of the parties but to enforce them and how a right might be enforced is a matter of procedure. Procedure is governed by the lex fori which, in the present case, was the procedure in force in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, in the absence of any provision relating to such agreements in the Admiralty Rules or in the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court. Under art. 94(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, such a clause, even if valid, was ineffective to preclude the institution of this action before the Court in the territorial jurisdiction of which the whole alleged cause of action had arisen. The Court below being properly seized with this action, its jurisdiction could not be interfered with by the arbitration clause and the Court could not be asked to enforce an agreement which was invalid as being against public policy under the lex fori, i.e., the law of Quebec. Vinette Construction Lt\u00e9e v. Dobrinsky, [1962] Que. Q.B. 62. The clause, being vitiated by absolute nullity, could not be acted upon in the Court below to oust its jurisdiction, and any decision reached by a Board of arbitration in New York would not be res judicata in the Province.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The substantive law applied by the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side\u2014and which is the same throughout Canada\u2014is the English Maritime Law, and by virtue of s. 18(1) of The Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1, its jurisdiction is the same as \"the Admiralty jurisdiction now possessed by the High Court of Justice in England\". The question as to whether an arbitration clause, contained in a contract, is enforceable is one of substance or of procedure, falls to be decided, pursuant to s. 18(1) of The Admiralty Act, in like manner as would be done by the High Court of Justice in England in the exercise of its Admiralty jurisdiction. It is settled by the decision of the House of Lords in Hamlyn and Co. v. Talisker Distillery, [1894] A.C. 202, that this is a matter of substance and not procedural. In the case at bar, it was the intention of the parties that this clause was to be interpreted and governed by the law of the United States. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be assumed that the substantive law of the United States is the same as that of the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side. There was no doubt that by the law administered in the High Court of Justice in England the clause would be found to be valid and enforceable. The material filed in this case supported the view that by the law of the United States the arbitration clause was also valid and enforceable. This was a case in which the proper course was to stay the procedings in the Court below. This will give effect to the expressed intention of the parties and is favoured by every consideration of convenience.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting: The trial judge had jurisdiction both ratione materiae and territorially over the matter by virtue of ss. 18(3)(a)(i) and 20(1)(e) of The Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1, and s. 22(1)(a)(xii)(l) of the Schedule to the Act. Under the law of Quebec such an arbitration clause is null as being against public policy and is unenforceable in the Courts of that Province. However, although the contract was to be performed in part in Quebec where the breach was alleged to have occurred, the Court in which the action was brought was a statutory Court whose jurisdiction by virtue of s. 18(1) of The Admiralty Act was made coextensive with that \"now possessed by the High Court of Justice in England\". The substantive law to be applied by the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side is required to be the same in the various Admiralty District Courts. Having regard, inter alia, to the jurisdiction now possessed by the High Court of Justice in England and existing by virtue of the Arbitration Act, 1950 (Eng.), c. 26, the clause here in question, whether it be treated as a condition precedent to the right of action or not, was not null and unenforceable. The question of whether or not an agreement is null and void as being against public policy is not one which is determined by the rules regulating practice and procedure in the forum where the action is brought. Since neither the rules of the Admiralty Court nor those of the Exchequer Court contain any reference to proceedings for the enforcement of an arbitration agreement and since such a clause is not recognized in the Province of Quebec, the proceedings for the enforcement of such an agreement in the Quebec Admiralty District Court were to be regulated by the procedure, if any, in force with respect to such matters in Her Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England. This procedure is to be found in The Arbitration Act, which, by s. 4(1), gives the Court a discretionary power to stay an action instituted in breach of an arbitration agreement. The defendant was in a position to invoke the provisions of that section. The proper course here was to stay the proceedings.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Smith, District Judge for the Quebec Admiralty District1, dismissing a motion to have plaintiff's action dismissed or proceedings stayed. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nRoger R. Beaulieu, Q.C., and Robert A. Hope, for the defendant, appellant.\nL.S. Reycraft, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Smith D.J.A. in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the Quebec Admiralty District2, rejecting as unfounded appellant's motion demanding the dismissal of respondent's action or alternatively the staying of all proceedings therein.\nIn its action, respondent alleges that by a charterparty, signed at New York on December 7, 1960, appellant under- took that its ship Lewis R. Sanderson would proceed with all convenient speed to Montreal and there load a cargo of wheat for carriage to Italy, and that in violation of this undertaking, the said vessel failed to do so in accordance with the terms of the agreement, with the result that respondent was unable to ship wheat it had contracted to deliver and was obliged to pay damages to the purchaser thereof. Respondent concludes that appellant be condemned to pay these damages, plus loss of profits and expenses, for breach of contract.\nAppellant's motion for the dismissal of this action or alternatively for the staying of all proceedings therein rests mainly on the contention that owing to the following arbitration clause of the charterparty, the Canadian Court has no jurisdiction in the matter or, if it has any, the proceedings must be stayed because of lis pendens in New York:\nNEW YORK PRODUCE EXCHANGE ARBITRATION CLAUSE\nShould any dispute arise between owners and the Charterers, the matter in dispute shall be referred to three persons at New York, one to be appointed by each of the parties hereto, and the third by the two so chosen; their decision or that of any two of them, shall be final and for the purpose of enforcing any award, this agreement may be made a rule of the Court. The Arbitrators shall be commercial men.\nThe record shows these facts:\u2014Being requested to pay the above damages and advised that, failing payment, an action for their recovery would be instituted in the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, appellant first asked for delay and eventually replied that according to the pre-cited clause, \"the only forum for the determination of respondent's claim was by arbitration in New York city,\" that it had nominated one P. V. Everett as its arbitrator and that failing respondent to designate its own arbitrator on or before March 2, 1962, appropriate action would be taken. Respondent having abstained from doing so, appellant sought and obtained on March 7, an Order from the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, ordering respondent to show cause, on March 13, why it should not arbitrate. Respondent appeared in the United States District Court under protest and for the sole purpose of vacating the Order and obtaining the dismissal of the proceedings. Its objection to the jurisdiction of the Court was rejected on April 3, and it was ordered to appoint an arbitrator within ten days. Meanwhile, to wit, on March 9, respondent procured the issue of the writ of summons in the present action in which appellant appeared under protest. It is my understanding that the proceedings in the U.S. District Court are held in abeyance pending the disposition of the present appeal.\nThe submissions of the parties, which are generally the same in this Court as in the Court below, may be briefly stated. On behalf of appellant, it is contended that the Court below has no territorial jurisdiction; that the arbitration clause is valid and applicable, in the United States where the contract was executed, to maritime transactions and charterparties and that even if the Court had territorial jurisdiction, the arbitration clause is the law validly binding the parties thereto, in Canada as well as it is in the, United States, hence, it is said, the Court below has no jurisdiction at all; that, in any event, the arbitration proceedings commenced in the New York jurisdiction preclude proceedings in Canada. Respondent's contentions, obviously challenged by appellant, are that the cause of action arose in Montreal and that of its nature the claim is one within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District; that arbitration agreements and proceedings, as well as rules relating to lis pendens are of a procedural nature governed by the lex fori which, in the absence of any provision in the General Rules and Orders in Admiralty and of the Exchequer Court of Canada, is the law governing practice and procedure in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec; that under the lex fori, this arbitration clause, admittedly a \"clause compromissoire\", is invalid as being against public policy, in violation of s. 13 of the Civil Code and thus totally ineffective to support appellant's motion.\nIf one consider the charterparty as if the arbitration clause was absent therefrom, the Court below, i.e., the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, Montreal Registry, has clearly jurisdiction to hear and determine this case. Ratione materiae, the claim is in damages and arises out of an agreement relating to use or hire of a ship and, as such, a claim within the jurisdiction of the Court under s. 18, subs. 3(a)(i) of The Admiralty Act, 1934. This counsel for appellant conceded. His contention that jurisdiction ratione loci is lacking rests on the submission that the contract was not one to be performed at Mont- real and that, even if it was, the alleged breach of the contract did not occur at Montreal; hence the action instituted within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court below and its service authorized to be made and actually made without that jurisdiction are invalid. Appellant's contention is untenable in view of the allegations of the statement of claim which incorporate by reference the charterparty and which, for the purpose of appellant's motion, must be deemed to be admitted. Sternberg v. Home Lines Inc.3 The present action is one in personam and is founded on the breach, occurring within the Admiralty District where the action is instituted, of the primary and unseverable obligation which had to be performed in the said district within the period of time agreed upon. In the circumstances, the institution of the action in Montreal and the authorization to serve it and its service in New York are valid under s. 20(1)(e) of The Admiralty Act, 1934, and Rule 20(b) of the General Rules and Orders in Admiralty, respectively. The decision of the House of Lords in Johnson v. Taylor Bros. and Company Ltd.4 does not assist appellant. The facts in that case are essentially different and the law, as stated therein by the House of Lords, supports, as I read it, respondent's contention which was accepted in the Court below.\nOn the view that, the arbitration clause being excluded from the consideration, the Court below has jurisdiction to hear and determine this case, the next question is whether that jurisdiction can be interfered with by the arbitration clause.\nThis clause requires no interpretation; it is clear. The parties have stipulated that should any dispute arise between them, they shall not have recourse to the ordinary Courts having, by law, jurisdiction to determine their rights under the charterparty, but undertook that they shall then refer the matter of dispute to three persons at New York who shall be commercial men and of whom the decision shall be final and the award made a rule of law for the purpose of its enforcement. Such an agreement to arbitrate any disputes that may arise pertains, as do agreements to arbitrate pending or impending disputes, to the law of remedies or procedure. The object of the clause is not to modify the rights of the parties under the charterparty but to enforce them and how a right might be enforced is a matter of procedure. Procedure is governed by the lex fori which, in the present case, in the absence of any provision relating to such agreements in the Admiralty Rules or in the General. Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court, is the procedure in force in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec according to Admiralty Rule 215 and Exchequer Court Rule 2(1)(b). That, under the Code of Civil Procedure, such a clause, even if valid, is ineffective to preclude the institution of this action before the Court in the territorial jurisdiction of which the whole alleged cause of action has arisen is settled by art. 94, para. 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure. In Gordon and Gotch (Australasia) Ltd. v. Montreal Australia New Zealand Line Ltd.5, where the effect of art. 94 was considered by the Court of Appeal, St-Jacques J., with the concurrence of L\u00e9tourneau, Bond and Galipeault JJ., said at p. 431:\nLa loi a dit, et ce, d'une fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive qui ne me para\u00eet pas souffrir de doute: D\u00e9sormais, les tribunaux de la province, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9s en vertu de la pr\u00e9rogative royale et des dispositions du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, ne tiendront aucun compte des \u00abstipulations, conventions ou engagements\u00bb qui auraient pour objet de soustraire un litigant \u00e0 la juridiction des tribunaux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9s dans cette province.\nThe clause in the latter case read as follows:\nIt is also agreed that in the event of any dispute arising in connection with any claims, such dispute shall be decided by the Courts of the country of such final port of discharge and not by the Courts of any other country;\nThe Court below being properly seized with this action, its jurisdiction to try the merits of the case cannot be interfered with by the arbitration clause and the Court cannot be asked to enforce it if, as contended for by respondent and held by the Court of first instance, this arbitration agreement is invalid as being against public policy under the lex fori, to wit, the law of the Province of Quebec.\nAdmittedly, this arbitration agreement is, under the law of France and of the Province of Quebec, what is designated as a clause compromissoire. The validity of such a clause has given rise to conflicting jurisprudence, both in France and in the Province of Quebec. In France, this conflict was definitely resolved in 1843 when, in Comp. l'Alliance v. Prunier, la Cour de Cassation concluded to the invalidity of the clause, (Sirey 1843.1.562), except, of course, in mat- ters of maritime insurance in respect of which the clause was expressly authorized under art. 332 of le Code du Commerce. Received with satisfaction by certain jurists and dissatisfaction by others, this decision remained the law in France up to 1925. In 1925, the clause was, generally speaking, validated so far as commercial matters only were concerned, by art. 631 of le Code du Commerce. In the Province of Quebec, the clause is invalid as being against public policy, according to what appears to be the weight of jurisprudence and according to the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec in Vinette Construction Li\u00e9e v. Dame Dobrinsky6. No useful purpose would be served in reciting and discussing here all the arguments advanced in favour of both the theses of validity and of invalidity of the clause. Sufficient it is to refer to Dalloz R\u00e9pertoire, tome 4, verbo Arbitrage, p. 502, nos 454 et seq., where these arguments are collected, to the thesis favouring validity, written in 1945 by Walter S. Johnson, K.C., and to a summary of these arguments appearing in the dissent of Owen J. in the Vinette case, supra, at page 73.\nDesirable as it may be in private international law, with respect to commercial matters, the Quebec legislature has not yet seen fit to make any enactment substantially similar to the one made in France to le Code du Commerce. And so far as it has expressed any policy in the matter, the legislature does not appear to favour the validity of such clause, as shown by the reasons for judgment of St-Jacques J. in Gordon and Gotch (Australasia) Ltd. v. Montreal Australia New Zealand Line Ltd., supra. After anxious consideration, I have formed the opinion that the Vinette case, supra, expresses the law of the Province in the matter and the arbitration clause pre-cited must, therefore, be held invalid as being against public policy.\nIn these views, the clause, being vitiated by absolute nullity, cannot obtain or be acted upon in the Court below either to oust or in any way interfere with its jurisdiction to be seized with and try the action on its merits. It also follows that whatever decision may be reached by the Arbitration Board in New York will not be res judicata in the Province, as held by the learned Judge of first instance.\nBefore closing, I should perhaps indicate that the above conclusions have not been reached without careful con- sideration being given to the decisions referred to by my brothers Cartwright and Ritchie in support of their reasons for judgment. For the purpose of this case, all I care to say with respect to these decisions is that they do not, in my respectful view, affect the basis upon which the opinion I have formed has been reached.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs and order the record to be returned to the Court below for resumption of the proceedings.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Smith, sitting as District Judge in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court of Canada in and for the Admiralty District of Quebec7, dismissing a motion whereby the appellant asked:\nfor the dismissal of plaintiff's action sauf recours or in the alternative the staying of proceedings until the terms of the arbitration clause appearing in the charterparty dated New York, December 7, 1960, between the parties have been complied with;\nThe relevant circumstances and the contentions of the parties are set out in the reasons of my brother Fauteux and I shall endeavour to avoid unnecessary repetition.\nFor the purposes of this appeal I will assume, without deciding, that the statement of claim sufficiently alleges a breach within the Admiralty District of Quebec of the contract between the parties and that were it not for the arbitration clause which forms part of that contract the action in the Court below should proceed in the usual way.\nIt is first necessary to consider what is the law applied by the Exchequer Court in the exercise of jurisdiction on its Admiralty side. In Robillard v. The Sailing Sloop St. Roch and Charland8, Maclennan D.L.J.A. said at pp. 134 and 135:\nThe first important question to be decided is:\u2014Is it the Maritime Law of England or the Canadian Law which governs the rights of the parties in respect to plaintiff's claim for title and possession of the sailing sloop St. Roch? The Exchequer Court of Canada as a Court of Admiralty is a court having and exercising all the jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred by the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (Imp.), over the like places, persons, matters and things as are within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Division of the High Court in England, whether exercised by virtue of a statute or otherwise, and as a Colonial Court of Admiralty it may exercise such jurisdiction in like manner and to as full an extent as the High Court in England. In the Gaetano and Maria, 7 P.D. 137, Brett L.J., at p. 143, said:\u2014\n'The law which is administered in the Admiralty Court of England is the English Maritime Law. It is not the ordinary municipal law of the country, but it is the law which the English Court of Admiralty, either by Act of Parliament or by reiterated decisions and traditions and principles, has adopted as the English Maritime Law.\nAlthough the Exchequer Court in Admiralty sits in Canada it administers the Maritime Law of England in like manner as if the cause of action were being tried and disposed of in the English Court of Admiralty.\nBy s. 35 of The Admiralty Act, 1934 (Can.), 24-25 George V, c. 31, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, was repealed \"in so far as the said Act is part of the law of Canada\", and the matter is now governed by the provisions of the Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1, subs. (1) of s. 18 of which reads as follows:\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Court on its Admiralty side extends to and shall be exercised in respect of all navigable waters, tidal and non-tidal, whether naturally navigable or artificially made so, and although such waters are within the body of a county or other judicial district, and, generally, such jurisdiction shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be over the like places, persons, matters and things as the Admiralty jurisdiction now possessed by the High Court of Justice in England, whether existing by virtue of any statute or otherwise, and be exercised by the Court in like manner and to as full an extent as by such High Court.\nSub-section (2) of the same section provides that, in so far as it can apply, s. 22 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, of the United Kingdom, which is printed as Schedule A to the Act, shall be applied mutatis mutandis by the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side.\nWhile all jurisdiction formerly vested in the High Court of Admiralty now forms part of the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice the law administered is still the English Maritime law. In the article on \"Admiralty\" in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 1, one of whose authors was Lord Merriman, it is said at p. 50, para. 92:\nThe law administered in Admiralty actions is not the ordinary municipal law of England, but is the law which by Act of Parliament or reiterated decisions, traditions, and principles, has become the English maritime law.\nThe substantive law applied by the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side is, of course, the same throughout Canada and does not vary according to the Admiralty District in which the cause of action arises, but, by the combined effect of Admiralty Rule 215 and Exchequer Court Rule 2(1)(b), the practice and procedure, where it is not otherwise pro- vided by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or any general rule or order of the Court, shall:\n(b) If the cause of action arises in the Province of Quebec, conform to and be regulated, as near as may be, by the practice and procedure at the time in force in similar suits, actions and matters in Her Majesty's Superior Court for the Province of Quebec; and if there be no similar suit, action or matter therein, then conform to and be regulated by the practice and procedure at the time in force in similar suits, actions and matters in Her Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England.\nSmith D.J.A. has taken the view that the questions raised on the motion are procedural in nature. The learned Judge says in part:\nArbitration agreements and proceedings, as well as the rules relating to lis pendens are procedural in nature. (C.P. 411 et seq; and C.P. 173) and, in the absence of any provision relating to same in the Admiralty Rules or in the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer, they are governed by the practice and procedure in force in the Superior Court of this Province \u2026.\nIt must be determined therefore whether the said arbitration clause is valid according to the laws of the Province of Quebec and is one which our Courts will enforce and give effect to.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that the learned Judge has erred in treating the question in issue as one of procedure rather than one of substance. Whether it is the one or the other falls to be decided, pursuant to s. 18(1) of the Admiralty Act quoted above, in like manner as would be done by the High Court of Justice in England in the exercise of its Admiralty Jurisdiction. That the question whether effect should be given to an arbitration clause contained in a contract is one of substance and not procedural appears to me to be settled by the decision of the House of Lords in Hamlyn & Co. v. Talisker Distillery9. The effect of that case is succinctly stated in the head-note as follows:\nWhere a contract is entered into between parties residing in different countries where different systems of law prevail, it is a question in each case, with reference to what law the parties contracted, and according to what law it was their intention that their rights either under the whole or any part of the contract should be determined.\nA contract between an English and a Scotch firm, signed in London but to be performed in Scotland, contained this stipulation: 'Should any dispute arise out of this contract, the same to be settled by arbitration by two members of the London Corn Exchange, or their umpire, in the usual way'.\nIn an action raised by the Scotch firm in Scotland for implement of the contract and for damages, the English firm pleaded that the action was excluded by the arbitration clause. The Scotch Courts held that the clause was governed by the law of Scotland inasmuch as that country was the locus solutionis, and that the reference, being to adbitrators unnamed, was therefore invalid:\u2014\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Session (21 Court Sess. Cas. 4th Series (Rettie) 204), that the contract was governed by English law, according to which the arbitration clause was valid, and deprived the Scotch Courts of jurisdiction to decide upon the merits of the case, unless the arbitration proved abortive.\nThe reasoning of this decision, applied to the facts of the case at bar, appears to me to establish (i) that the substantive law by which the parties intended that their rights under the contract should be determined was that of the United States of America, (ii) that the question whether the arbitration clause is enforceable is one of substantive law and not one of procedure and consequently, (iii) that if by the law of the United States of America the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable it should have been given effect in the Court below.\nThat the High Court of Justice in England in the exercise of its Admiralty jurisdiction would follow an applicable decision of the House of Lords goes without saying.\nThe speeches of all of the Law Lords who took part in the judgment bear on the questions with which we are concerned and it is difficult to refrain from unduly lengthy quotation.\nAt pp. 206 and 207, Lord Herschell L.C. said:\nIt is not in controversy that the arbitration clause is according to the law of England, a valid and binding contract between the parties, nor that according to the law of Scotland it is wholly invalid inasmuch as the arbiters are not named. The view taken by the majority of the Court below is thus expressed by Lord Adam: 'So far as I see, nothing required to be done in England in implement of the contract. That being so, I am of opinion with the Lord Ordinary that the construction and effect of the agreement, and of all and each of its stipulations, is to be determined by the lex loci solutionis, that is, by the law of Scotland'.\nIt is not denied that the conclusion thus arrived at renders the arbitration clause wholly inoperative, and thus defeats the expressed intention of the parties, but this is treated as inevitably following from the rule of law that the rights of the parties must be wholly determined by the lex loci solutionis. I am not able altogether to agree with the view taken by the learned Lord that everything required to be done in implement of the contract was to be done in Scotland, inasmuch as it appears to me that the arbitration clause which I have read to your Lordships does not indicate that that part of the contract between the parties was to be implemented by performance in Scotland. That clause is as much a part of the contract as any other clause of the contract, and certainly there is nothing on the face of it to indicate, but quite the contrary, that it was in the contemplation of the parties that it should be implemented in Scotland.\nAt pp. 208 and 209, Lord Herschell L.C. said:\nNow in the present case it appears to me that the language of the arbitration clause indicates very clearly that the parties intended that the rights under that clause should be determined according to the law of England. As I have said, the contract was made there; one of the parties was residing there. Where under such circumstances the parties agree that any dispute arising out of their contract shall be 'settled by arbitration by two members of the London Corn Exchange, or their umpire, in the usual way,' it seems to me that they have indicated as clearly as it is possible their intention that that particular stipulation, which is a part of the contract between them, shall be interpreted according to and governed by the law, not of Scotland, but of England, and I am aware of nothing which stands in the way of the intention of the parties, thus indicated by the contract they entered into, being carried into effect. As I have already pointed out, the contract with reference to arbitration would have been absolutely null and void if it were to be governed by the law of Scotland. That cannot have been the intention of the parties; it is not reasonable to attribute that intention to them if the contract may be otherwise construed; and, for the reasons which I have given, I see no difficulty whatever in construing the language used as an indication that the contract, or that term of it, was to be governed and regulated by the law of England.\nAt p. 211, Lord Watson after referring to the two pleas, '(1) No jurisdiction; (2) The action is excluded by the clause of reference', which had been repelled in the Courts below, said:\nWith reference to the two pleas which have been repelled, I wish to observe that, although they seem to have become stereotyped in cases like the present, they do not correctly represent the rights of a defender who relies upon a valid contract to submit the matter in dispute to arbitration. The jurisdiction of the Court is not wholly ousted by such a contract. It deprives the Court of jurisdiction to inquire into and decide the merits of the case, whilst it leaves the Court free to entertain the suit, and to pronounce a decree in conformity with the award of the arbiter. Should the arbitration, from any cause, prove abortive, the full jurisdiction of the Court will revive, to the effect of enabling it to hear and determine the action upon its merits. When a binding reference is pleaded in limine, the proper course to take is either to refer the question in dispute to the arbiter named or to stay procedure until it has been settled by arbitration.\nAt pp. 213 and 214, Lord Watson said:\nIt has never, so far as I am aware, been seriously disputed, that, whatever may be the domicile of a contract, any Court which has jurisdiction to entertain an action upon it must, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, be guided by what are termed the curial rules of the lex fori, such as those which relate to procedure or to proof. Don v. Lippman 2 Sh. & McL. 682, which is the leading Scotch authority upon the point, has settled that these rules include local laws relating to prescription or limitation. But all the rules noticed by Lord Brougham in his elaborate judgment as belonging to that class refer to the action of the Court in investigating the merits of a suit in which its jurisdiction has been already established. I can find no authority, and none was cited to us, to the effect that, in dealing with the prejudicial question whether it has jurisdiction to try the merits of the cause, the Court ought to disregard an agreement to refer which is pars contract\u00fbs, and binding according to the law of the contract, because it would not be valid if tested by the lex fori. Without clear authority, I am not prepared to affirm a rule which does not appear to me to be recommended by any considerations of principle or expediency. One result of its adoption would be that, if two persons domiciled in England made a contract there containing the same clause of reference which occurs in this case, either of them could avoid the reference by bringing an action before a Scotch Court, if the other happened to be temporarily resident in Scotland, or to have personal estate in that country capable of being arrested.\nAll of the Law Lords held that the arbitration clause made it clear that it was the intention of the parties that its operation and effect should be governed by the law of England. In the case at bar, on reading the whole contract and particularly having regard to the wording of the \"New York Produce Exchange Arbitration Clause\" which forms part of it, I am of opinion that it was the intention of the parties that this clause, setting out the agreement for the settlement of disputes which might arise out of the contract, was to be interpreted and governed by the law of the United States.\nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary it would be assumed that the substantive law of the United States is the same as that of the Court in which this action is pending, that is the Exchequer Court of Canada on its Admiralty side. That by the law administered in the High Court of Justice in England in the exercise of its Admiralty jurisdiction the clause would be found to be valid and enforceable does not appear to me to admit of doubt. On this point it is scarcely necessary to multiply authorities but in addition to the Hamlyn & Co. case, supra, reference may be made to the decision of the House of Lords in Atlantic Shipping and Trading Co. v. Louis Dreyfus and Co.10 The clause under consideration in that case reads as follows:\nAll disputes from time to time arising out of this contract shall, unless the parties agree forthwith on a single arbitrator, be referred to the final arbitrament of two arbitrators carrying on business in London who shall be members of the Baltic and engaged in the shipping and\/or grain trades, one to be appointed by each of the parties, with power to such arbitrators to appoint an umpire. Any claim must be made in writing and claimants' arbitrator appointed within three months of final discharge and where this provision is not complied with the claim shall be deemed to be waived and absolutely barred.\nThe Court of Appeal had taken the view that the meaning of the clause was that under no circumstances should a claimant be allowed to enter His Majesty's Courts at all and that it was bad in that it completely ousted the jurisdiction of the Court. With this the House of Lords unanimously disagreed, although the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed on another ground which has no relevance to the question before us.\nAt pp. 255 and 256, Lord Dunedin said:\nMy Lords, under the old law an agreement to refer disputes arising under a contract to arbitration was often asserted to be bad, as an ousting of the jurisdiction of the Courts, but that position was finally abandoned in Scott v. Avery 5 H.L.C. 811. As I read that case, it can no longer be said that the jurisdiction of the Court is ousted by such an agreement; on the contrary the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked to enforce it, and there is nothing wrong in persons agreeing that their disputes should be decided by arbitration. It follows that the clause here is not obnoxious so far as it provides for arbitration.\nAt pp. 258 and 259, Lord Summer said:\nI think the words do not exclude the cargo owner from such recourse to the Courts as is always open by virtue of the provisions of the Arbitration Act to a party who has agreed to arbitrate. If so, as of course the Court of Appeal would have been the first to recognize, the jurisdiction of the Courts is not ousted, so as to make this arbitration clause bad altogether. Its terms can be enforced.\nIn the case at bar, by a written agreement signed by the solicitors for the parties it was provided, inter alia:\n2. That the Arbitration Act of the United States of America (Title Number 9\u2014Arbitration) referred to in paragraph 3 of Defendant's amended motion is the applicable and binding law of the United States of America relating to the arbitration of maritime transactions and charterparties, and that the copy of the said law produced herewith as Defendant's Exhibit M-4 is a true copy thereof.\n3. That the Plaintiff admits the appearance referred to in paragraph 4 of Defendant's amended motion but adds that the said appearance was specially, or under protest, for the sole purpose of vacating the order to show cause and for the dismissal of the proceedings before the said United States District Court.\n4. The Plaintiff admits that pursuant to the decision of Judge Edelstein of the District Court of the Southern District of New York dated April 3rd, 1962, an Order issued from the said Court on April 12th, 1962, overruling the objection of the Plaintiff to the jurisdiction of the said Court and ordering the Plaintiff herein to appoint an arbitrator within ten days from the entry of the said Order and to proceed to arbitration within thirty days from the entry of said Order, and that said Order is a final judgment, subject to appeal, according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of the United States of America, a certified true copy of said Order, produced herewith as Defendant's Exhibit M-5.\nA perusal of the statute referred to as Exhibit M-4 supports the view, which in the absence of evidence would have been presumed, that by the law of the United States the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable.\nIn the course of his reasons, Smith D.J.A. said:\nCounsel for the defendant argued however that the validity of the said arbitration clause must be determined in accordance with the laws of the United States, where the contract was made. It is no doubt true that our Courts in adjudicating in respect of contracts executed in foreign jurisdiction are obliged to give consideration to the lex loci contractus, but they will not enforce or give effect to a contract which, under the laws of this Province, is against public order, even though the said contract may be legal and binding in the jurisdiction in which it was made.\nIt is no doubt true that if an agreement made in a jurisdiction other than that in which it is sought to be enforced is opposed to a fundamental principle of the law of the country in the courts of which the action to enforce it is pending those courts will not enforce it. But the question as to whether or not the agreement is opposed to such a principle must be decided by the substantive law administered by the Court in which the action is pending. In the case at bar, that law, as has been pointed out above, is not the law of the Province of Quebec; it is the Maritime law of England. The enforcement of the arbitration clause with which we are concerned is not opposed to any principle of the last mentioned law.\nBecause of this I do not find it necessary to consider whether a clause which makes a reference to arbitration a condition precedent to the bringing of an action is opposed to any fundamental principle of the law of Quebec. Had we been called upon to examine that question it would have been necessary to consider the effect of many cases of which I shall mention only one, Guerin v. The Manchester Fire Assurance Co11., a decision of this Court on appeal from the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec (Appeal Side). At pp. 151 and 152, Sir Henry Strong C.J. with whom Sedgewick and King JJ. agreed, said:\nFurther the arbitration clause, added to the conditions by the variation to condition sixteen, provides that no action should be maintainable until after an award had been obtained pursuant to the terms of the conditions fixing the amount of the claim. The Court of Review considered this provision void as tending to oust the jurisdiction of the courts of law and so contrary to public policy. I do not think this view can be maintained. The law of England provides that any agreement renouncing the jurisdiction of legally established courts of justice is null, but nevertheless in the case of Scott v. Avery, 5 H.L. Cas. 811, the House of Lords determined that a clause of this nature and almost in the same words as that before us making an award a condition precedent, was perfectly valid and that no action was maintainable until after an award had been made. This decision, which has been followed in many later cases, though of course not a binding authority on the courts of Quebec, proceeds upon a principle of law which is as applicable under French as under English law. This principle applies not merely to cases where the amount of damages is to be ascertained by an arbitrator, but also to cases where it is made a condition precedent that the question of liability should first be determined by arbitration.\nThe learned Judge having held that as a matter of law he could not give effect to the arbitration clause did not find it necessary to exercise any discretion in the matter. A reading of the record makes it plain that it was the intention of the contracting parties that any dispute arising between them out of the terms of the contract should be settled by arbitration at New York and that the United States Arbitration Act, referred to above, should be the governing statute as to the conduct of the arbitration. The inconvenience of permitting the action in the Exchequer Court of Canada to proceed is manifest. In my opinion this is a case in which the proper course is to stay proceedings in the Court below in order that the matter in dispute may be settled by arbitration in accordance with the terms of the contract. This will give effect to the expressed intention of the parties and is favoured by every consideration of convenience. Such an order will leave the parties at liberty to apply to the Court in the event, which on the material before us appears to be unlikely, that the reference proves abortive.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court below, direct that an order be entered staying proceedings in the action until arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the parties, and that the costs of the motion before Smith D.J.A. and of this appeal be paid by the respondent to the appellant forthwith after taxation thereof.\nRitchie J. (dissenting):\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal have been fully described in the reasons for judgment of my brothers Cartwright and Fauteux, which I have had the advantage of reading, and I will endeavour to confine any repetition of what they have said to such material as is necessary for the purpose of making my own views clear.\nThis is an action for damages arising out of the alleged breach by the appellant within the Quebec Admiralty District \"of an agreement relating to the use and hire of a ship\" and I agree with the learned trial judge that as the District Judge in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court of Canada for the Quebec Admiralty District, he had jurisdiction both ratione materiae and territorially over the matter by virtue of the provisions of ss. 18(3)(a)(i) and 20(1)(e) of the Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1, and s. 22(1)(a)(xii)(1) of the Schedule to that Act.\nThe arbitration clause which the appellant seeks to invoke as a ground for the dismissal of this action or in the alternative for a stay of proceedings reads as follows:\nShould any dispute arise between Owners and the Charterers, the matter in dispute shall be referred to three persons at New York, one to be appointed by each of the parties hereto, and the third by the two so chosen; their decision or that of any two of them, shall be final, and for the purpose of enforcing any award, this agreement may be made a rule of the Court. The Arbitrators shall be commercial men.\nThe reasons for judgment of my brother Fauteux and of the learned trial judge make it apparent that under the law of the Province of Quebec this clause is what is described as a \"clause compromissoire\" and that as such it is \"vitiated by absolute nullity\" as being against public policy and is unenforceable in the courts of that Province. I take the effect of this to be that the existence of such a clause, providing as it does that the decision of arbitrators appointed by the parties to the contract rather than by the court \"shall be final\" as to \"any dispute\" arising between the owners and charterers, is simply not recognized by the courts of the Province of Quebec. This appears to me to be borne out by the fact that there are no provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure for the enforcement of such a clause and that the articles of that Code dealing with arbitrators (see art. 411 et seq) are confined to arbitrators who are, whether by consent of the parties or otherwise, appointed by the court. The provisions of art. 94(3), read in the light of the decision of St. Jacques J. in Gordon and Gotch (Australasia) v. Montreal Australia-New Zealand Line Limited12, serve to further confirm the fact that such a clause is totally ineffective to supplant the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Quebec.\nThe peculiarity of the present case, however, is that although the contract in question was to be performed, at least in part, in the Province of Quebec where the breach is alleged to have occurred, the court in which this action is brought is not a court of that Province but a statutory court which is required by the provisions of s. 18(1) of the Admiralty Act to exercise its jurisdiction \"in like manner and to as full an extent\" as the same jurisdiction is exercised by the High Court of Justice in England notwithstanding the fact that the territorial limits of the Admiralty district within which such jurisdiction is exercised coincide with the boundaries of the Province of Quebec.\nThe history of the Admiralty Court in Quebec from the time of its organization in 1717 is recounted in the reasons for judgment of Girouard J. in Inverness Railway and Coal Company v. Jones13, and in these reasons, after having dealt extensively with the early French law of Admiralty, Girouard J. described the situation as it existed in 1908 in the following terms at p. 55:\nAfter the cession of the country to Great Britain the ordinance and the French law generally ceased to be enforced in the Quebec admiralty court and the English law was substituted for them as part of the public law of Great Britain. By his commission, the first admiralty judge in Quebec, appointed in 1764, was empowered to hold a vice-admiralty court like the High Court of Admiralty in England, and, of course, according to the English laws. The Civil Code of Quebec, art. 2383, recognized that rule in express terms:\nThe provisions in this chapter (chapter 4th relating to privilege and maritime lien) do not apply in cases before the court of vice-admiralty.\nCases in that court are determined according to the civil and maritime laws of England.\nFinally, the Imperial statute, 53 and 54 Vict. ch. 27, passed in 1890, empowering the legislature of a British possession to create colonial courts of admiralty, declares that the jurisdiction of such courts shall be\nas the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England \u2026\nThe fact that these observations were made in the course of a dissenting opinion does not, in my view, in any way affect their accuracy.\nBy the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (Imp.), the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Districts in Canada was limited to the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England as it existed at the time of the passing of that Act, (see The Yuri Maru14) and this continued to be the situation until 1934 when the Parliament of Canada enacted the Admiralty Act, 1934 (Can.), 31 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 1) whereby the jurisdiction was made coextensive with that \"now possessed by the High Court of Justice in England\", \"whether by virtue of any statute or otherwise\".\nIt appears to me to be clear from the Admiralty Act that the substantive law to be applied by the Exchequer Court of Canada on its Admiralty side is by the very nature of the jurisdiction conferred by that Statute required to be the same in the various Admiralty District Courts which have been established to exercise it.\nIn this respect the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court differs from that conferred upon it by the Exchequer Court Act as is indicated by the fact that in the exercise of the latter jurisdiction there are cases in which the liability of the Crown is to be determined by the law of the Province. (See King v. Laperri\u00e8re15).\nAs was said by the District Judge in Admiralty in the recent case of Savoy Shipping Limited v. La Commission Hydro-Electrique de Quebec16:\nBy Section 91 of the British North America Act the Parliament of Canada was given exclusive jurisdiction to legislate in respect of \"Shipping and navigation\". The Admiralty Court, although constituted as that part of the Exchequer Court having jurisdiction in Admiralty matters, is given a jurisdiction which is different and distinct from that vested in the Exchequer Court by the Exchequer Court Act.\nFor the reasons hereinafter stated, I do not consider that the clause here in question, whether it be treated as a condition precedent to the right of action under the contract or not, is such as to be \"vitiated by obsolute nullity\" and therefore unenforceable in the High Court of Justice in England having regard, inter alia, to the jurisdiction now possessed by that Court and existing by virtue of the Arbitration Act, 1950 (Eng.), c. 26.\nThe question of whether or not an agreement is null and void as being against public policy is not, in my respectful opinion, one which is determined by the rules regulating practice and procedure in the forum where the action is brought although such rules undoubtedly control the means, if any, by which the agreement is to be enforced.\nAs has been pointed out by my brother Cartwright, the practice and procedure of the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side, where it is not provided by an act of the Parliament of Canada or in the Admiralty rules or the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court shall \"if the cause of action arises in the Province of Quebec be regulated as near as may be by the practice and procedure at the time in force in similar suits, actions and matters in Her Majesty's Superior Court of the Province of Quebec; and if there be no similar suit, action or matter therein, then conform to and be regulated by the practice and procedure at the time in force in similar suits, actions and matters in Her Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England.\" (See Admiralty Rule 215 and Exchequer Court Rule 21(b)).\nSince neither the rules of the Admiralty Court nor those of the Exchequer Court contain any reference to proceedings for the enforcement of an arbitration agreement, and since a \"clause compromissoire\" is not recognized in the Province of Quebec and the only provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure of that Province relating to arbitrators are concerned with arbitrators appointed by the Court, it appears to me that the proceedings for the enforcement of such an agreement in the Quebec Admiralty District Court are to be regulated by the procedure, if any, in force with respect to such matters in Her Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England. This, in my view, is borne out by what was said in another connection by Mr. Justice A. I. Smith in Savoy Shipping Limited v. La Commission Hydro-Electrique de Quebec, supra, at p. 273.\nThe law and practice in England with respect to arbitration clauses is concisely stated in Chitty on Contracts, 22nd ed. (1961), in para. 741 at p. 309, where it is said:\nArbitration clauses in contracts are of two main kinds, namely bare arbitration agreements, when the parties agree that disputes arising out of the contract, or certain types of dispute, shall be referred to arbitration; and agreements making an arbitrator's award a condition precedent to any right of action under the contract \u2026.\nBare agreements to arbitrate were not specifically enforceable in equity; and while damages for breach of such an agreement could be granted at common law, it was difficult for the party seeking arbitration to prove more than nominal damages. It was therefore necessary for statute to provide machinery for the indirect specific enforcement of bare arbitration agreements. This was first provided by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, now section 4(1) of the Arbitration Act, 1950, which gives the court a discretionary power to stay an action begun in breach of an arbitration agreement.\nSection 4(1) of The Arbitration Act, 1950 (Eng.), reads as follows:\nIf any party to an arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, commences any legal proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to those legal proceedings may at any time after appearance, and before delivering any pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings, and that court or any judge thereof, if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the agreement, and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying the proceedings.\nThe appellant has delivered no pleadings nor taken any-other steps in these proceedings and is accordingly in the position to invoke the provisions of this section.\nThe High Court of Justice in England exercises its jurisdiction in relation to such arbitration clauses by virtue of the Arbitration Act and that the procedure for which provision is made in s. 41(1) of that Act has been held to apply in the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side is shown by the case of Birks Crawford Limited v. The Ship Stromboli17. In that case the parties to a bill of lading had agreed to litigate any dispute arising thereunder by Italian law at Genoa, Italy, and Sidney Smith, D.J.A. (B.C.) adopted the order made by Sir Samuel Evans in The Cap Blanco18 and accordingly ordered that the proceedings in the action taken in the B.C. Admiralty District be stayed in order that the parties could litigate in Genoa, Italy, as they had agreed to do. In The Cap Blanco, supra, the clause in issue provided that \"any disputes concerning the interpretation of the bill of lading are to be decided in Hamburg according to German law, and it was held that such a clause was to be treated as a submission to arbitration within the meaning of s. 4 of the Arbitration Act 1889\" (now s. 4 of the Arbitration Act, 1950). In the course of his reasons for judgment, Sir Samuel Evans said:\nIn dealing with commercial documents of this kind, effect must be given, if the terms of the contract permit it, to the obvious intention and agreement of the parties. I think the parties clearly agreed that disputes under the contract should be deal with by the German tribunal, and it is right to hold the plaintiffs to their part of the agreement. Moreover, it is probably more convenient and much more inexpensive, as the disputes have to be decided according to German law, that they should be determined in the Hamburg Court.\nAlthough, therefore, this Court is invested with jurisdiction, I order that the proceedings in the action be stayed, in order that the parties may litigate in Germany, as they have agreed to do.\nAs the Exchequer Court of Canada, in the exercise of its Admiralty jurisdiction is a statutory court clothed with authority to exercise its jurisdiction in like manner and to as full an extent as the High Court of Justice in England, and as there is no practice or procedure in force in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec relating to an arbitration clause such as is here sought to be invoked, I am of opinion that the court is required to conform to the practice and procedure in such matters in Her Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England, and that this procedure is to be found in the Arbitration Act, 1950, s. 4(1).\nI agree with my brother Cartwright that this is a case in which the proper course is to stay the proceedings in the court below, and I would dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by him.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Martineau, Chauvin, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu & Tetley, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Beauregard, Brisset, Reycraft & Chauvin, Montreal.\n1 [1963] Ex.

The company prepared a mortgage and an agreement for loan for execution by the defendant owner and, in his absence, the company's agent had the owner's brother sign these documents in the owner's name. An affidavit purporting to be that of the owner, stating that neither he nor his wife had lived on the land since their marriage, was completed on each document and the certificate of acknowledgment under The Dower Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 90, was completed and signed by a commissioner of oaths, although the owner's wife was not present. Her name was signed by the brother's wife after the documents had left the commissioner's office. The mortgage was registered by the plaintiff under The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 170. The wife admitted that she was aware that her husband was applying for a loan and also that she had been told that her name had been signed on some papers. She found either a copy of the mortgage or of the agreement for loan among some papers of her husband's about a year later and then noticed her \"signature\" on it. At that time the last of the advances by the plaintiff had long since been made.\nIn an action of foreclosure the trial judge held that the owner was estopped from denying the validity of the execution of the mortgage and that both he and his wife were estopped from raising the objection that the formalities for consent to the release of dower under The Dower Act were not complied with. This judgment was reversed by a unanimous decision of the Appellate Division and the company then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSections 4(2)(a) and 12(1) of The Dower Act, which contemplate that certain legal consequences may result in some instances from a disposition by a married person of a homestead made in breach of s. 3, had no application where the disposition was not by way of transfer, but was a disposition by agreement for sale, lease, mortgage or other instrument that did not finally disposed of the interest of the married person in the homestead. Dispositions of this kind were expressly forbidden and there were no provisions in the Act which accorded them any validity. The disposition in question here was, therefore, invalid, unless it was open to the appellant successfully to contend that it was entitled to succeed on the grounds of estoppel.\nWhether the statutory requirement for a written consent to the disposition of a homesead could be released by estoppel was questionable. However, it was not necessary to determine the point here because no evidence was found on which it could be said that there was any estoppel created which could preclude the wife from asserting her right to refuse consent to the mortgage.\nThe appellant failed to establish the existence of any duty, as between the wife and itself, which would obligate her to make a disclosure to it of the circumstances which she discovered, even assuming that she then discovered the existence of what purported to be her husband's affidavit falsely stating that the lands had not been the residence of himself or her since their marriage. In the absence of such a duty, no estoppel could be established merely by remaining silent.\nThe wife was, therefore, properly entitled to set up, as against the company, the absence of any written consent given by her to a disposition of her husband's homestead by mortgage. The fact that the land was the homestead and that no written consent was given by her was fully established. Under these circumstances the mortgage executed in breach of s. 3 had no validity and the appellant's claim to enforce it failed.\nMeduk v. Soja, [1958] S.C.R. 167, followed; Pinsky v. Waas [1953] 1 S.C.B.. 399; Maritime Electric Co. Ltd. v. General Dairies Ltd., [1937] A.C. 610, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Kirby J. Appeal dismissed.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C., and J. R. Dunnet, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. Dubensky, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is as to the validity of a mortgage, dated February 12, 1957,, and registered on February 27 of that year, pursuant to The Land Titles Act, on the Northwest quarter of Section 9, Township 51, Range 7, West of the 5th Meridian, at Moon Lake, in the Province of Alberta, of which the respondent Jaroslaw Kos is the registered owner. The respondent Hazel Kos is his wife. It is conceded that this land is their homestead within the meaning of The Dower Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 90. The purported execution of this document was effected in unusual circumstances. The respondent Jaroslaw Kos commenced the construction of a garage and filling station on a portion of the quarter-section in the year 1956. On November 7 of that year he applied, in writing, to the appellant for a loan of $12,000, to assist in financing this construction, to be secured by a first mortgage upon the lands described in the application. The description contained in that document referred to:\nN.W. \u00bc (Section) \u2026..9 \u2026\u2026\u2026.(Township 51 \u2026\u2026(Range) \u2026\u2026\u2026..7 W. of 5th M., \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026registered in the Land Titles Office\u2014Edmonton \u2026\u2026\u2026..Frontage of Lot \u2026\u2026\u2026..400 \u2026\u2026\u2026..feet, Depth of Lot \u2026\u2026\u2026.400 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026feet.\nThe land thus described comprised three acres.\nThe appellant prepared, for execution by Jaroslaw Kos, a mortgage upon the whole of the quarter-section and an agreement for loan, which referred to the loan of $12,000 to be made on the security of a first mortgage and which contained covenants by the borrower regarding the exclusive sale on the premises of the appellant's products for a period of ten years.\nThese documents were brought to Moon Lake by one Froeland, an agent of the appellant, to be executed. According to the evidence of Ernest Kos, the brother of Jaroslaw Kos, Froeland inquired as to the whereabouts of Jaroslaw Kos and, finding he was absent, suggested that Ernest Kos should sign them. The evidence of Ernest Kos generally did not impress the learned trial judge as being truthful. However, it is clear from the evidence of one Jensen, a commissioner for oaths called as a witness by the appellant, that both the mortgage and the agreement were signed with the name \"Jaroslaw Kos\" in his presence and in that of Froeland. At that time, Jensen says, he thought that the signatory was, in fact, Jaroslaw Kos. In fact it appears that both documents were signed by Ernest Kos.\nAn affidavit was completed on each document in Form B, as provided in The Dower Act, purporting to be that of Jaroslaw Kos, stating that he was the mortgagor and that neither he nor his wife had resided on the mortgaged land at any time since their marriage. This affidavit bore the signature \"Jaroslaw Kos\" and that of the commissioner for oaths, Jensen. Beneath the signature \"Jaroslaw Kos\" there appeared a signature \"Hazel Kos\". This latter signature is struck out on the affidavit which is part of the mortgage form, but was not struck out on the affidavit which is a part of the agreement for loan form.\nJensen's evidence makes it quite clear that there was no one present at the time the various signatures were placed on these two documents, other than the signatory, Froeland and himself.\nOn each of the two documents the form of Consent of Spouse, as provided in Form A of The Dower Act, had been typed out ready for signature by Hazel Kos, but they were not signed by anyone.\nThe Certificate of Acknowledgment by Spouse, as provided in Form C of The Dower Act, stating that Hazel Kos was aware of the disposition, was aware of her rights regarding the homestead under The Dower Act and that she had voluntarily consented to the execution of the document, was completed and signed by Jensen. His signature to this certificate was struck out on the mortgage form, but not on the other document.\nThere was evidence to the effect that where the signatures \"Hazel Kos\" appeared on the two documents the actual signatory was Vicki Kos, the wife of Ernest Kos. She did not give evidence at the trial, nor did Froeland. It is, however, clear, from Jensen's evidence, that the signatures of \"Hazel Kos\" were not placed on the documents until after they had been taken away from his office.\nThe mortgage was registered by the appellant at the appropriate Land Titles Office. It is clear that the appellant, from the form of the instruments and through the knowledge of its agent Froeland, must have been aware that he had obtained the execution of a mortgage which carried no consent by the mortgagor's wife and that the signature \"Hazel Kos\" on the affidavit forms had been added after the affidavits had been sworn by Jensen and after the documents had left his office.\nThe appellant made advances of money, to the amount of the $12,000 applied for, either directly to Jaroslaw Kos or in the form of payments to material men. Jaroslaw Kos had been told by Ernest Kos that the latter had signed his brother's name to some papers regarding the loan. The appellant filed a caveat in respect of the agreement for loan, of which Jaroslaw Kos had some knowledge. He admitted that he had told his wife he was expecting a loan from the appellant on the garage. At no time did he advise the appellant that he had not actually signed either the mortgage or the agreement.\nHazel Kos admitted that she was aware that her husband was applying for a loan on the garage and also that she had been told by Vicki Kos that the latter had signed Hazel's name on some papers. She found either a copy of the mortgage or of the agreement for loan among some papers of her husband's about a year later and then noticed her \"signature\" on it.\nThe appellant commenced action against the respondents claiming a declaration of the amount owing under the mortgage of $13,667.85 as at March 1, 1959, with interest thereafter; judgment for such amount; and, in default, foreclosure of the mortgage.\nThe learned trial judge decided in the appellant's favour. After stating that none of the defence witnesses impressed him as being truthful and referring to the respondents, he went on to say:\nI am unable to accept their story that Ernest Kos did not sign with the knowledge and authority of Jaroslaw Kos; that they did not know the nature of the documents signed by the Defendant Ernest Kos, using the name Jaroslaw Kos; I am satisfied and find that the Defendant Jaroslaw Kos received the proceeds from the mortgage from the Plaintiff company, knowing that the company advanced them in the belief that they were secured by a mortgage executed by the said Defendant, in which the Dower Act had been properly complied with; that the said Defendant knew that the mortgage had been improperly signed by his brother Ernest Kos, using his signature, and that The Dower Act had not been properly complied with. I am further satisfied and find that the Defendant Hazel Kos shared this knowledge and acquiesced in the conduct of the Defendant Jaroslaw Kos.\nHe held that Jaroslaw Kos was estopped from denying the validity of the execution of the mortgage and that both he and Hazel Kos were estopped from raising the objection that the formalities for consent to the release of dower under The Dower Act were not complied with.\nThis judgment was reversed on appeal by unanimous decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2, which held that neither of the respondents was estopped from saying that Hazel Kos had not consented to the disposition of the homestead property made in the mortgage. In consequence, the mortgage was not valid by virtue of the provisions of The Dower Act. Personal judgment in favour of the appellant as against Jaroslaw Kos was granted. The appellant appeals from the judgment in relation to the mortgage.\nThe Dower Act of Alberta, in the form in which it now appears, was first enacted by 1948 (Alta.), c. 7. It repealed and replaced an earlier statute, R.S.A. 1942, c. 206, which had provided that a dispositon by a husband of his homestead without his wife's consent was \"absolutely null and void for all purposes\". The purpose of its enactment appears to have been to prevent conflict in principle between that protection afforded to a wife by The Dower Act and that protection afforded to a person relying upon the register under The Land Titles Act. It also extended the protection which it afforded to both spouses, and not merely to the wife.\nThe portions of The Dower Act which are relevant to this appeal are as follows:\n2. In this Act,\n(a) \"disposition\"\n(i) means a disposition by act inter vivos that is required to be executed by the owner of the land disposed of, and\n(ii) includes\n* * *\n(B) a mortgage or encumbrance intended to charge land with the payment of a sum of money, and required to be executed by the owner of the land mortgaged or encumbered,\n* * *\n(b) \"dower rights\" means all rights given by this Act to the spouse of a married person in respect of the homestead and property of the married person, and without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes\n(i) the right to prevent disposition of the homestead by withholding consent,\n* * *\n(c) \"homestead\" means a parcel of land\n(i) on which the dwelling house occupied by the owner of the parcel as his residence is situated, and\n(ii) that consists of (B) not more than one quarter section of land other than land in a city, town or village;\n* * *\n3. (1) No married person shall by act inter vivos make a disposition of the homestead of the married person whereby any interest of the married person will vest or may vest in any other person at any time\n(a) during the life of the married person, or\n(b) during the life of the spouse of the married person living at the date of the disposition,\nunless the spouse consents thereto in writing, or unless a judge has made an order dispensing with the consent of the spouse as provided for in section 11.\n(2) A married person who makes any such disposition of a homestead without the consent in writing of the spouse of the married person or without an order dispensing with the consent of the spouse is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years.\n4. (1) When land becomes the homestead of a married person it continues to be his homestead within the meaning of this Act until the land ceases to be a homestead pursuant to subsection (2), notwithstanding the acquisition of another homestead or a change of residence of the married person.\n(2) Land ceases to be the homestead of a married person\n(a) when a transfer of the land by that married person is registered in the proper land titles office,\n(b) when a release of dower rights by the spouse of that married person is registered in the proper land titles office as provided in section 8, or\n(c) when a judgment for damages against that married person is obtained by the spouse of the married person pursuant to sections 12 to 18 in respect of any land disposed of by the married person and is registered in the proper land titles office.\n12. (1) A married person who without obtaining\n(a) the consent in writing of the spouse of the married person, or\n(b) an order dispensing with the consent of the spouse, makes a disposition to which a consent is required by this Act and that results in the registration of the title in the name of any other person, is liable to the spouse in an action for damages.\n* * *\n13. (1) Where a spouse recovers a judgment against the married person pursuant to section 12, the married person upon producing proof satisfactory to the Registrar that the judgment has been paid in full may register a certified copy of the judgment in the proper land titles office.\n(2) Upon the registration of the certified copy of the judgment the spouse ceases to have any dower rights in any lands registered or to be registered in the name of the married person and all such lands cease to be homesteads for the purposes of this Act.\nThe effect of these sections is that a married person is expressly forbidden under penalty from disposing of the homestead of that married person without the written consent of the spouse. If, however, notwithstanding the pro- hibition contained in s. 3, a transfer of the homestead land by that married person is registered in the proper land titles office, the land ceases to be the homestead of that married person. In such event, the spouse is given a right to recover damages against the married person who made the wrongful disposition. If a judgment is recovered in such an action, and paid in full, a certified copy of the judgment may be registered in the proper land titles office, and, thereafter, the spouse who recovered the judgment ceases to have any dower rights in any lands registered or to be registered in the name of the married person.\nIt must be noted immediately that, although the apparent purpose of The Dower Act of 1948 was to bring the law as to dower into harmony with the basic principles of The Land Titles Act, the provisions of s. 4(2)(a) and of s. 12(1) are limited to the situation which occurs where a transfer is registered under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, thus resulting in the creation of a new title in the name of the transferee. These provisions of The Dower Act, which contemplate that legal consequences may result in some instances from a disposition by a married person of a homestead made in breach of s. 3, have no application where the disposition is not by way of transfer, but is a disposition by agreement for sale, lease, mortgage, encumbrance or other instrument that does not finally dispose of the interest of the married person in the homestead. Dispositions of this kind are expressly forbidden and there are no provisions in the Act which accord to them any validity, nor which would afford the non-consenting spouse any remedy in damages.\nThe effect of s. 3 upon an agreement for sale was considered by Estey J., giving the opinion of himself and Kerwin J. (as he then was), in Pinsky v. Wass3. He expressed the view that, under the general rule, a contract made in breach of a statutory prohibition would be void, but that, in the light of the provisions contained in ss. 4 and 12, contemplating the registration of a transfer, it was indicated that the Legislature intended that an agreement for sale made in breach of the prohibition should be voidable rather than void.\nThe other members of the Court did not express any opinion with respect to this point. In 1958 the effect of s. 3 was again considered by this Court in relation to an agreement for sale, in Meduk v. Soja4. In that case a married woman, the registered owner of land, accepted an offer made to her to purchase the lands. Her husband did not consent in writing to the agreement. He was asked by the real estate agent, in the presence of the prospective purchasers, whether he would sign the agreement and said that he would not, since the property belonged to his wife and she could do what she pleased with it.\nCartwright J., who delivered the unanimous decision of the Court, said at p. 175:\nNo doubt the acceptance by Bessie Meduk of the respondents' offer would have formed a contract if the property had not been the homestead, but, since it was so, the making of the agreement by her without the consent in writing of her spouse was expressly forbidden by s. 3(1) of the Act and unless John Meduk did consent in writing, her acceptance was ineffective to form a contract.\nIn my opinion the same reasoning applies in relation to a disposition of land by way of mortgage, which is made in breach of s, 3. Such a disposition is expressly forbidden by the statute. As previously pointed out, there is nothing in the statute which would purport to give such a disposition any validity whatever. The disposition in question here is, therefore, invalid, unless it is open to the appellant successfully to contend that it is entitled to succeed on the grounds of estoppel.\nWhether the statutory requirement for a written consent to the disposition of a homestead could be released by estoppel is, I think, questionable (Maritime Electric Co. Ltd. v. General Dairies Ltd.5). However, as in the case of Meduk v. Soja, supra, I do not think it is necessary to determine the point in this case, because I do not find any evidence on which it could be said that there was any estoppel created in the present case which would preclude Hazel Kos from asserting her right to refuse consent to the mortgage.\nThe position is that the appellant registered a mortgage upon lands, which are now admitted to be homestead property, knowing that no consent had been given to its registration by the wife of the registered owner. Reliance was placed by the appellant on the affidavit purporting to have been taken by Jaroslaw Kos, stating that neither he nor his wife had lived on the land since their marriage, but no representation to that effect was made in such affidavit by Hazel Kos. It is clear that the purported signature of Hazel Kos to that affidavit could not have been made when the affidavit was sworn and that Froeland must have been fully aware of that fact. Furthermore, the name \"Hazel Kos\" was struck out from that affidavit attached to the mortgage and it must be presumed that it was struck out before the mortgage was registered.\nThe fact that Hazel Kos knew that her husband was applying for a loan on the garage, that she knew that her name had been placed on some documents by Vicki Kos and that about a year later she discovered her name, either on the mortgage form or on the agreement form, cannot be construed as any representation by her to the appellant that the lands covered by the mortgage were not the homestead of her husband.\nI am extremely doubtful whether, upon the evidence adduced in this case, it would be possible to bring home to Hazel Kos actual knowledge, at any relevant time, that a purported affidavit had been made to the effect that the land in question had never been occupied since the marriage by either herself or her husband. The only basis upon which it can be suggested that she obtained any such knowledge would be the evidence as to her discovery, about a year after the mortgage was completed, among her husband's papers, of a paper that looked like a mortgage. That discovery was made at a time long after the last of the advances by the appellant had been made, so that, even if she did acquire that knowledge at that time, any representation which might be inferred from non-disclosure of that knowledge to the appellant did not cause it to act to its detriment in consequence thereof.\nIn any event, it is my view that the appellant has failed to establish the existence of any duty, as between Hazel Kos and itself, which would obligate her to make a disclosure to it of the circumstances which she discovered, even assuming that she then discovered the existence of what purported to be her husband's affidavit falsely stating that the lands had not been the residence of himself or her since their marriage. In the absence of such a duty, no estoppel can be established merely by remaining silent. In my opinion, therefore, the respondent Hazel Kos was properly entitled to set up, as against the appellant, the absence of any written consent given by her to a disposition of her husband\u2019s homestead by mortgage. The fact that the land was the homestead and that no written consent was given by her is fully established. Under these circumstances the mortgage executed in breach of s. 3 has no validity and the appellant\u2019s claim to enforce it must fail.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Kane, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Dubensky & Hughson, Edmonton.\n1 (1964), 46 W.W.R. 36, 36 D.L.R.

Sedgwick, [1964] S.C.R. 177\nDate: 1963-12-16\nThe Minister of National Revenue Appellant;\nand\nJoseph Sedgwick Respondent.\n1963: November 19; 1963: December 16.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income\u2014Partnership\u2014Advances to stock-broker for share of profits\u2014Termination of agreement\u2014Profit in respect of current fiscal year, not yet ended, set at negotiated amount\u2014Whether negotiated amount income or capital receipt\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 6(1)(c), 15(1),(2).\nIn 1949, the respondent and four others entered into an agreement with P to advance him funds with which to purchase a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange and to provide working capital for his stock brokerage business. It was provided that the \"lenders\" would receive a percentage of the net profits of the business but no interest. The agreement further provided that no partnership should be deemed to be created. However, the trial judge held that a partnership was constituted, and this finding was not challenged before this Court.\nAs this agreement was in conflict with the rules of the Stock Exchange, it was terminated on February 1,1956, two months before the end of the then fiscal year. P agreed to pay the lenders a sum of $550,000, made up of (1) the total of all advances, (2) the increase in value of the seat on the Exchange, (3) the share of the lenders in the cash surrender value of an insurance policy, (4) their share in the net profits of the business for the fiscal year ending two months hence and fixed at $300,000, and (5) a share in the goodwill of the business. The Minister sought to assess as profit from a partnership the respondent's share of the 1300,000. The respondent argued that this amount was part of the consideration for the sale of his partnership interest and as such was a capital receipt. The assessment was confirmed by the Tax Appeal Board but was set aside by the Exchequer Court. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the assessment restored.\nPer Abbott, Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.: Under ss. 6(1)(c) and 15(1) and (2) of The Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, the respondent became liable to tax for the year 1956 in respect of his share of the partnership income (even though not withdrawn) for the fiscal period of the partnership which ended in 1956. That period ended when the partnership was terminated on February 1, but the partnership profita were determined by the agreement up to the end of the normal fiscal period ending March 31. There was no evidence to establish that his share of income was less than that established by the termination agreement. This agreement could not be construed as being one for the sale of interests in a partnership. It was rather an agreement for the winding-up of the partnership, which was necessitated by the rules of the Stock Exchange. In essence, the lenders withdrew from the business the capital value of that which they had provided in the form of capital assets and were paid out the profits which they had acquired out of the operation of the business. The respondent was therefore liable to income tax in respect of his share of the partnership profits.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: Some of the amounts set out in the termination agreement were merely negotiated or estimated. The respondent never became entitled to receive any income from the operation of the partnership during the fiscal year 1956 because, by the termination agreement, the lenders conveyed to P all their rights to the profits for that year's operation and all the rights they had to any other assets of the partnership. The termination agreement was not a mere dissolution of the partnership but a sale by all the partners of their interests in all the partnership assets. The sale price must therefore be considered as a capital receipt and the same result applied even when the sale price was calculated by including as part thereof an estimate of the already earned but undistributed profits. It follows that no part of the purchase price should have been included in the respondent's income.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Ritchie D.J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, setting aside the respondent's assessment for income tax. Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.\nE. J. Cross and P. M. Troop, for the appellant.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., and H. Sedgwick, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by Martland J.:\u2014On March 31, 1949, the respondent, along with four other parties, entered into an agreement with John Edward Purcell, pursuant to which they advanced funds to Purcell to enable him to purchase a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange and to provide working capital for his stock brokerage business. It is conceded that the respondent's interest under this agreement was held by him on behalf of another person as to one-half of the respondent's interest, so that his actual interest was a one-tenth interest.\nThe advances made by the parties to the agreement (who were therein described as \"the Lenders\" and who will, for purposes of convenience, be thus described hereinafter) were described as being \"by way of loan\", but no interest was payable to them by Purcell. Instead, the agreement provided that each of the Lenders would receive a percentage of the net profits of the business. It was provided that Purcell should receive an annual payment for his services, plus 10 per cent of the net profits of the business. He agreed not to engage in any other business and to devote his whole time and attention to the business. He also agreed to obey all lawful directions of the Lenders in writing. He undertook to hold the Stock Exchange seat, and any other assets acquired by reason of the operation of the business, in trust for the Lenders.\nBy letter, dated March 31, 1953, to Purcell, the respondent agreed that the provisions with respect to the giving of directions to Purcell by the Lenders and the holding of his Stock Exchange seat in trust be deleted. Similar letters were written by the other Lenders. The reason for the deletion of these provisions was that they conflicted with the policy of the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nOne clause of the agreement provided that nothing in the agreement should be deemed to constitute the Lenders as partners in the brokerage business. However, the learned trial judge2 has held that, notwithstanding this provision, a partnership was constituted by virtue of the provisions of the agreement and this finding was not challenged on the appeal to this Court. The appeal was argued on the basis that a partnership was created.\nThe business prospered and profits were earned in each year from 1950 to 1955 inclusive. In 1955, however, the Board of Governors of the Toronto Stock Exchange ruled that, as the Lenders were not actively engaged in the business, they could not take a share of the net profits of the business and the profit-sharing arrangement was required to be terminated by the end of that year.\nIn consequence of this, on February 1, 1956, a second agreement was made between Purcell and the Lenders or their successors in interest, referred to in this agreement as \"the Creditors\". It recited the ruling of the Board of Governors of the Toronto Stock Exchange and further, notwithstanding the letters regarding the deletions from the first agreement, recited that the Stock Exchange seat was held in trust for the Lenders. The agreement then went on to provide:\n1. It is mutually agreed:\n(a) That to date the advances of money to Purcell by the Creditors amount to $112,500.\n(b) That the increase in the market value of the said seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange is fixed at $63,000.\n(c) That the share of the Creditors in the cash surrender value of the insurance policy is hereby fixed at $4,850.\n(d) That the share of the Creditors in the net profits of the business for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1956, is hereby fixed at $300,000.\n(e). That the share to which the Creditors are entitled in the good will of the business is hereby fixed at $69,650.\nTotal $550,000.\nThe agreement stated that the original agreement should be terminated by mutual consent, that the Creditors would no longer be entitled to share in the net profits of the business and that, as consideration for the termination of the original agreement, the giving up of their interest in the Stock Exchange seat and in the physical assets of the business and their right to share in the profits of the business, Purcell would pay to the Creditors a total amount of $550,000. Provision was then made for the terms of payment of this sum of $550,000. $150,000 was to be paid by Purcell by April 15, 1956. The balance of $400,000, until paid, was to carry interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, payable quarterly, the first such payment falling due on the last day of June 1956.\nThe respondent was assessed for income tax for the year 1956 in respect of the amount of $30,000, being his one- tenth interest in the $300,000 referred to in para. (d) of cl. 1 of the agreement recited above.\nThe assessment was confirmed by the Tax Appeal Board but, on appeal, the Exchequer Court3 held that, although the relationship between Purcell and the Lenders was that of partners, the real effect of the second agreement was that Purcell had agreed to purchase from the Lenders their interest in the partnership for a total consideration of $550,000. It was further held that this consideration must be regarded as a whole and that the recipients thereof would be in receipt of a capital payment. It was held that the fact that the consideration included an item associated with profits did not affect its character or quality.\nThe governing provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, are the following:\n6. Without restricting the generality of section 3, there shall be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n* * *\n(c) the taxpayer's income from a partnership or syndicate for the year whether or not he has withdrawn it during the year;\n15. (1) Where a person is a partner or an individual is a proprietor of a business, his income from the partnership or business for a taxation year shall be deemed to be his income from the partnership or business for the fiscal period or periods that ended in the year.\n(2) Where an individual was a member of a partnership the affairs of which were wound up during a fiscal period of the partnership by reason of the death or withdrawal of a partner or by reason of a new member being taken into the partnership, for the purpose of subsection (1), the fiscal period may, if the taxpayer so elects, be deemed to have ended at the time it would have ended if the affairs of the partnership had not been so wound up.\nTheir effect is that income from a partnership must be included in a taxpayer's income for a taxation year, whether or not he has withdrawn it during that year. Such income in a taxation year is his share of the partnership income for the fiscal period ending in that year. If a partnership is wound up during a fiscal period by reason of the death or withdrawal of a partner, the taxpayer may elect to have the fiscal period of the partnership deemed to end at the time it would have ended if the partnership affairs had not been wound up.\nApplying these provisions to the present case, the respondent would become liable to tax for the year 1956 in respect of his share of the partnership income (even though not withdrawn by him) for the fiscal period of the partnership which ended in 1956. That period ended when the partnership was wound up on the date of the second agreement, February 1, 1956, but the partnership profits were determined by the agreement itself up to the end of the normal fiscal period ending March 31, 1956. If the respondent were entitled to invoke subs. (2) of s. 15, that is the date at which the profits would be ascertained.\nUnless he were able to establish that his income from the partnership was less than that established by the agreement, it would appear that he is liable for income tax in respect of it (Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue4). No evidence was led to establish that his share of income was less.\nCounsel for the respondent contended that these profits were not taxable in the respondent's hands, but in the hands of Purcell, because the respondent, by the agreement, sold his interest in the partnership business to Purcell and the whole of the payment to which the respondent became entitled' would be a receipt of capital. He submitted that the fact that the price was determined, in part, by the share of the Lenders in the partnership profits for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1956, does not alter the quality of the payment to be made to them by Purcell. He cited the statement of Lord Macmillan in Van Den Berghs, Limited v. Clark5:\nBut even if a payment is measured by annual receipts, it is not necessarily itself an item of income. As Lord Buckmaster pointed out in the case of Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue ((1922) S.C. (H.L.) 112): \"There is no relation between the measure that is used for the purpose of calculating a particular result and the quality of the figure that is arrived at by means of the test.\"\nIn my opinion this argument fails and I am unable, with respect, to agree with the conclusions reached by the learned trial judge because I cannot construe the agreement of February 1, 1956, as being one for the sale of interests in a partnership. It is rather an agreement for the winding-up of the partnership, which had been necessitated by the decision of the Board of Governors of the Toronto Stock Exchange. As a result of that decision, the Lenders were thereafter precluded from sharing in the profits of the business. That right they gave up in the agreement because they had been compelled to do so. The agreement determined the amount of the advances by the Lenders to Purcell (out of which the seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange had been purchased), the increase in value of that seat, the cash surrender value of a certain insurance policy, the value of the goodwill of the business and the amount of the Lenders' share in the profits of the business for the year ending March 31, 1956. Purcell agreed to pay to the Lenders the total of those various amounts, and the $400,000 balance remaining after the payment of $150,000 is referred to in the agreement as a \"loan\", which bore interest as in the agreement provided. Essentially, therefore, the Lenders were withdrawing from the business the capital value of that which they had provided to it in the form of capital assets and were to be paid out the profits which they had acquired out of the operation of the business. The character of each of the items described in cl. 1 was not altered by the fact that they were totalled at the end of the clause.\nThis being so, in my opinion the respondent is liable to income tax in respect of his share of the partnership profits, as determined by cl. 1(d) of that agreement.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the assessment restored with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court.\nSpence J. (dissenting):\u2014I have read the reasons of my brother Martland herein and I wish to adopt his outline of the relevant facts.\nThe learned Exchequer Court Judge6 found that the arrangement carried on between the Creditors and Mr. Purcell under the agreement of March 31, 1949 (ex. 1) was a partnership and neither party disputed that finding in this Court.\nWhen the respondent was absent in England, his secretary, as was her usual course, made up his income tax return form T.1 General and a photostat copy thereof was filed as ex. A upon the trial before Ritchie D.J. in the Exchequer Court. In the schedule attached to the said income tax return there was shown in the recapitulation of income an item which read \"Purcell invest account, $32,000\" and written opposite the words \"Purcell investment account\" are the words \"T.20 in file of Jack Purcell\". There was no explanation at the trial as to who endorsed the last mentioned memoranda on the form. The Minister of National Revenue issued a re-assessment notice to the respondent under date of March 5, 1958, adding to the tax assessment the sum of $697.57 plus $33 interest, a total of $728.57. The respondent filed notice of objection to that re-assessment under date of March 31,1958, and in a \"Statement of Facts and Statement of Reasons for Objection\" attached thereto took the position for the first time that as to $30,000 of the sum of $32,000 referred to, supra, the respondent received on his own account only the sum of $15,000 and not $30,000, and that that receipt was a capital receipt and should not be taxed as income. It will be seen that the sum of $15,000 is 10 per cent of the sum of $150,000 which was, by virtue of the agreement of February 1,1956, to be paid immediately to the \"Creditors\" and the respondent was entitled to 10 per cent of the amounts payable under that agreement.\nThe discussions preceding the execution of the agreement of February 1, 1956, are dealt with in the evidence of the respondent at trial. It should be noted that the respondent was the only witness called at the trial and therefore there is no denial of any evidence given by him. At p. 37, line 21, the respondent said:\nThe agreement sets it out in detail as to how the $550,000 was reached.\nMr. Cross: Do you remember the figure of $550,000 was reached; was there any audit of the books of Jack Purcell made?\nA. I don't remember if there was any audit but I do recall his auditor attended one or more than one meeting and gave some sort of estimate as to how much money would be there but I don't think he would be able to make an audit at the end of December because his year ended in March and no one would know what he would do. It was an indication, not an audit. It couldn't have been an audited figure\u2014$300,000 is obviously an error\u2014.\nQ. Had there been a quick audit by the Stock Exchange shortly before that?\nA. I don't know, I couldn't tell you. I know they do a sub-audit but I don't know\u2014. I paid no attention to the business. I was in the office twice; once at Christmas time and\u2014.\nQ. If the lenders were partners, you say they were not, and if they were, as partners, entitled to profits at the time the agreement of February 1st, 1956, was entered into, you do not dispute the amount of those profits would be $300,000?\nA. I don't dispute or deny.\nThen, at p. 38, line 21:\nHis Lordship: And then on this seat, $30,000 profits for period. It does not show what period. I have the fixed impression from the evidence I have heard that this was an end agreement in consideration of the lenders relinquishing any rights, any further right, for a negotiated settlement.\nThe Witness: That was the point.\nMr. Cross: I think the $550,000\u2014.\nHis Lordship: The $550,000 made up of the other items I have mentioned, an amount of $112,500 and then the cash surrender value, the increase of the Stock Exchange seat and then those items total $150,000. Is that right?\nThe Witness: Yes, my lord, you put it perfectly and that is the situation. It was an end agreement and the figure of $300,000 may, for all I know, bear some relation to some profit that had been earned but it was an agreed on figure, it is not an accounting figure.\nHis Lordship: I think it is a negotiated figure.\nThe Witness: A negotiated figure.\nI have come to the conclusion that some of the amounts set out in para. (1) of the agreement of February 1, 1956, which total $550,000 must have been on the basis of negotiation or estimate. Paragraph (a), the advances made by the Creditors to Mr. Purcell, $112,500, is a fixed and easily ascertainable item. Paragraph (b), the increase in the market value of the seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange, $63,000, can only be an estimate or judgment of what the seat would be worth if it had been sold on the market on that day. Such an estimate might well be based on the last similar sale of such a seat but the estimate might be higher than or lower than the amount of the sale price in the last previous sale depending on the difference in stock market conditions between the date of the 'last previous sale and February 1, 1956. Paragraph (c), the share of the Creditors in the cash surrender value of the insurance policy, ($4,850) is, of course, a figure which could be ascertained exactly. Paragraph (d), the one in question in this appeal and which reads \"That the share of the Creditors in the net profits of the business for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1956, is hereby fixed at 1300,000\" must be considered in the light of the evidence given at trial part of which has been set out above. There was no division of profits during the course of a fiscal year in this partnership and there was no audit which would enable anyone to say with any exactness what the profits would be at the end of the fiscal year March 31, 1956. One need only consider the nature of the business of the partnership to understand how inaccurate an estimate might be of the profits for the year when that estimate was made two full months prior to the end of the fiscal year. In a stock brokerage business those two final months might have been disastrous so that the profits could have been reduced drastically or they may have been very profitable so that the profits would far exceed the estimate. It would appear, from one question put to the respondent upon the trial, that the profits actually much exceeded the figure of $300,000. The share of the goodwill to which the Creditors were entitled, $69,650, again illustrates the negotiated or estimated character of the various items set out in these paragraphs as no one could put an exact amount to include a $50 item, upon such a nebulous asset as goodwill. It is quite evident that para. (a), the advances, and (c), the cash surrender value of the insurance policy, were the only fixed amounts in the calculation and that the other three paras. (b), (d) and (e) were all negotiated or estimated figures to reach the total of $550,000. The Minister has assessed the tax upon the item of $30,000 as being profits to which the respondent was entitled for the operation of the business in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1956, and which would eventually have been paid to him apart from the agreement made on February 1, 1956. The Minister relies on s. 6(c) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and s. 15(1) and (2) of the said statute. Certainly, if the respondent had or was entitled to receive an income from the operation of this partnership in the year 1956, he must pay tax upon that income. The position, however, of the respondent is that he never did become entitled to receive any income from the operation of the partnership during the fiscal year 1956, because on February 1, 1956, by the agreement of that date he and his fellow Creditors conveyed to Mr. Purcell all of their rights to the profits for that year's operations and all the rights they had to any other assets of the partnership.\nBy para. 2 of the said agreement:\nIt is further agreed that the Original Agreement shall be terminated by mutual consent of the Parties hereto for the reasons set out in the third recital hereof, and that the Creditors shall no longer be entitled to share in the net profits of the business. As consideration for the Creditors terminating the Original Agreement and giving up their interest in the Stock Exchange seat, and in the physical assets of the business as aforesaid, Purcell covenants and agrees to pay to each of the Creditors the amount set opposite his name below, totalling in all $550,000, payable at the times hereinafter set forth:\nI am of the opinion that what the Creditors and Mr. Purcell accomplished by the agreement (ex. 3) dated February 1, 1956, was not a mere dissolution of the previously existing partnership but a sale by all of the partners except Purcell of their interests in all of the partnership assets to Purcell. I am of the opinion that a dissolution of a partnership necessarily implies a division of the assets of the partnership, after payment of its creditors, amongst the partners in proportion of their respective shares in the partnership. In the present case, there was no attempt at realization of the partnership assets and no division of the assets either by money or in specie between the former partners who were designated in the said agreement (ex. 3) as Creditors, nor does there seem to have been even an accurate evaluation of those assets. The business of the partnership was carried on exactly as before by Mr. Purcell who had been prior to that date the manager and one of the partners of the partnership business and who thereafter became the sole proprietor subject to the payment of the unpaid portion of the purchase price. It is true that this purchase price was arrived at by taking the actual value of some of the partnership assets and an estimate of the monetary value of other of the partnership assets but this was merely a method of calculating a sale price. I am therefore of the opinion that the recital of the sum of $300,000 as being the fixed share of the Creditors in the net profits of the business for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 1956, is merely a recital of how one of the items used to determine the sale price was arrived at.\nIt would appear from three cases that such a device for the calculation of a purchase price cannot change the fact that the actual price calculated and paid was a capital receipt and not receipt of income. In Glenboig Union Fire Clay Co. v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue7, the House of Lords was dealing with a transaction whereby a railway company paid to the taxpayer the sum of \u00a315,316 as compensation for their foregoing the right to remove clay from certain of their lands adjacent to the line of the railway company. It was said and not disputed that that amount was assessed by considering that the fire clay to which it related could be worked only for some two and a half years before it would be exhausted and that the amount represented the actual profit for two and a half years had the fire clay been worked, which was, under the agreement, received in one lump sum, and that therefore the amount should be treated as profits. Lord Buckmaster said, at p.115:\nIt is unsound to consider the fact that the measure adopted for the purpose of seeing what the amount should be was based on considering what were the profits that would have been earned. That no doubt is a perfectly exact and accurate way of determining the compensation, for it is now well settled that the compensation payable in such circumstances is the full value of the minerals that are to be left unworked, less the cost of working, and that is of course the profit that would be obtained were they in fact worked. But there is no relation between the measure that is used for the purpose of calculating a particular result and the quality of the figure that is arrived at by means of the test. I am unable to regard this sum of money as anything but capital money, and I think therefore it was erroneously entered in the balance-sheet ending 31st August 1913 as a profit on the part of the Fireclay Company.\nIt is true that decision dealt with the foregoing of profits which were to be earned in the future by a lump sum payment while the present case deals with forgoing profits which were payable in the future although jointly earned in the past. But again I stress that on February 1, 1956, neither the respondent nor any of his fellow Creditors were entitled to any profits and that the $300,000 was only an estimate of what had been earned during the past 10 months and would have been earned during the following two months.\nRutherford v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue8 dealt with the situation where on October 31, 1921, one partner who had been entitled to 18\/64ths of the profits of a partnership retired and on December 7, 1921, by agreement it was provided that the retiring partner should receive \u00a31,500 \"in full settlement of his whole share and interest in the profits of the firm for the year ending the 31st of December 1921\" and further decreasing amounts in subsequent years. The remaining partner who up to October 31, 1921, was entitled to 36\/64ths of the profits attempted to take the sum of \u00a31,500 which was payable to the retiring person from the firm's profits before his own share was calculated for taxation. The learned President, Clyde, said at p. 692:\nThe sum of \u00a31,500 was made payable to the retiring partner independently of what might turn out to be the profits actually made in the current year, either as a whole, or during that part of it which preceded the date of dissolution. It was nothing but the consideration in respect of which the retiring partner gave up any right he might have had in the profits made in that part of the year; and it would have remained a debt due to him by the remaining partners, personally, even if no profits at all had been shown on a balance struck by the remaining partners\u2014whether at the date of dissolution or at the end of the current year.\nAnd at p. 693:\n(2) The sum of \u00a31,500 was not a share of those profits but the price or consideration paid by the remaining partners for a discharge of any claims on the part of the retiring partner to participate in them.\nLord Blackburn said at p. 697:\nThe fair construction of the agreement does not appear to me to provide any justification for treating this sum as a charge upon the profits. In my opinion, it must be regarded as a price paid to the retiring partner for his share in the profits and a sum for which the remaining partners remained liable irrespective altogether of what the profits of the firm for the year might prove to amount to.\nIt may be noted that that decision dealt only with payment for an agreement to forgo a share of profits to which the taxpayer would become entitled in the future, such profits having been earned in the past, while in the present case, the sum of $550,000 payable to the Creditors was for the discharge of not only the Creditors' rights to the profits which would, on March 31, 1956, be determined as having been earned in the fiscal year at that time, but to release all of the Creditors' other claims to partnership assets, and the $300,000 (item (d)) was merely one of the items included in the calculation to arrive at the said sum of $550,000. I am of the opinion, therefore, that the facts in the present case are more favourable to the contention of the respondent than were those in Rutherford v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue.\nIn Van Den Berghs, Ltd. v. Clark9, the House of Lords considered a payment of \u00a3450,000 by a Dutch company to an English company made in the year 1927, to settle the claim of the English company, the appellant for a share in the profits of the Dutch company during the First War and for the release of their right to a share in the profits which might be earned by the Dutch company in the years following and up to 1940. The English company had been entitled to those shares of profits up to the year 1940 under a series of agreements between the two companies. The appellant had, in calculating the amount it should claim in the arbitration to fix the amount due between the companies, worked out a sum of \u00a3449,042 which it alleged the Dutch company owed them already. The special commissioners held that the \u00a3450,000 was paid in respect of the pooling agreements and must be brought in for the purpose of arriving at the balance of the profits and gains of the appellant for the year ending December 31, 1927. Lord Macmillan said, at p. 442:\nBut even if payment is measured by annual receipts, it is not necessarily itself an item of income. As Lord Buckmaster pointed out in the case of the Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 1922 S.C. (H.L.) 112, 115, \"There is no relation between the measure that is used for the purpose of calculating a particular result and the quality of the figure that is arrived at by means of the test.\"\nIf the arrangement arrived at by virtue of the agreement of February 1, 1956, (ex. 3) is, as I have found it to be, a sale of partnership assets by the various partners to the continuing partner and included in those assets the right of the retiring partners to share in any profits of the partnership, either those which were earned before the agreement or those which would be earned thereafter, then I am of the opinion that the authorities quoted require the sale price to be considered as a capital receipt, and I am of the opinion that if, when the sale price was calculated by including as part thereof an estimate of the already earned but undistributed profits, the same result applies. Counsel for the Minister cited in reply the Commissioner of Taxation v. Melrose10, a decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. That was an appeal from the decision of a magistrate of the Court of Review. Melrose was the owner of 4\/7ths shares in a partnership operating a very large agricultural enterprise. The partnership agreement provided for the division of profits on June 30 annually. On June 24, 1920, Melrose delivered \u00bcth of his interest to each of three members of his family and then attempted to resist the claim of the Commissioner of Taxation for tax on the profits which would be payable upon those 3\/7ths interest. McMillan C.J. said, at p. 25:\nIt seems to me that it is a very clear case. During the year in question considerable profits accrued, to which, when they had been ascertained, the present respondent would have been entitled. Those were the profits which he would have got from the business. But a few days before the time for taking the accounts he handed over portion of his share of the partnership profits to different members of his family. It seems to me that if profits have once accrued, as they did in this case, although the actual amount of them had not been ascertained, there is taxable income upon which the Commissioner is entitled to require the usual amount to be paid.\nThe decision of the Court does not cite any authority nor is any authority mentioned in the notes of the argument. The transfer of the shares to members of his family was evidently gratuitous. I am unwilling to accept this decision in view of the decision of the House of Lords in Rutherford v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and Van Den Berghs Ltd. v. Clark, supra. In my view, Mr. Purcell and the Creditors, i.e., his former partners, made an agreement whereby Purcell for a price, bought the physical assets of the partnership, and any rights which his partners might have in the future, whether that future be near or far, to obtain profits from the operation of the partnership business. The purchase price was a capital receipt and no part of it should have been included in the respondent's income. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Spence J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. S.

They argued that the indictment that they conspired to effect the unlawful purpose of obtaining from a constable of the Ontario Provincial Police information which it was his duty not to divulge, did not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code of Canada.\nHeld: Assuming that this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application, it should be dismissed.\nThe purpose alleged in the charge was an unlawful purpose. The fact that the purpose or the breach of trust contemplated by the conspirators, whether as their ultimate aim or only as a means to it, could be, if carried into effect, punishable either under s. 103 of the Criminal Code or under s. 60 of the Ontario Provincial Police Act, manifested the unlawfulness of the purpose within the meaning of the law attending Common Law conspiracies.\nAPPLICATION by two of the appellants for a rehearing of this appeal following the judgment rendered by this Court1. Appeal dismissed.\nC. Thomson, for the applicants.\nC. Powell, contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014On June 24, 1963, this Court dismissed an appeal2 entered by Robert J. Wright, Joseph P. McDermott and Vincent B. Feeley against their conviction on the following charge:\n2. And further that the said Robert J. Wright, Joseph P. McDermott and Vincent Bernard Feeley between the 1st day of January, 1960 and the 1st day of July, 1960 in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit:\nTo obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 408(2).\nSome six months later, in December 1963, both McDermott and Feeley, purporting to be so entitled under rule 61 of the Rules of this Court, applied to this Court for an order granting a rehearing of the appeal on the ground that the above indictment did not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code of Canada. Having heard and considered the submissions of counsel for the applicants, the Court, indicating that reasons would later be delivered, declared that, assuming it had jurisdiction to entertain the application, the ground upon which it was made was ill-founded. The application was dismissed.\nThe charge is laid under s. 408(2) of the Criminal Code providing that:\n408.(2) Every one who conspires with any one\n(a) to effect an unlawful purpose or,\n(b) to effect a lawful purpose by unlawful means,\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\nThe argument made in support of the application is centred upon the meaning to be ascribed to the term \"unlawful purpose\". It was contended that the unlawful purpose contemplated in the section must be one which, if carried into effect, would constitute an act declared to be criminal by the Criminal Code of Canada and that, as the purpose alleged in the charge was made unlawful under s. 60 of The Police Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 298, the charge did not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code. The case of Regina v. Sommervill and Kaylich3 was particularly relied on.\nWhile marginal notes in the body of an Act form no part of the Act, the marginal note appended to s. 408(2) accurately designates as \"Common Law conspiracy\" the offence described in this section which, as defined by Lord Denman in Rex v. Jones4, consists in a combination \"either to do an unlawful act, or a lawful act by unlawful means\". Common Law conspiracy is one of the few Common Law offences which, upon the 1954 revision of the Criminal Code, Parliament thought advisable to perpetuate by codification. Martin's Criminal Code 1955 ed., p. 35. Hence the law pertaining to this offence, its elements and the wide embracing import of the term \"unlawful purpose\", remains unchanged. While the term, as shown in Harrison The Law of Conspiracy, encompasses more than criminal offences, sufficient it is to say, for the purpose of this case, that the purpose alleged in the charge, to wit, the obtention from a constable of information which it is his duty not to divulge, is an unlawful purpose. In the language of Lord Mansfield, in Rex v. Bembridge5:\nA man accepting an office of trust concerning the public, especially if attended by profit, is answerable criminally to the King for misbehaviour in his office.\nThe fact that the purpose or the breach of trust contemplated by the conspirators, whether as their ultimate aim or only as a means to it, be, if carried into effect, punishable either under s. 103 of the Criminal Code (vide Rex v. McMorran6) or under s. 60 of the Ontario Provincial Police Act, adequately manifests the unlawfulness of the purpose within the meaning of the law attending Common Law conspiracies.\nWith deference, I am unable to agree with the decision rendered in Regina v. Sommervill and Kaylich, supra, and to accept as well founded the ground alleged in support of this application which, as indicated above, has been dismissed at the issue of the hearing.\nApplication dismissed.\n1 [1963] S.C.R. 539.\n2 [1963] S.C.R. 539.\n3 (1963), 2 C.C.C. 178.\n4 (1832), 4 B. & A. 345, 110 E.R. 485.\n5 (1783), 3 Doug.

II, c. 102\u2014By-laws 1920 and 2414 of the City of Montreal.\nIn 1953 the appellants acquired a vacant emplacement in Montreal where the building of multifamily dwellings was permitted by the zoning by-law then in force. In 1958 the City adopted a by-law restricting to single-family dwellings the type of building that could be erected in the locality. In 1961 the appellants sought to resort to the procedure of arbitration provided for under para. 44(a) of art. 300 of the City Charter for the recovery of an indemnity for loss of vested rights. It was conceded that the appellants never obtained nor sought to obtain a building permit nor did they make any subdivision, opening of streets or similar works with respect to this land. It was argued by the City that the appellants had not been deprived of any vested rights. Upon the refusal of the City to appoint its own arbitrator, the appellants applied for a writ of mandamus. The trial judge dismissed the action, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The appellants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe true import in para. 44(a) of the expression \"having vested rights\" or \"droits acquis\" could not be ascertained adequately without regard to the context, the nature, object and purpose of the enactment in which it appeared. The presence of this expression in the text would be superfluous had the Legislature considered sufficient for one to possess rights common to all \"owners, tenants or occupants\", to be entitled to an indemnity. The appellant's claim could not be entertained. Canadian Petronina Ltd. v. Martin and Ville de St-Lambert, [1959] S.C.R. 453, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Robinson J. Appeal dismissed. Gordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and J. Richard, for the petitioners, appellants.\nP. Casgrain and J. P. Lamoureux, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014The facts giving rise to this litigation are simple and undisputed. In November 1953, appellants acquired a vacant emplacement on Dudemaine Street in the City of Montreal. At that time, the building of multi-family dwellings, two storeys in height, was there permitted under City by-law no. 1920. In June 1958, the City adopted by-law no. 2414 further restricting to single family dwelling units only the type of buildings that could be erected in the locality. Three years later, in May 1961, appellants, contending that the value of their vacant emplacement had been substantially reduced as a result of this new building restriction, sought to resort to the procedure of arbitration provided for under para. 44(a) of art. 300 of the City Charter for the recovery of the indemnity therein contemplated for loss of vested rights. Having appointed their arbitrator, they requested the City to appoint its own, and upon the refusal of the latter to do so, procured the issue of a writ of mandamus to compel the City to arbitrate.\nContested by the City, this action of the appellants was dismissed by a judgment of the Superior Court which, being appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench2, was affirmed by a majority judgment. A further appeal entered in this Court was dismissed at the issue of the hearing, the Court indicating that reasons would later be delivered.\nIt was conceded that the City adopted By-Law 2414 in the public interest and that the appellants never obtained nor sought to obtain a building permit for this emplacement which they had bought with the intention to sell. It may be added that the record does not disclose any subdivision, opening of streets or similar works having been done by the appellants with respect to their land.\nAt the hearing, it was common ground that the only issue was whether, as contended for by the appellants and obviously denied by the respondent, the two Courts below erred in failing to find that appellants were, as a result of by-law 2414, deprived of any vested rights within the meaning of the term under para. 44(a) of art. 300 of the City Charter.\nArticle 300 of the Charter enables the City to make by-laws. As it stood, prior to the date of acquisition of appellants' emplacement, art. 44(a) thereof authorized the City:\nTo regulate the kind of buildings that may be erected on certain streets, parts or sections of streets or on any land fronting on any public place or park; to compel the proprietors or constructors of buildings, hereafter erected, containing ten stories or more, to reserve an adequate space as a garage for the use of the occupants of such buildings; to determine at what distance from the line of the streets, public places or parks the houses shall be built, provided that such distance shall not be fixed at more than twenty-five feet from the said line, or to prohibit the construction, occupation and maintenance of factories, workshops, taverns, billiard-rooms, pigeon-hole rooms, livery-stables, butcher's stalls or other shops or similar places of business in the said streets, parts or sections of certain streets or on said land fronting on any public place or park, saving the indemnity, if any, payable to the proprietors, tenants or occupants of the buildings now built or being built or who have building permits, which indemnity shall be determined by three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the city, one by the proprietor, tenant or occupant interested and the third by the two former and, in default of agreement, by a judge of the Superior Court; and the city shall have the right to pass a by-law to compel every proprietor to have an opening made in the outer door of his house or houses, even those already built, to enable the postman to insert the mail;\nThe provisions of this section were replaced, on February 22, 1955, by the following:\nTo classify buildings and establishments; to divide the municipality into zones, whose number, shape and area seem suitable; to regulate and restrict differently according to the location in such zones, parts or sections of certain zones or in certain streets, parts or sections of certain streets or at any place whatsoever, the use and occupation of lands, the kind, destination, occupation and use of buildings which may be erected as well as the maintenance, reconstruction, alteration, repair, enlargement, destination, occupation and use of buildings already erected, saving the indemnity, if any, payable to the owners, lessees or occupants, having vested rights, which indemnity must be determined by three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the city, one by the interested party and the third by the two former and, in default of agreement, by a judge of the Magistrate's Court, to prescribe the area of lots, the proportion thereof which may be occupied by the buildings, the number of parking units which are to be laid out, the space to be left between the buildings and between the buildings and the line of streets, lanes, public places or parks, to prohibit any construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, destination, occupation and any enlargement and usage not in conformity, to have them cease and even provide for the demolition of the construction; The wording of the two texts differs in that the words \" \u2026 saving the indemnity, if any, payable to the proprietors, tenants or occupants of the buildings now built or being built or who have building permits \u2026 \", appearing in the former, have been replaced, in the latter, by the words \" \u2026 saving the indemnity, if any, payable to the owners, lessees or occupants, having vested rights \u2026 \" This difference, it was argued, evidences an intention of the Legislature to enlarge the group of persons entitled to an indemnity to all those whose vested rights are injuriously affected. With deference, I fail to appreciate the relevancy of this submission to solve the question in issue which is centred on the effect to be given to the expression \"having vested rights\" or, as it appears in the French version, \"ayant des droits acquis\". Whatever be generally the meaning of the term \"vested rights\" or \"droits acquis\", the true import, in art. 44(a), of the expression \"having vested rights\" or \"ayant des droits,acquis\" cannot be ascertained adequately without regard to the context, the nature, object and purpose of the enactment in which it appears. In the context, this expression qualifies the words \"owners, tenants or occupants\". As held by Taschereau J., with the concurrence of Tremblay C.J. and Rivard J., the presence of this expression in the text would be superfluous had the Legislature considered sufficient for one to possess rights common to all \"owners, tenants or occupants\", to be entitled to an indemnity. The extent to which such rights, as those invoked by appellants in the circumstances of this case, are affected by legislation of a nature and having an object and purpose substantially similar to art. 44(a) has often been considered by the Courts. To admit appellants' claim to an indemnity would be disregarding virtually the general principles attending such legislation. These general principles were particularly formulated by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Toronto Corporation v. Roman Catholic Separate Schools Trustees3, and recently applied by this Court in Canadian Petrofina Limited v. Martin and Ville de Saint-Lambert4.\nAppellants' claim to an indemnity could not be entertained. And as above indicated, their appeal against the dismissal of their action was, at the issue of the hearing, dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the petitioners, appellants: Louis & Berger, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Parent, McDonald & Mercier, Montreal.\n1 [1963] Que.

Il \u00e9tait depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es engag\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses transactions immobili\u00e8res. Vu les difficult\u00e9s de financer leur projet, les associ\u00e9s ont vendu une partie du terrain en 1955 \u00e0 une compagnie qui a par la suite construit un centre d'achats sur le site. L'appelant, ayant acquis de ses associ\u00e9s une partie du r\u00e9sidu de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en revendit une partie en 1955. Il pr\u00e9tendit qu'il avait eu l'intention de construire une taverne sur ce site. De ces deux ventes, l'appelant a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 des profits respectifs de 869,406.93 et $24,603. Le Ministre, par la m\u00e9thode dite de conciliation de capital, a ajout\u00e9 ces deux.montants au revenu imposable de l'appelant pour les ann\u00e9es 1953, 1954 et 1955.

In 1953 the appellant, a notary, purchased in partnership with two builders a parcel of land with the alleged intention of building a shopping centre. He had frequently before engaged in real estate transactions. The difficulties of financing the project forced them to sell part of the property in 1955 to a company which later constructed a shopping centre on the site. The appellant, having acquired from his associates part of the remainder of the property, resold part of it, also in 1955. He claimed that he had intended to build a tavern on that site. The appellant realized profits of $69,406.93 and $24,603 respectively on the two sales. The Minister, using the method of capital reconciliation, added these two amounts to the appellant's income for the years 1953, 1954 and 1955. The appellant contended that they were capital gains. The Exchequer Court held that the appellant had engaged in a scheme of profit making. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe evidence justified the trial judge's conclusion that, when acquiring the land in question, the appellant was indifferent as to its use or, alternatively, as to its eventual sale, and that speculation was the determining factor in the acquisition. The profits realized by the appellant were therefore taxable as income.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du juge Kearney de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada1, confirmant la cotisation de l'appelant pour imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.

Cette preuve manifeste particuli\u00e8rement que l'appelant, notaire, homme d'affaires tr\u00e8s averti, \u00e9tait, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, engag\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses transactions immobili\u00e8res et ce dans la r\u00e9gion m\u00eame o\u00f9 sont situ\u00e9s les immeubles pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, qu'en raison particuli\u00e8rement des fonctions publiques qu'il exer\u00e7ait dans cette r\u00e9gion, il avait une grande connaissance des expectatives d'accroissement de valeur des immeubles de l'endroit.

On September 14, 1955, L executed a transfer of the optioned claims to Conwest to be held subject to the terms of the agreement. L then borrowed money from Conwest, and, in satisfaction, under a written loan agreement, Conwest agreed to take 13,000 of L's 50,000 shares in the proposed company. The remaining 37,000 shares were optioned to Conwest in four blocks to be taken up on February 15, in the years 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961. The first block, consisting of 5,000 shares, was taken up on the specified date.\nConwest filed an application on September 18, 1958, for the incorporation of the company under the Dominion Companies Act, and was notified by the Director of Companies that letters patent were being prepared and would bear date September 25, 1958. Conwest then decided to invite L to have his name appear in the proposed company; on September 26, 1958, L agreed to this use of his name. The Director wrote to inquire about the nature of L's interest in the company, and in a declaration signed on October 7, L stated that he would have a substantial interest therein. Two days later L sent a telegram to the Director withdrawing his consent to the use of his name and stating that in his opinion his contract with Conwest was null and void.\nThe letters patent, bearing date September 25, 1958, were actually sealed and issued on October 20, 1958. The company subsequently issued 32,000 shares to L. Tenders were made for the several blocks of shares, as provided for by the loan agreement, but these tenders were refused.\nL sought return of the claims held under option and the transfer of other contiguous claims staked by Conwest on the ground that the latter, not having performed the conditions precedent to the exercise of the option, had lost all its rights. According to the incorporating authority, the company came into being on September 25, 1958. Conwest claimed that this constituted performance of its contract. L maintained that he was entitled to have a company whose letters patent were actually sealed and issued on or before October 1, 1958. Three actions were tried together and the first two, brought by L, were dismissed. In the third action, Conwest was given specific performance of the share option agreement. An appeal from the judgment of the trial judge was allowed by the Court of Appeal, which held that Conwest had failed to comply with the terms of the option.\nHeld (Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright and Judson JJ: The share option agreement had effected an important modification of the claims option agreement of July 1955. On October 1, 1958, L was no longer in a position to demand a freely-transferable certificate for the shares to which he was entitled under the option. The result of the two agreements was that L had no interest in the incorporation of the company until Conwest failed on February 15 , 1959, 1960 and 1961, to take up any of the instalments of shares under option.\nMoreover, under the claims option agreement Conwest could choose to incorporate the company under the Companies Act of Canada, and rely on s. 133 to show to L that the incorporating authority had conferred a status upon this company from September 25, 1958. The application for incorporation had been completed by that date, the incorporating fees had been paid and the letter sent by the Director of Companies. Nothing more remained for Conwest to do. The rest was departmental routine, and on this basis alone Conwest had performed its contract precisely and exactly. Also, L, by his intervention in the incorporation of the company before October 1, 1958, and continuing after that date, provided Conwest with an equitable defence against a claim for the re-transfer of the claims under option and the transfer of the claims staked by Conwest. Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877), 2 App. Cas. 439; Pierce v. Empey, [1939] S.C.R. 247, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J.: L was not simply resisting an attempt to enforce the option; he was seeking to compel the conveyance to himself not only of the claims which he caused to be transferred to Conwest but also of a number of other claims which were never his. While the appellant was entitled to succeed without the necessity of relying on the defence of equitable estoppel, that defence was available in the circumstances of this case.\nPer Martland J., dissenting: Conwest was not seeking to raise equitable estoppel as a defence to the strict enforcement by L of his contractual rights. L did not need to take any steps to terminate the option agreement, for it terminated automatically upon expiration of the option period. Conwest was really seeking to use equitable estoppel as a means of establishing that there was an extension of the option period. But such an extension would involve the making of a new contract and for such a contract there was no consideration. Equitable estoppel had no application to this type of case. Combe v. Combe, [1951] 2 K.B. 215, referred to.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: Even if it were to be accepted that the phrase \"causing to be incorporated\" as employed in the claims option was equivalent to \"taking all reasonable steps to bring about incorporation\", the actions of the appellants still fell short of compliance with that condition. No steps were taken to this end for a period of three years after the date of the agreement. When application for incorporation was made on September 18th, it proved to be too late for the charter to be granted \"on or before October 1st, 1958\", and the fact that it was made effective, when granted, as of an earlier date could not alter the position which existed on October 2nd, at which time no company had been incorporated and the claims option had lapsed.\nIf any delay in incorporation was caused by the suggestion that L's name be used, it was caused by the appellants. His consent given on September 26th, could not be regarded as a waiver of the terms of the option. Even if L's \"declaration of substantial interest\" which was not given until October 7th was to be treated as an acceptance by him of the fact that the company had not been incorporated and an acquiescence in delay, this could not serve to reinstate the lapsed option. The law is well settled that once it has expired an option cannot be revived without a new agreement for valuable consideration. Dibbins v. Dibbins, [1896] 2 Ch. 348, referred to.\nThe contention that the share option agreement was consistent only with L having waived strict compliance with the claims option was also rejected. The share option was concerned with shares in a company to be incorporated on or before October 1, 1958, and Conwest's failure to cause such a company to be incorporated within the stipulated time effectively prevented the shares from coming into existence.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wootton J. Appeal allowed, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., W. S. Walton, Q.C., and F. U. Collier, for the appellants.\nHon. J. W. de B. Farris, Q.C., C. F. Murphy, and P. E. Hogan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Judson J. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The result of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is that the appellant, Conwest Exploration Company Limited, must hand back to the respondent, Felix Letain, certain claims which it held under option, and also transfer other contiguous claims which it had staked itself. The Court of Appeal has held that Conwest failed to comply with the terms of the option.\nThe option agreement is dated July 26, 1955, and under it the obligations of Conwest were (a) to cause to be incorporated a company on or before October 1, 1958, to hold the claims under option, and, (b) to allot and issue to Letain not less than 50,000 shares of this company, the capitalization of which had been previously defined. On September 14, 1955, Letain executed a transfer of the optioned claims to Conwest to be held subject to the terms of the agreement.\nThen Letain borrowed money from Conwest. Each borrowing was evidenced by an agreement in writing and the last loan agreement dated February 15, 1957, is really a consolidation of the two previous ones. Under this, Letain acknowledges that he has borrowed $13,000 from Conwest. In satisfaction of this loan Conwest agrees to take 13,000 of Letain's 50,000 shares in the company yet to be incorporated. This left Letain entitled to 37,000 shares in the proposed company, and these 37,000 shares were optioned to Conwest on the following terms:\nFebruary 15,1958\n5,000 shares\nFebruary 15,1959\n5,000 shares\nFebruary 15,1960\n7,000 shares\nFebruary 15,1961\n20,000 shares. The first block of February 15, 1958, was taken up by Conwest. Therefore, on October 1, 1958, the last date for the incorporation of the proposed company, Letain's interest had become limited to 32,000 shares, all of which were under option to Conwest.\nI turn now to the steps taken to incorporate the company. On September 18, 1958, Conwest filed an application under the Dominion Companies Act. The suggested name was not satisfactory to the Department and a new name was substituted\u2014Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited. The Director of the Companies Division then notified Conwest that letters patent were being prepared and would bear date September 25, 1958. The Director testified that but for the matters to which I next refer, the letters patent would have been sealed and issued by October 1, 1958.\nConwest then decided to invite Letain to have his name appear in the proposed company. On September 26, 1958, Letain signed a consent to the incorporation of the company under the name of Letain Asbestos Company Limited. This was addressed to the Secretary of State and delivered. On September 29, 1958, the Bank of Montreal as assignee of the payments due under the share-option agreement, and therefore the assignee of Letain's total claim unless he was entitled to a reassignment of the claims, wrote to Conwest pointing out that its assignment was still subsisting and that the next payment was due on February 15, 1959. On September 29, 1958, the proposed company, relying on s. 133 of the Companies Act, held two organizational meetings. On October 1, 1958, the Director of the Companies Division following departmental practice, wrote to inquire about the nature of Letain's interest in the proposed new company. On October 7, 1958, Letain signed a declaration addressed to the Secretary of State stating that \"on the incorporation and organization of the above company I will have a substantial interest therein\". Two days later, on October 9, 1958, Letain sent a telegram to the Director withdrawing his consent to the use of his name and stating that in his opinion his contract with Conwest was null and void.\nThe letters patent of Kutcho Creek bear date September 25, 1958, in accordance with the advice officially given by the Director of the Companies Division on that date. The letters patent were actually sealed and issued on October 20, 1958. Conwest proceeded with the organization of Kutcho Creek. This company, on November 7, 1958, issued 32,000 shares to Letain. On February 15, 1959, the Bank of Montreal refused the tender of $5,000 for the 5,000 shares due on that date. On March 2, 1959, 32,000 shares were tendered to Letain and refused. On February 16, 1960, the tender for the shares due on that date was refused, and on February 15, 1961, the tender of $40,000 for the remaining block of 20,000 shares was refused.\nOn these facts, in my respectful opinion, there is error inholding that Conwest, not having performed the conditions precedent to the exercise of the option, had lost all its rights. The share-option agreement of February 15, 1957, had effected an important modification of the claims-option agreement of July 1955. Under the claims-option agreement, if that alone is looked at, Letain on October 1, 1958, would have been entitled to demand 50,000 shares. Having received an incorporation date of September 25, 1958, and having held its organizational meetings on September 29, 1958, I think the company would have been in a position to deliver these shares, although Letain, I can well understand, might have had some difficulty in selling them merely on the strength of the departmental letter and s. 133 of the Act. But under the loan agreement of February 15, 1957, Letain was not entitled to the unconditional delivery of 50,000 shares or any shares. He had already sold 13,000 shares and the first option for another 5,000 shares had been taken up. He had therefore sold, in anticipation of incorporation, 18,000 shares, and the remaining 32,000 shares to which he was entitled were also under option. On October 1, 1958, therefore, he was in no position to demand a freely-transferrable certificate for these shares. The result of the two agreements is that Letain had no interest in the incorporation of the company until Conwest failed, on February 15, 1959, 1960 and 1961, to take up any of the instalments of shares under option.\nThis litigation has already been before this Court on a point of law arising under the pleadings. Conwest took the position that because of the provisions of s. 133 of the Companies Act, the date of incorporation was conclusively established against everybody by the date of the letters patent. This view was adopted by the Courts in British Columbia, but this Court held in Letain v. Conwest Exploration Co. Ltd.[1], that the application of the section was to matters which involved the status and powers of the company and that the section did not preclude a person from questioning the date of incorporation appearing in the letters patent in a civil action in which the status and powers of the company were not involved. The question of what constituted performance of this particular contract was therefore left untouched by this decision. The incorporating authority has said that this company came into being on September 25, 1958. Conwest now says that this is performance of its contract. On the other hand, Letain says that under the terms of his agreements with Conwest, he was entitled to have a company whose letters patent were actually sealed and issued on or before October 1, 1958.\nTwo conflicting views are therefore put forward on what constituted \"causing a company to be incorporated\" before a certain date. Of the two I think that Conwest's submission is to be preferred, and that Letain's interpretation of the contract is unduly narrow. From the point of view of performance of a contract, what constitutes \"causing a company to be incorporated\" lacks the definition of a single precise act, for example the payment of money on or before a certain date.\nBy the terms of clause 7 of the claims-option agreement, Conwest was given a complete choice of jurisdiction under which it might incorporate the company. There is no uniformity of practice throughout Canada in company incorporation. It was open to Conwest under this agreement to choose incorporation under the Companies Act of Canada, and to rely on s. 133 to show to Letain that the incorporating authority had conferred a status upon this company from September 25, 1958. The application had been completed by that date for a company under the name of Kutcho Creek, the incorporating fees had been paid and the letter sent by the Director of the Companies Branch. Nothing more remained for Conwest to do. The rest was departmental routine and in my opinion on this basis alone Conwest had, within the meaning of clause 7 of the claims-option agreement, performed its contract precisely and exactly. The contract left it open to Conwest to adopt this mode of performance and what the parties meant by performance of this contract is a question of construction for the Court.\nI am strengthened in my opinion of what performance meant under these two agreements\u2014the claims-option agreement and the share-option agreement, by the nature of the interest which was outstanding in Letain on October 1, 1958. I think the nature of the interest is strongly against Letain's interpretation of the performance to which he was entitled. Even if his interest had remained at 50,000 shares clear of encumbrance, Conwest could have delivered them on October 1, 1958, and they would have been validly issued on the strength of s. 133; but long before October 1, 1958, Letain's interest in 50,000 shares clear of encumbrance had disappeared. I have already defined the interest that remained in him and it is at least arguable that he could have no possible cause for complaint about anything until there was default in the exercise of the option on any instalment of the shares. The share-option agreement modified the need on the part of Conwest to show any incorporation of a company until it was in default in the exercise of the shares optioned to it.\nI am also of the opinion that Letain, by his intervention in the incorporation of the company before October 1, 1958, and continuing after that date, provided Conwest with an equitable defence against a claim for the re-transfer of the claims under option and the transfer of the claims staked by Conwest. By acting as he did in signing the consent to the use of his name and the declaration of substantial interest on October 7th, together with his retention of the $18,000 paid for the shares in this proposed company, Letain represented to Conwest that he was satisfied with what was being done as performance of the contract and he knew that Conwest would act and was acting upon his representation. But for this representation, Conwest could have given him the kind of performance to which he now says he is entitled. I think that this brings the case within the principle which appears to have originated in the judgment of Lord Cairns in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[2] There was an unambiguous representation of intention made by Letain which was intended to be acted upon and was acted upon by Conwest, with the result that Conwest's position in relation to Letain was prejudiced if Letain's interpretation of what constituted performance under this contract is correct. The principle is stated in the following terms:\nIt is the first principle upon which all courts of equity proceed, that if parties, who have entered into definite and distinct terms, involving certain legal results\u2014certain penalties or legal forfeiture\u2014afterwards by their own act or with their own consent, enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable, having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties.\nThere was a recognition of this type of equitable defence in the judgment of Duff C.J. in Pierce v. Empey[3], and without going into detail, it does not seem to me that the recent interest in England in this subject-matter, beginning with Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.[4], has done anything more than to restate the principle.\nLetain says in answer to this that his intervention should go for nothing because Conwest represented to him when he signed the documents addressed to the Companies Department that the company was in fact incorporated. The documents themselves indicate to the contrary, particularly the declaration of interest of October 7, 1958, but in addition there is a finding of fact against Letain on this point made by the trial judge which could not be put in stronger terms. It reads as follows:\nThe plaintiff knowing the situation between himself and the defendants but thinking that he should have made a better deal, as he says instead of taking \"two-bit shares\", he should have had more, testified that he said to himself before his telegram interfering with the use of his name was sent to the Department of State \"By golly, it is not incorporated\". No suggestion was made by anyone to him that the company had in fact been incorporated. In this respect I believe the witnesses for the defendants, and I disbelieve the plaintiff when he suggested in his evidence that one or more of the three gentlemen with whom he had dealings on behalf of Conwest represented to him that the company was in fact incorporated when he was communicated with before and after the 1st day of October, 1958. I saw the persons under oath and had good opportunity to estimate their credibility.\nThe inference to be drawn from Letain's conduct until October 9, 1958, when he revoked his consent to the use of his name, was that he was participating in the incorporation of this company with full knowledge of what was being done, and was accepting Conwest's steps towards incorporation of this company as performance of Conwest's obligations under the two agreements. He knew what the position was. He chose to treat his contracts with Conwest as subsisting. He continued these contracts although he now says they were not fully performed at the due date. He cannot now assert his construction of the contract that the letters patent should have been sealed and issued on or before October 1.\nI would therefore allow the appeals and restore the judgments at trial. The two actions brought by Letain in connection with the claims were dismissed with costs. I would also restore the judgment at trial which gave Conwest specific performance of the share-option agreement. The appellants are also entitled to their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and wish to add only a few words as to the availability of the defence of equitable estoppel in the circumstances of this case.\nIf I were able to share the view of my brother Martland that in substance the only question before us is whether Conwest can enforce an agreement made by Letain without consideration to extend the time within which Conwest was entitled to exercise the option previously granted to it I would not disagree with his statement of the applicable law.\nIn my view, however, Letain is the plaintiff in substance as well as in form. He is not simply resisting an attempt to enforce the option; he is seeking to compel the conveyance to himself not only of the eight claims which he caused to be transferred to Conwest but also of a number of other claims which were never his. The foundation of his asserted right to a conveyance of these claims is the failure by Conwest to perform strictly the term in the agreement of July 26, 1955, as to causing a company to be incorporated on or before October 1, 1958. Assuming that this condition had not been varied by the acts of the parties and that it was not complied with until October 20, 1958, it is my opinion that by the dealings between the parties recited in the reasons of my brother Judson Letain led Conwest to suppose that he would not exercise his right to insist on performance of the condition by the date mentioned; in my view it would be inequitable having regard to those dealings to allow Letain to take advantage of the delay which occurred. While, in my opinion, the other grounds upon which the judgment of my brother Judson is based are sufficient to entitle the appellant to succeed without the necessity of relying on the defence of equitable estoppel, that defence appears to me to be available in the circumstances of this case.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Judson.\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the reasons of my brother Ritchie and wish to deal only with the matter of equitable estoppel. In my opinion it has no application to the circumstances of the present case.\nThe agreement which gives rise to the issues in this appeal is an option agreement. It is true that it contains, in addition to the option granted by the respondent to the appellant, Conwest Exploration Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Conwest\"), to purchase the respondent's claims, provision for the transfer of those claims to Conwest during the option period; for the right of Conwest to work them during that time; and for the addition to those claims of any fractional mineral claims, lying within the exterior boundaries of the respondent's claims, or any mineral claims, or fractional mineral claims adjoining any of the said claims, staked and recorded by Conwest. Essentially, however, it is an option to purchase and the question in issue in these proceedings is whether Conwest did actually purchase the respondent's claims, for it had no right to retain them or any added claims unless it had done so. That question depends entirely upon whether or not Conwest accepted the option. Conwest asserts that it did and this the respondent denies.\nIn so far as its claim depends upon the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, Conwest contends that, while it did not accept the respondent's offer within the period limited by the option agreement, it was induced by his conduct to believe that he had agreed to extend the time for acceptance and that it acted upon that representation. In taking this point, however, Conwest is not seeking to raise equitable estoppel as a defence to the strict enforcement by the respondent of his contractual rights. The respondent did not need to take any steps to terminate the option agreement, for it terminated automatically upon the expiration of the option period. What Conwest really seeks to do is to use equitable estoppel as a means of establishing that there was an extension of the option period. But such an extension would involve the making of a new contract and for such a contract there was no consideration.\nThe doctrine has never been extended this far and its application in similar circumstances was denied by the Court of Appeal in England in Combe v. Combe[5]. While it is true that in that case the party seeking to apply the principle was the plaintiff in the action, in my opinion its application is not dependent upon which party sues the other. The basic question is as to whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, it is being used as a defence to the strict enforcement of contractual rights, or as a means of proving the existence of a contract made without consideration. It has no application to the latter type of case and consequently, in my view, should not be applied here.\nI would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowing an appeal by the present respondent from a judgment of Wootton J. rendered with respect to three actions which were consolidated and tried together before him.\nTwo of these actions were brought by Letain for the retransfer to him of certain mining claims which he had transferred to Conwest Exploration Company Limited (hereinafter called Conwest) pursuant to the provisions of a claims option agreement dated July 26, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the CLAIMS OPTION) which was to be exercised by Conwest causing a mining company to be incorporated on or before October 1, 1958, and which the respondent claims was not so exercised.\nThe third of these consolidated actions was brought by the appellants Conwest and Cassiar Asbestos Corporation Limited (hereinafter called Cassiar), for specific performance of a SHARE OPTION agreement dated February 15, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as the SHARE OPTION) for the purchase of the shares to which the respondent would have become entitled in the proposed mining company in the event of that company being incorporated in accordance with the terms of the CLAIMS OPTION.\nThe disposition of these actions must, in my opinion, depend upon whether or not Conwest exercised or was excused from exercising its option to purchase the said mining claims by causing a mining company to be incorporated on or before October 1, 1958, in accordance with the said CLAIMS OPTION, the relevant clauses of which read as follows:\n7. In the event of Conwest electing to exercise fully the option hereby granted, it may do so by causing to be incorporated on or before the 1st day of October 1958, under the Companies Act of Canada, or under the laws of such other jurisdiction in Canada as Conwest shall choose, a mining company to which reference is herein made as the proposed company, with an authorized capital comprising three million shares, either without nominal or par value, or of the par value of $1.00 each, as Conwest shall decide. The proposed company, if incorporated, shall, in due course, be organized by Conwest, whereupon the said claims and such other mineral claims, if any, as Conwest shall elect, shall be transferred to the proposed company free of encumbrances.\n8. The considerations to be paid or otherwise satisfied by the proposed company for the transfer to it of the said claims shall be such as shall be arranged between Conwest and the proposed company, including the allotment and issue by the proposed company, as fully paid and non-assessable, of such number of shares in its authorized capital, being not less than Fifty Thousand (50,000) shares in its authorized capital, as shall be agreed between Conwest and the proposed company, to which shares reference is hereinafter made as \"THE VENDOR'S SHARES\". Of the vendor's shares, fifty thousand (50,000) shall be allotted and issued to, and shall be the property of the Optionor.\n***\n11. The Optionor will deliver forthwith to Conwest a good and sufficient bill of sale, or good and sufficient bills of sale, each in triplicate, of the said claims, to Conwest duly executed and attested and capable of due registration, which bills of sale Conwest may register in due course. In the event that Conwest shall not duly exercise the option hereby granted, Conwest will, at the request of the Optionor, retransfer the said claims, or such of them as shall be retained in good standing, to the Optionor.\n***\n13. In the event that Conwest shall stake and record, or cause to be staked and recorded on its behalf, any fractional mineral claim or claims lying within the exterior boundaries of the said claims, or any mineral claim or claims, or fractional mineral claim or claims which adjoin any of the said claims, the same shall, for the purposes of this indenture, be treated as though they were comprised in the said claims. It is established that Conwest caused Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as Kutcho Creek), a mining company, \"to be incorporated under the Companies Act of Canada\" with letters patent bearing date September 25, 1958, and in the first of these actions Conwest pleaded, by way of defence,\nthat under s. 133 of the said Companies Act except in a proceeding for the purpose of rescinding or annulling said letters patent, said letters patent are conclusive proof of the fact that such a mining company was incorporated prior to the said 1st day of October 1958.\nThe point of law so raised was the subject of an appeal to this Court at the instance of Letain (see Letain v. Conwest Exploration Company Limited[6]), and it was then determined that the mere production of the letters patent of Kutcho Creek bearing date September 25, 1958, in no way precluded the appellant (i.e. Letain) \"from showing at the trial that Conwest did not exercise its option according to its terms\".\nAccordingly, when these actions came to trial, Mr. A. A. Cattanach, who was the Director of the Companies Division in the Department of the Secretary of State in September and October 1958, was called as a witness on behalf of Letain to prove that the letters patent of Kutcho Creek were not signed and the seal of the Secretary of State was not affixed until October 20, 1958.\nThe CLAIMS OPTION was required to be exercised by \"causing\" a mining company \"to be incorporated ... under the Companies Act of Canada or under the laws of such other jurisdiction in Canada as Conwest shall choose \u2026\", but Conwest did not choose \"any other jurisdiction in Canada\" and the method of incorporating a company under Part 1 of the Companies Act of Canada which is specified in s. 5(1) of that Act was the subject of comment in this Court in Letain v. Conwest, supra, at p. 107, where it is said:\nThe only method of creating a body corporate under Part 1 of the Dominion Companies Act is for the Secretary of State to grant a charter by letters patent under his seal of office (see s. 5(1)). If the charter so granted bears a date earlier than that upon which the seal was affixed then by virtue of s. 133 the company acquires status with effect from the earlier date. The question here, however, is not whether or not Kutcho Creek Asbestos Company Limited is to be conclusively taken as having the status of a company incorporated on the 25th of September but rather whether or not the respondent caused it to be \"incorporated on or before the 1st day of October 1958\", within the meaning of those words as they are used in para. 7 of the agreement pursuant to which this action was brought.\nIt is suggested that those representing Conwest actually complied with the terms of clause 7 by causing all reasonable steps to be taken towards the incorporation of a mining company on or before October 1, 1958. In support of this suggestion, it is pointed out that the application was first made on September 18th, that the draft letters patent were prepared on September 25th bearing that date, and that they were completed on or before October 1st, so that the seal of the Secretary of State could have been affixed by the close of business on that date.\nIt is evident also that the first organization meetings of the new company were held on September 29th and that those responsible, apparently relying on their interpretation of s. 133 of the Companies Act, treated the matter as if the company had in fact been incorporated on September 25th.\nI agree with Bird J.A., who delivered the reasons for judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, that \"the CLAIMS OPTION is an option simpliciter to purchase mineral claims \u2026\" and that the requirement for incorporation of a mining company contained in clause 7 is to be treated, to use the words of Kindersley V.C. in Lord Ranelagh v. Melton[7]:\n\u2026as a condition on the performance of which the party who claims the benefit of the performance is entitled to certain privileges but in order to entitle him to them he must perform the condition strictly; and if the time fixed for the performance of the condition passes over by one single day that prevents his having the right.\nThe word \"causing\" may be capable of different shades of meaning dependent upon the context in which it is used, but in my opinion as it is employed in the phrase \"causing to be incorporated\" in clause 7 of the CLAIMS OPTION, it necessarily implies the achievement of an objective which in this case was the incorporation of a mining company on or before October 1, 1958.\nEven if it were to be accepted that the phrase \"causing to be incorporated\" as so employed was equivalent to \"taking all reasonable steps to bring about incorporation\", the actions of Conwest and Cassair would still, in my view, fall short of compliance with this condition of the option. It is to be remembered that the option was signed on July 26, 1955, and that there was therefore a period of three years and two months in which to cause the company to be incorporated. No steps whatever appear to have been taken to this end for three years after the agreement was made and in July, 1958, for some unexplained reason, representatives of Conwest and Cassair approached Letain with a view to having the date for compliance with the option by incorporating a company, extended for a further three years until October 1, 1961; it was only after it had become apparent that Letain would not agree to this that last-minute steps were taken to comply with the terms of the option by the making of an application for incorporation on September 18, 1958. Under the circumstances this proved to be too late for the charter to be granted \"on or before October 1st 1958\", and the fact that it was made effective, when granted, as of an earlier date cannot, in my opinion, alter the position which existed on October 2nd, at which time no company had been incorporated and the CLAIMS OPTION had lapsed. By the time that the Secretary of State signed and affixed his seal to the charter the time fixed for the performance of the condition had, to adopt the language of Kindersley V.C., \"passed over\" not only \"by one single day\" but by eighteen days and the right to exercise the option was gone.\nIt is no doubt true that the retroactive effect of the antedating of the charter as of September 25th might, after the company had been duly incorporated, have the effect of validating acts done by the embryo company, but in my view no such acts can have had any validity as corporate acts until after the incorporation of the company on October 20th.\nThis does not, however, dispose of the ground upon which the learned trial judge based his decision and which was urged upon us by counsel for the appellants, namely, that Letain waived strict compliance with the CLAIMS OPTION and so conducted himself\nthat the defendants were led into the position of believing . . . that everything was to be satisfactory regardless of the date of October 1st, 1958, and that they acted to their detriment in reliance on that belief and were, therefore, \"estopped from claiming default against the defendant Conwest\". It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the delay in incorporation of this company after September 26th was occasioned, or at least acquiesced in, by the respondent because on that date, when the name of Kutcho Creek had been accepted by the Companies Division, representatives of the appellants requested Letain to let his name be used as part of the company's title and as a result of his having consented to this request, Mr. Cattanach wrote to him on October 1st asking for a \"declaration of substantial interest in the company\" which Letain did not send forward until October 7th and in which he said\nthat on incorporation or organization of the said company I will have a substantial interest therein.\nIf any delay in the incorporation was caused by the suggestion that Letain's name should be used, I am satisfied that it was caused by the representatives of the appellants rather than by the respondent. Whatever their motives may have been, it was the appellants who approached Letain in the last days of September 1958 to obtain his consent to the use of his name, and although this may have been a friendly gesture which Letain appreciated at the time, his consent given on September 26th cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as a waiver of the terms of the option.\nIt is suggested, however, that the respondent's \"declaration of substantial interest\" which was not given until October 7th is to be treated as an acceptance by Letain of the fact that the company had not then been incorporated and an acquiescence in the delay, but even if this were so it could not serve to reinstate the lapsed option as the law is well settled that once it has expired an option cannot be revived without a new agreement for valuable consideration (see Dibbins v. Dibbins[8]).\nA substantial portion of the appellants' argument was devoted to the contention that the SHARE OPTION of February 15, 1957, read in the light of the relationship then existing between Letain and Conwest both before and after that date, is consistent only with Letain having waived strict compliance with the CLAIMS OPTION.\nIt is true that the respondent was employed by Conwest before the CLAIMS OPTION was granted and that for three years thereafter he worked for that company during the prospecting seasons and, indeed, was continuously in its employ from August 1, 1957, to October 1, 1958, but none of his contracts of employment has any bearing on the terms of the CLAIMS OPTION and I am unable to see that the relationship of employer and employee which existed between the parties during these years placed Letain under any obligation to notify Conwest that he intended to hold it to the letter of its bargain. Nor do I think that the provisions of the loan agreements and the SHARE OPTION executed by the respondent in the years 1956 and 1957 gave rise to any such obligation.\nThe loan agreements of December 7, 1955, and December 3, 1956, were given by Letain as collateral security for repayment of advances totalling $5,500 made to him by Conwest and had the effect of releasing Conwest from its obligation to issue shares to Letain in the company to be incorporated under the CLAIMS OPTION if the loans were not repaid before June 7, 1957. These loan agreements were abrogated by the SHARE OPTION agreement of February 15, 1957, under which Conwest agreed to cancel Letain's existing indebtedness and to advance a further sum of $7,500 in return for the transfer to it of all the respondent's right, title and interest in the first 13,000 of the 50,000 shares to which he might become entitled under the CLAIMS OPTION in the event of a mining company being incorporated in the manner thereby provided.\nBy para. 8 of this agreement it was provided:\nIn the event of the incorporation and organization of the said mining company, Letain hereby gives and grants to Conwest the sole and exclusive options, which are herein referred to as \"THE SHARE OPTIONS\", to purchase the whole or any part or parts of the remaining Thirty-seven Thousand (37,000) shares of the said mining company to which Letain shall then be entitled, and which shall be issuable to Letain as fully paid and non-assessable, at the prices, on or before the dates and in the quantities hereunder mentioned, that is to say:\nFIRST. The whole or any part or parts of Five Thousand (5,000) shares, at the price of One Dollar ($1.00) per share, on or before the 15th day of February 1958.\nSECOND. The whole or any part or parts of Five Thousand (5,000) shares, at the price of One Dollar ($1.00) per share, on or before the 15th day of February 1959.\nTHIRD. The whole or any part or parts of Seven Thousand (7,000) shares, at the price of One Dollar ($1.00) per share, on or before the 15th day of February 1960. FOURTH. The whole or any part or parts of Twenty Thousand (20,000) shares, at the price of Two Dollars ($2.00) per share, on or before the 15th day of February 1961.\nCounsel for the appellants attached great importance to the fact that on November 17, 1957, the respondent assigned all moneys which might be paid to him under this agreement to the Bank of Montreal giving notice of this assignment to Conwest, and that prior to February 15, 1958, the Bank was paid and accepted $5,000 in respect of the first block of the 37,000 shares in the proposed company.\nIt is also pointed out on behalf of the appellants that as late as September 29, 1958, the Bank of Montreal in its capacity as Letain's assignee wrote to Conwest stating:\nThe assignment is still in effect and we trust that the payment due in February 1959 will be forwarded direct to us for account of Mr. Letain.\nIt is to be remembered that the SHARE OPTION, like the loan agreements which preceded it, was concerned with shares which were to be issued in the \"proposed company referred to in the said agreement of July 26th, 1955, to be incorporated within the time set forth in that agreement \u2026\u201d. By its failure to cause such a company to be incorporated within the time set forth, Conwest effectively prevented the shares which were the subject-matter of this option from ever coming into existence and this appears to me to afford a complete answer to the action for specific performance of the SHARE OPTION which action was brought to enforce a right that Conwest itself had destroyed.\nThe fact that Conwest appears to have been ready to pay for the optioned shares both before the CLAIMS OPTION was due to be exercised and after it had lapsed cannot, in my opinion, be treated as a substitute for the incorporation of a mining company in accordance with the terms of that option any more than the acceptance of the first $5,000 payment under the SHARE OPTION in February 1958, or the anticipation of the February 1959 payment by the Bank of Montreal, can be treated as evidence of Letain's agreement to waive strict compliance with the specified date for the incorporation of the proposed mining company.\nThe suggestion that the respondent's conduct over the years was such as to justify the appellants in believing that he had relieved Conwest from the obligation to exercise the CLAIMS OPTION on or before October 1st is, in my view, entirely inconsistent with the draft agreement sent to Letain by the representatives of the appellants Conwest and Cassiar in July 1958 which recited the fact that the CLAIMS OPTION provided for the incorporation of the proposed company on or before October 1st. By this draft agreement, as has been indicated, Letain was asked to extend the time for the incorporation \"from on or before the 1st day of October 1958 to on or before the 1st day of October 1961\", and it appears to me that his refusal to agree to this extension must have alerted the appellants to the importance of complying with the deadline of October 1st for the incorporation of the proposed company.\nI am satisfied that, at least from the date of this refusal in July or August 1958, the appellants were fully aware of the importance of adhering to the October 1st limit for the incorporation of the proposed company, and I am satisfied also that far from believing that \"everything was to be satisfactory regardless of the date of October 1st\u2026\", the appellants were seeking to have that date extended, and that having failed to do this they took all the steps which they thought to be necessary to comply with the letter of the CLAIMS OPTION by obtaining the assurance of the Companies Division that a mining company would be incorporated with letters patent bearing date of September 25, 1958. The fact of the matter was that between October 1 and October 20, 1958, no such company was in existence but this does not mean that the representatives of the appellants had been misled into thinking that they did not have to meet the October 1st deadline. On the contrary, those who were responsible wrongly thought that the deadline had been met, relying as they did on their own view of the effect of the said s. 133 of the Companies Act.\nIn view of the above, I am unable to conclude that Letain waived any of his rights under the CLAIMS OPTION and with all respect I can find no evidence to justify the learned trial judge's conclusion that he was estopped from claiming default against the appellant Conwest.\nI agree with Bird J.A. that the effect of Conwest's failure to exercise the CLAIMS OPTION is that a resulting trust was created in favour of Letain with respect to the mining claims in question and that he is entitled to have them retransferred to him in accordance with the terms of that option.\nI agree also with Mr. Justice Bird that the claims and fractional claims shown hatched in blue on exhibit 47, like those which are hatched in red, are all \"fractional mineral \u2026claims which adjoin\" the claims transferred to Conwest pursuant to the CLAIMS OPTION and that they are therefore \"to be treated\" as though they were comprised in the said claims, and to be transferred to the respondent in accordance with the terms of that option.\nFor these reasons as well as for those contained in the decision rendered by Bird J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Guild, Yule, Schmidtt, Lane, Collier & Hinkson, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hogan, Webber & Woodliffe, Vancouver.\n[1] [1961] S.C.R. 98, 33 W.W.R. 635, 26 D.L.R.

McKenna and The Bell Telephone Company of Canada Respondents.\n1963: November 26; 1963: December 16.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF TRANSPORT COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA.\nPublic utilities\u2014Telephone company\u2014Order by Transport Board to provide service\u2014Area not served by Bell Telephone Company\u2014Absence of jurisdiction\u2014An act respecting the Bell Telephone Company of Canada, 1902 (Can.), c. 41, s. 2\u2014The Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, s. 33.\nThe respondent lived on the south side of a road served by the appellant company. The Bell Telephone Company served the north side of that road. The respondent was granted an order by the Transport Board directing the Bell Telephone Company to provide him with telephone service. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the Board set aside.\nUnder s. 2 of An Act respecting the Bell Telephone Company of Canada, 1902 (Can.), c. 41, the Transport Board could require the Bell Telephone Company to serve all persons within a territory \"within which it gave a general service\". It was not intended that it could impose a requirement upon the Bell Telephone Company to extend its services into new areas or to enter a territory already served by another telephone company. The evidence in this case disclosed that the general service provided in that territory in which the respondent lived, was provided by the appellant. Consequently, the respondent did not come within the section of the Act and the Transport Board was without jurisdiction to make the order.\nAppeal by leave from an order of the Transport Board. Appeal allowed.\nJ. P. Nelligan, for the appellant.\nNo one appearing for the respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal is from an Order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada made under s. 33 of the Railway Act, the Assistant Chief Commissioner dissenting, which ordered the Bell Telephone Company of Canada to give telephone service to the respondent Walter J. McKenna.\nBefore the Transport Board the Bell company denied that it was obliged to give service to Mr. McKenna, the reasons given being the same as those relied upon by the appellant in this appeal Although entered as a respondent, the Bell company takes the position that it has no reason to oppose the appeal but on the contrary that it is in agreement with the position taken by the appellant Metcalfe Telephones Limited (formerly The Metcalfe Rural Telephone Company Limited), a rural telephone company incorporated under the laws of Ontario.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The respondent McKenna resides on the south side of Edwards Road which at that point is the dividing line between the townships of Gloucester and Osgoode in the County of Carleton. Mr. McKenna's residence is in the Township of Osgoode. The Metcalfe company has a telephone line running along the south side of Edwards Road in the township of Osgoode which passes the McKenna residence. The Bell company has a line on the opposite (the north) side of Edwards Road in Gloucester Township. The respondent McKenna can be served by the Metcalfe company and it is ready to serve him. An agreement exists between the Bell company and the Metcalfe company dated December 21, 1951, which was approved by the Transport Board on February 26, 1952, providing for an interchange of services and which contains the following clause:\nNeither company shall enter into competition with the other, except as may be agreed upon in writing, but nothing in this agreement shall be deemed or construed to prevent the Bell Company from accepting application for direct connection from any other system already connected with and forming part of the system of the Connecting Company, and entering into an agreement for such purpose.\nOn August 8, 1962, the respondent McKenna applied to the Transport Board for an Order directing the Bell company to provide him with telephone service. After correspondence with the parties (an oral hearing having been waived) the Board on May 1, 1963, issued the Order requested. The present appeal, by leave, is from that decision.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board to make the Order complained of, depends upon the interpretation and effect of s. 2 of c. 41 of the Statutes of Canada 1902, entitled \"An Act respecting the Bell Telephone Company of Canada\". It reads as follows:\nUpon the application of any person, firm or corporation within the city, town or village or other territory within which a general service is given and where a telephone is required for any lawful purpose, the Company shall, with all reasonable despatch, furnish telephones, of the latest improved design then in use by the Company in the locality, and telephone service for premises fronting upon any highway, street, lane, or other place along, over, under or upon which the Company has constructed, or may hereafter construct, a main or branch telephone service or system, upon tender or payment of the lawful rates semi-annually in advance, provided that the instrument be not situate further than two hundred feet from such highway, street, lane or other place.\nIn my opinion the purpose of this section is clear. That purpose is to require the Bell company to serve all persons within a territory \"within which a general service is given\" by Bell, who comply with the other requirements of the section. It is not intended to impose a requirement upon the Bell company to extend its services into new areas or to enter a territory already served by another telephone company. On this point I adopt the following statement of the Assistant Chief Commissioner in his written reasons:\nBy its nature a public utility usually operates in an area or territory in which it alone provides the service. This is the area or territory in which its general service is given. The boundaries may be clearly defined but usually they are not.\nA customer, consumer or subscriber in such an area (with very few exceptions) cannot elect by which utility he will be served. He has available to him only the services provided by the utility giving general service in the area. Hence the reason for much legislation to protect him.\nInstances have occurred in the past where rivalries have arisen between utilities to serve certain areas with resulting intrusion by one utility into the territory served by another.\nAt the time of the passage of the amendment of 1902 (with which we are concerned), the pattern of utilities providing a general service in a particular territory was well established. At that time there were in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario many private and municipal telephone systems. In my opinion, the wording of the 1902 amendment recognized the necessity of one telephone system only providing a general service in any one city, town or village, or in any one territory or service area.\nThe material in the record shows that general telephone service in Osgoode Township is provided by the Metcalfe company although, about its perimeter, portions of the township are served by Bell. Nevertheless the general service that is provided in the major portion of the said township\u2014and more particularly in that portion in which Mr. McKenna resides\u2014is provided by appellant.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the respondent McKenna does not come within s. 2 of the statute II Ed. VII, c. 41, as being a person within a territory in which general telephone service is furnished by the Bell company. It follows that the Transport Board was without jurisdiction to make the Order which it did.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the Order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada dated May 1, 1963, set aside. Counsel for appellant agreed that there should be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed; no order as to costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. P. Nelligan, Ottawa.\n"

In January 1962, he exchanged his diplomatic passport for an ordinary passport. In the following March he reported to an immigration officer, pursuant to s. 7(3) of the Immigration Act that he had ceased to be a non-immigrant and applied to become a permanent resident of Canada. After a hearing before a Special Inquiry Officer under ss. 27 and 28 of the Act, an order of deportation was made against the appellant on the ground that he was a person other than a person referred to in s. 28(2) in that, not being a Canadian citizen or a person having Canadian domicile, he was not a person who could come into Canada as of right, that he was a person seeking admission to Canada but was a member of the prohibited class described in s. 5(t) of the Act because (a) he was not in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa issued by a visa officer as required by s. 28(1) of the Immigration Regulations, Part 1, and (b) his passport did not bear a medical certificate duly signed by a medical officer, nor was he in possession of a medical certificate in the form prescribed by the Minister as required by s. 29(1) of the said Regulations. An appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board, under s. 31 of the Act, was dismissed and this decision was subsequently confirmed by the Minister. The appellant then brought proceedings by way of certiorari to quash the deportation order. The application was refused by the High Court and an appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Abbott, Judson and Hall JJ.: The administrative responsibility of granting or refusing the immigrant visa, required by the regulations as a condition precedent to landing in Canada, was entrusted, under the Act, to certain designated officers located outside Canada. Immigration officers at points of entry in Canada were given no authority to grant such a visa. The Minister was given wide discretionary powers and it might well be that he had power to waive the visa requirements, but in the present case he was not prepared to take such action. Regulation 28(1) was not beyond the power of the Governor in Council to enact.\nThe Special Inquiry Officer had jurisdiction to make the deportation order. The hearing was in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the order was based on findings of fact which had not been challenged. The order having been made under the authority of and in compliance with the Act, under s. 39, a court had no jurisdiction to interfere.\nDe Marigny v. Langlais, [1948] S.C.R. 155, referred to. Ex parte Mannira (1959), 17 D.L.R. (2d) 482, agreed with.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: Regulation 28 was procedural rather than substantive; and the general words of ss. 5(t) and 7(3) of the Act must be construed as rendering this regulation inapplicable to an applicant who is in fact at the time of seeking admission lawfully present in Canada. Similarly, the purpose of regulation 29 was to prevent a would-be immigrant setting out for Canada if he falls within classes (a), (b), (c) or (s) of s. 5 of the Act and in so far as it contemplates a medical certificate obtained in the country whence the applicant came it also was inapplicable to the case of a person who has for some time prior to making application for admission been lawfully present in Canada. This was not to say that the appellant did not have to obtain a medical certificate to establish that he did not fall within any of the aforementioned classes. In the present case there was uncontradicted sworn testimony that the applicant was in perfect health and that he asked to be informed to whom he could submit himself for an examination. To deny him this information and a reasonable time in which to obtain a certificate would be to deny him the sort of hearing to which under the Act and the common law he was entitled.\nEx parte Mannira, supra; Attorney-General of Canada v. Brent, [1956] S.C.R. 318, referred to.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from an order of McRuer C.J.H.C. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nF.A. Brewin, Q.C., and C. Sirois, for the appellant.\nD.S. Maxwell, Q.C., and N.A. Chalmers, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Abbott, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The appellant, who is a citizen of the Dominican Republic, entered Canada on or about November 4, 1961, and since that date has not been out of Canada. On entering Canada, he carried a diplomatic passport issued by the Dominican Republic which was based on his having been made Commercial Attach\u00e9 for that Republic in Iran. He also held a Canadian diplomatic visa issued at the Canadian Embassy in the Dominican Republic. He therefore entered Canada as a non-immigrant pursuant to paragraph (a) of subs. (1) of s. 7 of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325. His appointment as Commercial Attach\u00e9 was cancelled at the beginning of January 1962 and he was then issued with an ordinary passport by the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Ottawa. Apparently he then decided to retire \u201cfrom political ways\u201d and to apply to become a resident of Canada.\nIn March 1962, appellant reported to an immigration officer pursuant to s. 7(3) of the Immigration Act that he had ceased to be a non-immigrant and signed an application form to become a permanent resident in Canada. He was duly examined pursuant to s. 20 of the Act by an immigration officer and on July 10, 1962, a report was made by the said officer to a Special Inquiry Officer pursuant to s. 23 that the appellant was not a Canadian citizen nor a person who had acquired Canadian domicile and that it would or might be contrary to the Act or the Immigration Regulations to grant him admission to Canada as a permanent resident as he was a member of the prohibited class referred to in subs, (t) of s. 5 of the Act by reason of the fact:\n1. that he was not in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa, issued by a visa officer, as required by subs. (1) of s. 28 of the Immigration Regulations, Part I; and\n2. his passport did not bear a medical certificate duly signed by a medical officer, nor was he in possession of a medical certificate in the form prescribed by the Minister, as required by subs. (1) of s. 29 of the Immigration Regulations, Part I.On July 17, 1962, a hearing pursuant to ss. 27 and 28 of the Act was held before Mr. Collingwood Schreiber, a Special Inquiry Officer at Ottawa, at which the appellant was represented by counsel. No exception was or has been taken to the conduct of this hearing.\nImmediately following the said inquiry, the Special Inquiry Officer made an order of deportation against appellant pursuant to s. 28(3) of the Act on the ground that he was a person other than a person referred to in subs. (2) of the same section in that, not being a Canadian citizen or a person having Canadian domicile, he was not a person who could come into Canada as of right, that he was a person seeking admission to Canada but was a member of the pro- hibited class described in s. 5(t) of the Act because (a) he was not in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa issued by a visa officer as required by subs. (1) of s. 28 of the Immigration Regulations, Part I, and (b) his passport did not bear a medical certificate duly signed by a medical officer, nor was he in possession of a medical certificate in the form prescribed by the Minister as required by subs. (1) of s. 29 of the said Regulations, Part I. It is sufficient to support the deportation order that appellant had failed to comply with either of the said sections: De Marigny v. Langlais[1].\nAppellant appealed to the Immigration Appeal Board under s. 31 of the Act and, after a hearing, the Immigration Appeal Board on August 9, 1962, dismissed this appeal.\nOn September 19, 1962, the Honourable R.A. Bell, the then Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, after reviewing the circumstances of the case, pursuant to s. 31 of the Immigration Act confirmed the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board and stated that he did not feel that there was any justification for his intervention as Minister. On October 25, 1962, after still further representations and after a further review, the Minister again stated that he could find no justification for interfering with the deportation order which had been made.\nBy originating notice of motion dated November 1, 1962, appellant brought proceedings for an order by way of certiorari to quash the deportation order \u201con the ground of the lack of jurisdiction\u201d. The said application came on for hearing before the Chief Justice of the High Court of Ontario on November 30, 1962, and was dismissed without written reasons, the learned Chief Justice considering himself bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Ex parte Mannira[2].\nAn appeal from this order was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario on March 4, 1963, also without written reasons, that Court no doubt considering itself bound by its previous decision in the Mannira case. The present appeal by leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is from that decision. At the hearing before us Mr. Brewin agreed that if the Mannira case was rightly decided this appeal fails. In my respectful view it was rightly decided.\nIn its essential features the present appeal does not differ in any material respect from that in Ex parte Mannira. In both cases the appellant had entered Canada as a non-immigrant. As such, under s. 7(3) of the Act, he had no higher rights than a would-be immigrant presenting himself at a port of entry for admission as a permanent resident of Canada. In both cases appellant was not in possession of the immigrant visa or the medical certificate required under the regulations. Such regulations were passed under s. 61 which in its terms authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations respecting \u201cthe terms, conditions and requirements with respect to the possession of\u2026passports, visas or other documents pertaining to admission;\u2026\u201d Regulation 28(1) is such a regulation and it reads:\n28. (1) Every immigrant who seeks to land in Canada shall be in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa issued to him by a visa officer and bearing a serial number which has been recorded by the officer in a register prescribed by the Minister for that purpose, and unless he is in possession of such visa, he shall not be granted landing in Canada.\n\u201cVisa officer\u201d is defined in regulation 2(h) as follows:\n2. (h) \u201cvisa officer\u201d means\u2014\n(i) an immigration officer stationed on duty outside of Canada and authorized by the Minister to issue visas or letters of pre-examination for the purpose of section 28, and\n(ii) in a country where no such immigration officer is stationed\n(A) a diplomatic or consular officer of Canada, or\n(B) a diplomatic or consular officer of the United Kingdom if there is no diplomatic or consular officer of Canada in the country;\u2026\nThe only persons entitled to enter Canada as of right are Canadian citizens and persons having Canadian domicile. All others desiring to do so must comply with the requirements of the statute and regulations.\nIn the Immigration Act, Parliament has provided for the control of immigration to Canada and for the selection of prospective immigrants. The regulations passed under the authority of the Act clearly contemplate that the examination of persons seeking permanent admission to Canada in order to determine their suitability whether from a medical standpoint, an internal security point of view or otherwise, should be conducted abroad, in the homeland of the prospective immigrant. No doubt there are sound reasons for such a requirement.\nThe administrative responsibility of granting or refusing the immigrant visa, required by the regulations as a condition precedent to landing in Canada, has been entrusted to certain designated officers located outside Canada. Immigration officers at points of entry in Canada are given no authority to grant such a visa.\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is given wide discretionary powers under the Act and it may well be that he has power to waive the visa requirements. The record shows that in the present case he was not prepared to take such action.\nThe word \u201cvisa\u201d is used in the Act itself and the term is familiar to anyone who travels outside the boundaries of his own country. It is merely a certificate or endorsement upon a passport or other similar document, made by a person authorized to do so, that the bearer of the document is entitled to proceed to the country to which he seeks entry: See Webster Third New International Dictionary under the word \u201cvisa\u201d.\nAppellant submits however that regulation 28(1) is beyond the power of the Governor in Council to enact because it purports to delegate to specified immigration officials and diplomatic or consular officers, an absolute discretion to grant or refuse such immigrant visa. As I have said, the administrative responsibility of granting or refusing the immigrant visa required by regulation 28(1) has been entrusted to certain designated officers located outside of Canada. It must be entrusted to someone and the duty of such officers is to ascertain whether or not an applicant for permanent landing in Canada comes within one of the prohibited classes. That question is a question of fact.\nThe present regulation 28(1) is similar in its terms to the former regulation 18(4) considered in Ex parte Mannira, and on this point I adopt the following statement of Schroeder J.A.[3]:\nI cannot agree with the submission that Reg. 18(4) is invalid on the ground that it purports to delegate an authority committed to the Governor-General in Council to officers outside of Canada. There is cer- tainly no factual basis which supports counsel\u2019s suggestion. Moreover it impresses me that if an officer empowered to issue an immigrant visa were to exercise his powers improperly, such abuse of authority could hardly be held to affect the validity of the Regulation.\nThe Special Inquiry Officer had jurisdiction to make the deportation order. The hearing before him was in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act. The order was based on findings of fact which have not been challenged.\nThere is nothing to indicate that appellant ever applied to the proper visa officer as defined in s. 2(h) of the regulations for an immigrant visa. The Examining Officer and Special Inquiry Officer merely applied, after a hearing and in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, regulations validly made by the Governor in Council to prevent those who come into Canada as non-immigrants from achieving a preferred or special position in relation to permanent admission to Canada. The order of deportation against appellant having been made under the authority of and in compliance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, under s. 39, a court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the order.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from an order of that Court dismissing an appeal from an order of McRuer C.J.H.C. whereby the application of the appellant for an order in lieu of a writ of certiorari to quash a deportation order made against the appellant on July 17, 1962, by Collingwood Schreiber, a Special Inquiry Officer, was dismissed.\nThere is no dispute as to the relevant facts.\nThe appellant is a citizen of the Dominican Republic. He was born in that country on October 2, 1921. He entered Canada on November 4, 1961, to visit his children who were attending school in Ottawa. He has remained in this country ever since. At the time of his entry he held a diplomatic passport issued by the Dominican Republic which was based on his having been appointed Commercial Attach\u00e9 for the Dominican Republic in Iran; endorsed on this passport was a Canadian diplomatic visa issued at the Canadian Embassy in the said Republic. The appellant\u2019s appointment as Commercial Attach\u00e9 was cancelled at the beginning of January 1962, and he exchanged his diplomatic passport for an ordinary passport which was issued to him at the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Ottawa on January 12, 1962. This ordinary passport was cancelled but was re-validated at the same Embassy on May 29, 1962; it will expire on May 29, 1964.\nIt is common ground that the appellant entered Canada lawfully as a non-immigrant. Following the exchange of his diplomatic passport for an ordinary passport he decided to seek to become a resident of Canada and early in March 1962, pursuant to s. 7(3) of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d, he reported to an immigration officer at Ottawa that he had ceased to be a non-immigrant; he was told to return on March 29, 1962, for a further interview.\nOn March 29, 1962, the appellant was interviewed by an immigration officer at whose request he signed an application to become a permanent resident of Canada. This officer examined the appellant under oath and told him that he would be informed of the decision made on his application. Thereafter the appellant attended at the same office every two weeks to inquire whether a decision had been reached. On June 13, 1962, the appellant received a letter dated June 11, 1962, signed by the Immigration Officer in charge at the Immigration Port of Ottawa, stating that his application was refused and that he was required to leave Canada within 30 days.\nOn July 11, 1962, the appellant received a letter dated July 10, 1962, from Collingwood Schreiber, Special Inquiry Officer of the Department of Immigration, stating that his application had been reviewed by an immigration officer who had made a report pursuant to s. 23 of the Act which said, \u201cYou are a member of the prohibited class referred to in Section 5, paragraph \u2018t\u2019 of the Immigration Act by reason of the fact that (i) you are not in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa issued by the visa officer as required by subsection (1) of section 28 of the Immigration Regulations Part I, (ii) your passport does not bear a medical certificate duly signed by a medical officer nor are you in possession of a medical certificate in the form prescribed by the Minister as required by subsection (1) of section 29 of the Immigration Regulations Part I.\u201d This letter required the appellant to appear for a special inquiry on Tuesday, July 17, 1962, at the Immigration Office in Ottawa.\nOn the following day the appellant attended at the Immigration Office at Ottawa and asked for arrangements to be made to enable him to be medically examined by a medical officer appointed by the Minister so that he could obtain a medical certificate as required by the Regulations but the representative of the Immigration Office informed the appellant that there was nothing for him to do but wait and present himself at the special inquiry.\nOn July 17, 1962, the appellant attended at the Immigration Office and a special inquiry under the Act was held by the Special Inquiry Officer, Mr. Schreiber. At the end of the hearing the decision was announced and an order for the deportation of the appellant was made. The order recites that under s. 28 of the Immigration Act and on the basis of the evidence adduced at the inquiry held at the Immigration Office of Ottawa on July 17, 1962, the Special Inquiry Officer had reached the decision that the appellant might not come into Canada or remain in Canada as of right in that (i) he was not a Canadian citizen, (ii) he was not a person having a Canadian domicile and that he was a member of a prohibited class described under paragraph \u201ct\u201d of s. 5 of the Immigration Act as he could not or did not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of the Act or the Regulations by reason of the fact that (i) he was not in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa issued by a visa officer as required by subs. (1) of s. 28 of the Regulations of the Immigration Act, Part I, and (ii) his passport did not bear a medical certificate duly signed by a medical officer, nor was he in possession of a medical certificate in the form prescribed by the Minister as required by subs. (1) of s. 29 of the Regulations of the Immigration Act, Part I.\nAn appeal taken to the Immigration Appeal Board was dismissed on August 9, 1962. Representations were made to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, but the order for deportation was not altered.\nThe decision of the Minister not to interfere with the deportation order was communicated to the appellant\u2019s solicitor by a letter dated October 25, 1962, and on November 1, 1962, the application to the Supreme Court of On- tario to quash that order was launched. The notice of motion was directed to Mr. Schreiber and he returned to the Court the record of his inquiry including the transcript of the evidence taken before him on July 17, 1962. In support of the motion was filed an affidavit made by the appellant in which were set out the facts recited above amongst others.\nThe motion was heard by McRuer C.J.H.C. on November 30, 1962, and was dismissed at the conclusion of the argument without recorded reasons. An appeal heard by the Court of Appeal on March 4, 1963, was similarly dismissed without recorded reasons. It would appear that the learned Chief Justice of the High Court and the Court of Appeal regarded themselves as bound by the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal in. Ex parte Mannira[4], a decision which counsel for the appellant submits should be over-ruled.\nIn support of the appeal counsel for the appellant submits that the Special Inquiry Officer was without jurisdiction to make the deportation order for the following reasons:\n(a) Regulation 28(1) is ultra vires the Governor in Council as the said regulation purports to vest in a visa officer absolute and uncontrolled discretion to grant or refuse a visa as a condition of admission to Canada without giving any reasons therefor, or granting any hearing to the would-be immigrant.\n(b) Because Regulation 28(1) as applied in the present case is inconsistent with the provisions of s. 7, subs. (3) of the Immigration Act.\n(c) Because Regulation 29, in requiring that no immigrant should be granted landing in Canada without a medical certificate, necessarily contemplates that the immigrant be given an opportunity to appear before a medical officer who might grant or refuse a medical certificate in accordance with the regulations and a deportation order made on the basis of the absence of a medical certificate when no opportunity is afforded to obtain one is invalid.\n(d) In the alternative, Regulation 29 is ultra vires the Governor in Council.\n(e) Because the proceedings in this case effectively denied to the appellant a hearing as to his admissibility provided for by the Immigration Act.\n(f) The order of deportation is inconsistent with the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, s. 2(e).\nIf, but only if, the deportation order made by the Special Inquiry Officer was made under the authority and in accordance with the provisions of the Act the Court would be without jurisdiction to quash it, by reason of the provisions of s. 39. In dealing with the predecessor of that section in Samejima v. The King[5], Duff J., as he then was, said:\nThe chief question I desire to discuss is the effect of section 23 of the Immigration Act. The words, \u201chad made or given under the authority and in accordance with the provisions of this Act relating to the detention or deportation of any rejected immigrant, passenger or other person, upon any ground whatsoever, unless such person is a Canadian citizen or has Canadian domicile\u201d are an essential part of this section; and its disqualifying provisions obviously can only take effect where the conditions expressed in these words are fulfilled. In particular, the phrase \u201cin accordance with the provisions of this Act\u201d cannot be neglected; their meaning is plain. The \u201corder\u201d returned as justifying the detention must be \u201cin accordance with the provisions of this Act\u201d. It must not, that is to say, be essentially an order made in disregard of some substantive condition laid down by the Act.\nIt is necessary to consider the application of the relevant provisions of the Act to the facts of this particular case.\nSection 7(3) of the Act is as follows:\n(3) Where any person who entered Canada as a non-immigrant ceases to be a non\u2011immigrant or to be in the particular class in which he was admitted as a non\u2011immigrant and, in either case, remains in Canada, he shall forthwith report such facts to the nearest immigration officer and present himself for examination at such place and time as he may be directed and shall, for the purposes of the examination and all other purposes under this Act, be deemed to be a person seeking admission to Canada.\nThe appellant complied with the terms of this subsection.\nIt is not questioned that the Special Inquiry Officer, Mr. Schreiber, had authority to enter upon and hold the hearing which took place before him on July 17, 1962. The procedure to be followed and the duties of the Special Inquiry Officer in respect of the hearing are laid down in s. 27 and subss. (1) and (2) and (3) of s. 28 of the Act which read as follows:\n27 (1) An inquiry by a Special Inquiry Officer shall be separate and apart from the public but in the presence of the person concerned wherever practicable.\n(2) The person concerned, if he so desires and at his own expense, shall have the right to obtain and to be represented by counsel at his hearing.\n(3) The Special Inquiry Officer may at the hearing receive and base his decision upon evidence considered credible or trustworthy by him in the circumstances of each case.\n(4) Where an inquiry relates to a person seeking to come into Canada, the burden of proving that he is not prohibited from coming into Canada rests upon him. 28 (1) At the conclusion of the hearing of an inquiry, the Special Inquiry Officer shall render his decision as soon as possible and shall render it in the presence of the person concerned wherever practicable.\n(2) Where the Special Inquiry Officer decides that the person concerned is a person who\n(a) may come into or remain in Canada as of right;\n(b) in the case of a person seeking admission to Canada, is not a member of a prohibited class; or\n(c) in the case of a person who is in Canada, is not proven to be a person described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of subsection (1) of section 19,\nhe shall, upon rendering his decision, admit or let such person come into Canada or remain therein, as the case may be.\n(3) In the case of a person other than a person referred to in subsection (2), the Special Inquiry Officer shall, upon rendering his decision, make an order for the deportation of such person.\nThe inquiry was held in the presence of the appellant and he was represented by counsel.\nIt has already been mentioned that the Special Inquiry Officer returned to the Court the transcript of the evidence taken before him. There is nothing in that evidence to suggest that the appellant is a member of any prohibited class other than the class described in clause (t) of s. 5, upon which the decision of the Special Inquiry Officer was based. In particular, the unchallenged evidence shewed that the appellant was possessed of ample means and that he and the other members of his family were in excellent health.\nBy reason of the concluding words of subs. (3) of s. 7, quoted above,\u2014\u201cand shall, for the purposes of the examination and all other purposes under this Act, be deemed to be a person seeking admission to Canada\u201d the duty of the Special Inquiry Officer was that prescribed by clause (b) of subs. (2) of s. 28, quoted above, that is to say, he was required to decide whether the appellant was or was not a member of a prohibited class.\nThe Special Inquiry Officer having decided to make a deportation order was required by s. 13(a) of Immigration Regulations, Part II to forthwith inform the appellant \u201cas to the provisions of the Act or the Regulations pursuant to which the order was made\u201d. This duty was duly performed.\nThe answer to the question whether or not the deportation order was made in accordance with the provisions of the Act depends upon the construction of the relevant provisions of the Act and of the Regulations and upon whether the Regulations relied on by the respondent are intra vires of the Governor General in Council.\nIn entering upon the question of construction, the Act and the valid relevant Regulations must be read together and considered as a whole; and it is necessary to bear in mind the rule of construction expressed in the maxim \u201cVerba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel aptitudinem personae\u201d. (Bac. Max. Reg. 10). The following passage in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 9th ed., 1946, at p. 63 has often been quoted with approval:\nIt is in the interpretation of general words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the particular subject-matter with reference to which the words are used finds its most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more or less elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter. While expressing truly enough all that the Legislature intended, they frequently express more, in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore, a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be construed as particular if the intention be particular; that is, they must be understood as used with reference to the subject-matter in the mind of the Legislature, and limited to it.\nWe are particularly concerned with s. 5(t) of the Act and with ss. 28(1) and 29(1) of the Immigration Regulations, Part I. These read as follows:\n5. No person, other than a person referred to in subsection (2) of section 7, shall be admitted to Canada if he is a member of any of the following classes of persons:\n* * *\n(t) persons who cannot or do not fulfil or comply with any of the conditions or requirements of this Act or the regulations or any orders lawfully made or given under this Act or the regulations.\n(Subs. (2) of s. 7 has no application to the facts of this case).\n28 (1) Every immigrant who seeks to land in Canada shall be in possession of a valid and subsisting immigrant visa issued to him by a visa officer and bearing a serial number which has been recorded by the officer in a register prescribed by the Minister for that purpose, and unless he is in possession of such visa, he shall not be granted landing in Canada.\n29 (1) No immigrant shall be granted landing in Canada (a) if his passport, certificate of identity or other travel document required by these Regulations does not bear a medical certificate duly signed by a medical officer, or\n(b) if he is not in possession of a medical certificate, in the form prescribed by the Minister, showing that he does not fall within one of the classes described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (s) of section 5 of the Act. The evidence of the appellant taken at the hearing on July 17, 1962, established that at that time he was not in possession of an immigrant visa, his passport did not bear a medical certificate and he was not in possession of a medical certificate in the form referred to in s. 29(1) (b). On proof or admission of these facts the Special Inquiry Officer decided that he was required by subs. (3) of s. 28 to make an order of deportation. This view was supported by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Mannira, supra, in which case a similar order made by the same Special Inquiry Officer was ordered to be quashed by a judgment of Ferguson J.[6], but was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nIf the words of s. 5(t) and s. 7(3) of the Act and ss. 28 and 29 of the Regulations are interpreted literally they would seem to require the making of a deportation order in this case; but, in my opinion, the general words with which s. 7(3) concludes cannot be applied literally to a person who has for some time been lawfully in Canada and who entered Canada under such circumstances that he would not have and would not be required to have either an immigrant visa as described in s. 28(1) or a medical certificate as described in s. 29(1) of the Regulations. Such a literal application would in most, if not all, cases arising under s. 7(3) render the inquiry a mere formality bound to result in the making of a deportation order; the effect of the subsection would be to require the person concerned to return whence he came rather than to require the holding of an inquiry as to whether he was a member of any prohibited class.\nWhen the Act is read as a whole its purpose is plain. It regulates the admission to Canada of persons who are neither Canadian citizens nor possessed of Canadian domicile as defined in the Act and the expulsion of such persons who may have been allowed to enter. A person who seeks to enter Canada as an immigrant is entitled to a hearing (s. 20(1) and s. 27 of the Act). The burden of proving that he is not prohibited from coming into Canada rests upon him, (s. 27(4)), but if he succeeds in proving this before the Special Inquiry Officer, it is the duty of that officer to admit him and the applicant has a corresponding right to be admitted (s. 28(2)(b)). The prohibited classes are numerous. Section 5 contains twenty subdivisions, a number of which in turn contain the descriptions of several classes. In addition to these the Governor General in Council has authority under s. 61 of the Act to prescribe additional prohibited classes.\nThe vital question in the case of a would-be immigrant is whether in fact he comes within any prohibited class.\nAssuming for the purposes of construction that s. 28 of the Immigration Regulations, Part I, is valid, it contemplates that a person in a foreign country who wishes to immigrate to Canada shall obtain an immigrant visa from a visa officer which by s. 2(h) of the Regulations is defined as meaning:\n(i) an immigration officer stationed on duty outside of Canada and authorized by the Minister to issue visas or letters of pre-examination for the purpose of section 28, and\n(ii) in a country where no such immigration officer is stationed\n(A) a diplomatic or consular officer of Canada, or\n(B) a diplomatic or consular officer of the United Kingdom if there is no diplomatic or consular officer of Canada in the country,\u2026\nThe regulations are silent as to what are the duties of the visa officer but it may, I think, be assumed that he would make some sort of inquiry as to whether the applicant for the visa came within any of the prohibited classes so as to prevent a person setting out on the journey to Canada when it appeared probable that he could not be admitted. This section of the Regulations does not create a disability to admission to Canada in the nature of an additional prohibited class, rather it envisages a preliminary inquiry as to whether the applicant falls within any of the prohibited classes already created. It is procedural rather than substantive; and, in my opinion, the general words of ss. 5(t) and 7(3) of the Act must be construed as rendering s. 28 inapplicable to an applicant who is in fact at the time of seeking admission lawfully present in Canada. To hold that in the case of such a person a preliminary inquiry must be held in the foreign country whence he came would be contrary to the maxim, lex neminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia, which this Court has held may be of assistance in construing a statutory provision; vide The Queen v. Crawford[7]. If the Special Inquiry Officer finds it necessary to make inquiries or obtain evidence in the country whence the applicant came, the regulations give him ample powers to adjourn the hearing.\nTurning to s. 29 of the Regulations its purpose is similarly to prevent a would-be immigrant setting out for Canada if he falls within classes (a), (b), (c) or (s) of s. 5 of the Act and in so far as it contemplates a medical certificate obtained in the country whence the applicant came it also is, in my opinion, inapplicable to the case of a person who has for some time prior to making application for admission been lawfully present in Canada. This is not to say that the appellant does not have to obtain a medical certificate to establish that he does not fall within any of the classes mentioned. In the case before us there is uncontradicted sworn testimony that the applicant is in perfect health and that he asked to be informed to whom he could submit himself for an examination. To deny him this information and a reasonable time in which to obtain a certificate would, in my opinion, be to deny him the sort of hearing to which under the Act and the common law he was entitled.\nThe view that the provisions of ss. 28 and 29 of the Regulations deal with preliminary matters is strengthened by the wording of s. 30:\nThe passing of any test or medical examination outside of Canada or the issue of a visa, letter of pre-examination or medical certificate as provided for in these Regulations is not conclusive of any matter that is relevant in determining the admissibility of any person to Canada.\nFor the above reasons it is my opinion that the Special Inquiry Officer erred in his interpretation and application of the Act and of the Regulations and that he should have proceeded to inquire and decide whether the appellant was in fact a member of any prohibited class and should have given the appellant an opportunity to obtain a medical certificate shewing that he did not fall within any of the classes (a), (b), (c) and (s) of s. 5 of the Act. It follows from this that the deportation order which he made was not made in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nSince in reaching this conclusion I have assumed, without deciding, that ss. 28 and 29 of the Regulations Part I are intra vires of the Governor General in Council, I do not find it necessary to decide the question of their validity and express no final opinion upon it.\nHowever, since the judgments in the Courts below and the reasons of the majority in this Court are founded, in part at least, upon the view that s. 28(1) of the Regulations, Part I, is valid and is applicable to the appellant in the circumstances of this case, I venture to suggest that the reasons of the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Mannira, supra, do not provide an adequate answer to the argument of counsel for the appellant based on the decision of this Court in Attorney General of Canada v. Brent[8].\nIf, as a matter of construction, s. 28(1) of the Regulations, Part I, casts upon the visa officer the duty of issuing a non-immigrant visa whenever an applicant therefor establishes that he is not a member of any prohibited class then, for the reasons given above, it is not, in my opinion, applicable in the particular circumstances of the case at bar. If, on the other hand, this section of the Regulations casts no such duty on the visa officer it results that it is committed to his uncontrolled individual judgment to grant or withhold the visa as he sees fit and the delegation of authority to him is even wider than that which in the Brent case, this Court held to be ultra vires of the Governor in Council.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and of McRuer C.J.H.C. and direct that an order be made quashing the deportation order made by the Special Inquiry Officer on July 17, 1962.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vincent, Addy, Charbonneau, Mercier & Sirois, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

La voiture appartenait au d\u00e9fendeur G et elle \u00e9tait conduite par le fils mineur du d\u00e9fendeur B \u00e0 qui le fils mineur de G avait permis de prendre le volant. Dans l'action, bas\u00e9e sur les arts. 1053 et 1054 du Code Civil, intent\u00e9e aux deux p\u00e8res seuls, il fut all\u00e9gu\u00e9 contre G que l'automobile \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueuse, qu'il avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 sa voiture \u00e0 son fils mineur qu'il savait \u00eatre un conducteur t\u00e9m\u00e9raire, incomp\u00e9tent et imprudent, et qui \u00e0 son tour avait permis au fils de B de prendre le volant.

Lemieux, C.R., pour les d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLe juge en chef:\u2014Le 6 septembre 1953, vers 11:30 p.m., Madeleine Dagenais, alors fille mineure, \u00e9tait passag\u00e8re dans une automobile qui, au moment de l'accident, \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur Josephat Gervais de St-Antoine-Abb\u00e9, district de Beauharnois, et qui circulait \u00e0 ce moment sur la route n\u00b0 4 venant de Huntingdon en direction de Ormstown.\nDans sa d\u00e9claration le demandeur es-qualit\u00e9, tuteur de Madeleine Dagenais, all\u00e8gue qu'en arrivant \u00e0 une courbe assez prononc\u00e9e, l'automobile du d\u00e9fendeur Josephat Gervais, conduite par Carmel Beauchamp, fils mineur du d\u00e9fendeur Josephat Beauchamp, circulait \u00e0 une vitesse excessive et dangereuse sur un pav\u00e9 glissant alors qu'il pleuvait et que la visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait mauvaise. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 en outre qu'en approchant la courbe, Carmel Beauchamp, conducteur, a perdu le contr\u00f4le de la voiture et la porte avant du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit s'ouvrit subitement et la demanderesse qui \u00e9tait assise sur le si\u00e8ge avant fut projet\u00e9e hors de l'automobile, et elle tomba sur un amoncellement de roches et de pierres sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit de la route et la voiture alla s'arr\u00eater plus loin sur le bord du foss\u00e9.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que Madeleine Dagenais a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e tr\u00e8s gravement et a d\u00fb \u00eatre conduite imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l'accident \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital d'Ormstown, et la preuve m\u00e9dicale r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'elle sera pratiquement invalide pour le reste de ses jours.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante, maintenant fille majeure, qui a repris l'instance, que le d\u00e9fendeur Josephat Gervais est responsable de cet accident parce qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile dans laquelle la victime \u00e9tait passag\u00e8re, que la porte avant droite \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueuse et en mauvaise condition, que Josephat Gervais n'avait pas pris les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers qui voyageaient dans sa voiture, et qu'il avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 son automobile \u00e0 Claude Gervais, son fils mineur, et que ce dernier a permis \u00e0 Carmel Beauchamp, fils mineur de Josephat Beauchamp, de conduire cette voiture. On pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que Josephat Gervais savait que son fils Claude \u00e9tait un conducteur t\u00e9m\u00e9raire, incomp\u00e9tent et imprudent, qu'il conduisait son automobile d'une fa\u00e7on dangereuse, et que ce fait \u00e9tait de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique.\nOn a \u00e9galement soumis \u00e0 la Cour que Claude Gervais conduisait sous l'influence de la boisson, qu'il transportait dans son automobile des boissons alcooliques qu'il consommait sur le bord de la route, qu'il avait l'habitude de laisser conduire la voiture par d'autres jeunes gens et jeunes filles qui \u00e9taient des conducteurs incomp\u00e9tents et imprudents et qui faisaient \u00e9galement un usage excessif et immod\u00e9r\u00e9 de bi\u00e8re et de boissons alcooliques. Josephat Gervais n'aurait pas exerc\u00e9 la surveillance voulue sur les all\u00e9es et venues de son fils mineur Claude qui se servait \u00e0 volont\u00e9 de la voiture de son p\u00e8re sans que ce dernier s'assur\u00e2t au pr\u00e9alable qu'il en ferait un bon usage et qu'il la conduirait avec comp\u00e9tence et en \u00e9tat de sobri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQuant \u00e0 l'autre intim\u00e9 Josephat Beauchamp, p\u00e8re de Carmel Beauchamp qui conduisait la voiture, on le tient responsable de cet accident parce qu'il est le p\u00e8re de Carmel, fils mineur, et qu'il a autoris\u00e9 l'\u00e9mission d'un permis de conduire pour l'ann\u00e9e 1953, date de l'accident, alors que son fils \u00e9tait un conducteur incomp\u00e9tent et imprudent.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 reposerait sur les \u00e9paules de Carmel Beauchamp, comme auteur du quasi-d\u00e9lit, vu qu'il s'est engag\u00e9 dans une courbe prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 une vitesse excessive et dangereuse, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause que Madeleine Dagenais fut projet\u00e9e hors de l'automobile.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de Josephat Beauchamp proviendrait du fait qu'il savait que son fils mineur avait l'habitude de conduire son automobile d'une fa\u00e7on imprudente, qu'il \u00e9tait souvent sous l'influence de la boisson, et que le d\u00e9fendeur Josephat Beauchamp n'exer\u00e7ait aucune surveillance sur les all\u00e9es et venues de son fils et qu'il lui pr\u00eatait m\u00eame sa propre automobile. On reproche au d\u00e9fendeur Beauchamp d'avoir donn\u00e9 son consentement \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission d'un permis de conduire pour l'ann\u00e9e 1953, et c'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante qu'il n'a pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils une \u00e9ducation s\u00e9rieuse et que ce dernier avait une conduite d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 des deux d\u00e9fendeurs-intimes reposerait donc sur les arts. 1053 et 1054 du Code Civil, en ce sens qu'il y a eu faute de leur part (culpa in eligendo), que la voiture n'\u00e9tait pas en bon \u00e9tat, que la porte \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueuse, et aussi parce qu'ils n'auraient pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre la responsabilit\u00e9 qui s'attache \u00e0 leur qualit\u00e9 de p\u00e8re (1054 para. 6). Ils auraient failli de d\u00e9montrer qu'ils n'auraient pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nM. le Juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, a rejet\u00e9 l'action. Il a retenu la faute du jeune Carmel Beauchamp, conducteur de la voiture, soulignant qu'il n'aurait pas pris toutes les pr\u00e9cautions requises pour emp\u00eacher la voiture de quitter la route comme elle l'a fait. Il retient aussi la faute de Jean-Claude Gervais qui, selon lui, \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de Carmel Beauchamp. Mais ces deux derniers n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivis, et la seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est donc de savoir si les deux d\u00e9fendeurs sont responsables des actes de leurs fils. La Cour d'Appel2 a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, M. le Juge Bissonnette ayant enregistr\u00e9 sa dissidence aurait maintenu l'action jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $23,781.70.\nJe m'accorde avec la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel que les intim\u00e9s ne peuvent \u00eatre recherch\u00e9s en dommages, en vertu de l'art. 1053 du Code Civil. Sous l'empire de cet article, il incombe \u00e0 la victime du d\u00e9lit ou du quasi-d\u00e9lit de prouver la faute, soit qu'elle naisse d'une imprudence, d'une n\u00e9gligence ou d'une inhabilet\u00e9. Il me para\u00eet clair, en vertu des jugements de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour d'Appel, que la voiture pr\u00eat\u00e9e par Josephat Gervais \u00e9tait une voiture en bon \u00e9tat, que la porte du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit fonctionnait bien et que son fils, de m\u00eame que Carmel Beauchamp, \u00e9taient des chauffeurs exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, et que ce n'\u00e9tait pas une n\u00e9gligence de la part des intim\u00e9s de leur confier la conduite de cette voiture. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la cour d'Appel, \u00e0 mon sens, ont eu raison de statuer ainsi.\nEn ce qui concerne la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de l'art. 1054 du Code Civil, les principes qui d\u00e9terminent la responsabilit\u00e9 des parents sont bien \u00e9tablis. Vide Alain v. Hardy3; Foley v. Marcoux4.\nDans ces causes, o\u00f9 la jurisprudence a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement \u00e9tablie, cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la responsabilit\u00e9 dispara\u00eet, si le p\u00e8re a agi comme un homme prudent, s'il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils une bonne \u00e9ducation et s'il a exerc\u00e9 sur lui une surveillance ad\u00e9quate. Alors l\u00e0, il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. Comme cette Cour le dit dans Alain v. Hardy:\nLe p\u00e8re n'est pas tenu de d\u00e9montrer qu'il y avait impossibilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te d'emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. En effet, si le texte devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on, et s'il fallait lui donner une telle rigidit\u00e9, seule la preuve du cas fortuit, de la force majeure ou de l'acte d'un tiers, pourraient faire dispara\u00eetre la responsabilit\u00e9. Il doit y avoir plus de flexibilit\u00e9, et ce qu'il faut rechercher, c'est toujours la faute, et s'il y a eu surveillance, bonne \u00e9ducation, pr\u00eat d'une auto \u00e0 un chauffeur comp\u00e9tent, on peut dire que le p\u00e8re a agi comme un homme prudent, et il est alors exempt de responsabilit\u00e9.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, cette clause d'exon\u00e9ration doit trouver la pl\u00e9nitude de son application, et lib\u00e9rer les deux d\u00e9fendeurs-intimes de toute responsabilit\u00e9 civile d\u00e9coulant de l'art. 1054 C.C. C'est ce qu'ont pens\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s et la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour d'Appel, et sur cette question de responsabilit\u00e9, comme d'ailleurs celle d\u00e9rivant de l'art. 1053, o\u00f9 il ne s'agit que de questions de faits, je crois qu'il n'y a pas lieu que cette Cour intervienne.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens si les intim\u00e9s les demandent.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens si demand\u00e9s.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, appelante: Maurice Bourassa, Verdun.\nProcureur des d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s: Albert Lemieux, Valleyfield.\n1 [1962] B.R. 866.\n2 [1962] B.R. 866.\n3 [1951] R.C.S. 540 \u00e0 552.\n4 [1957] R.C.S. 650.\n"

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1963: March 6; 1963: October 1.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nLabour\u2014Collective agreement\u2014Provisions imposed by arbitration award\u2014Alleged error in retroactive clause\u2014Power to amend\u2014Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A, s. 17\u2014An Act respecting Municipal and School Corporations and their Employees, 1949, 13 Geo. VI (Que.), c. 26, s. 12.\nOn February 1, 1954, an arbitration council, appointed under the Act respecting Municipal and School Corporations and their Employees, 1949, 13 Geo. VI (Que.), c. 26, made an award prescribing the hours of work and wage scales to be in force between the appellant City and its employees. Attached to and forming part of the award was the text of a collective agreement. The award was made retroactive to a specified date, 13 months back. Subsequently, at the instance of the employer, the arbitration council amended the award on the ground of alleged clerical error to provide that all the provisions as to hours of work should become effective only as of the date of the original award.\nThe plaintiff, an employee of the City, sued for a balance of wages of $829.24, being the amount he would have received had the wage increase been given effect retroactively. The City contended that the agreement had been validly amended and, alternatively, that the award was null since it was made retroactive for a period of 13 months while under s. 12 of the Act it could not be made retroactive for more than 12 months. The trial judge dismissed the action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The City was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe award was not null because it was made retroactive for a period exceeding that which was permitted by the Act. The effect of s. 12 in the circumstances of this case was to render the agreement retroactive for 12 months.\nThe terms of the agreement were clear and unambiguous and under them the plaintiff was entitled to the amount which has been awarded to him.\nThe council had no power to make the alterations. It had the right to interpret the award and to correct a simple clerical error, but not to amend it. The error, if there was an error, which the Council purported to correct, was not a clerical error. It was doubtful as to whether it could be said that the council was in error in making the award retroactive. However, if they erred in so doing it was in a matter of substance and not in expression.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Lesage J. Appeal dismissed.\nToussaint McNicoll, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nYves Pratte, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec2, which reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge and gave judgment in favour of the respondent for $889.24 with interest and costs.\nThe facts are not in dispute. For a number of years the respondent has been employed by the appellant as a truck driver (snow-blower and watering truck, Class A) and the mis-en-cause, Le Syndicat National Catholique des Employ\u00e9s Municipaux de Jonqui\u00e8re Inc., has been duly certified by the Labour Relations Board of the Province of Quebec as the bargaining agent of all employees of the appellant.\nPrior to December 31, 1952, the working conditions of the respondent were governed by the terms of a collective labour agreement made between the appellant and the mis-en-cause, which terminated on the last mentioned date. The appellant and the mis-en-cause were unable to agree upon the terms of a new collective labour agreement and the dispute was referred to a Council of Arbitration, hereinafter referred to as \"The Council\", set up in accordance with the provisions of An Act respecting Municipal and School Corporations and their employees, Statutes of Quebec, 13 Geo. VI, c. 26, hereinafter referred to as \"The Act\". The Council heard the parties and made its award on February 1, 1954.\nBy this award the Council prescribed the working conditions which were to be in force between the appellant and its employees for the two-year period from January 1, 1953 to December 31, 1954. Attached to and forming part of the award was the text of a collective labour agreement to which the award referred as follows:\nPour conclure, le pr\u00e9sent tribunal ordonne aux parties de signer la convention collective dont le texte est annex\u00e9.\nA d\u00e9faut par les parties de signer ladite convention collective, le tribunal d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que la pr\u00e9sente sentence arbitrale aura le m\u00eame effet que la signature par les parties de ladite convention collective.\nThe award was signed by all members of the Council although the member appointed by the union appended a report dissenting in part; it was delivered on February 1, 1954, to the clerk of the Council to be communicated to the parties and was immediately communicated to them.\nThe relevant terms of the collective agreement created by the award, particularly those relating to hours of work and wage scales, are set out in the reasons of Montgomery J. and need not be repeated.\nThe opening paragraph of art. 20 of the agreement reads as follows:\nLa pr\u00e9sente convention entrera en vigueur r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 1953 pour une p\u00e9riode de deux ann\u00e9es, devant se terminer le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1954.\nIt was argued by the appellant at the trial and in the Court of Queen's Bench that the whole agreement was null because it was made retroactive for thirteen months while under s. 12 of the Act it could not be made retroactive for more than twelve months. I did not understand this argument to be pressed before us but, in any case, I would reject it for the reasons given by the learned trial judge which were quoted and accepted by Montgomery J. The effect of s. 12 in the circumstances of this case is to render the agreement retroactive to February 1, 1953, instead of to January 1. This view was apparently taken by the legal advisers of the respondent as his claim was restricted to the period from February 1, 1953 to February 1, 1954.\nI agree with Montgomery J. that the terms of the agreement are clear and unambiguous and that under them the respondent is entitled to the amount which has been awarded to him.\nThe question on which there has been a difference of opinion between the learned trial judge and the Court of Queen's Bench is whether the terms of the agreement forming part of the award of February 1, 1954, were validly varied by a document dated February 24, 1954, signed by two members of the Council, under the following circumstances. On or about February 6, 1954, the appellant gave notice to the members of the Council of a motion asking that the Council correct a manifest clerical error in the award concerning the retroactivity of the provisions as to hours of work. The member of the Council appointed by the union notified the Council that he refused to take part in the hearing of the motion on the ground that the award as delivered represented the decision arrived at by the Council and that it was without jurisdiction to alter it. The remaining members of the Council heard the motion and on February 24, 1954, purported to deliver a judgment amending the award and the agreement forming part thereof to provide that all the provisions as to hours of work should become effective only as of February 1, 1954.\nI agree with the unanimous opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench that the Council had no power to make this alteration.\nI wish to adopt the following passage in the reasons of Montgomery J.\nI am satisfied that the council had the right to interpret the award but not to amend it. This does not mean, however, that it did not have the right to correct a simple clerical error. Anybody having quasi-judicial powers must have such a right, otherwise the consequences of a simple slip in drafting an award might be disastrous. The right of a court to correct a clerical error is expressly recognized by Article 546 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This article is not directly applicable in the present instance, but we may, in my opinion, apply the same principle. I find myself in complete agreement with the reasons of Montgomery J. for holding that the error, if error it was, which the majority of the Council purported to correct by the document of February 24, 1954, was not a clerical error. There is nothing that I wish to add to those reasons.\nI share the doubts of Montgomery J. as to whether it can be said that the Council was in error in making the award retroactive; if, however, they erred in so doing it was in a matter of substance; there was no error in expressing in the words of the award and of the agreement which formed an integral part of it the decision at which the Council had arrived.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: T.

These applications were made under s. 41(1) of the Patent Act and they claimed the substance as produced by the various processes. Letters Patent were subsequently granted pursuant to these applications. The respondent later filed an application for Letters Patent entitled \"Anti-diabetic compositions containing sulphonyl ureas\". This application contained 15 claims, all of which related to a medicine consisting of the sulphonyl urea diluted by a carrier. The Commissioner of Patents rejected these composition claims on two grounds: (1) that the applicant was entitled only to one patent for an invention and that the composition claims did not inventively distinguish from the product claims already granted, and (2) that the claims related to substances prepared by a chemical process and intended for medicine and were prohibited by s. 41(1) of the Act because they amounted to an attempt to protect the sub- stance otherwise than by a patentable process by which it was produced. In allowing an appeal from the Commissioner's decision, the Exchequer Court held that although the mixture was intended for a medicine, it was a substance\u2014a new substance not prepared or produced by a chemical process. It went on -to hold that the antidiabetic composition was new and useful and therefore patentable. It also held that there was inventive ingenuity.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe respondent had a patent under s. 41 of the Patent Act for the invention of a medicine. It now wanted another patent for the medicine in a diluted form, that is, mixed with some inert substance, called \"an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\", that would enable it to be put on the market for consumption. The addition of an inert carrier was nothing more than dilution and did not result in a further invention over and above that of the medicinal itself. If a patent subsisted for the new medicinal substance, a separate patent could not subsist for that substance merely diluted. If a legal impediment existed against a patent claim for the new medicinal substance, namely, s. 41(1) of the Act, that legal impediment was equally applicable to the diluted substance.\nThe mixing of a patented chemical with a carrier was not new and it was not the result of inventive ingenuity; it was still a substance identical in all respects except dilution with a substance produced by a chemical process and for which a patent had been granted under s. 41(1).\nCommissioner of Patents v. Ciba Ltd., [1959] S.C.R. 378, discussed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents to reject an application for a patent. Appeal allowed.\nGordon P. Henderson, Q.C., and D. Bowman, for the appellant.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and Russel S. Smart, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The Commissioner of Patent appeals from the judgment of the Exchequer Court', which allowed an appeal from his decision to reject an application for a patent\n[Page 51].\nOn June 5, 1956, the respondent filed a parent and 9 divisional applications all relating to different processes for producing an antidiabetic preparation, sulphonyl urea. These applications were made under s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, and they claimed the substance as produced by the various processes. Letters Patent were subsequently granted pursuant to these applications.\nOn June 28, 1957, the respondent filed an application for Letters Patent entitled \"Anti-diabetic compositions containing sulphonyl ureas\". This application contains 15 claims, all of which are in issue in this appeal. These claims\nall relate to a medicine consisting of the sulphonyl urea diluted by a carrier.\nOn January 13, 1960, the Commissioner of Patents rejected these composition claims on two grounds. The first was that the applicant was entitled only to one patent for an invention and that the composition claims did not inventively distinguish from the product claims already granted. The inventive feature of the claimed composition was in the sulphonyl urea compound and not in the association of the compound with the carrier.\nThe second ground was that the claims related to substances prepared by a chemical process and intended for medicine and were prohibited by s. 41(1) of the Act because they amounted to an attempt to protect the substance otherwise than by a patentable process by which it was produced. By the time the Commissioner had rejected the application in question in this appeal, the respondent had already received, on September 1, 1959, the 10 Letters Patent for the substance and the processes pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Patent Act.\nWhat the respondent is seeking can be put in very plain words. It has a patent under s. 41 for the invention of the medicine. It now wants another patent for the medicine in a diluted form, that is, mixed with some inert substance, called \"an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\", that will enable it to be put on the market for consumption. Claim 1 in the application under consideration may be taken as an example. It reads as follows:\n1. An antidiabetic preparation effective on oral administration to reduce the blood sugar level, said preparation comprising as the active blood sugar lowering ingredient a sulphonyl urea of the formula R-SO2-NH-CO-NR-R1 in which; R is a radical selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl having up to two sub- stituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl; alkoxy and halogen, and aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon containing 3-8 carbon atoms; RI represents a radical selected from the group consisting of aliphatic and\ncycloaliphatic hydrocarbon containing 2-8 carbon atoms, or a salt thereof, and an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefore.\nThe only difference between this claim and the following claims is that each claims sulphonyl urea of a formula that is different in definition, together with the carrier.\nThe case was argued both in the Exchequer Court and here on an agreed statement of facts. I set out paragraphs 6, 13, 15 and 17:\n6. In application No. 731,948, each of the claims is for an antidiabetic preparation comprising a sulphonyl urea or its salts and an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, and no process was claimed. Such preparation would consist of a sulphonyl urea mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed or encapsulated by a carrier in the form of a capsule.\n13. The mixing, the diluting, the enclosing or encapsulating of a sulphonyl urea with an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is not a chemical process.\n15. At the effective filing date of application No. 731,948, a person skilled in the art could, if so requested, have made a preparation of the sulphonyl ureas or their salts and an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier theref or without the exercise of any inventive ingenuity.\n17. The only utility disclosed in application No. 731,948 for the anti-diabetic preparations claimed does not differ from the utility which is disclosed in the issued patents for the sulphonyl ureas and their salts, and upon which the grant of the said patents was predicated.\nThe Exchequer Court held that although the mixture was intended for a medicine, it was a substance\u2014a new substance not prepared or produced by a chemical process. The fact that one of the ingredients in the substance was so prepared or produced did not make the substance as a whole one that was so prepared. This last assumption as it is applied to the facts of this case, which is merely one of dilution, is, of course, challenged by counsel for the Commissioner.\nThe Exchequer Court went on to hold that the antidiabetic composition was new and useful and therefore patentable. It also held that there was inventive ingenuity. It found this because the inventors had conceived the idea of mixing with a carrier the sulphonyl ureas, of whose un-obvious utility they had knowledge so as to bring into being a new substance. But for their discovery of the unobvious utility of the substances, there would have been no reason for combining them with a carrier, for the utility of such a combination was not obvious. Thus, inventive ingenuity, one of the attributes of patentability, was in fact present.\nThe fallacy in the reasoning is in the finding of novelty and inventive ingenuity in this procedure of dilution. It is an unwarrantable extension of the ratio in the Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba Ltd.[2], where inventive ingenuity was found in the discovery of the valuable properties of the drug itself.\nA person is entitled to a patent for a new, useful and inventive medicinal substance but to dilute that new substance once its medical uses are established does not result in further invention. The diluted and undiluted substance are but two aspects of exactly the same invention. In this case, the addition of an inert carrier, which is a common expedient to increase bulk, and so facilitate measurement and administration, is nothing more than dilution and does not result in a further invention over and above that of the medicinal itself. If a patent subsists for the new medicinal substance, a separate patent cannot subsist for that substance merely diluted. If a legal impediment exists against a patent claim for the new medicinal substance, namely, s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, that legal impediment is equally applicable to the diluted substance. The diluted medicinal is still a medicine and the essential step of the process for preparing the diluted medicinal is a chemical step. Therefore, s. 41(1) of the Patent Act applies. Further, the respondent has already received patent protection to the full extent allowed by the law. Invention may lie in a new, useful, and inventive process for producing a new medicinal substance, and the respondent has already obtained patents for such inventive processes and for the new product as produced by such processes. The process claims and process dependent product claims in these patents represent the full extent of the protection to which the respondent is entitled.\nTherefore, the primary error in the judgment of the Exchequer Court is twofold. The mixing of a patented chemical substance with a carrier is not new and it is not the result of inventive ingenuity. It is, of course, a substance, as the learned President has found, but it is still a substance identical in all respects except dilution with a substance produced by a chemical process and for which a patent has been granted under s. 41(1) of the Patent Act.\nThe decision under appeal is of extreme practical significance. It gives effect to form rather than substance. The claim to a pharmaceutical composition with which the present appeal is concerned is free from the limitations imposed by s. 41(1) and a person who obtained a patent in this way could assert such claims against anyone using the pharmaceutically active ingredient constituting the substance of the invention regardless of the process whereby it was produced. Further, it might affect compulsory licensing applications under s. 41(3).\nI am therefore of the opinion that the rejection of the application by the Commissioner of Patents was well founded for the reasons stated by him in his letter of rejection, which I now set out in full:\nApplicant's letter of May 20, 1959, has been received and the application has been reviewed having regard to applicants' arguments.\nHowever after careful consideration it has been decided that these arguments do not overcome the objections set forth in the last Office Action. The arguments will remain on record.\nAll of the applicants' claims (1 to 15 inclusive) are rejected, and this rejection is made final under the provisions of Rule 46.\nThe applicants are entitled to only one patent for their invention. The compositions defined in the claims fail to inventively distinguish from the product claims appearing in parent application number 708,643 now Patent number 582,621. The composition claims are obviously directed to the same invention as the product claims of Patent 582,621. The essential inventive feature of the claimed compositions resides in the medicinally active chemical compound, and not in the fact that this compound is associated with a carrier. It is general practice in the medicinal art to associate an active compound with a suitable diluting or carrying agent because, usually, such a. compound cannot be used in the pure form. Furthermore the fact that the active compounds of the compositions have been allowed in the parent application in claims draughted along the requirements stated in Section 41 of the Patent Act constitutes evidence that said compounds are intended for medicine, and makes unnecessary and superfluous any claim to the mere use thereof. It is therefore clear that the composition claims of this application fail to reveal anything which is not taught or clearly implied by the allowed product claims of Patent 582,621.\nIn the Exchequer Court decision number 100035, Rohm and Haas Company vs The Commissioner of Patents, Cameron J. makes clear that claims such as the present composition claims are not patentable. He states: \"I am of the opinion, however, that when a claim to a compound has been allowed, a claim to a fungicidal composition merely having that compound as an active ingredient is not patentable\". And further that: \"The utility of the compounds as fungicides is fully set forth in the specification of the patent which has been allowed; to name the compound as a fungicidal composition is merely to recite one of its inherent qualities\". When \"medicinal\" is substituted for \"fungicidal\" and, \"medicines\" for \"fungicides\", the above quotation applies squarely to applicants' claims.\nThe argument, made by the applicants, that by taking the already patented compounds of Patent 582,621 and merely mixing them with a carrier they have converted them into new products which are not governed by Section 41, cannot be accepted. The essential inventive feature of the composition claims is the new medically-active chemical compounds. The invention of these composition claims relates to substances prepared by chemical processes, and intended for medicine. Practically all new medicines must be diluted with some carrier or other ingredient, and cannot be\nused in the pure form. Such carriers obviously must be compatible with the active substance, and suitable for the way in which the medicine is to be administered. In this case there is no question of second invention involving the discovery of a new and particular carrier which imparts a special, new, and unexpected character to the compositions. To permit the claiming of a medicine mixed with a carrier in per se form, rather than in process-dependent form, would mean that all new medicines could be claimed free of the restrictions of Section 41 in the only practical form in which they may be used. This, of course, would defeat the whole purpose of the Section.\nAll the claims are rejected.\nAs the objections cannot be overcome by amendment, this action terminates the prosecution of the application before the examiner. Any request for review must be lodged within three months.\nsigned (G. Drouin)\nExaminer\u2014Group C-6\nI have set out the reasons of the Commissioner in full because they show the kind of consideration he gave to this problem in his office and also because of a suggested limitation of his function in the reasons of the Exchequer Court. Following statements made in R. v. Patents Appeal Tribunal, Ex p. Swift & Co.[3], the Exchequer Court said that the Commissioner should not refuse to allow an application to proceed to the grant of a patent unless he is quite satisfied that the subject-matter of the application could not conceivably be patentable within the meaning of the Patent Act.\nThe Commissioner was well within even this definition of the scope of his duties but I think that the obiter of the Exchequer Court expresses the duty of the Commissioner too restrictively and fails to recognize the distinction between the United Kingdom and the Canadian Patent Acts. Under ss. 6, 7 and 8 of the United Kingdom Patents Act, 1949, the Examiner may examine only for anticipation. He may not and does not as a matter of practice examine as to inventiveness. This is left to the Court. Further, as pointed out in Re Levy & West's Application[4], no appeal lies from the Patent Appeal Tribunal, whereas in a subsequent action the validity of the patent may be impeached in the highest court in the land.\nIn contrast, in Canada the Patent Office, supervised by the Court, does examine as to inventiveness, and an applicant may appeal to the highest court. Moreover, in the particular class of case with which we are here concerned dealing with drugs and medicines, there is considerable public interest at stake, and the Commissioner should most carefully scrutinize the application to see if it merits the grant of monopoly privileges, and to determine the scope of the monopoly available.\nI also wish to say something about the construction put upon the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba Ltd., supra. Although the learned President does find in this case that there was inventive ingenuity, erroneously in my respectful opinion, he also states categorically that the Ciba case held that novelty and utility are the only attributes of patentability that need to be present in order to constitute an invention. This, to me, is an erroneous interpretation of the effect of the Ciba case. With respect, the judgment of this Court did not proceed on the narrow ground that novelty and utility are the only two attributes of patentability. The judgment of this Court affirmed the judgment of the Exchequer Court for reasons common to both judgments, namely, an adoption of the principles stated by Jenkins J. in Re May & Baker Ltd. and Ciba Ltd's. Letters Patent[5], and as far as I can see, until the question was raised in the reasons delivered in the Exchequer Court no one ever doubted the principle that invention is an essential attribute of patentability. In any case, in this Court, as far as I know, wherever the question has been material the judgments have always so held.\nThe construction put upon s. 41(1) of the Patent Act in the reasons for judgment of the Exchequer Court requires comment. The section was held to be restrictive of the rights that an inventor would have except for the prohibitions of the section. Consequently, the Court should not find that a particular application came within its prohibitions unless the conditions for its application are clearly present. I can see no justification for this interpretation. There is no inherent common law right to a patent. An inventor gets his patent according to the terms of the Patent Act, no more and no less. If the patent for which he is applying comes within the provisions of s. 41(1) of the Act, then he must comply with that section.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court and declare that the fifteen claims of application, serial No. 731,948, be held to be unpatentable.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

The president of the Exchequer Court refused. leave to appeal on the ground that no question of law was involved in the declaration of the Board and that, in any event, this was not the kind of case in which leave should be given. The appellants served a notice of appeal to this Court from this refusal, and the Crown moved to quash for lack of jurisdiction.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be granted.\nThere was no right of appeal to this Court from the decision of the Exchequer Court to refuse leave to appeal, either under s. 58(6) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, or under s. 82(1) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98. Lane et al. v. Esdaile et al, [1891] A.C. 210, applied. It has been consistently held in our Courts and in the Courts of England that where a statute grants a right of appeal conditionally upon leave to appeal being granted by a specified tribunal there is no appeal from the decision of that tribunal to refuse leave, provided that the tribunal has not mistakenly declined jurisdiction but has reached a decision on the merits of the application. In the present case, the application was considered on its merits. In no sense was jurisdiction declined. Consequently, regardless of whether the decision of the Exchequer Court should be described as a final order or an interlocutory order, there was no appeal.\nMOTION by respondent to quash appeal from a judgment of Thorson P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada. Motion granted.\nC. R. O. Munro, Q.C., for the motion.\nG. H. Steer, Q.C., and B. V. Massie, Q.C., contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014Each of the appellants applied to the Tariff Board, pursuant to s. 57 of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, for a declaration that natural gas used in its gas turbines for producing electricity is exempt from sales tax imposed by the Act. By agreement the two applications were joined for hearing. On January 31, 1963, the Tariff Board declared that the natural gas so used is subject to and not exempt from sales tax. This was a decision of the majority of the Board; Mr. Elliott, dissenting, would have declared the natural gas to be exempt from the tax. The amount of the tax involved exceeds $123,000.\nThe appellants served a notice returnable on February 28, 1963, before the presiding judge of the Exchequer Court in chambers applying for leave to appeal to the Exchequer Court from the declaration of the Tariff Board, \"upon the following questions of law\":\n1. Did the Tariff Board err as a matter of law in deciding that Brown Boveri gas turbine equipment for producing electricity is an internal com- bustion engine within the meaning of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act?\n2. Did the Tariff Board err as a matter of law in deciding that natural gas when used in Brown Boveri gas turbine equipment for producing electricity, is not natural gas for heating purposes within the meaning of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act.\nThe application for leave to appeal was heard by the learned President of the Exchequer Court on March 28, 1963, and at the conclusion of the hearing leave was refused. Subsequently the learned President gave written reasons for his decision. At the commencement of these reasons after reciting the making of the application and the two questions set out above he said in part:\nAfter hearing counsel for the applicants as well as for the respondent I refused leave to appeal on the ground that, in my opinion, no question of law was involved in the declaration of the Tariff Board and that, in any event, this was not the kind of case in which leave should be given and I dismissed the application with costs.\nSince then I have been requested by counsel for the applicants to give written reasons for my decision and these are now given.\nThe learned President went on to examine the proceedings before the Tariff Board, the reasons of the majority and those of the dissenting member and formed the opinion that the questions on which leave to appeal was sought were questions of fact and not of law. He did not elaborate his reasons for holding \"that, in any event, this was not the kind of case in which leave should be given\".\nThe decision of the learned President was embodied in a formal order of the Exchequer Court the operative part of which reads as follows:\nIT IS ORDERED that leave to appeal be and the same is hereby refused and that the application for leave be and the same is hereby dismissed with costs.\nOn May 24, 1963, the appellants served a notice of appeal to this Court from the order of Thorson P. which reads in part as follows:\nThis Notice of Appeal is given pursuant to the provisions of Section 58, Subsection 6 of the Excise Tax Act being Chapter 100 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1952.\nThe grounds of the appeal are as follows:\n(1) The learned Judge erred in holding that the majority finding of the Tariff Board that the Brown Boveri gas turbine equipments of the appellants were internal combustion engines were findings of fact.\n(2) The learned Judge erred in failing to find that the question whether the natural gas used in the appellants' Brown Boveri gas turbine equipment was used for heating purposes within the meaning of the Excise Tax Act was a question of law.\n(3) The learned Judge erred in holding that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant the leave to appeal for which the application was made, and in finding that the decision of the Judge of the Exchequer Court that a question of law was or was not involved in the application for leave to appeal was not subject to review.\n(4) The learned Judge erred in refusing to grant the appellants leave to appeal.\nThe respondent moves to quash this appeal \"on the ground that the Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal, and alternatively on the ground that this appeal must be dismissed\".\nFor the appellants it is contended that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under the combined effect of s. 42 of the Supreme Court Act, subss. (1)(4) and (6) of s. 58 of the Excise Tax Act and subss. (1) and (5) of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act. These read as follows:\n42. Notwithstanding anything in this Act the Supreme Court has jurisdiction as provided in any other Act conferring jurisdiction.\n58. (1) Any of the parties to proceedings under section 57, namely,\n(a) the person who applied to the Tariff Board for a declaration,\n(b) the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise, or\n(c) any person who entered an appearance with the Secretary of the Tariff Board in accordance with subsection (2) of section 57,\nmay, upon leave being obtained from the Exchequer Court of Canada or a judge thereof, upon application made within thirty days from the making of the declaration sought to be appealed, or within such further time as the Court or judge may allow, appeal to the Exchequer Court upon any question that in the opinion of the Court or judge is a question of law.\n* * *\n(4) The Exchequer Court may dispose of an appeal under this section by dismissing it, by making such order as the Court may deem expedient or by referring the matter back to the Tariff Board for re-hearing.\n(6) Any order or judgment of the Exchequer Court made under this section may be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada in like manner as any other judgment of the Exchequer Court, and the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act as to appeals apply to any appeal taken under this subsection.\n82. (1) An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada lies\n(a) from a final judgment or a judgment upon a demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings, and,\n(b) with leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, from an interlocutory judgment,\npronounced by the Exchequer Court in an action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars. (5) A judgment is final for the purpose of this section if it determines the rights of the parties, except as to the amount of the damages or the amount of liability.\nAs already mentioned, the declaration of the Tariff Board was made under s. 57 of the Excise Tax Act. Subsection (3) of that section reads:\n(3) A declaration by the Tariff Board under this section is final and conclusive, subject to appeal as provided in section 58.\nIn my opinion the reasoning of the House of Lords in Lane et al v. Esdaile et al1 is decisive against the existence of a right of appeal to this Court from the decision of Thorson P. to refuse leave to appeal. The relevant words of The Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, 39 and 40 Vict., c. 59, which was the statute conferring jurisdiction on the House of Lords were those of s. 3, reading as follows:\n3. Subject as in this Act mentioned an appeal shall lie to the House of Lords from any order or judgment of any of the courts following, that is to say,\n(1) Her Majesty's Court of Appeal in England;\nThere was no provision in the Act restricting the generality of the words just quoted. By Order LVIII Rule 15, dealing with the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, it was provided:\nNo appeal to the Court of Appeal from any interlocutory order \u2026 shall, except by special leave of the Court of Appeal, be brought after the expiration of twenty-one days, and no other appeal shall, except by such leave, be brought after the expiration of one year \u2026\nIn July 1885, Kay J. gave judgment for the plaintiffs in an action against several defendants two of whom were the appellants. Some of the defendants other than the appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal and being unsuccessful in that Court appealed again to the House of Lords where, on August 10, 1888, they succeeded in reversing the judgments below against them. The appellants thereafter applied to the Court of Appeal for special leave to appeal against the judgment of Kay J. Their application was refused by the Court of Appeal and against that refusal they appealed to the House of Lords. A preliminary objection that no appeal lay to the House of Lords was unanimously sustained and the appeal was dismissed as incompetent. Lord Halsbury points out the absurdity which would result from holding that there is a right of appeal from the refusal, and presumably also from the granting, of leave to appeal by the particular body appointed by the statute to decide whether leave should be given. I refrain from quoting from his speech and that of the other Lords who took part in the judgment. All that they say appears to me to be applicable to and decisive of the question before us.\nThe point has already come before this Court. In Canadian Horticultural Council et al v. J. Freedman & Sons Limited2, Thorson P. refused two applications for leave to appeal made under s. 45(1) of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58, the wording of which is indistinguishable from that of s. 58(1) of the Excise Tax Act. At page 551 of the report there is a note reading:\nAn appeal from the above decision to the Supreme Court of Canada was quashed by order of the Court on October 18, 1954.\nThe decision of the Court quashing the appeal was pronounced at the conclusion of the hearing and there is no record of the reasons which were given. In view of this I do not base my judgment on that decision.\nIn the case of In re Smith v. Hogan Ltd.3, this Court set aside an order of Cannon J. refusing an application for special leave to appeal from a judgment in bankruptcy proceedings pronounced by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick but the reasons of the Court expressly approve the decision in Williams v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.4 to the effect that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from an order of a Judge of that Court granting or refusing leave to appeal from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The order of Cannon J. was set aside because, owing to a misunderstanding touching the effect of a statute, he had erroneously decided that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application; the order of this Court provided that the applicants might proceed with their application for leave. In re Smith v. Hogan Ltd. is explained by Duff C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court in Duval v. The King5, as follows:\nThe decision proceeded upon the ground that the dismissal of the application constituted a refusal to entertain an application which the applicant was legally entitled to have heard and decided on the merits.\nThere is nothing in that judgment, or in any of the previous judgments there referred to, which suggests that, consistently with the intendment of the provisions of the Railway Act, or the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, for example, this Court could, after an application for leave to appeal has been fully heard on the merits and dismissed by the judge to whom the application was made, review the decision on the merits and allow the application; and we think that applies with equal force to applications under the provisions of article 1025 of the Criminal Code.\nHere the application was made to Mr. Justice Hudson, was fully heard by him and dismissed, and we think that must be final.\nI have considered all the decisions referred to in the arguments of counsel and I am satisfied that as a matter of construction the opening words of subs. (6) of s. 58 of the Excise Tax Act, \"Any order or judgment of the Exchequer Court made under this section\", do not include the decision of a judge of that Court granting or refusing leave to appeal under subs. (1) of that section. I am equally satisfied that no appeal from such a decision lies under either cl. (a) or cl. (b) of subs. (1) of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nIt appears to me to have been consistently held in our courts and in the courts of England that where a statute grants a right of appeal conditionally upon leave to appeal being granted by a specified tribunal there is no appeal from the decision of that tribunal to refuse leave, provided that the tribunal has not mistakenly declined jurisdiction but has reached a decision on the merits of the application.\nIn the case at bar it is clear that the learned President considered the applications for leave to appeal on their merits and reached the conclusion that the questions on which leave was sought were not questions of law and that, in any event, this was not the kind of case in which leave should be given. In no sense did he decline jurisdiction. In these circumstances it is my opinion that no appeal from his decision lies to this Court regardless of whether that decision should be correctly described as a final order or an interlocutory order, a question which was fully argued before us but as to which I do not find it necessary to express an opinion.\nI would grant the motion to quash. The respondent is entitled to the costs of the motion.\nMotion to quash granted with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & Macdonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

On the death of the insured in April 1960, the Minister took the position that the proceeds of the policy should be included in the estate for estate tax purposes. On appeal to the Exchequer Court, the notice of appeal alleged that the deceased, or alternatively, the corporation, had paid the premiums unitl October 1959, at which date the corporation had assigned the policy to the wife; that the assignment had been an absolute one, and that neither the, deceased nor the corporation had any interest in the policy after the assignment. In his reply to the notice of appeal, the Minister admitted these allegations. Subsequently, the Minister was allowed by the Exchequer Court to amend his reply so as to admit only that the deceased, or alternatively, the corporation had paid the premiums until October 1959. The appellant applied to this Court for leave to appeal from that ruling, contending that the admission could not be withdrawn because the Minister had failed to prove that the facts which had been admitted were not true.\nHeld: The application should be dismissed.\nThe facts to which the admission related were entirely within the knowledge of the appellant and first came to the knowledge of the Minister at the time of examination for discovery. The admission was as to matters of mixed fact and law. It was open to the trial judge to take the view that the evidence showed that there was a triable issue as to the validity and absolute nature of the assignment which should be decided at a trial rather than on an interlocutory motion. There was no good reason to think that on appeal the ruling which the trial judge had made in the exercise of his discretion would be reversed.\nApplication before Cartwright J. in chambers for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Cameron J. Application dismissed.\nD. Spitz, for the applicant. G. W. Ainslie, contra.\nThe following judgment was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Cameron J. allowing the respondent to amend his reply, and awarding the costs of the motion to the appellant in any event.\nThe question which is in dispute between the parties is whether the sum of $50,000 the proceeds of a life insurance policy taken out by a company, Papp's Truck Service Limited, on the life of Gordon Papp, in which his wife Mae Papp was named as beneficiary, should be included in the estate of the said Gordon Papp in calculating the amount of estate tax payable in respect of his estate. Gordon Papp died on April 22, 1960; he was the owner of 90 per cent and Mae Papp was the owner of 10 per cent of the shares of Papp's Truck Service Limited.\nParagraph 5 of the appellant's notice of appeal to the Exchequer Court reads as follows:\n5. The deceased, alternatively, the Company, paid the monthly premiums on the policy until October, A.D. 1959. In October, A.D. 1959 the policy was assigned by the said Company to Mae Papp. The policy was absolutely assigned and neither the deceased nor the company had any interest whatsoever in the policy after the assignment thereof. Further Mae Papp assumed the burden of paying all the further instalments on the policy.\nParagraph 3 of the respondent's reply as originally delivered read as follows:\n3. He admits that the deceased, alternatively, the company, paid the monthly premiums on the policy of assurance until October, A.D. 1959; that in October, A.D. 1959 the said policy of assurance was assigned by the said company to Mae Ritter Papp; that the said policy of assurance was absolutely assigned and neither the deceased nor the company had any interest whatsoever in the said policy of assurance after the assignment thereof; but does not admit any further allegations of fact, if any, contained in paragraph 5.\nBy the order of Cameron J. the respondent was allowed to delete this paragraph and to substitute the following:\n3. He admits that the deceased, alternatively, the company, paid the monthly premiums on the policy of assurance until October, A.D. 1959 but does not admit any other allegations of fact, if any, contained in paragraph 5.\nOther amendments were also permitted but they are comparatively unimportant. Both counsel state that the answer to the question whether the policy was absolutely assigned to Mae Papp in October 1959, so that neither the deceased nor the company had any interest whatsoever in the policy thereafter, is relevant to the decision of the dispute between the parties.\nOn the hearing of the motion before Cameron J. oral testimony was given. The solicitor who had prepared the reply on behalf of the respondent was examined and cross-examined at some length.\nOn the evidence given it was open to Cameron J. to find that the admission was made through inadvertance but it is urged on behalf of the appellant that it was not proved that the facts admitted were not true. Reliance was placed on a number of authorities most of which are discussed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation v. The City of Toronto1. Hope J. A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court said at p. 733:\nAn admission may in certain circumstances and upon proper terms be withdrawn on leave of the Court. Nevertheless it is well established that facts admitted cannot be withdrawn unless it is proved by satisfactory evidence that the fact so admitted was not true.\nIt was not necessary for the decision of that case to state the rule of practice in such wide terms. It is clear, as appears from the reasons at p. 735, that neither by evidence nor argument had counsel for the City attempted to show that the admission was not in fact correct; and the fact admitted was one within the knowledge of the City.\nIn the case at bar the facts to which the admission related were entirely within the knowledge of the appellant and first came to the knowledge of the respondent at the time of the examination for discovery; the admissions are as to matters of mixed fact and law. In my opinion, it was open to Cameron J. to take the view that the evidence showed that there was a triable issue as to the validity and absolute nature of the assignment of the policy which should be decided at a trial rather than on an interlocutory motion. There does not appear to me to be good reason to think that the Court on appeal would reverse the ruling which the learned judge made in the exercise of his discretion.\nThe application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The costs of the motion will be costs to the respondent in the cause.\nApplication dismissed.\n1 [1951] O.R. 726, 4 D.L.R. 587.\n"

One T was appointed receiver of all the assets of the partnership with power to manage the business of the partnership until the conclusion of the expropriation proceedings. The Ontario Municipal Board, which was appointed the sole arbitrator, fixed the compensation at $50,525. The husband, the wife and T appealed to ask that the compensation be increased. The appeal was dismissed. The husband alone decided to appeal to this Court, and served notice of appeal upon the solicitors for the City and the solicitor for his wife and T. The City moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the appellant had no status to maintain the appeal because a partner cannot sue alone to recover a debt due to the partnership.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be dismissed.\nIt may well be that the better practice would have been for the appellant to serve a notice of appeal on behalf of the partnership, in spite of the refusal of the other partner to take part in it. However, he has served notice of the appeal on all persons who were interested. What is of real importance is that all necessary parties should be made parties to the appeal. In this case it was of little significance whether the wife and T were described as appellants or respondents. The notice of appeal should therefore be amended to describe the wife and T as respondents and a copy of the order so directing should be served upon them. MOTION by the respondent to quash the appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario for want of jurisdiction. Motion dismissed.\nB. H. Kellock, for the motion.\nR. F. Wilson, contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014On April 8, 1958, the City of Hamilton expropriated certain lands of which Alfred Herrington and Gisele Herrington, who are husband and wife, were the owners as joint tenants and which formed part of the property of a partnership in which they were the only partners.\nUnder the relevant statutory provisions the Ontario Municipal Board was appointed sole arbitrator to determine the compensation to be paid by the City. By order dated March 23, 1962, the Board fixed the compensation at $50,525.\nPursuant to a report of His Honour Judge Schwenger dated September 30, 1960, Samuel Taylor had been appointed Receiver of all the assets of the partnership with power to manage the business of the partnership until the final conclusion of the expropriation proceedings.\nAlfred Herrington, Gisele Herrington and Taylor appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the award made by the Board asking that the compensation be increased. On January 9, 1963, this appeal was dismissed with costs.\nApparently Alfred Herrington decided to appeal to this Court while Gisele Herrington and Taylor decided not to appeal. By notice dated March 6, 1963, Gisele Herrington and Samuel Taylor changed their solicitors. On the same day the solicitors for Alfred Herrington served a notice of appeal to this Court, using the style of cause set out above and reading as follows:\nTAKE NOTICE that the Claimant, Alfred K. Herrington, appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada from the Order of the Court of Appeal of Ontario pronounced on the 9th day of January, 1963, and asks that the said Order be set aside or varied and that the amount of compensation awarded be increased, or in the alternative, that the matter be referred back to the Ontario Municipal Board for a new hearing. This notice was directed to and served upon the solicitors for the City and the solicitor for Gisele Herrington and Samuel Taylor.\nOn March 8, 1963, an order was made by the Registrar of this Court approving the security given by the appellant.\nCounsel for the City now moves to quash the appeal \"on the ground that the appellant Alfred Herrington has no status to maintain this appeal\". Counsel for Alfred Herrington opposes this motion and also moves:\nfor an order extending the time for making application for leave to appeal and for leave to appeal to this Court from the Order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dated the 9th day of January, 1963, dismissing the appeal of the Claimants from the Order of The Ontario Municipal Board dated the 23rd day of March, 1962, or for such further or other order as to this Honourable Court may seem just.\nIn support of the motion to quash, Mr. Kellock cited a number of cases holding that one partner cannot sue alone to recover a debt due to the partnership. In the earliest of these Scott v. Godwin1, Eyre C.J. said at p. 73:\nI take it to have been solemnly adjudged in several cases, and to be the known received law, that one co-covenantee, one co-obligee, or one joint contractor by parol, cannot sue alone.\nIn Kennedy, Ross and Velanoff v. Canadian General Insurance Co.2, all the members of a partnership had joined in an action on a policy issued to the partnership. The action was dismissed. One of the partners appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in his own name. The appeal was quashed. Aylesworth J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court, after pointing out that the policy was issued to and insured the partnership said, at pp. 688 and 689:\nThere is no right of an individual partner either to sue upon such a claim or if judgment be given against the partnership in an action on such claim, individually and in his personal capacity to appeal from that judgment.\nIt is made clear, however, in the last paragraph of the reasons of the learned Justice of Appeal that the Court had offered to entertain an application by the appellant to regularize the proceedings; the offer was apparently disregarded. In the case at bar Mr. Wilson makes such an application in case it should be found necessary.\nIt may well be that the better practice would have been for the appellant Alfred Herrington to serve a notice of appeal on behalf of the partnership, in spite of the refusal of the other partner to take part in an appeal; he has, however, served notice of the appeal on all persons who are interested. Had he not done so it would have been open to the Court, under Rule 50 (2), to direct that such parties respondent be added as might be necessary \"to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle the question involved in the appeal\". What is of real importance is that all necessary parties should be made parties to the appeal. In this case it is of little significance whether Gisele Herrington and Samuel Taylor are described as appellants or respondents, it is sufficient that they will be before the Court.\nThe notice of appeal should be amended to describe Gisele Herrington and Samuel Taylor as respondents and a copy of the order so directing should be served upon them; when this has been done the appeal will, in my opinion, be properly constituted, and the motion to quash should therefore be dismissed. The motion made on behalf of Alfred Herrington becomes unnecessary and should also be dismissed. I would reserve the costs of both motions to be disposed of by the Court hearing the appeal.\nMotion to quash dismissed.\n1 (1797), 1 Bos. & P. 67, 126 E.R. 782.\n2 (1960), 22 D.L.R. (2d) 687.\n"

The appellant, a native of Roumania but who is now a Canadian citizen, was interned in Canada during the last war. By petition of right he claimed damages for \"cruel and unusual treatment and punishment\" accorded to him in the course of his internment during and for some time after the war. His broad petition was that all officers or servants of the Crown who were employed in jails and internment camps owed a duty to prisoners not to expose them to the kind of treatment and punishment to which he alleged he was subjected, and that the mere recitation of the manner in which he was treated constituted an allegation of breach of this duty and, therefore, negligence such as to create a liability against the Crown under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34. The Exchequer Court answered in the negative the question of law as to whether a petition of right lie against the Crown on the assumption that the allegations of fact contained in the petition were true. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was a wide difference between general allegations of mistreatment such as those made here and an allegation that some servant or agent of the Crown had, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, committed a tortious act of negligence under such circumstance as to draw upon himself a personal liability to the petitioner. Under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, the liability of the Crown was limited to proof of allegations of the latter character. Negligence involves the causing of damage by a breach of that duty of care for others which the circumstances of the particular case demand. The allegations of fact contained in the petition of right could not be considered as disclosing tortious acts of negligence by officers or servants of the Crown. They were descriptive of disciplinary and regulatory measures deliberately taken by authorities responsible for the custody of the appellant while he was legally interned and were, therefore, not such as to create liability against the Crown under s. 19(c).\nThe Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, like the Crown Liability Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 30, was not in force during that period and the pre-existing rights which are there recognized did not include the right to bring an action in tort against the Crown except as specifically provided by statute.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 dismissing a petition of right. Appeal dismissed.\nG. A. Roy, Q.C., for the appellant.\nPaul Ollivier, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada2 rendered on February 20, 1953, whereby he determined in the negative the following question of law set down for hearing before him pursuant to rule 149 of the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court:\nAssuming the allegations of fact contained in the Petition of Right to be true, does a petition of right lie against the Respondent for any of the relief sought by the Suppliant in the said Petition?\nThe petitioner, who is now a Canadian citizen, was,, at the time of the happening of the events complained of in his petition of right, a citizen of Roumania and his present very substantial claim for damages is founded upon what his counsel describes as the \"cruel and unusual treatment and punishment\" accorded to him in the course of. his imprisonment and internment in Canada during and for some time after the last war.\nThe circumstances of the appellant's arrest, internment and imprisonment and the details of his alleged mistreatment are fully reviewed in the reasons for judgment; of the learned President, but it is now admitted to have been wrongly alleged in the petition of right that the appellant's imprisonment and internment were illegal and the claim asserted in this appeal is limited to a series of complaints as to the treatment accorded to the appellant while he was legally confined by order of the Canadian Government. In the factum filed on behalf of the appellant these complaints are attributed to the negligence of \"officers of the Crown\". The relevant paragraph of the factum, which appears on pp. 6 and 7, reads as follows:\nThe officers of the Crown \u2026were negligent during the incarceration of the Appellant in Halifax and during his internment, because they acted as follows:\n(a) They did not inform the Appellant of the motives for his arrest and of his detention. This is alleged in paragraph 41 of the Amended Declaration;\n(b) They did not allow the Appellant, for a period of three months, to write letters, and more particularly did not allow him to write to the Rumanian Consul in Montreal, and once they did allow him to write, they did not transmit his letter with due haste. This is alleged in paragraph 39 of the Amended Declaration;\n(c) They did not advise the Appellant that he could have his case referred to and dealt with by a Board under the terms of Article 25 of Order in Council P.C. 2385 of April 4, 1941. This is alleged in paragraph 41 of the Amended Declaration;\n(d) The Appellant was made to do forced labour, was put in solitary confinement, and put on bread and water, without mattress, for a period of six months. This is alleged in paragraph 35 of the Appellant's Amended Petition; (e) The Appellant's rations were reduced to a cup of tea and a piece of bread at breakfast, a soup and piece of bread for lunch, and a cup of tea and a piece of bread in the evening. This is alleged in paragraph 36 of the Appellant's Amended Petition;\n(f) The Appellant, while interned, was not granted the privileges of the Red Cross, while other enemy prisoners were. This is alleged in paragraph 53 of the Appellant's Amended Petition;\n(g) The Appellant was not granted the privileges granted to other enemy prisoners. He could not write to his family, was not given similar medical care and was locked in a cell. This is alleged in paragraph 55 of the Appellant's Amended Petition.\nIt is to be observed with respect to sub-paras. (a) and (c) above that the complaints therein alleged are related to the arrest and continued incarceration of the appellant and in this regard it is to be observed that the complaints in question are preceded in the factum filed on behalf of the appellant by the following:\nThe incarceration of the Appellant in Halifax on December 14, 1940, was legal under the terms of Order in Council P.C. 4751. The continued incarceration of the Appellant in Halifax, after the rendering of Order in Council P.C. 2385 on April 4, 1941, was also legal, because the right of the Appellant under the said Order in Council to have his case reviewed was only permissive and not imperative. The internment of the Appellant under Regulation 21 of the Defence of Canada Regulations was legal as the Appellant was a Rumanian citizen.\nThe remaining matters complained of in sub-paras. (b), (d), (e), (f) and (g) are set out in the petition of right as part of the narrative of the appellant's experiences while in legal custody in Canada and although in his arguments before this Court appellant's counsel attributed all these complaints to the negligence of officers of the Crown, it is noteworthy that the only plea contained in the petition upon which reliance is placed as an allegation of such negligence is that contained in para. 74 which reads as follows:\nL'incarc\u00e9ration et l'internement du requ\u00e9rant, tel que d\u00e9crit ci-dessus, sont dus \u00e0 la faute et\/ou la n\u00e9gligence d'employ\u00e9s, de fonctionnaires, d'officiers et\/ou de serviteurs de la Couronne, pendant qu'ils \u00e9taient dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions ou de leur emploi.\nIt is argued that because the words \"tel que d\u00e9crit ci-dessus\". have been inserted in this paragraph it is to be construed as an allegation that all the matters complained of in the earlier paragraphs of the petition were occasioned by the fault and\/or negligence of employees, officials, officers and\/or servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their employment, and that this constitutes an allegation sufficient to give rise to liability against the Crown.\nIt is settled law \"that there cannot be an action in tort against the Crown unless it is founded upon a statute\". See The King v. Paradis & Farley Inc.3, per Taschereau J. as he then was; and the only such statutory provision existing at the time when the events complained of are alleged to have occurred was that contained in para. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, as amended by 1938 (Can.), c. 28 which reads as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe nature of the liability thus created against the Crown is explained in the reasons for judgment of Rand J. speaking for the majority of this Court in The King v. Anthony4, where he said:\nI think it must be taken that what paragraph (c) does is to create a liability against the Crown through negligence under the rule of respondeat superior, and not to impose duties on the Crown in favour of subjects: The King v. Dubois (2); Salmo Investments Ltd. v. The King (3). It is a vicarious liability based upon a tortious act of negligence committed by a servant while acting within the scope of his employment; and its condition is that the servant shall have drawn upon himself a personal liability to the third person.\nIf the liability is placed merely on the negligent failure to carry out a duty to the Crown and not on a violation of a duty to the injured person, then there will be imposed on the Crown a greater responsibility in relation to a servant than rests on a private citizen. But the words \"while acting\" which envisage positive conduct of the servant taken in conjunction with the consideration just mentioned clearly exclude, in my opinion, such an interpretation.\nThe broad contention made on behalf of the appellant is that all officers or servants of the Crown who were employed in jails and internment camps such as those in which he was interned and incarcerated, owed a duty to the prisoners in their charge not to expose them to the kind of treatment and punishment to which the appellant alleges that he was subjected, and that the mere recitation of the manner in which he was treated, coupled with the wording of para. 74 of the petition, constitutes an allegation of a breach of this duty and therefore of negligence such as to create a liability against the Crown under the Exchequer Court Act.\nThere appears to me, however, to be a wide difference between general allegations of mistreatment and unfairness suffered by a prisoner while confined by order of the Canadian Government and an allegation that some servant or agent of the Crown has, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, committed a tortious act of negligence under such circumstances as to draw upon himself a personal liability to the petitioner. Under the provisions of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, the liability of the Crown is, in my opinion, limited to proof of allegations of the latter character.\nIt is to be observed also that the claim which is alleged to be put forward by para. 74 of the petition is not confined to \"negligence\" but is based upon an allegation of \"faute et\/ou la n\u00e9gligence\" of officers and servants of the Crown. As the learned President of the Exchequer Court has pointed out, \"negligence\" is only one segment of the broad field of \"faute\" which is envisaged by the provisions of art. 1053 of the Quebec Civil Code, the English version of which reads as follows:\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nIn this regard, in Canadian National Railways Co. v. Lepage5, Rinfret J. (as he then was) had occasion to say:\nThe respondent's case is rested on fault consisting not in any positive act or imprudence, but in the neglect of the company and its employees (art. 1053 C.C.).\n* * *\nIt is a familiar principle that neglect may, in law, be considered a fault only if it corresponds with a duty to act.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, the learned President has traced the history and development of the specific and independent tort of negligence and I have nothing to add to his analysis of the subject.\nIn essence, negligence involves the causing of damage by a breach of that duty of care for others which the circumstances of the particular case demand. It is lack of due care which gives rise to liability for negligence and a very real distinction exists between inadvertently causing injury through an unreasonable failure to guard against foreseeable danger to others and deliberately carrying out a course of conduct designed to control persons in legal custody by subjecting them to disciplinary action.\nI agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that the allegation of fact contained in the petition of right cannot be considered as disclosing tortious acts of negligence by officers or servants of the Crown. They are descriptive of disciplinary and regulatory measures deliberately taken by authorities responsible for the custody of the appellant while he was legally imprisoned and incarcerated and are therefore not such as to create liability against the Crown under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nAs to the argument of appellant's counsel based on The Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, it is only necessary to say that that statute, like The Crown Liability Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 30, was not in force during the period referred to in the petition of right and that the pre-existing rights which it recognizes do not include the right to bring an action in tort against the Crown except as specifically provided by statute.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Georges A.

A confession was put in evidence at the trial. His appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal, the dissent being as to the admissibility of the confession. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nUnder s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, this Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground of appeal raises only a question of mixed law and fact. The ground of appeal must raise a question of law in the strict sense and in respect to which there is a disagreement, expressed or implied, between the minority and the majority in the Court of Appeal. In the case at bar, the difference of opinion was attributable to different inferences drawn by the dissenting judge and by those of the majority from the accepted evidence relevant to the voluntariness of the confession. Consequently, the ground of appeal did not raise a question of law in the strict sense and this Court had no jurisdiction.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the appellant's conviction for an offence under s. 79(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.

(1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\n(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or\nUnder these provisions, this Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground alleged in support thereof raises only a question of mixed law and fact. It is indeed well settled by the decisions of this Court that the ground of appeal must raise \"a question of law in the strict sense\", The King v. Decary[3], and that this question of law, involved in the ratio decidendi, must be one in respect to which there is a disagreement expressed or implied between the minority and the majority in the Court of Appeal. Rozon v. The King[4]\nIn the case at bar, the majority and the minority disagreed with respect to the admissibility, as a voluntary statement, of a confession of guilt made by the appellant. It does not appear from the reasons of Davey J.A., dissenting, and from those of his colleagues Bird and Wilson JJ.A., of the majority, that this disagreement is based on a conflicting view of the law governing the admissibility of confessions; a careful consideration of the reasons for judgment reasonably indicates that the difference of opinion is attributable to different inferences being drawn by the dissenting Judge and by those of the majority from the accepted evidence relevant to the voluntariness of the confession. On this view of the matter, the ground of appeal alleged by the appellant does not raise a question of law in the strict sense. The Queen v. Fitton[5]. Hence, this Court has no jurisdiction and the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rankin, Dean & Munro, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewart, Kelley, Burke-Robertson, Urie & Butler, Ottawa.\n[1] (1963), 43 W.W.R. 610.\n[2] (1963), 43 W.W.R. 610.\n[3] [1942] S.C.R. 80, 77 C.C.C. 191, 2 D.L.R. 401.\n[4] [1951] S.C.R. 248 at 256, 11 C.R. 255, 99 C.C.C. 167, 2 D.L.R. 594.\n[5] [1956] S.C.R. 958, 24 C.R. 371, 116 C.C.C. 1, 6 D.L.R.

The appellants were Treaty Indians and were hunting deer for food for their own use and on lands to which they had the right of access. They were acquitted by the magistrate, but their acquittal was set aside by the Court of Appeal. They were granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and an acquittal directed.\nIn regard to Indians, the word \"hunt\" as used in s. 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act was not ambiguous nor subject to any of the limitations which are imposed by s. 31(1) upon non-Indians.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, setting aside the appellants' acquittal by a magistrate on a charge under s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act of Manitoba. Appeal allowed.\nDuncan J. Jessiman, Q.C., for the appellants.\nBenjamin Hewak, for the respondent. Gerald LeDain, Q.C., for the Attorney-General of Quebec, intervenant.\nS. Freedman, for the Attorney General of Alberta, intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014The appellants, both of them Treaty Indians, were charged before Magistrate Bruce McDonald of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba:\nThat they did on or about the 27th day of October, A.D. 1961, at or near the Rural Municipality of South Cypress, in the Province of Manitoba, unlawfully hunt big game by means of night lights, contrary to the Provisions of the Game and Fisheries Act and Regulations, Section 31(1).\nSection 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, provides as follows:\n31(1) No person shall hunt, trap or take any big game protected by this Part and the regulations by means of night lights of any description, traps, nets, snares, baited line, or other similar contrivances, or set such traps, nets, snares, baited line, or contrivance for such big game at any time, and, if so set, they may be destroyed by any person without incurring any liability for so doing.\nThe learned Magistrate acquitted the appellants because the term \"night lights\"\n\u2026 as used in the above subsection was not capable of definition, that the land upon which the hunting was being done was land to which the Indians had access in that there were no prohibition signs posted, and that the Indians were entitled, in any event, to hunt in any manner they saw fit on land to which they had access.\nThe Crown took an appeal by way of stated case to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2. The questions propounded were as follows:\n(a) having found that Rufus Prince, George Prince, and Robert Myron were hunting big game by means of a spotlight was I right in holding that such spotlight was not a night light within the meaning of Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 94;\n(b) was I right in interpreting the term \"night lights\" as contained in Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 94, as a classification or description of an object rather than a method or means of hunting;\n(c) having found that the land upon which Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron were hunting was land that was occupied and under cultivation and privately owned land, was I right in holding that such land was land to which the said Rufus Prince, George Prince, and, Robert Myron had a \"right of access\";\n(d) having found that the land upon which Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron were hunting was land to which the said Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron had \"a right of access\", was I right in dismissing the charge under Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act on this ground.\nThe Court of Appeal answered questions (a) and (b) in the negative; question (c) in the affirmative and question (d) in the negative, Schultz and Freedman JJ.A. dissenting as to (d). The Court accordingly directed that the case be referred back to the learned Magistrate with a direction that conviction should be entered against the three accused and that appropriate penalties should be imposed.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted on January 22, 1963.\nIt was admitted in this Court that at the time in question in the charge the appellants were Indians; that they were hunting deer for food for their own use and that they were hunting on lands to which they had the right of access. These admissions are fundamental to the determination of this appeal.\nSection 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, reads as follows:\n72(1) Notwithstanding this Act, and in so far only as is necessary to implement The Manitoba Natural Resources Act , any Indian may hunt and take game for food for his own use at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the Indian may have the right of access.\nThe above section refers to The Manitoba Natural Resources Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 180, of which s. 13 thereof reads as follows:\n13. In order to secure to the Indians of the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence, Canada agrees that the law respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, with which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.\nThere was a suggestion that the appeal involved a constitutional issue as to the validity of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, in respect to Indians. The Attorney-General for Ontario gave Notice of Intervention and the Provinces of Quebec and Alberta did likewise. Prior to the appeal being heard, the Province of Ontario filed a Notice of Withdrawal. The Provinces of Quebec and Alberta filed factums and were represented by counsel at the hearing. They were not heard as the Court held that no constitutional issue arose in the appeal. The agreement dated December 14, 1929, between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Manitoba containing, inter alia, said s. 13, pursuant to which The Manitoba Natural Resources Act was passed acquired the force of law by virtue of The British North America Act, (1930), 21 George V, c. 26.\nThe sole question for determination is whether the word \"hunt\" as used in s. 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, in regard to Indians is ambiguous in any way or subject to the limitations contained in s. 31(1) of the said Act.\nWith respect, I agree with the reasons of Freedman J.A. in his dissenting judgment and also with the statement by McGillivray J.A. in Rex v. Wesley3, when he said:\nIf the effect of the proviso is merely to give to the Indians the extra privilege of shooting for food \"out of season\" and they are otherwise subject to the game laws of the province, it follows that in any year they may be limited in the number of animals of a given kind that they may kill even though that number is not sufficient for their support and subsistence and even though no other kind of game is available to them. I cannot think that the language of the section supports the view that this was the intention of the law makers. I think the intention was that in hunting for sport or for commerce the Indian like the white man should be subject to laws which make for the preservation of game but, in hunting wild animals for the food necessary to his life, the Indian should be placed in a very different position from the white man who, generally speaking, does not hunt for food and was by the proviso to sec. 12 reassured of the continued enjoyment of a right which he has enjoyed from time immemorial.\nThe word \"hunt\" as used in the section under review must be given its plain meaning. \"Hunt\" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as:\nThe act of chasing wild animals for the purpose of catching or killing them; to chase for food or sport; to scour a district in pursuit of game.\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"hunt\" as: \"To follow or search for game for the purpose and with the means of capturing or killing.\" It is not ambiguous nor subject to any of the limitations which s. 31(1) imposes upon the non-Indian.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct that the acquittal of the appellants be confirmed. There should be no order as to costs for or against the Attorneys-General of Quebec and Alberta.\nAppeal allowed and acquittal directed, with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Johnston, Jessiman, Gardner & Johnston, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Manitoba.\n1 (1962), 40 W.W.R. 234.\n2 (1962), 40 W.W.R. 234.\n3 (1932), 2 W.W.R. 337 at 344, 26 Alta.

It was a snowy day and the water had accumulated as the result of people entering the bank with snow on their footwear. The plaintiff, who was not a regular customer of the bank in question, entered the premises for the purpose of cashing a cheque, and after having endorsed the cheque she walked to one of the tellers' cages where she was told that she would have to get the cheque initialled by the accountant or the manager. As she left to attend to this, her feet slipped from under her and she fell heavily to the watery floor and was injured. The plaintiff recovered substantial damages at trial, but, on appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the trial judge by a majority decision.\nHeld (Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.: The state of the floor on the afternoon of the accident constituted an \"unusual danger\". Not even the exigencies of Western Canadian winter conditions would make usual the presence on the floor of a large bank, in mid-afternoon, of a dangerous glaze of water underfoot near the tellers' wickets. The danger could have been prevented by economical and easy precautions; a member of the public frequenting this bank was entitled to expect such precautions and their absence tended to make the danger an \"unusual\" one. The bank failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage to its customers.\nThe defendant failed to establish the defence of volenti non fit injuria. As found by the trial judge, the plaintiff was not sciens of the danger to be met in the area of the tellers' wickets. Certainly, the defendant had failed to show such knowledge as to leave the inference that the risk had been voluntarily encountered. There was nothing to indicate that the plaintiff consented to absolve the defendant from its duty to take care.\nAlso, as held by the Courts below, the defence of contributory negligence was not established.\nIndermaur v.

Hamilton, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. N. McLachlan, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 (Freedman and Monnin JJ.A. dissenting) allowing an appeal by the respondent from the judgment rendered at trial by Mr. Justice Maybank whereby he awarded substantial damages to the appellant for injuries which she sustained in a fall occa- sioned by slipping in some water which had gathered on the floor of the premises of the Royal Bank of Canada at Brandon, Manitoba, on a snowy day in November, 1959. The appellant, who was not a regular customer of the bank in question, entered the premises for the purpose of cashing a cheque, and after having endorsed the cheque she walked to one of the tellers' cages where she was told that she would have to get the cheque initialled by the accountant or the manager. As she left the wicket to attend to this, her feet slipped from under her and she fell heavily to the watery floor, with the result that she sustained the injuries in respect of which this action is brought.\nThe source of the water on the floor is explained by the learned trial judge when he says:\nThere is no doubt that the numerous persons who entered the bank's lobby that day carried in a certain amount of snow on their boots\nand he describes the nature and the condition of the floor itself as follows:\nThe floor itself was of smooth tile of a kind seen in many public places like banks. It had been oiled on the week-end before the accident. There is no evidence to indicate improper oiling or an accumulation of oil in any particular place. Directly and by itself the oil on the floor did not cause the accident which is the subject of this action. It is possible that the oiled tile and water on top of it made the floor slippery, but I think the point does not necessarily have to be determined.\n(The italics are mine).\nThe learned trial judge proceeds to make the following finding as to the cause of the accident:\nI think there can be no doubt that water on the floor of the bank lobby caused this woman to fall and I find this as a fact. It was, in my opinion, more than mere moisture or dampness; it may have been less than actual puddles; but certainly there was at least a dangerous glaze or film of water underfoot near the tellers' wickets. It may be that the recent oiling contributed to the slipperiness caused by the water, but whether that is so does not, as I have previously said, need to be determined. The place was too slippery for safety.\nAs will hereafter appear, Mr. Justice Maybank adopted the view that the bank, while not actually an insurer of the appellant's safety on its premises, was, nevertheless, under a duty to her to use reasonable care to keep those premises safe, and it appears to me to be clear that it was upon this basis that he fixed the bank with liability saying:\nIn the instant case the bank did not take care to have its premises safe for its customers. In the vestibule was a rubber corrugated mat on which people could clean their footwear. It was not adequate as a help towards keeping a fairly dry lobby floor. A cocoa mat someplace about would have been useful. Also, when the weather was such that people carried in wet snow, a few strips of matting to the busy parts of the lobby or even at those busy places would have kept the floor nearly dry. The bank had no system or method for ensuring safe premises.\nIt is not disputed that the relationship between the bank and the appellant was that of invitor and invitee and the sole question raised by this appeal is whether the bank discharged the duty to which that relationship gives rise.\nIn defining this duty, the learned trial judge, after referring to a number of cases which had been cited before him, including Indermaur v. Dames3, went on to say:\nNow it is quite clear that while the invitor does not actually insure the safety of his invitee, he must use reasonable care to keep safe the premises into which he has invited that person. If there is a danger for his invitee of which the invitor ought to have known, his responsibility is the same as if he had known of it. All the authorities listed above and many others either express these propositions or are consonant with them.\nWhen this passage is considered in conjunction with the finding that it was a breach of the bank's duty for it to fail to have any \"system or method of ensuring safety\", it seems to me with the greatest respect to be apparent that the learned trial judge has misconceived the nature of the duty owing by an invitor to an invitee under the law applicable in Manitoba.\nThe nature of that duty has recently been restated in the case of Hillman v. Macintosh2, where Mr. Justice Martland, speaking on behalf of the majority of this Court said:\n\u2026 the relationship between the appellant and the respondent was that of invitor and invitee.\nThe appellant, therefore, owed to the respondent, in relation to his use of the freight elevators, a duty the classic definition of which is that of Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames:\nAnd, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger, which he knows or ought to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question whether such reasonable care has been taken, by notice, lighting, guarding, or otherwise, and whether there was contributory negligence in the sufferer, must be determined by a jury as a matter of fact.\nSee also Hanes v. Kennedy4, per Kerwin J. (as he then was) at p. 387.\nI would also adopt the following comment by Professor Fleming in his work on \"The Law of Torts\" 2nd ed., at p. 412:\nThe duty is not to prevent unusual danger but to prevent damage from unusual danger. An invitee cannot claim that the occupier make alterations to his premises to render them safe. He must take them as they are subject to the occupier's duty to use reasonable care to protect him from unusual dangers.\nIt has been said that the term \"unusual danger\" as used in this context defies comprehensive definition, but as has been pointed out by MacDonald J. in Rafuse v. T. Eaton Co. (Maritimes) Ltd.5:\n\u2026 it clearly has one primary meaning: it means \"such danger as is not usually found in carrying out the function which the invitee has in hand\"; and \"was intended to exclude the common recognizable dangers of every day experience in premises of an ordinary type\". See London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton6, per Lord Porter at p. 745 and Lord MacDermott at p. 762.\nIn light of the above authorities, it appears to me to be established that proof of the existence of an unusual danger which caused the damage complained of is an essential ingredient of the plaintiff's case, and in the absence of such proof, it is superfluous to consider any defence based on the appellant's having known and appreciated the condition of the floor or having accepted the risk, if any, inherent in encountering it.\nAccordingly, in my view, the first question to be answered in this case is:\nHas it been shown that an accumulation of moisture which had collected on the tile floor in front of the tellers' wickets in a busy bank in Brandon, Manitoba, on a snowy day constituted an unusual danger.\nI think it may at least be accepted that it is natural for moisture to accumulate on the tile floor of a building at a point where people have been standing with damp snow on their boots, and that in snowy climates, unless some preventative measures are taken, this must happen to some extent in wintertime on the tile floors of all buildings frequented by the public. Mr. Armstrong, the bank manager, refers to the moisture which accumulated in the bank in question as \"dampness\" rather than \"water\", and Mr. Edworthy, who was a regular customer of the bank, says that he had never actually noticed water on the floor and did not notice it on the day in question until his foot slipped as he turned to help the appellant up from her fall. The views thus expressed do not satisfy me that it was unusual to find melted snow in varying quantities on the floor of this particular bank \"when the weather was such that people carried in wet snow\" (to use the trial judge's expression) and particularly that it was unusual for there to be a concentration of such melted snow in front of the tellers' wickets.\nIt remains to be considered whether it is usual for the occupiers of such a building to take preventative measures against allowing water to accumulate on tile floors, such as having cocoa matting or some other substance on the floor in wintertime, or having somebody circulating amongst the customers with a mop to keep the floor fairly dry.\nIt is apparent, as the learned trial judge has found, that the respondent did not employ any effective system to control or prevent such conditions as existed in the lobby when the appellant fell, and as there is nothing to indicate that there was anything about the weather or the condition of the floor itself to distinguish the day in question from any other day in winter, it becomes relevant to note that throughout the eight winters during which Mr. Armstrong had been manager there had never been any complaint about anybody falling or slipping in the lobby. This appears to me to support the suggestion that while the fall was unusual, the floor was not dangerous.\nThe learned trial judge has found that the floor \"was of smooth tile of a kind seen in many public places such as banks\", but I can find no evidence whatever in the record as to what if any measures it is usual for the occupiers of such public buildings to take in wintertime to prevent water collecting from the snowy boots of their customers. The danger of attempting to decide this matter by taking judicial notice of floor conditions usually found in such buildings in snowy weather appears to me, with all respect, to be demonstrated by the sharp difference of opinion which existed between the distinguished judges of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba as to whether it was usual or unusual to find water in such quantities on the floor of a bank in Manitoba in wintertime. Three judges of that Court were of opinion that there was nothing \"unusual\" about the condition of the bank's floor on the day in question, saying that it would be \"wholly unrealistic and unreasonable\" \"\u2026 to expect anything other than a wet floor on a snowy day in Manitoba in any public place such as a bank \u2026\", while two judges of the same Court had not the slightest doubt that the presence of water on the floor constituted an unusual danger and expressed the view that: \"One does not normally expect that bank premises, to which members of the public customarily resort in large numbers, will be wet and therefore hazardous. Not even under Western Canadian winter conditions would it be usual to expect to encounter such a floor\".\nOwing no doubt to the view which he took of the law, the learned trial judge made no finding as to whether or not the appellant's injuries were caused by an unusual danger, unless it can be said that the finding that \"The place was too slippery for safety\" is itself to be considered a finding of unusual danger.\nI do not consider the evidence that the appellant slipped and fell in the amount of water which had accumulated on the floor at the tellers' wickets of the respondent's bank and that Mr. Edworthy slipped but did not fall on the same spot as he turned to pick her up, is of itself proof of the presence of an unusual danger or indeed that it proves that on the day in question the floor was too slippery for the safety of persons other than the appellant.\nAs I am unable to find any evidence in the record before us that it was unusual for such floor conditions to be present in such a building on such a day, I must conclude that the appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proving that her unfortunate fall occurred under circumstances giving rise to liability on the part of the respondent bank. I would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Judson, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSpence J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba7 dated January 3, 1963, which allowed an appeal from the judgment of Maybank J. dated July 4, 1962, in which he awarded the plaintiff judgment against the defendant for $35,889 and costs. The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for damages sustained in a fall on the premises of the defendant in Brandon, Manitoba, at 2:30 p.m. on Monday, November 23, 1959.\nIt is not my purpose at the present time to review the facts in detail as I presume they are to be mentioned in another judgment in this Court.\nThe appeal, however, was argued upon the basis that the plaintiff was an invitee upon the premises. The occupier's liability to an invitee was stated by Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames8 as follows:\nAnd, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knows or ought to know.\nThat outline of liability has been accepted universally since the day it was pronounced. Therefore, the first and the most important inquiry before a court considering such a claim is whether, under the circumstances existing at the time and place of the accident, there was present an \"unusual danger\". \"Unusual danger\" has been defined in the judgment given in the House of Lords in London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton9, by Lord Porter at p. 745, as follows:\nI think \"unusual\" is used in an objective sense and means such danger as is not usually found in carrying out the task or fulfilling the function which the invitee has in hand, though what is unusual will, of course, vary with the reasons for which the invitee enters the premises. Indeed, I do not think Phillimore, L.J., in Norman v. Great Western Railway Co., [1915] 1 K.B. 584 at 596, is speaking of individuals as individuals but of individuals as members of a type, e.g. that class of persons such as stevedores or seamen who are accustomed to negotiate the difficulties which their occupation presents. A tall chimney is not an unusual difficulty for a steeplejack though it would be for a motor mechanic. But I do not think a lofty chimney presents a danger less unusual for the last-named because he is particularly active or untroubled by dizziness. The plaintiff was a widow of 55 years of age who was attending the bank premises in order to obtain payment of a cheque made in her favour. The bank was not the one with which she regularly dealt and she had been in the premises but a few times before. In other words, she was an ordinary member of the public with no special prior knowledge of the conditions in the particular premises.\nLord Normand said at p. 752 of the same case:\nI am of opinion that if the persons invited to the premises are a particular class of tradesman then the test is whether it is unusual danger for that class.\nHere, as I have stated, the invitee was an ordinary customer of the bank but of no particular class. We must, therefore, consider the facts in a particular case in the light of these statements of the law which I adopt.\nThe bank premises were in the City of Brandon, a city with a population not given in evidence but we may take judicial notice that it is a considerable city, second in Manitoba outside the Greater Winnipeg area, with a population of nearly 30,000. The bank premises contained the sole branch of the bank in that city and was no small building as it provided space for 7 tellers' wickets, and the area for the use of the public inside the main vestibule measured 21\u00bd feet by 32 feet. To these bank premises the public resorted in large numbers.\nThe day of the accident was a Monday but was described by Mrs. Martens, a teller, as \"a busy day\" and it would seem that on a busy day each one of the 4 savings tellers dealt with between 30 and 35 customers during the day. The bank was at the corner of 8th Avenue and Prosser Street in the City of Brandon. The accident occurred at about 2.30 p.m. on November 23, 1959, and during the previous day 1\u00bc inches of snow had fallen in Brandon and another 2.8 inches fell throughout the course of the 23rd of November. The temperature on the latter day varied from 23 to 27 degrees so that the condition under foot could be referred to as mildly slushy. Whether or not there had been snow cleaning in the immediate vicinity of the bank, the learned trial judge found that many persons who entered the bank on that day carried in a certain amount of snow on their boots. Entering the bank, a customer passed through a vestibule 10 feet square, the floor of which was completely covered with a corrugated rubber mat. No witness at the trial had ever seen anyone stamping snow off their feet on that mat. The customer passing through that vestibule entered the public premises of the bank through a double door. Much of the evidence at trial and consideration in both the Court of Appeal and in this Court was devoted to an examination of the state of the floor in the public premises. That floor was of a rubber composition tile and had been treated with what was described in evidence as \"self-polishing non-skid liquid wax\" on either the Sunday or the Saturday preceding the accident, both of which, of course, were non-business days. The learned trial judge stated:\nIt is possible that the oiled tile and water on top of it made the floor slippery, but I think the point does not necessarily have to be determined.\nAfter that statement, the consideration of the issue of the defendant's liability has proceeded without regard to any possibility that the presence of wax referred to in error by the learned trial judge as \"oiled\" contributed in any way to the accident. In this case, we are not concerned with the effect of wax on the floor but with the effect of water from melted snow upon the floor. In the Court of Appeal, Guy J.A., entered into a detailed and careful examination of the evidence upon that topic and particularly the plaintiff's knowledge of the condition of the floor.\nAs to the presence of an \"unusual danger\" apart from any question of the plaintiff's knowledge and appreciation of it, one might well commence with the finding of fact by the learned trial judge, where he said:\nI think there can be no doubt that water on the floor of the bank lobby caused this woman to fall and I find this as a fact. It was, in my opinion, more than mere moisture or dampness; it may have been less than actual puddles; but certainly there was at least a dangerous glaze or film of water underfoot near the teller's wickets.\nAnd:\nIn the first place it should be said I think that the plaintiff's knowledge was not knowledge of the dangerous condition around the tellers' wickets. The condition was worse there. (The underlining is my own.)\nThese were findings of fact by an experienced trial court judge made after hearing the evidence, often contradictory, in court and coming to the conclusion as to the evidence which he would accept and the probative value he would attach to that evidence,\nYet her statement is one I accept unreservedly.\nAnd:\nI have no doubt about the plaintiff's veracity. I would say that any unequivocal statement made by her should be accepted as wholly true.\nFreedman J.A., said, in the minority judgment of the Court of Appeal, in reference to this finding, \"And I would say that the evidence clearly supports such a finding\". And at p. 207, \"Once again, I would say that the learned trial Judge's conclusions are supported by the evidence.\" (The underlining is my own.)\nWith that statement and with that course in reference to the trial judge's findings of fact upon contradictory evidence, I am in complete agreement.\nWatt or Thomas v. Thomas10, per Lord Macmillan at p. 490; S.S. Hontestroom v. S.S. Sagaporack11, per Lord Sumner at p. 47; Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home12, per Viscount Sankey at pp. 249-50; Roche v. Marston13, per Kerwin J. at pp. 495-6; Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. et al. v. Forseth & Forseth14, per Martland J. at pp. 594-5.\nTherefore, in the light of these facts as so found, was the condition of the floor at the place where the plaintiff fell on November 23, 1959, a \"condition of unusual danger\"? Guy J.A., giving the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal, said:\nThe plaintiff apparently lived in Western Canada all her life and spent the ten years prior to the accident, in the city of Brandon. She knew what the snow conditions were outside, and I think we may take judicial notice of the fact that she must have encountered the same situation in every shop, either city or rural office, department store, school and public building she visited during her lifetime. On at least nine occasions during the giving of her evidence in Court at the trial, she stated that she noticed the floor was wet; that she saw patches of water; that she thought it was wet (\"not all over, but in spots\"). In addition to this, of course, at least two witnesses testified that the bank floor was wet in spots.\nThere had been a number of people in the bank during banking hours that day, and, according to the witness Martens, it was a busy day. According to the witness Golding, one of the plaintiff's witnesses, the condi- tion of the floor was no more than one would expect in a public place on a snowy day. I shall quote her evidence further on in this judgment.\nAnother witness called by the plaintiff was a Mr. Edworthy, who testified to the same effect; a portion of his evidence appears later in this judgment.\nHaving regard to the picture presented by all the evidence, I must say that the situation, which confronted the plaintiff in the bank on the day in question, was a situation so commonplace as to take it out of the category of the \"unusual\". The significance of the word \"unusual\" as it appears in the basic principle of Indermaur v. Dames, supra, seems to me to be this: if the danger is an usual danger, it must be assumed that ordinary reasonable people know and appreciate it fully. Conversely if they know and appreciate it, it ceases to be unusual. In my view, to expect anything other than a wet floor on a snowy day in Manitoba in any public place such as a bank, store, post office, school, office, theatre, restaurant, or any of the hundreds of shops that abound in the Province, is to deny the everyday realities of life, and is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable.\nOn the other hand, Freedman J.A., in giving the minority judgment of that Court, said:\nOne does not normally expect that bank premises, to which members of the public customarily resort in large numbers, will be wet and therefore hazardous. Not even under western Canadian winter conditions would it be usual to expect to encounter such a floor. Admittedly snowstorms outside carry with them the prospect of snow being brought within premises, but that very likelihood imposes upon the occupier the obligation to take some effective measures against hazards thereby created. He cannot stand idly by, do nothing to protect invitees from damage arising from a wet floor, and then simply look to the snowstorm to exonerate him.\n(The underlining is my own.)\nThe question of \"reasonable care\" under the rule of Indermaur v. Dames, will be described hereinafter.\nAgain, I find myself in agreement with Freedman J.A. that not even the exigencies of Western Canadian winter conditions would make usual the presence on the floor of a large bank in a city of 30,000, in mid-afternoon, of \"a dangerous glaze of water underfoot near the tellers' wickets\". I am of opinion that the state of the floor in that bank on that afternoon constituted an \"unusual danger\".\nIt is perhaps a test of some value to determine whether a condition is one of unusual danger to investigate the ease by which the occupier might avoid it. In the present case, the learned trial judge said:\nA cocoa mat some place about would have been useful. Also when the weather was such that people carried in wet snow a few strips of matting to the busy parts of the lobby or even at those busy places would have kept the floor nearly dry. If the danger could have been prevented by these economical and easy precautions then surely a member of the public frequenting such a busy place as this bank would have been entitled to expect such precautions or others equally effective, and their absence would tend to make the danger an \"unusual\" one. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the condition which confronted the plaintiff as she walked \"very gingerly\" from the savings wicket towards the ledger wicket was a condition of \"unusual danger\".\nBefore considering the defences of volenti non fit injuria and of contributory negligence, I turn to the question of whether the defendant on its part did use \"reasonable care to prevent damage\" to the plaintiff. Throughout the case, in the evidence, and in the judgments of both Courts, reference is made to the defendant's \"system\" of cleaning the floor. So far as that system affected the accumulation of snow or water from melted snow upon the floor in the public area of the bank's premises, it may be characterized as haphazard at the best. Some of the employees of the bank described as \"juniors\" seem to have cast upon them the vague duty of both cleaning the snow from the sidewalks outside the bank and mopping up the water which might collect on the floor in the bank premises. The trial judge, upon consideration of the evidence, only could find that the sidewalks \"had probably been cleared of snow during the day\" but no junior or anyone else had mopped the floor inside the bank at all during the course of the day of November 23rd, despite the fact that nearly 3 inches of snow fell in the city of Brandon during that day. The janitor, Gill, who one might presume might be the employee whose duties had most immediate connection with the cleaning of floors, was not even required to be about the premises during business hours. This course of conduct on the part of the defendant bank I would characterize as failure to use reasonable care to prevent damage to its customers, including the plaintiff whom the bank could expect to frequent its premises. I have come to this conclusion realizing the ease with which the danger could have been prevented by any of the steps referred to by the learned trial judge. Moreover, in my view, such a finding does not cast upon small businesses and shops throughout Manitoba any onerous burden. I would adopt the words of Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal:\nCounsel for the defendant advanced the argument that to hold the defendant liable in circumstances such as the present would be to impose an unfair and intolerable burden upon occupiers of premises. With respect, I do not share that view. Naturally one does not expect perfection of conduct from an occupier of premises. Moreover, one must make allowances for climatic conditions and the hazards they bring. But if weather conditions bring with them risks, they are no less accompanied by a corresponding duty to take reasonable precautions against damage that might be caused therefrom. \"The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed\" said Cardozo J. (Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Company, (1928) 248 N.Y. 339), and it is appropriate to recall those words here.\nGuy J.A., giving the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal, quoted the learned trial judge as follows: \"That she was sciens to a degree is not open to opposing argument\". And also:\nIn the first place it should be said I think that the plaintiff's knowledge was not knowledge of the dangerous condition around the tellers' wickets. The condition was worse there. So that even if the maxim on which defendants often rely was \"scienti non fit injuria\" rather than \"volenti non fit injuria\" it could not be said that the plaintiff was sciens of the danger to be met in the area of the tellers' wickets. Even if she were aware of the floor around the tellers' wickets being more slippery than the floor around the endorsement counter, (and I do not see how she could be aware of this in all the circumstances), it seems to me one would still not be able to say that she was volens.\nand expressed his view that the evidence did not support such statement. The learned justice in appeal then proceeded to quote extensively from the evidence of the plaintiff and concluded:\nWith respect, the foregoing evidence of the plaintiff herself does not justify the statement of the learned trial judge that she was not sciens of the danger to be met in the area of the tellers' wickets.\nAnd:\nI say this is significant because, if there was an unusual danger and if, as the law states, she must fully appreciate the nature and extent of the risk, the plaintiff alone fully appreciated the nature and extent of the risk, and the other witnesses regarded the condition as common or usual on days such as November 23, 1959.\nAgain, it is my view, that the learned trial judge heard the evidence and observed not only the plaintiff but all the other witnesses and expressed his finding of fact in the words which I have quoted above. Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal accepted that finding of fact when he said:\nHere, however, the plaintiff had far from a full knowledge of the danger. Beyond sensing or perceiving a condition of moisture in the location of the endorsement counter, she had no actual knowledge of the far more serious condition of wetness around the area of the tellers' cage. On the evidence it cannot be said that the plaintiff was sciens.\nI am of the opinion that under the circumstances, the finding of the learned trial judge should be accepted. Certainly, the defendant has failed to show such knowledge as to leave the inference that the risk had been voluntarily-encountered. See Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.15, per Lord Shaw at p. 730, and Osborne v. London and North Western Railway Co.16, per Willes J. at p. 223:\n\u2026 if the defendants desire to succeed on the ground that the maxim \"Volenti non fit injuria\" is applicable, they must obtain a finding of fact \"that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk he ran, impliedly agreed to incur it\".\nIn Lehnert v. Stein17, Cartwright J., giving judgment for the majority of the Court, said at p. 43:\nThe decision of this Court in Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Seymour and Moloney, [1956] S.C.R. 322, 2 D.L.R. (2d) 369, renders it unnecessary to make any lengthy examination of the authorities, which were fully considered in the judgments delivered in that case, particularly in that of Doull J., in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (in Banco), (1955) 36 M.P.R. 337. That decision establishes that where a driver of a motor vehicle invokes the maxim volenti non fit injuria as a defence to an action for damages for injuries caused by his negligence to a passenger, the burden lies upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff, expressly or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff occasioned by that negligence, and that, as stated in Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 44:\n\"The true question in every case is: Did the plaintiff give a real consent to the assumption of the risk without compensation; did the consent really absolve the defendant from the duty to take care?\"\nThere is nothing to indicate that the plaintiff consented to absolve the defendant from this duty to take care. Therefore, the defendant has not established the defence of volens.\nThe learned trial judge found that the defence of contributory negligence has not been established. Guy J.A., giving the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal, said \"It is clear from the evidence, with respect, that the learned trial judge was right\". I also concur in this view.\nTherefore, in the result, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored. The plaintiff is also entitled to the costs of the appeal in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Honeywell, Baker, Gibson, Wetherspoon, Lawrence & Diplock, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n1 (1963), 41 W.W.R. 91, 37 D.L.R.

Ce radio fut vole par un nomme Corbin qui le cacha dans le bas de la ville de Montr\u00e9al. Quelques heures plus tard, dans la soir\u00e9e, Corbin et deux autres personnes prirent place dans le nord de la ville dans l'automobile de l'appelant qui \u00e9tait accompagne d'un nomme Whitworth. Ils descendirent vers le bas de la ville pour s'arr\u00eater dans le voisinage de l'endroit ou Corbin avait cache le radio. A ce moment ou quelques instants auparavant Corbin informa l'appelant qu'il avait quelque chose a lui donner. Corbin alla chercher le radio et le rapporta en le cachant sous son manteau. Apr\u00e8s avoir laisse Corbin et ses deux compagnons en cours de route, l'appelant conduisit Whitworth \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 celui-ci cacha le radio.

Leurs t\u00e9moignages, non d\u00e9pourvus de r\u00e9ticences ou de contradictions, permettent d'en faire ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nDans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 30 mars 1961, Fernand Corbin vola le radio en question alors qu'il \u00e9tait fixe a une automobile stationn\u00e9e dans le bas de la ville en arri\u00e8re d'un immeuble de la rue St-Denis, pr\u00e8s de la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes, v\u00e9hicule qu'il avait ill\u00e9galement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 aux fins de ce vol. Il cacha le radio dans une cour priv\u00e9e attenante \u00e0 la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes et dont l'acc\u00e8s \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par une cl\u00f4ture. Le m\u00eame jour, vers les neuf heures du soir, Corbin, Marcel Plante et Charles Vincent, se trouvant alors dans le nord de la ville, prirent place dans une automobile conduite par l'appelant, en compagnie duquel se trouvait d\u00e9j\u00e0 Wayne Whitworth. Tous ces occupants de la voiture, a l'exception de Rotondo qui \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s de quarante ans, \u00e9taient des jeunes gens de quinze a dix-neuf ans. Ils descendirent tous vers le bas de la ville pour s'arr\u00eater dans le voisinage imm\u00e9diat de l'endroit ou Corbin avait cache le radio. C'est alors que Corbin, muni d'outils, se rendit dans la cour priv\u00e9e, prit le radio et le rapportera l'automobile en le cachant sous son manteau. Repartis de cet endroit, les occupants de la voiture, a l'exception de Rotondo et Wayne Whitworth, se firent laisser a une salle de pool et Rotondo conduisit Whitworth a un endroit o\u00f9 celui-ci cacha le radio. A un certain moment, avant ou au moment d'arriver \u00e0 la cour priv\u00e9e, Corbin informa Rotondo qu'il avait quelque chose 'a, lui donner. Il ne fait aucun doute, suivant la preuve, que ce quelque chose \u00e9tait le radio que Corbin avait rapporte a l'automobile avec ses outils, au vu de certains sinon de tous les occupants de la voiture. Sans entrer dans le d\u00e9tail et la discussion des t\u00e9moignages rendus par ces jeunes gens et l'appelant, l'ensemble de la preuve faite par ces t\u00e9moins, dont la tenue en Cour aussi bien que les t\u00e9moignages ont pu \u00eatre appr\u00e9cies par le Juge au proc\u00e8s, \u00e9tablit raisonnablement que ce dernier pouvait judicieusement conclure\u2014comme il le fit\u2014que l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit don \u00e9tait le radio, qu'il savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet vole, et enfin qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un temps appr\u00e9ciable, la possession. Entendu comme t\u00e9moin, pour sa propre d\u00e9fense, Rotondo admit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 condamne pour vol avec effraction et recel. Il t\u00e9moigna qu'a un moment, au cours de cette randonn\u00e9e en automobile, il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\u2014\u00abMoi je veux rien avoir \u00e0 faire avec ca\u00bb. Si cette d\u00e9claration, rapport\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage, permettait au Juge de d\u00e9duire que Rotondo savait alors qu'il s'agissait d'un objet vole, le Juge \u00e9tait libre de croire ou de ne pas croire que Rotondo avait v\u00e9ritablement fait cette d\u00e9claration au cours de l'affaire. La section 4 de l'art. 3 du Code Criminel d\u00e9finit ainsi la possession:\nAux fins de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\na) Une personne est en possession d'une chose lorsqu'elle l'a en sa possession personnelle ou que, sciemment,\n(i) elle l'a en la possession ou garde r\u00e9elle d'une autre personne, ou\n(ii) elle l'a en un lieu qui lui appartient ou non ou quelle occupe ou non, pour son propre usage ou avantage ou celui d'une autre personne; et\nb) Lorsqu'une de deux ou plusieurs personnes, au su et avec le consentement de l'autre ou des autres, a une chose en sa garde ou possession, cette chose est cens\u00e9e sous la garde et en la possession de toutes ces personnes et de chacune d'elles.\nEt l'article 300 \u00e9dicte:\nPour l'application de l'article 296 et de l'alin\u00e9a b) du paragraphe (1) de l'article 298, l'infraction consistant \u00e0 avoir en sa possession est consomm\u00e9e lorsqu'une personne a, seule ou conjointement avec une autre, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le d'une chose mentionn\u00e9e dans ces articles ou lorsqu'elle aide \u00e0 la cacher ou a en disposer, selon le cas.\nAyant attentivement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la preuve et tous les moyens de droit soulev\u00e9s de la part de l'appelant, je dirais qu'au regard de la loi et du dossier, rien ne permet d'\u00e9carter validement la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre l'appelant en premi\u00e8re instance et confirm\u00e9e par le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine si\u00e9geant en appel.\nJe renverrais l'appel.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureur de l'appelant: Norbert Losier, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l'intim\u00e9e: Michael Franklin, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1962] B.R. 653."
