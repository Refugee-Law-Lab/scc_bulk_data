Mitchell (Defendant) Respondent.\n1927: November 2; 1928: February 7.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nLibel\u2014Privilege\u2014Letters written by medical officer of railway company, while investigating claim by company\u2019s employee to Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board\u2014Disclosure of alleged communications by claimant when consulting medical officer as his personal physician\u2014Principles underlying right to protection of privilege.\nThe underlying principle on which is founded protection for a communication otherwise actionable as defamatory, is \u201cthe common convenience and welfare of society.\u201d The communication is only protected when it is fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency, and when made in discharge of some public or private duty such as would be recognized by people of ordinary intelligence and moral principles, or is fairly made in the legitimate defence of a person\u2019s own interests. It is not sufficient that the person making the statement believes, honestly and not without some ground, that the duty or interest exists. There must, in fact, be such a duty or interest as, under all the circumstances, warrants the communication.\nProfessional secrets acquired from a patient by a physician in the course of his practice, are the patient\u2019s secrets, and, normally, are under his control and not under that of the physician. Prima facie it is the patient\u2019s right that the secrets be not divulged; and that right is absolute unless there is some paramount reason overriding it.\nThe fact that the disclosure of a patient\u2019s secret is made by one physician to another is not a decisive factor to justify it, although in some cases that fact may have significance.\nEven where the circumstances may justify a physician in disclosing his patient\u2019s secret, the justification does not extend to a wanton disclosure; and the fact that a statement is made unnecessarily (though without malice) may, having regard to its nature, make it a wanton disclosure, and bar the claim of privilege with respect to it. Also, even where a disclosure of a patient\u2019s secret may be justified, the physician should take every practicable precaution to avoid inaccuracy and unfairness, and his failure to do so (though without malice) may be fatal to a claim of privilege.\nA medical officer of an industrial concern, charged with investigating an employee\u2019s claim made to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board (Ont.), and in preparing the evidence, (and even where any sum awarded will be paid, not by the employer, but by the Dominion Government, by reason of the claimant being a returned soldier), is not so situated that he is under a duty, for the purpose of securing information in preparing his case, to divulge, without the claimant\u2019s assent, facts which he has confidentially ascertained from the claimant as his personal medical adviser. The absolute privilege protecting the testimony of witnesses in court is applicable to protect statements by an intending witness, as to the nature of the evidence he can give, made to persons engaged professionally in preparing the evidence to be presented in court (Watson v. McEwan, [1905] A.C. 480); but does not extend to such statements made to persons not concerned in preparing the evidence.\nCertain statements made by defendant, assistant chief medical officer of a railway company, and charged with investigating a claim made by plaintiff, an employee of the company, to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board (Ont.), which statements were contained in two letters, written, respectively, to an officer of the Department of Soldiers Civil Re\u2011establishment, for information, and to an eye specialist whose opinion was required, and disclosed communications alleged by defendant to have been made to him by plaintiff when consulting defendant as a physician some years before to the effect that plaintiff had had a certain disorder, were held, in the circumstances in question, not to come within the protection of privilege.\nMacintosh v. Dun, [1908] A.C. 480, at pp. 390, 398, 399; London Assn. for Protection of Trade v. Greenlands Ltd., [1916] A.C. 15, at pp. 22-23, 28, 29; Stuart v. Bell, [1891] 2 Q.B. 341, at p. 350, and other cases, cited.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (59 Ont. L.R. 590, reversing judgment of Wright J., 59 Ont. L.R. 385) reversed in part.\nSmith J. dissented in part, holding that the second letter was privileged, being written in the performance of defendant\u2019s duty of investigating the claim, and submitting facts, as he had gathered them, on which an expert opinion was to be based; that defendant could not properly, under the circumstances, have suppressed the facts (as he understood them) which he believed would show the claim to be unfounded; as to the first letter, however, the defence of qualified privilege could not prevail; it was a letter seeking information, and there was no necessity of making therein the libellous statement complained of; and in respect thereof the plaintiff was entitled to at least nominal damages.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Wright J.[2]\nThe action was for damages for alleged libel and slander. Wright J. held the plaintiff entitled to recover $500 for libel and $200 for slander. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division, which held that the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed. This Court, in its judgment now reported, held that the plaintiff should succeed as to the libels, and allowed the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for $500 damages for libel, and costs of the action. Smith J. dissented in part, as indicated in the above headnote. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nR.T. Harding K.C. for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Lamont JJ.) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant was a member of the Canadian Expeditionary Forces, in which he enlisted on the 8th of October, 1915, and was discharged as no longer fit for service, on the 10th of April, 1918, by reason of valvular disease of the heart, which had been contracted in the army. In May, 1924, while in the service of the Canadian National Railways at Toronto, as a draftsman, he suffered an attack of iritis, which permanently affected his vision; and in the following September he applied to the Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board for compensation, ascribing the affection from which he suffered to a blow received from a swinging door in the office where he was employed, and supporting his application by a certificate from Dr. Angus Campbell, the physician who had treated him. Shortly afterwards, he was requested by the Claims Department of the Canadian National Railways to submit himself for examination to the respondent, who was Assistant Chief Medical Officer of the railway company, at Toronto, and was in due course examined by the respondent, and later by Dr. James McCallum, an eye specialist.\nOn the 22nd of December, 1924, the Board notified him that his application had been rejected. His request for permission to inspect the evidence upon which the Board had proceeded was refused, but he was granted a re-hearing, which took place on the 8th of January, 1925. On the rehearing, he was asked by the Secretary of the Board if, while in the army, he had contracted a disease referred to in the evidence as \u201cg.c. infection\u201d; and this he denied. On this re-hearing, the respondent also gave evidence, that the appellant had been a patient of his in 1920, and had then admitted to him that, two years before, he had suffered from that malady. This the appellant denied, and the hearing was adjourned for further evidence. The ap- pellant then, having been given an opportunity of inspecting the material before the Board, discovered that, in addition to a communication from the respondent, similar in tenor to that of the testimony just mentioned, there had been placed before the Board a communication from Dr. Hewitt, the Chief Officer of the Department of Soldiers\u2019 Civil Re-establishment in Toronto, stating that the military records contained an entry indicating that the appellant had been affected by this disorder, while in the army. After considerable delay, the appellant\u2019s exertions were successful in having the original records, giving his army medical history, transferred from Ottawa to Toronto for inspection; from which it appeared that they contained no such entry. Thereupon the appellant requested the respondent to withdraw the statements he had made as to the facts ascertained by him as the appellant\u2019s physician in 1920, which, through some channel, had been reported to the appellant\u2019s family. The appellant, in his evidence, stated that at this interview the respondent declared he would never have made the communication he did make to the Board, but for the information he had received from Dr. Hewitt, as to the entries in the military record; and the learned trial judge finds as a fact that the respondent promised then to write a letter which the appellant had demanded, withdrawing the statement that the appellant had admitted having contracted g.c. infection. A day or two after this interview, the appellant received from the respondent a letter, written, it is stated, after consultation with the Railway Company\u2019s Claims Agent, declining to make any \u201cfurther report\u201d upon the subject to the appellant. The appellant then brought the action out of which this appeal arises, claiming damages for defamation. Justification was not pleaded, but the respondent alleged that the communications complained of were severally published on privileged occasions, and without malice.\nIn substance, the learned trial judge held that in fact the appellant had not informed the respondent that he had suffered from the malady mentioned; that the publications complained of were not privileged; and, moreover, that in disclosing to the detriment of the appellant information supposed to have been received by him under the seal of professional confidence, the respondent was not actuated by a sense of duty, but by a determination to defeat the appellant\u2019s claim for compensation. This judgment was reversed, and the action dismissed, by the Second Appellate Division.\nThe publications complained of in the statement of claim are four, all in October or November, 1924. First, to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, in writing; second, to Dr. Angus Campbell, orally; third, to Dr. Hewitt, in writing; fourth, to Dr. McCallum, in writing.\nAs to the first of these publications, the learned trial judge held that the respondent was protected by an absolute privilege, on the principle of Watson v. McEwan[3], and no question now arises as to this communication. As to the second, the Appellate Division held, and we think rightly, that there was nothing in the conversation upon which the charge was based which, in terms or in effect, upon the evidence adduced, can properly be held to have imputed to the appellant a presently existing infection. We need only concern ourselves, therefore, with the communications on the third and fourth occasions. Before proceeding to the discussion of the evidence, it should be mentioned that, after declining, on the advice of the Claims Agent, to write the letter he had previously promised to write, the respondent says that he appeared before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board on behalf of the Railway Company, and insisted upon the correctness of his previous statement. The appellant\u2019s claim was dismissed upon grounds which the Board stated in their reasons for judgment, included the fact that there was before them evidence of a g.c. infection. Later, the appellant having taken the only means left to vindicate himself, by bringing this action, he was, because he had taken that step, dismissed from his employment with the Canadian National Railways.\nIn all this, if the learned trial judge was not mistaken in his finding, the appellant has evidently been the victim of a cruel error; and it behooves us to examine with some attention the reasons given by the Appellate Division for their reversal of Wright J\u2019s judgment. Let us, then, consider these communications, in respect of their origin, purport and object. In each case, the subject matter of the communication was a fact which the respondent supposed the appellant had stated to him as his medical attendant, in circumstances which clothed the communication with a confidential character. The respondent, looking up his notes of his treatment of the appellant, found an entry on one of his cards to the effect that, two years before the date of the entry, the appellant had suffered from g.c. infection; and a further entry, that, in treating the appellant, he had administered anti-g.c. vaccine. He had no actual recollection of any statement by the appellant on the subject; and at the trial he was unable to say with certainty when the memorandum had been made. The learned trial judge found\u2014a finding which must, I think, be accepted in this Court\u2014that the note was not made at the time of, or immediately after, the interview to which it relates, but some weeks, at least, later. Before the publication of any of these libels, the respondent had interviewed Dr. Angus Campbell, who had treated Halls quite recently, and had been informed by Dr. Campbell that, when first consulted by Halls, he had, with a view to ascertaining the cause of the iritis from which he was suffering and the proper treatment for it, asked Halls if he had ever suffered from g.c. infection, and had received an answer in the negative; and his treatment had proceeded on that basis. The respondent, in these communications, therefore, was professing to give the substance of information confidentially imparted to him by the appellant as the appellant\u2019s medical adviser, but without any actual recollection of what the appellant had told him, and with a knowledge of the fact that, for the purposes of diagnosis, the appellant had recently informed the physician who was treating him that he had never suffered from the complaint imputed to him in the entry on the respondent\u2019s card.\nAs to the occasion, the respondent, acting in his capacity as Assistant Chief Medical Officer of the Canadian National Railways, was engaged in investigating, at the request of the Claims Department, the appellant\u2019s claim for compensation, and in collecting the evidence to be presented to the Board upon the subject of that claim, for the purpose of assisting the Board in determining the questions raised, in their medical aspects. The respondent, in applying to Dr. Hewitt, wished to obtain, to assist him in his investigations, the medical history of the appellant as disclosed in the records of the Department, of which Dr. Hewitt was an official\u2014the chief official in Toronto. Iritis, it seems, is commonly the result of a systemic affection, and as, according to the respondent, his entries suggested the existence of rheumatism, although there is there no express entry to that effect, he was particularly anxious to ascertain, he says, whether the military records threw any light upon that subject; and primarily, the application to Dr. Hewitt was made with that object in view. He first made a personal visit to Dr. Hewitt, taking with him his cards, and gave to Dr. Hewitt the history of his interviews with, and treatment of, the appellant as disclosed by his notes; and received from Dr. Hewitt, orally, a statement of the contents of his record, including the entry \u201cv.d.g.\u201d, indicating \u201cg.c. infection.\u201d On his examination for discovery, he affirmed quite unreservedly that he had read the document, and that the interview had lasted about half an hour. At the trial, he agreed with the suggestion of cross-examining counsel that any competent physician, reading the history as given by the document, intelligently, must have realized that the entry of the letters \u201cv.d.g.\u201d was a mistake, and that the letters should have been \u201cv.d.h.\u201d; but he there stated that he did \u201cnot think\u201d he had inspected the document, and that his attention had been attracted almost exclusively by the entry \u201cv.d.g.\u201d, read to him by Dr. Hewitt. On the 30th of October, he wrote the letter containing the statements complained of. Before the letter of the 30th of October was written, Dr. Hewitt had already, on the 27th of October, communicated with Ottawa, and by letter dated the 3rd of November, he received authority to give the information desired, and this was done by letter dated the 6th of November.\nThe other occasion with which we are concerned is the occasion of the respondent\u2019s letter of the 17th of November to Dr. McCallum, who was an eye specialist; and the ostensible purpose of the letter to Dr. McCallum was to put him in possession of the relevant facts, so far as they were known to Dr. Mitchell, in order to enable Dr. Mc- Callum to conduct an examination of the appellant, and report upon the probable cause, in his opinion, of the appellant\u2019s malady.\nThe first question for consideration is whether the statements made in the letters of the 30th of October and the 17th of November, disclosing confidential communications alleged by the respondent to have been made by the appellant to him as his medical attendant, and imputing to the appellant the disorder mentioned, were made in such circumstances as, prima facie, to bring them under the protection of privilege.\nThe circumstances of the alleged libel are very exceptional, and cases similar, in the nature and origin of the defamatory matter, must have been rare; and it is therefore desirable to be quite sure that we are on the solid ground of fundamental principles. Fortunately, we have for our guidance a statement of the law proceeding from the very highest authority, and I at once quote from the judgment of the Judicial Committee, delivered by Lord Macnaghten in Macintosh v. Dun[4]. The members of the Board for whom Lord Macnaghten spoke were, Lord Loreburn, Lord Ashburne, Lord Robertson, Lord Atkinson and Lord Collins. The passage is as follows:\u2014\nThe law with regard to the publication of information injurious to the character of another is well settled. The difficulty lies in applying the law to the circumstances of the particular case under consideration. In Toogood v. Spyring[5], Parke B., delivering the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, says: \u201cThe law considers such publication as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs in matters where his interest is concerned. In such cases the occasion prevents the inference of malice, which the law draws from unauthorized communications, and affords a qualified defence depending on the absence of actual malice. If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society, and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits.\u201d\nThat passage, which, as Lindley L.J. observes, is frequently cited, and \u201calways with approval,\u201d not only defines the occasion that protects a communication otherwise actionable, but enunciates the principle on which the protection is founded. The underlying principle is \u201cthe common convenience and welfare of society\u201d\u2014not the convenience of individuals or the convenience of a class, but, to use the words of Erle C.J., in Whiteley v. Adams[6], \u201cthe general interest of society.\u201d\nCommunications injurious to the character of another may be made in answer to inquiry or may be volunteered. If the communication be made in the legitimate defence of a person\u2019s own interest, or plainly under a sense of duty such as would be \u201crecognized by English people of ordinary intelligence and moral principle,\u201d to borrow again the language of Lindley L.J., it cannot matter whether it is volunteered or brought out in answer to an inquiry. But in cases which are near the line, and in cases which may give rise to a difference of opinion, the circumstance that the information is volunteered is an element for consideration certainly not without some importance.\nThe defamatory statement, therefore, is only protected when it is fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency, and when it is fairly made in discharge of some public or private duty, or in the conduct of the defendant\u2019s own affairs in matters in which his interests are concerned. The privilege rests not upon the interests of the persons entitled to invoke it, but upon the general interests of society, and protects only communications \u201cfairly made\u201d (the italics are those of Parke B. himself) in the legitimate defence of a person\u2019s own interests, or plainly made under a sense of duty, such as would be recognized by \u201cpeople of ordinary intelligence and moral principles.\u201d\nReferring to the enunciation of the principle by Parke B., in the passage quoted above, in London Assn. for Protection of Trade v. Greenlands Ltd.[7], Lord Buckmaster said:\u2014\nI do not think that any of the subsequent explanations, or definitions, have made any variation in the principle thus enunciated, nor added anything by way of explanation to this clear exposition of the law. The long list of subsequent authorities to which your Lordships were referred do nothing but afford illustrations of the different circumstances to which this principle may be applied * * * Indeed, the circumstances that constitute a privileged occasion can themselves never be catalogued and rendered exact * * * It is, I think, essential to consider every circumstance associated with the origin and publication of the defamatory matter in order to ascertain whether the necessary conditions are satisfied by which alone protection can be obtained.\nAgain, in James v. Baird[8], Lord Loreburn said:\u2014\nIn considering the question whether the occasion was an occasion of privilege, the Court will regard the alleged libel and will examine by whom it was published, to whom it was published, when, why, and in what circumstances it was published, and will see whether these things establish a relation between the parties which gives rise to a social or moral right or duty, and the consideration of these things may involve the consideration of questions of public policy, as had to be done in a comparatively recent case in the Privy Council\u2014(See Macintosh v. Dun[9], considered in Barr v. Musselburgh Merchants Association[10]). It is not sufficient\u2014it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say\u2014that the defendant may, quite honestly and not without some ground, have believed that the interest or the duty existed. There must, in fact, be such an interest or such a duty as, when all the circumstances are considered, warranted the communication. Stuart v. Bell[11]. Was there any duty, then, resting upon the respondent, was there any interest which he was bound or entitled to protect, which, upon these principles, could justify the disclosure of the facts stated, which he believed, but which he believed had come to his knowledge under the seal of professional confidence?\nIt is pointed out in the judgment of the Appellate Division that the Canadian National Railways had, strictly, no substantial pecuniary interest in any question raised by the appellant\u2019s claim for compensation. In order to obviate some of the difficulties encountered by returned soldiers in securing employment, the Dominion Government had agreed to assume the payment of awards for compensation made in their favour under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts. A fund had been set apart for this purpose, and the administration of this was committed to the Department of Soldiers\u2019 Civil Re-establishment. The Canadian National Railways was technically interested in the appellant\u2019s claim, as a claim, if valid, payable by the company in point of law, but in fact its chief concern was that, having assumed the investigation of such claims, it was under a duty (whether legal or moral is of no importance) to take the usual steps to assist the Board in ascertaining the facts. The parties, in point of substantial interest, were the appellant and the Crown. Primarily, and at the outset of the proceedings, the appellant\u2019s interest was exclusively a pecuniary one, although, as we have seen, his interest assumed a much graver character in the later stages. The Crown also, as the ultimate payer in the event of the claim being established, had a pecuniary interest, and an interest not, perhaps, easily distinguishable from that of any high-minded employer concerned to do his full duty by his employees. No official could be under a duty to secure the defeat of such a claim by unfair or improper methods. As to Dr. Hewitt, and the officials of the Department of Soldiers\u2019 Civil Re-establishment, and the officers of the Department of National Defence, they had no special concern with the investigation of these claims: their duty, as regards the medical records in their hands, would be to observe the practice of the department, which, we may assume, included measures to prevent any improper use of such records; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to suppose, although there is no evidence on the point, that the practice could authorize giving out such information without the knowledge of the soldier to whom it related, to be used by the person receiving that information, equally without his knowledge, to his intended prejudice; or, in any case, in the absence of the strictest care to prevent the publication, to his detriment, of misleading statements.\nAs to Dr. Mitchell, no doubt, when engaged in investigating a claim for compensation made by a returned soldier, he would be quite within the limits of his duty in consulting, subject to the conditions prescribed by the practice, the military records of such a soldier, and making such fair and proper use of information obtained therefrom as the practice might permit; but it would be a mistake to suppose,\u2014in considering the assertions made by him to the D.S.C.R., in connection with an application for permission to inspect such a record (whether merely casual or with the deliberate object of inducing the Department to permit inspection)\u2014it would be a mistake to suppose (as we have seen) that we can properly disregard the fact that the matter of them was derived through confidential communications received from the appellant.\nThe Judicial Committee, in Macintosh v. Dun[12], in summarizing their reasons for holding that the communications, in question there, were not within the protection of the law, said:\nInformation such as that which they offer for sale may be obtained in many ways, not all of them deserving of commendation * * * It may be picked up from discharged servants. It may be betrayed by disloyal employees;\nand in Greenland\u2019 Case[13], the Law Lords agreed that every circumstance connected with the origin and publication of the defamatory matter must be considered, in determining whether or not the necessary conditions of protection exist.\nWe are not required, for the purposes of this appeal, to attempt to state with any sort of precision the limits of the obligation of secrecy which rests upon the medical practitioner in relation to professional secrets acquired by him in the course of his practice. Nobody would dispute that a secret so acquired is the secret of the patient, and, normally, is under his control, and not under that of the doctor. Prima facie, the patient has the right to require that the secret shall not be divulged; and that right is absolute, unless there is some paramount reason which overrides it. Such reasons may arise, no doubt, from the existence of facts which bring into play overpowering considerations connected with public justice; and there may be cases in which reasons connected with the safety of individuals or of the public, physical or moral, would be sufficiently cogent to supersede or qualify the obligations prima facie imposed by the confidential relation.\nIn Comyn\u2019s Digest, Action on the Case for Deceit, (A. 5) \u201cFor Deceit in his Trust\u201d, the action is said to lie\nif a man, being entrusted in his profession, deceive him who entrusted him; as, if a man retained of counsel, become afterward of counsel with the other party in the same cause, or, discover the evidence, or secrets of the cause.\nCommunications made in confidence to, or knowledge acquired in confidence by members of the medical profession, are not at common law privileged from disclosure in courts of justice, as are communications to legal advisers; but Lord Brougham many years ago declared himself unable to appreciate the grounds of this distinction; and other eminent judges have expressed their regret that such a distinction should be recognized. Lord Mansfield, in a famous case, used strong language concerning the voluntary disclosure of confidences by medical practition- ers. The right of the client to insist upon the nondisclosure of information acquired by his solicitor when acting for him is not limited in its application to those matters which are privileged from disclosure in courts of justice. The right is founded upon the necessities of the business of life, which require that people shall be able fearlessly to entrust their affairs to legal advisers, and applies to all confidential communications received professionally. Consequently, a solicitor is not permitted to make use, for his own benefit, or for the benefit of another client, of admissions or communications made to him by a person for whom he is acting as solicitor (Moore v. Terrell[14]; Taylor v. Blacklow[15]; Cleave v. Jones[16]; and a solicitor will be restrained from acting for a new client in matters so closely connected with the business of a client for whom he is already acting as to justify an apprehension that some prejudicial disclosure may take place.\nA similar duty is broadly incidental, not only to the relationship of principal and agent, or that of master and servant, but, speaking generally, to all cases in which confidence is given and accepted, subject, of course, to the implied qualification springing from the maxim de minimis. In Scotland, the clerk of a firm of accountants engaged in winding up the affairs of a firm of writers, who disclosed to the Board of Inland Revenue information derived from books and documents to which he had access for that purpose, and which seemed to indicate that the returns to the Board had not correctly stated the profit and loss account of the defunct firm, was held liable to pay damages for this breach of confidence, although no special damages were proved. Lord McLaren, in delivering judgment, in which the Lord President (Lord Robertson), Lord Adam and Lord Kinnear, concurred, observed,\nThe act was defended as being done in discharge of a public duty, but I have never heard nor read that the duty of assisting the Treasury in the collection of the public revenue was of such a paramount nature that it must be carried out by private individuals at the cost of the betrayal of confidence and the invasion of the proprietary rights of other people.\nThere is apparently no reported judgment of any English court in which the principle stated in the passage quoted above, from Comyn, has been applied to a medical practitioner. In Scotland, the liability is sanctioned by decision as well as by principle. A.B. v. C.D.[17]\nThe general duty of medical men to observe secrecy, in relation to information acquired by them confidentially from their patients is subject, no doubt, to some exceptions, which have no operation in the case of solicitors; but the grounds of the legal, social or moral imperatives affecting physicians and surgeons, touching the inviolability of professional confidences, are not, any more than those affecting legal advisers, based exclusively upon the relations between the parties as individuals.\nIt is, perhaps, not easy to exaggerate the value attached by the community as a whole to the existence of a competently trained and honourable medical profession; and it is just as important that patients, in consulting a physician, shall feel that they may impart the facts touching their bodily health, without fear that their confidence may be abused to their disadvantage. Was there, as to the communication to Dr. Hewitt, any reason for the disclosure of such weight (when these considerations are kept in view) as to attract to the respondent\u2019s statement the protection which the law, for the welfare of society as a whole, affords to privileged communications? The direct interest of the Crown was a pecuniary interest\u2014an interest in the proper application of the fund. The duty of the respondent had relation only to the protection of that interest. It was not, as already observed, a duty of stricter obligation than that of any employee or agent called upon to investigate such a claim, and instructed by his employer to take all proper measures to assist the Board in arriving at the facts. Having regard to the character of the disclosures, I confess my inability to treat very seriously the notion that the existence of such a duty or such an interest could afford a ground for holding that the welfare of society requires the protection of them. The Appellate Division seems to have treated the communication as a confidential communication between doctors. I do not perceive the force of the fact that the official to whom the communication was made was a doctor. The occasion was not a consultation between physicians; still less a consultation in the interests of the appellant. The communication was made to an official for the purpose of securing official information, to be used adversely to a claim which the appellant was asserting. No special precautions were taken to secure secrecy. The respondent\u2019s letter would pass through the usual clerical and official channels. Moreover, the official was the local head of the Department to which, as a pensioner, the appellant periodically reported. A communication made by a medical adviser, with regard to the state of his patient\u2019s health, for the purposes of consultation, for the benefit and with the authority, express or inferential, of his patient, is a thing bearing no resemblance to that with which we are concerned in this case.\nFrom beginning to end, the respondent was actuated by the intention of placing the medical secrets which he had acquired from the appellant before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, and before others, for the purpose of securing reports or evidence (for the information of the Board) that were expected and intended to have some effect in influencing the Board to take a view adverse to the appellant\u2019s claim.\nNo doubt there may be cases in which the fact that the communication is made to a physician is not without significance; but to regard it as a necessarily decisive factor is not an admissible view. As Lord Loreburn said, in Greenlands\u2019 Case[18]:\nThe Court has to hold the balance, and, looking at who published the libel, and why, and to whom, and in what circumstances, to say whether it is for the welfare of society that such a communication, honestly made, should be protected by clothing the occasion of the publication with privilege;\nand in a passage in which it appears to me the law is accurately stated, in Pollock, Torts, 12th Ed., p. 270, it is said:\nThe nature of the interest for the sake of which the communication is made (as whether it be public or private, whether it is one touching the preservation of life, honour or morals, or only matters of ordinary business), the apparent importance and urgency of the occasion, * * * will all have their weight. Considering the present case from all these points of view, I am unable to agree that the duty of a chief medical officer of an industrial concern, for example charged with investigating a claim made by an employee for compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and in preparing the evidence, is so \u201csituated\u201d that \u201cit,\u201d to use the language of Blackburn, J. in Davies v. Snead[19], \u201cbecomes right in the interests of society that he should tell\u201d, for the purpose of securing information in preparing his case, the facts he has confidentially ascertained from the claimant as his personal medical adviser; or that he is under a duty recognized by people of \u201cordinary intelligence and moral principle,\u201d to divulge such facts without the assent of the patient.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division refers to a remark of the trial judge, that the interest with which the respondent was concerned was a pecuniary interest.\nThe question, in the last resort, with which everyone was concerned, was this, was the appellant to be awarded a certain sum of money, to be paid by the Crown? Neither the Canadian National Railway Company nor the respondent, as already observed, had any immediate pecuniary interest in this question. But to repeat what has been said above, I do not agree that, because of that, the duty under which he rested, was of a quality more potent for justifying his disclosures than the interest or the duty coming into play in the case of a practitioner acting for a private employer in investigating a claim for compensation by any employee.\nThe duty devolving upon the company, and upon the respondent as a servant of the company, was to take measures to see that the Board was properly informed; as the Appellate Division observes, to ascertain the facts and report them. But did this duty involve this professional man in any obligation to betray the professional confidences of his personal patient? If he chose to do so, was there any occasion or exigency which fairly warranted it? Does the welfare of society require that his communications should receive the protection which the law affords to privileged communications? Or is it not right that, having done so, to quote again from Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment, he \u201cshould take the consequences,\u201d if he did \u201coverstep the law?\u201d That question is, I think, best answered by citing another passage from the judgment of the Judicial Committee, in Macintosh v. Dun[20]:\nIt may not be out of place to recall the striking language of Knight Bruce, V.C., in reference to a somewhat similar subject * * * \u201dThe discovery and vindication and establishment of truth,\u201d His Honour says, \u201care main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, * * * cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them * * * Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely\u2014may be pursued too keenly\u2014may cost too much.\u201d And then he points out that the meanness and the mischief of prying into things which are regarded as confidential, with all the attending consequences, are \u201ctoo great a price to pay for truth itself.\u201d\n\u201cFollowing up this train of thought,\u201d as their Lordships did in Macintosh v. Dun[21]\u2014however convenient or even advantageous it may be to employers to have access to the secrets entrusted by their employees to their own medical advisers, such information \u201cmay be bought too dearly\u2014at least for the good of society in general.\u201d\nThe Appellate Division have agreed with the trial judge that the statement in the letter to Dr. Hewitt was not necessary. The substance of the statement being such as it was, that alone seems to be a conclusive bar to the claim of privilege. Even in a case in which circumstances might, in the last resort, require a doctor to give up his patient\u2019s secret, or justify him in doing so, justification could not extend to a wanton disclosure. A statement, such as that we are discussing, made unnecessarily, is, in my opinion, a wanton disclosure. Plainly, it is not a disclosure, to quote the language of Parke B., \u201cfairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency.\u201d Plainly, also, persons of ordinary intelligence and moral principle, situated as the respondent was, would not feel themselves under a duty unnecessarily to make such a disclosure.\nAnd here an observation becomes necessary which, in principle, applies to the communication to Dr. McCallum as well as to the letter to Dr. Hewitt. In Greenlands\u2019 Case[22], Lord Loreburn said (at pp. 28 and 29): We should look at who and what are the persons to whom and by whom the libellous communication is made, and to the manner in which they conducted themselves, before admitting the privilege claimed * * *\nBut we must remember that private reputation and credit are at stake, and I cannot think that privilege should be allowed unless there is not merely good faith but also real care to make inquiry only in reliable quarters, and to verify it where practicable. The absence of such care may, no doubt, be evidence of malice, but it is also relevant on the point whether there is privilege or not, and may, in my judgment, be fatal to the privilege even if malice is disproved.\nFirst, as to the letter to Dr. Hewitt. The sentences which are important are as follows:\u2014\nHalls tells me that he was discharged from the army on account of valvular disease of the heart, resulting from rheumatism earlier in life. He also stated that he had had g.c. infection about 1918. I would be glad if you would advise me as to the heart condition which necessitated his discharge, also whether his records show a history of rheumatism and g.c. infection.\nAs to the first sentence, the appellant denies that he ever told the defendant he had suffered from rheumatism. The respondent does not dispute this; his evidence is to the effect that he had inferred rheumatism from the entries on his card, as to the disease of the heart, and as to the initial treatment. The learned trial judge might have regarded this sentence not only as inaccurate but even as misleading. As to the second sentence, the respondent admits, that he had no recollection of any statement to that effect by the appellant. He was here also drawing an inference from his notes. He had been told that the appellant had informed his own physician in answer to questions put for purposes of diagnosis that he had never suffered from the infection mentioned. The respondent, if he had given the matter the slightest thought, must have realized that his letter was calculated to give the impression that there was no dispute about the facts he was stating, if indeed the letter was not also calculated to create the impression that his application was being made with the assent of the appellant; that, in truth, he was speaking for the appellant, although he knew he was, in effect, stating what the appellant had recently denied to his own physician.\nFrom this point of view, Dr. Hewitt\u2019s reply is rather important. Dr. Hewitt evidently was under the impression that the information he was giving from the army records added nothing material to what the respondent already knew from the lips of the appellant himself. The judgment of the Appellate Division, as I have said, treats this letter as innocuous. There is only too much reason to think that, next to the respondent\u2019s fatal mistake in proceeding with the investigation after discovering the former relation between himself and the appellant, this communication and the form in which it was couched had much to do with the mistakes that followed. I repeat that Dr. Hewitt\u2019s reply indicates, if it does not conclusively establish, that he believed he was giving to the respondent from the records, information which he had already received from his patient, and as to the correctness of which there was no sort of dispute between the respondent and the patient; a view which the respondent\u2019s letter was naturally calculated to produce, as we have seen. This seems to me the most natural explanation of the failure on the part of Dr. Hewitt to observe that the letters v.d.g. had been entered in his pr\u00e9cis by mistake; a mistake which the respondent admits must at least have been suspected by any competent person reading the pr\u00e9cis with care. It is not easy to understand why Dr. Hewitt was not sufficiently struck by the incongruity between the letters v.d.g. and their context, and the practice, to have realized at least the desirability of some inquiry as to the accuracy of his pr\u00e9cis. His mistake most naturally is to be ascribed, I think, to the fact that he had before him this letter from the respondent, a physician, professing to give his patient\u2019s own account of his medical history, with which the entry (the letters v.d.g.) was wholly in accord. The learned trial judge might very well have taken the view, and this may go far to account for the severity of some of his strictures, that if the respondent had informed Dr. Hewitt that the application was not made with the assent of the appellant; that the appellant denied having had the infection indicated; that he himself had no recollection of any admission by the appellant; that he was proceeding solely upon the entries in his cards; that the attention of the appellant had not been called to these entries; that he purposed using Dr. Hewitt\u2019s reply in opposition to the appellant\u2019s claim, without notifying the appellant, and without giving him an opportunity of meeting it\u2014if all these facts had been fairly placed before Dr. Hewitt, the learned trial judge might have found it difficult (if not impossible) to think that Dr. Hewitt\u2019s reply would have been sent without further inquiry.\nThe letter to Dr. McCallum (17th Nov.) consisted largely of a repetition of communications said to have been received by the respondent from the appellant. Assuming that a duty did rest upon the respondent in the last resort to disclose the facts touching the appellant\u2019s confidential statements to him in 1920, and touching his treatment of the appellant, he was under no obligation in doing so to conceal from the appellant the fact of his disclosures; and he was under a duty at least to take every practicable precaution to avoid inaccuracy.\nHe wrote in part as follows:\nMr. Halls had been a patient of my own in 1920, when he consulted me for a painful condition of the right side of the sacrum about its middle, which had been bothering him for some five weeks prior to that. He gave a history of having been discharged from the Army on account of valvular disease of the heart, and when I saw him in 1920, he had a mitral systolic lesion. I at first, gave anti-rheumatism treatment, but this did not affect the painful sacral condition, and in view of this, and the fact that Halls admitted having had a g.c. infection two years before I saw him and still had shreds in the urine, I administered anti-gonococcus vaccine. After a short course of treatment, my records show that he felt some improvement. He now tells me that very shortly after the last injection the painful condition in the sacrum cleared up.\nThis last sentence distinctly conveys the impression that Halls had, in a very recent discussion of his g.c. infection with the respondent and of the doctor\u2019s treatment of it, admitted that he had benefited by that treatment. There had, in fact, been no such discussion. Neither the subject of g.c. infection nor that of the treatment had been mentioned between them. The statement seems to have been founded upon some inference drawn by Dr. Mitchell from an explanation given to him by Halls of the discontinuance of his visits to the doctor in 1920. The appellant denied that the treatment had been of any value, and the learned trial judge seems to have accepted his evidence. The letter contains more than one assertion conveying the idea that facts are either admitted or indisputable, which would have been disproved or vigorously disputed by the appellant.\nIt is difficult to understand why he did not take the course of frankly informing the appellant of what he was doing; in the interests of accuracy, since the facts placed before Dr. McCallum so largely rested upon \u201cadmissions\u201d ascribed to the appellant, that would appear to have been an obvious precaution.\nIn justice to the respondent, it should be said that he was no doubt convinced by his notes, and the entry in Dr. Hewitt\u2019s pr\u00e9cis, that the appellant\u2019s claim was groundless, and his conviction as to this, no doubt, explains the tone of his letter to Dr. McCallum. It cannot, however, justify his conduct in disclosing the contents of his notes without giving the appellant an opportunity of explaining, or presenting his side of the matter, or taking any measures to protect his reputation. I cannot think that public policy requires that such communications, made in such circumstances should receive the protection accorded to privileged communications.\nIt was rather suggested that the letter to Dr. McCallum should be protected as within the principle of Watson v. McEwan[23]. The basis of the judgment in Watson v. McEwan23 is that statements made by a witness as such, in court, are absolutely privileged, and that this privilege would become illusory, were it not applicable for the protection of a statement by an intending witness, as to the nature of the evidence the witness can give, made to professional persons preparing the evidence to be presented in court. As the protection by privilege of the testimony of witnesses in court is regarded by the law as essential to the administration of justice, and as the extension of that protection to such preliminary statements is regarded as essential to the effectiveness of the substantive privilege, such preliminary statements are held to fall within the rule; but, as Lord Halsbury points out, this strict necessity is the basis of the privilege. In Watson v. McEwan23 there was no question, as Lord Halsbury observes, of communications to persons other than those engaged professionally in preparing the evidence to be presented in court, and obviously the principle does not extend to such collateral statements. It protects the respondent, whatever his motives may have been, in respect of statements made before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and in respect of statements made to the Claims Agent, voluntary though they were, as to the evidence which he was prepared to give; but this privilege has no relation to the statements made to Dr. Campbell, to Dr. Hewitt, or to Dr. McCallum.\nThere was also a suggestion that the respondent may plead in excuse the fact that he was acting under the instructions of the Claims Department of the Canadian National Railway Company. In disclosing to the officials of that Department the nature of the evidence he could give, the respondent was within the principle of Watson v. McEwan23, and is protected accordingly. But as regards other defamatory communications, the railway company in requiring, or knowingly taking advantage of, breaches of confidence on his part, would share his responsibility. In respect of communications in breach of confidence, the courts afford protection as against the person in whom confidence was originally reposed; and the law is not so futile as to withhold such protection as against third persons, who, in acquiring knowledge of confidential matters, have also become acquainted with their character and origin. As the judgment in Macintosh v. Dun[24] shews, the fact that defamatory matter has originated in breach of confidence, to the knowledge of the defamer, or indeed, the fact that it was produced under a system which contemplated the violation of confidence as a source of information, may constitute a conclusive reason for rejecting the claim of privilege.\nIt is, perhaps, desirable to mention a passage in a textbook by a well known author: Bower, on Actionable Defamation (2nd Ed.), p. 111, which seems, superficially at least, not to be entirely in consonance with the view here expressed. The passage is as follows:\nWhere the party defaming is entitled to such defeasible immunity as aforesaid, he is not deprived of the benefit thereof, as a defence to any action of defamation, by reason only of the circumstance that the communication was, as between himself and the party defamed, a breach of duty or a wrongful act not being in the nature of defamation.\nIf this passage is to be read as enunciating the proposition that in determining the existence or non-existence of privilege, it is, in point of law, immaterial that the defamatory matter originated or was published in breach of confidence, then the passage is plainly inconsistent with the decisions in Macintosh v. Dun24, and Greenlands\u2019 Case[25]. The authorities cited in support of the passage are, indeed, of doubtful purport. In Robshaw v. Smith[26], it does not appear that the court was really concerned with anything amounting to a breach of confidence on the part of the defendant. No such point was discussed or considered, and generally, as regards that case, the observations of Hamilton L.J. in the Greenlands\u2019 Case[27] must not be overlooked. That eminent judge suggests that the case is incompletely reported; and he declines to accept the expressions of opinion imputed to Lindley and Grove JJ. as authoritative. In Thurston v. Charles[28], no question of breach of confidence arose.\nTo summarize my reasons for thinking that the conditions have not in this case been satisfied in which the law protects privileged communications that otherwise would be actionable as defamatory. \u201cThe underlying principle\u201d upon which that protection is founded is \u201cthe common convenience and welfare of society\u201d\u2014not the interests of individuals or of a class, but \u201cthe general interest of society.\u201d The court must consider whether the communication was made plainly under a duty\u2014and a sense of that duty\u2014which in all the circumstances would be \u201crecognized by people of ordinary intelligence and moral principle\u201d; and in considering that, the court will take into account the origin of the matter of the communication and \u201cevery circumstance connected with the publication\u201d of it; and must \u201chold the balance and looking at who published the libel, and why, and to whom, and in what circumstances\u201d must say \u201cwhether it is for the welfare of society that such a communication honestly made should be protected by clothing the occasion of the publication with privilege.\u201d There was no duty resting upon the respondent, and no interest committed to his charge, of sufficient weight and importance to require that the libels in question, involving the disclosure of profes- sional confidences, should be protected in the \u201cgeneral interests of society.\u201d Moreover, assuming such a duty or interest existed as might warrant such disclosures if necessary in the last resort, the protection ought not, (considering the gravity of the matter of the libels), to be extended beyond the strict necessities of the occasion, or to disclosures made secretly without communicating with the appellant giving him an opportunity of explanation, and endeavouring to attain the object sought by other means, entailing no injury to the appellant\u2019s reputation. In all the circumstances, such disclosures made in the absence of such precautions, can not be said to be \u201cfairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency.\u201d\nIn this view it is unnecessary to consider the finding of the trial judge, that assuming the occasion of the publications in question to have been privileged, the respondent was actuated by some ulterior motive, and that in each case the occasion was abused. No opinion is expressed upon that finding beyond this: there is no adequate ground for disagreeing with the finding of the trial judge that the appellant\u2019s account of the interviews between himself and the respondent in 1920 should be accepted; and that the entry in the respondent\u2019s notes on the subject of the g.c. infection was the result of an error.\nThe appeal therefore succeeds as to the libels. The appellant is entitled to judgment for $500 and Wright J.\u2019s judgment should be varied accordingly. He is also entitled to his costs of both appeals.\nSMITH J. (dissenting in part).\u2014The grounds of appeal that require serious consideration are those in reference to the libels alleged to be contained in the letter of respondent to Dr. Hewitt of 30th October, 1924, Ex. I, and in his letter to Dr. McCallum of 17th November, 1924, Ex. 20. In the judgment appealed from it was held that there was qualified privilege in connection with these communications.\nThe contention here is that there rests on a medical practitioner at least a strong moral obligation to keep secret information received by him from patients for the purpose of enabling him to properly and intelligently minister to their ailments. It is, however, I think, conceded that there may be circumstances which may make it proper to disclose, even voluntarily, such information; and the question here is as to whether the circumstances in this case were such as to warrant the respondent in making such disclosure.\nIt is to be noted in the first place that a medical practitioner, unlike a solicitor, can be compelled to disclose, as a witness, relevant confidential information received in connection with professional services rendered, so that the statements complained of, when made in the witness box, were absolutely privileged, and the evidence could not have been excluded at the instance of appellant on the ground that the communication was confidential. It does not seem to me that the legal result would be different if a medical practitioner were to offer voluntarily to become a witness, though it might amount to a serious breach of professional etiquette.\nThe respondent was the Assistant Chief Medical Officer of the Canadian National Railway Company. In addition, he practised his profession of physician; and the appellant, while in the employ of the railway, consulted him, in May, 1920, and received treatment from him. Four years afterwards\u2014on May 3rd, 1924\u2014the appellant, while still in the employment of the Railway Company, was struck on the right eye by a swinging door that had been pushed open by a fellow employee; and on 10th June following, consulted Dr. Angus Campbell, who found him then suffering from acute iritis of that eye. In the following September he filed a claim with the Ontario Compensation Board against the Railway Company, alleging that the iritis arose from the stroke received from the swinging door. While any award against the Railway Company would be paid by the Dominion Government, it was none the less the duty of the Railway Company to see that no unfounded claim was allowed, and to make all proper investigations and present all proper evidence to the Board tending to show the claim to be unfounded. It was part of the regular duty of the respondent towards the Railway Company to investigate the medical aspect of the appellant\u2019s claim. This was a duty that he was under contract to faithfully and honestly perform for the Company. In the ordinary course, the respondent was called upon to investigate the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Dr. Campbell had certified that the iritis was the result of the blow from the swinging door. The respondent, as a medical man, was unable to connect the one with the other, particularly in view of the time that elapsed between the blow and the development of iritis; and it seems that such a lapse of time is quite unusual, and would ordinarily suggest the probability of some other cause. The respondent remembered having treated the appellant previously, and consulted his history card of that treatment, which he had on file, and which recorded that the appellant had had g.c. infection two years previous to the time of making out this card on May 1st, 1920, with some shreds still. The card continues, showing three treatments for this g.c. infection of two years previous. The respondent was of opinion that lingering constitutional effects of this former disorder of 1918 was a possible cause of the iritis. The appellant had been in the army, and the respondent pursued his enquiries by interviewing Dr. Hewitt, Medical Director for the Department of Soldiers\u2019 Civil Re-establishment at Toronto, as to appellant\u2019s medical history in the army, and was informed by Dr. Hewitt that the records showed that the appellant had suffered from rheumatism, and that there was one item of v.d.g. The respondent asked for this information in writing, but was informed that it would be necessary to make a written application for it. The respondent made this written application, which is Ex. I, complained of, and received the reply of November 6th, 1924\u2014Ex. 5\u2014which states that the appellant\u2019s medical history shows a single record of him having v.d.g.\nWith the information thus gathered from his own card of his treatment of appellant in 1920 for this disease of 1918, and from the army medical history, which went to confirm the statement in the card, the respondent was confirmed in his view that the iritis could not be connected with the blow from the door, and advised his Company to take the opinion of Dr. McCallum, an expert, and received directions to obtain Dr. McCallum\u2019s opinion. In the letter to Dr. McCallum of 17th November, 1924, Ex. 20, complained of, he submitted the facts as he had gathered them, on which the expert opinion was to be based.\nI think it is clear that the company had a right, in resisting what it believed to be an unfounded claim, to take expert advice as to whether or not the iritis could be regarded as flowing from the blow, and for the purposes of such advice to submit all material facts that it expected to establish by the evidence. The fact of v.d.g. infection was one that the company had strongest grounds for supposing would be established beyond question, in view of the respondent\u2019s card and the army record. It is not denied that this infection, if a fact, was most material. It would have been a manifest absurdity to ask Dr. McCallum for expert advice and to have suppressed a fact upon which his whole opinion might hinge. The respondent was the only party who had knowledge of this piece of material evidence. He was the proper medium for the company to use in laying the facts before Dr. McCallum. It is argued that, because of the confidential relationship between the appellant and respondent in connection with the treatments of 1920, the respondent should have suppressed this most important bit of evidence, which he had every reason at the time to suppose would establish that there was no valid claim against his company. It is suggested that, because of the moral obligation not to disclose what he had received in confidence from the consultations in 1920, he should have refused to have anything to do with investigating the claim, and should have suppressed the knowledge he had of facts he believed would show the claim to be unfounded. It was part of his duty to his company that he had contracted to perform and that he was being paid for, to investigate such claims where medical opinion was a factor, and, in my opinion, he could not honestly stand by under the circumstances and allow a claim to be established against his company by suppressing evidence that would go to show that the claim was unfounded. The higher duty, I think, was to have the evidence that he alone knew of placed fairly before the tribunal trying the rights between his company and the appellant.\nIt was finally established that the information furnished by Dr. Hewitt to the respondent as to the appellant\u2019s army medical history was in fact erroneous, and that the history did not contain any record of appellant having been afflicted with v.d.g. A most unfortunate mistake had been made in the copy of the record from which Dr. Hewitt gave his information in writing, the letters v.d.g. having been used, instead of the letters v.d.h., which have an entirely different signification. The correction of this mistake greatly weakened the evidence of the fact of the appellant having had g.c. infection, but the respondent had no knowledge of such mistake at the time he was submitting facts for the opinion of Dr. McCallum. In the final determination of the claim, the fact of the alleged infection rested solely on the correctness of the respondent\u2019s card record, made, as the respondent says, from the appellant\u2019s own statement to him. The appellant denies having made such statement and having had such infection, and gives as his explanation a misunderstanding between himself and respondent of questions and answers, and says he did not know he was receiving treatment for g.c. infection. The learned trial judge has accepted this testimony, finding as a fact that the respondent was not told by the appellant that he had had g.c. infection. This finding is not questioned in the Appellate Division nor here, and the appellant has the full benefit of it, regardless of the result of the litigation on the question of damages.\nThe letter of the respondent to Dr. Hewitt of 30th October, 1924, Ex. I, stands on a different footing from that to Dr. McCallum, which I have just discussed, and the difference is clearly recognized in the judgment appealed from. The respondent was simply seeking information from Dr. Hewitt, and in asking for information the protection of privilege is not required at all, as there can be no libel in a mere request for information. There is no necessity for allegations of facts or alleged facts in connection with such requests. At all events, there was no necessity in this instance for the allegation by respondent to Dr. Hewitt in Ex. I, \u201cHe also stated that he had had a g.c. infection about 1918,\u201d and the Appellate Division so holds, but excuses it on the ground that there was qualified privilege in connection with the letter itself. In my view this excuse cannot prevail. A litigant is, of course, within his right in seeking any information that would be of service to him in connection with the action, but this, as I have stated, would not, in my opinion, warrant him in making libellous statements to those from whom he might be seeking the information. If, for instance, a servant were suing for wages or false dismissal, and the defence were dishonesty, the defendant would be within his right in inquiring as to the servant\u2019s conduct in other employment, but could not justify specific allegations of dishonesty on the part of the servant, if they were in fact untrue, on the ground of privilege.\nHere we have a specific allegation of fact in a letter that was simply a request for information and could not be libellous if confined to such request. The allegation was entirely unnecessary, as held by the Appellate Division, and was, in fact, untrue, according to the undisturbed finding of the trial judge. The untrue allegation was undoubtedly libellous in its character, and gives, I think, technically a right of action with nominal damages. It could not have affected Dr. Hewitt\u2019s mind, because he had before him his own record that contained the same allegations, which he had just communicated to the respondent. It may be argued that when this record was corrected, an erroneous opinion of the appellant might still remain in Dr. Hewitt\u2019s mind as a result of the respondent\u2019s allegation, and that the allegation would remain permanently on the file.\nIt may be noted that the appellant would not necessarily have succeeded in establishing his claim before the Board if the respondent\u2019s evidence as to infection had not been offered, because it might still have been held that the connection between the blow and the iritis had not been established.\nI agree with the trial judge that there was no malice on the respondent\u2019s part in the nature of ill-will towards the appellant, and with the Appellate Division that there was no malice in the legal sense of indirect or improper motive.\nI therefore agree with the Appellate Division that the claim for libel in the letter of the 17th November, 1924, to Dr. McCallum should be dismissed, but am of opinion that the appellant is entitled to at least nominal damages for the untrue and unnecessary allegation in the letter to Dr. Hewitt of the 30th of October, 1924.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Harding & Clark.\nSolicitors for the respondent: D.L.

The motion was made on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed from conflicts with the judgment of the First Divisional Court of the said Appellate Division in Rex v. Hall[2] and with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Brooks v. The King[3]. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The motion was dismissed.\nL.P. Sherwood for the motion.\nA.W. Rogers contra. MIGNAULT J.\u2014Francis Hill, who was convicted on an indictment for rape on the person of a Mrs. Hazel Blow, has applied to me for leave to appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Second Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario which confirmed the conviction. Hill was a taxi driver of Fort Frances, Ont., and the crime was committed about one o\u2019clock of the morning of the 16th of September, 1927. The complainant had come to Fort Frances on the 15th to get some provisions, and could only return home the following day. She registered at the Fort Frances Hotel, and employed Hill, whom she had never seen before, to drive her to a dance at Pithers\u2019 Point, a pleasure resort some three miles from Fort Frances. She returned from the dance in Hill\u2019s taxi, a closed sedan car, and her story is that when she reached Fort Frances, Hill insisted on her going for a drive with him. It was on this drive, on a cross road, that the crime was committed, Hill, according to the complainant\u2019s testimony, having forced her to leave the front seat which she occupied with him and to go on to the rear seat where she was assaulted by him.\nThe trial took place at Fort Frances before Mr. Justice Logie, and the only point in dispute\u2014Hill having admitted that he had connection with the complainant on the occasion mentioned by her\u2014was whether the connection was with or without her consent. On this point, the Crown undertook to show that the prosecutrix complained of the assault at the first reasonable opportunity. Hill brought her back to the hotel after the assault. She saw the night clerk there, but said nothing to him of the matter. The next morning she went to see Dr. Hartrey of Fort Frances to get a prescription for a friend. Dr. Hartrey had already treated her, and she says she wanted to speak to him about the assault, but did not have the courage to do so. She took the two o\u2019clock train home, to Bear Pass, where her husband was station agent, and on her arrival told him the whole story. The following day Mrs. Blow returned to Fort Frances, and laid before the Crown Attorney a complaint against Hill. It was said that the complainant did not make any outcry, but, as far as she knew, there was no house in the vicinity, and it was about one o\u2019clock in the morning. On the question of complaint by the prosecutrix, the learned trial judge gave the following instructions to the jury:\nIn this class of case certain statements made after the event are admissible. Statements made after the transaction are generally irrelevant and inadmissible in favour of the person making them, but in cases of rape and similar offences the fact that a complaint was made by the prosecutrix shortly after the alleged occurrence, and the particulars of such complaint may, so far as they relate to the charge be given in evidence by the prosecution not as evidence of acts complained of but as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness box and to negative consent.\nNow, that class of evidence is admissible, of course, where consent is or is not material evidence in the charge, but the complaint must be shown to be made at the first opportunity which reasonably presents itself after the commission of the offence.\nI admitted the statement to her husband because I felt on the evidence it was the first reasonable opportunity she had to make the complaint. She did not make complaint to the hotel clerk. She thought of making it to her doctor, but she said she could not bring herself to do it, and then she went home and within 12 hours, or whatever time it was, told her husband. If I am wrong in admitting that and I do not think I am wrong, the prisoner will get the benefit if he appeals. But I have admitted the statement and have told you the effect of the complaint and you are not to consider it as anything other than what I have told you.\nCounsel for Hill contended that by the final words of the passage just quoted the learned trial judge had in effect instructed the jury that they must consider that the complaint had been made by the complainant on the earliest reasonable opportunity. In my view, the final words, fairly construed with the context, refer to what the learned judge had already told the jury, that \u201cparticulars of such complaint may, so far as they relate to the charge, be given by the prosecution, not as evidence of acts complained of, but as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness box and to negative consent.\u201d There was no objection to the charge, and if the passage quoted could be misconstrued, the prisoner\u2019s counsel did not call the learned judge\u2019s attention to it.\nI have referred to these circumstances somewhat in detail in order to determine whether, as contended by counsel for the prisoner, and that is the only question with which I am concerned, the unanimous judgment of the appellate court herein is in conflict with the decision of another court of appeal in a like case (s. 1025 Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36).\nThe decision to which counsel for the prisoner referred me is Rex v. Hall, of which there is a short report in 31 Ontario Weekly Notes, p. 451, but counsel furnished me with a complete copy of the judgment which I have very carefully considered. This is a decision of the First Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario, rendered on the 17th of February, 1927, whereby a conviction for rape before the same trial judge was set aside and a new trial ordered because the trial judge had misdirected the jury and had failed to place the defence fully and fairly before them.\nMr. Rogers contended that this decision cannot be said to be a decision of \u201canother court of appeal,\u201d as required by s. 1025, inasmuch as both divisions of the Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario are one court of appeal, so that the decision now in question is a judgment of the same court of appeal as that which decided the other case. He relied on the definition of the words \u201ccourt of appeal\u201d in s. 2, subs. 7, of the Criminal Code, and also on the Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 88, ss. 4 and 11.\nI am unable to accept this contention. Section 2, subsection 7, of the Criminal Code states that \u201ccourt of appeal\u201d includes, in the province of Ontario \u201cthe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\u201d This Appellate Division is composed of two Divisional Courts, numbered consecutively and designated the First Divisional Court and the Second Divisional Court (Ontario Judicature Act, ss. 39 and 40). The Chief Justice of Ontario and four Justices of Appeal form the First Divisional Court, and the Second is composed of a Chief Justice and four Justices of Appeal. I cannot doubt that they are distinct appellate courts, and one of them in contradistinction to the other would be not misdescribed by calling it \u201canother court of appeal\u201d within the meaning of s. 1025 of the Criminal Code. A conflict on a question of law between these two courts is not readily conceivable, but if it did arise, it obviously would create such a situation as Parliament must have contemplated when it enacted s. 1025. The ratio legis here strongly applies and there is certainly nothing in the language of the section which prevents its being carried out.\nThis brings me back to Rex v. Hall[4], and the only matter to be considered is whether it conflicts with the unanimous judgment of the Second Appellate Division in the present case. Of course, it must be \u201ca like case,\u201d and I take it that the conflict mentioned by s. 1025 is a conflict on a question of law. I do not think there was any such conflict or difference of opinion between the First Appellate Division in the Hall Case4 and the Second Appellate Division in this case as to the duty of a trial judge in instructing the jury. Everything turned on the circumstances of the particular case and, in my opinion, the facts in the Hall Case4, were materially different from those in the present one. The appellate court there was of opinion that the trial judge had practically told the jury to disregard evidence showing that the complainant \u201cwas not in the state of mind of one who has been outraged and desired to make an outcry about it.\u201d Moreover, in the Hall Case[5], there was evidence of admissions by the complainant that previously she had had connection with the prisoner, and she did not deny in rebuttal the statement of the prisoner that he had had sexual intercourse with her about twenty-five times. The appellate court further found that the trial judge had not placed the defence fully and fairly before the jury. In my opinion, the present case stands on an altogether different footing.\nI may perhaps further add that Rex v. Hall5 could not be considered as an authority in a case where the facts were not the same. In other words, it is not \u201ca like case.\u201d To borrow the well known language of Lord Haldane in Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co. Ltd.[6],\nwhen a previous case has not laid down any new principle but has merely decided that a particular set of facts illustrates an existing rule, there are few more fertile sources of fallacy than to search in it for what is simply resemblance in circumstances, and to erect a previous decision into a governing precedent merely on this account.\nCounsel for the prisoner also sought to show a conflict between this case and the recent judgment of this court in Brooks v. The King. To the latter case, what I have said of Rex v. Hall may well apply, for an established rule of law was applied to a particular set of facts. In Brooks v. The King, this court in substance found that the trial judge had not, under the circumstances, fairly charged the jury. I am unable to find any conflict between it and this case.\nUpon the whole, I do not think that the decision from which the prisoner seeks leave to appeal is in conflict with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case. The application for leave to appeal is therefore dismissed.\nMotion dismissed.\nSolicitor for accused: H.A.

C. ss. 995, 993, 998, 1025 (R.S.C.

The judgment appealed from which held that the evidence of a dying witness was regularly taken and could be considered by the jury is, if these sections apply (a point on which no opinion was expressed), in conflict with the decision of the English Court of Crown Cases Reserved in Reg. v. Shurmer (16. Cox C.C. 94). This decision strictly applied the Imperial statute above mentioned requiring a notice in writing to the accused. Under the circumstances of this case and inasmuch as there is already an appeal by the appellant before this court, leave to appeal is granted as to the question of the admissibility at the trial of the ante mortem deposition.\nMOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 1024a (now 1025) of the Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellant for manslaughter.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the motion.\nValmore Bienvenue K.C. contra.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an application made before me, on the 4th of February, for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Quebec, of the 14th of January, 1928, dismissing an appeal by Brunet from his conviction for manslaughter following an abortion practised by him on one Alice Couture who died as a result of the operation. Brunet\u2019s appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench was on four questions of law, as to one of which\u2014 misdirection or non-direction of the trial judge to the jury as to the danger of convicting an accused on the evidence of an accomplice\u2014there was a dissent (that of Mr. Justice Letourneau) in the appellate court, and on this point the petition alleges that an appeal has already been taken to this court under section 1023 of the Criminal Code (according to the numbering of the sections in R.S.C., 1927, c. 36). The object of this application is to seek leave to appeal on the following points with respect to which the learned judges were unanimous:\n(1) The evidence of Alice Couture taken at the hospital by a magistrate should not be accepted without following the rules of art. 955 of the Criminal Code of Canada, concerning \u201cevidence, under commission, of person dangerously ill.\u201d\n(2) Sufficient instructions, were not given to the jurors regarding the crime of manslaughter and abortion.\n(3) The defence was not sufficiently put before the jury. I will consider point 1 only, for with respect to points 2 and 3, the petitioner has not established a case for granting leave to appeal.\nPoint 1 is as to the admission of the evidence of Alice Couture at the trial. The petition refers to art. 955 of the Criminal Code, but this is a clerical error. It should be section 995 and the following sections, the effect of which the parties discussed, and I will consider the petition as amended accordingly.\nUnder section 1025 of the Criminal Code, leave to appeal from a unanimous judgment of a court of appeal may be granted.\nif the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\nIn The King v. Boak[1], it was held that decisions prior to the enactment of s. 1013 in 1923 might properly be considered as coming within the intendment of section 1025, if they were rendered in a like case. In another case, De Bortoli v. The King[2], my brother Newcombe appears to have been of the opinion that a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada might, if in conflict and in a like case, be brought within the meaning of s. 1025.\nIn view of the generality of the words \u201cany other court of appeal,\u201d I think I am at liberty to look at decisions not only of the Canadian courts of appeal, but also of English courts of criminal appeal, provided of course the statute governing the matter be to the same effect.\nComing now to the evidence of Alice Couture, there are two depositions of this witness in the record:\u2014\nThe first is intituled:\nD\u00e9position ante mortem de Alice Couture, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 23 ans, de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, 482, rue St. Vallier, prise sous serment \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4tel-Dieu du Pr\u00e9cieux Sang, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, devant l\u2019Honorable Arthur Lachance, Juge des Sessions de la Paix pour la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ce quatorzi\u00e8me de mai, 1927.\nAs stated, this deposition was taken on the 14th of May, 1927. It does not appear that the accused, or any counsel appearing for him, was present. The deposition is certified at the foot by the stenographer.\nThe second deposition was taken at the \u201cH\u00f4pital H\u00f4tel-Dieu du Pr\u00e9cieux Sang de Qu\u00e9bec\u201d on the 16th of May, 1927. The heading is \u201cBureau de la Paix (Instruction pr\u00e9liminaire),\u201d and the deposition is stated to have been taken before the judge of the Sessions of the Peace in presence of the accused. The witness was cross-examined by Mr. L\u00e9o Pelland, a barrister, on behalf of Brunet. The deposition is followed by a certificate signed by Arthur Lachance, Esq., Judge of Sessions of the Peace.\nI am informed that an information was on the later date, 16th May, 1927, pending against Brunet for having illegally used instruments to bring about an abortion.\nIt appears by the evidence, as well as by statements of counsel, that the first deposition was taken at the hospital before any complaint had been laid against Brunet. Counsel for the Crown informs me that this deposition remained among the papers of the preliminary inquiry, but was not used at the trial nor read to the jury.\nThe second deposition was read to the jury, the objection of the accused\u2019s counsel to its admission as evidence having been overruled. The petitioner now contends that it should have been rejected. He relies on sections 995 and following of the Criminal Code.\nCounsel for the Crown argues that section 995 has no application here, that the deposition of Alice Couture (the reference is to the second one) was taken as a part of the preliminary inquiry on the information then pending against the accused, and that it could be read at the trial under section 1000 of the Criminal Code.\nThe sections of the Criminal Code in question (and more particularly sections 995, 996 and 998) are taken from the Imperial statute 30-31 Vict., c. 35, ss. 6 and 7. If they govern this case, I must find that the decision of the appellate court that the evidence of Alice Couture was regularly taken and could be considered by the jury, is in conflict with the decision of the English Court of Crown Cases Reserved in Reg. v. Shurmer[3], which strictly applied the Imperial statute above mentioned requiring a notice in writing to the accused. Reg. v. Shurmer3 has been since followed in England. See Rex v. Harris[4].\nI do not think I should take upon myself on this application to decide whether sections 995 and following do or do not govern this case. The question is a very important one and there is conflict if the sections apply. Under these circumstances, and inasmuch as there is already an appeal by the accused before the court, I have decided to grant the petitioner leave to appeal on point 1 above mentioned.\nThis application was made to me within the twenty-one days mentioned by section 1025, but if an extension of time be necessary, I hereby extend it to the date of this judgment.\nLeave to appeal granted.\n[1] [1926] S.C.R. 481.\n[2] [1926] S.C.R. 492.\n[3] 16 Cox C.C. 94.\n3 16 Cox C.C. 94.\n[4] 26 Cox C.C. 143.\n"}

Co., which acquired the bills of lading and endorsed them to plaintiff as security for advances. As to seven of the cars, defendant delivered the grain to M. Co. while M. Co. held the bills of lading and before its endorsement of them to plaintiff. As to one car, defendant delivered the grain to M. Co. after its endorsement of the bill of lading to plaintiff. Each of the bills was in the standard form approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and provided that it was \u201cnot negotiable unless property is consigned \u2018to order\u2019\u201d; that \u201cit is mutually agreed, as to each carrier * * * and as to each party at any time interested in all or any of said bulk grain, that every service to be performed hereunder shall be subject to all the conditions * * * herein contained * * * and which are agreed to by the shipper, and accepted for himself and his assigns;\u201d and that \u201cthe surrender of this original bill of lading, properly endorsed, shall be required before delivery of the bulk grain when consigned \u2018to order\u2019 * * * *.\u201d Plaintiff, who had taken the bills without knowing of any defect in M. Co.\u2019s title, sued defendant for the value of the grain, claiming that defendant should not have delivered the grain to M. Co. without requiring surrender of the bills. From the evidence it appeared that frequently a consignee is not able, on delivery of the grain, to deliver the bill of lading, and the practice is for the carrier to deliver the goods upon receiving from the consignee a bond of indemnity; of which practice plaintiff was aware.\nHeld: As to the seven cars, defendant was not liable. Estoppel was not established. The bills were not negotiable except in the limited sense that they could be transferred by endorsement, and that when the effect of the transfer was to pass the property in the goods the benefit of the contract passed also; in that view the transfer of the bills to plaintiff as pledgee did not in itself constitute it the assignee of contractual rights under the bill (Brandt v. Liverpool, etc., Nav. Co. Ltd., [1924] 1 K.B. 575, at pp. 594 et seq.); and delivery of the goods to the person entitled, under the bill, to the possession of them at the time of delivery, was a complete answer to any claim based upon an allegation of wrongful delivery (London Joint Stock Bank v. British Amsterdam Maritime Agency, 16 Com. Cas. 102, at p. 107). The phrase in the bill, \u201ceach party at any time interested in all or any of said bulk grain\u201d could not be reasonably extended to apply to persons acquiring an interest in the grain after delivery of it pursuant to the terms of the bill. It could not be said that the form and terms of the bill, or its approval in such form and terms by the Board of Railway Commissioners, manifested an intention to place upon the carrier the burden of protecting transferees by insisting in all cases upon observance of the condition requiring its surrender on delivery of the goods.\nHeld, further: As to the bill endorsed to plaintiff before delivery of the grain, the defendant was liable. Plaintiff, as pledgee of the bill, acquired, while the goods were still in transit, a special property in the grain. The fact that the car, originally consigned to Fort William, had been diverted to Winnipeg c\/o M. Co. before transfer of the bill to plaintiff, did not amount to constructive delivery for any relevant purpose.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (36 Man. R. 322) affirming, on equal division of the court, judgment of Macdonald J. (ibid), reversed in part.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] which, by an equal division of the court, affirmed the judgment of Macdonald J.[2] holding the plaintiff entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $14,774.89, being the value of eight carloads of grain which the plaintiff claimed the defendant had wrongfully failed to deliver to it.\nEach of the cars of grain had been shipped on defendant\u2019s railway, in bulk, consigned to order, and a bill of lading was delivered to each shipper by the defendant\u2019s agent at point of shipment, the form being the same in each case, and being the standard form approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by order no. 14591 of 18th August, 1911, and providing, inter alia, that it was\nnot negotiable unless property is consigned \u201cto order\u201d;\nthat\nit is mutually agreed, as to each carrier of all or any of said bulk grain over all or any portion of said route to destination, and as to each party at any time interested in all or any of said bulk grain, that every service to be performed hereunder shall be subject to all the conditions, whether printed or written, herein contained (including conditions on back hereof) and which are agreed to by the shipper, and accepted for himself and his assigns;\nand that\nthe surrender of this original bill of lading, properly endorsed, shall be required before delivery of the bulk grain when consigned \u201cto order\u201d or upon application by the owner or consignee for terminal elevator delivery or warehouse receipt. Some of the cars were, by the terms of the bills of lading, consigned to Winnipeg, and the others to Fort William, but the latter, while in transit, were, by arrangement, diverted to Winnipeg.\nThe McMillan Grain Co., Ltd., of Winnipeg, became the purchaser of the grain, and acquired the bills of lading. It endorsed these to the plaintiff as security for advances.\nThe defendant delivered all the grain to the McMillan Grain Co., Ltd., without the surrender of the bills of lading. As to seven of the cars, this delivery took place before the endorsement of the bills of lading to the plaintiff, and while the bills of lading were in the hands of the McMillan Grain Co., Ltd., which was at the time the holder of them and entitled under them to receive, and give a valid acquittance to the defendant for, the grain they affected. As to the other car, the bill of lading had been transferred to the plaintiff before the delivery of the grain by the defendant. This bill of lading, covering a car originally consigned to Fort William, had been acquired by the McMillan Grain Co., Ltd., and the diversion to Winnipeg had been noted on the face of the bill by the words \u201cDiverted to Winnipeg, c\/o McMillan Grain Co.,\u201d before the transfer of the bill to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff took the bills of lading, as security for advances, without actual knowledge of any defect in the title of the McMillan Grain Co., Ltd., to the bills or to the grain which they purported to cover. The McMillan Grain Co., Ltd., subsequently went into forced liquidation.\nAs found by this Court, on the evidence, the practice is that the term, above quoted, of the bill of lading, requiring its surrender before delivery of the grain, is not, as a rule, strictly enforced; frequently the consignee is not in a position to deliver the bill of lading, and the practice of the carrier is to deliver the goods shipped upon receiving from the consignee a bond of indemnity; the plaintiff was fully aware of this practice.\nThe plaintiff, alleging its presentment of the bills of lading and demand for delivery of the grain and defendant\u2019s failure to deliver to it, and wrongful delivery, sued defendant for the amount of the value of the grain. Macdonald J. gave judgment for the plaintiff[3], which was affirmed, on equal division, by the Court of Appeal (Dennistoun and Prendergast JJA. being for the dismissal of the appeal, and Fullerton and Trueman JJA. being for its allowance)[4]. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and R. D. Guy K.C. for the appellant.\nH. J. Symington K.C. and H. V. Hudson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action against the appellant company to recover the value of eight carloads of grain shipped on its railway. The respondent company sued as the holder of eight bills of lading relating severally to these cars. The grain was delivered by the appellant company to a firm, the McMillan Grain Co., who the respondent company says were not entitled to possession of it, and without obtaining in return therefor surrender of the bills of lading pursuant to the terms of the bills. The bills of lading are all in the form prescribed by the Board of Railway Commissioners. Four of the cars in question were, by the terms of the bills, consigned to Winnipeg, and the others to Fort William. These last mentioned cars, while in transit, were, by arrangement, diverted to Winnipeg.\nAs to one of the last mentioned cars (no. 209554), the bill of lading had been transferred to the respondent company before the delivery of the grain to the McMillans. This bill of lading had been acquired by the McMillans, and the diversion to Winnipeg had been noted on the face of the bill by the words \u201cDiverted to Winnipeg, c\/o McMillan Grain Co.\u201d before the transfer of the bill to the respondent company. As to the remaining seven cars, the bills of lading were at the time of delivery in the hands of the McMillans, who were the holders of them, and entitled under them to receive and give a valid acquittance to the railway company for the grain they affected. As already mentioned, the railway company did not insist upon the bills of lading being given up by the McMillans, and, after delivery to them, the McMillans transferred, by indorsement, all of these seven bills of lading to the respondent company, who took them, as security for advances, without actual knowledge of any defect in the title of the McMillans to the bills, or to the grain they purported to cover. As already intimated, one term of each of the bills is expressed in these words \u201cThe surrender of this original bill of lading, properly endorsed, shall be required before delivery of the bulk grain when consigned \u2018to order.\u2019\u201d\nThe learned trial judge held that, by leaving the bills of lading in the hands of the McMillans after delivering the grain to that firm, the appellant company had put it in the power of the McMillans to represent that the bills of lading were valid and subsisting bills affecting grain then in transit, and that, having in that way assisted the McMillans in their wrongful conduct in pledging them as security for advances, the appellant company was estopped from denying that the grain was still in its hands, at the time the advances were made. In the Court of Appeal, two members of the court agreed and two disagreed with the learned trial judge.\nI agree with Fullerton and Trueman JJA., that the evidence fails to establish the existence of the elements essential to the existence of the estoppel relied upon. The practice as shown by the evidence is that the term of the bill of lading above quoted is not as a rule strictly enforced. Frequently the consignee is not in a position to deliver the bill of lading, and the practice of the carriers (both the C.P.R. Co. and the C.N.R. Co.) is to deliver the goods shipped upon receiving from the consignee a bond of indemnity. The respondent company was fully aware of this practice.\nIt may be that the respondent company was acting under some vague idea that the bond of indemnity would be available for its benefit if it should prove that the transit was at an end when the bill of lading was transferred to it. But it is difficult to understand how that can affect the question of estoppel. The fact of a bill of lading being outstanding would not\u2014this is really undisputed\u2014to a person familiar with the practice, in itself indicate that the grain affected by it was still undelivered. A lender taking such a bill as pledgee would rely not upon the fact of the bill being outstanding, but upon the honesty of his borrower, or possibly might be influenced by the vague idea adverted to, above, that in some way the railway company\u2019s right of indemnity would be available for his benefit, if difficulties arose. On neither of these hypotheses could the estoppel contended for be maintained.\nIt is also argued that by the terms of the bill of lading the respondent company was a party to the contract, and entitled, as a party, to insist upon the term above quoted. There are several objections to that; and on the whole I think the preferable view of the bill of lading is that taken by Trueman JA., and that negotiability as contemplated by the bill means negotiability in the limited sense in which bills of lading are sometimes spoken of as negotiable, that is to say that the bill can be transferred by endorsement, and when the effect of the transfer is to pass the property in the goods, the benefit of the contract passes also.\nIn that view, the transfer of the bills to the respondent company as pledgee did not in itself constitute that company the assignee of contractual rights under the bill: Brandt v. Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Nav. Co., Ltd.[5]; and delivery of the goods to the person entitled, under the bill of lading, to the possession of them, is a complete answer to any claim based upon an allegation of wrongful delivery. London Joint Stock Bank v. British Amsterdam Maritime Agency[6].\nEven if it could be contended that, on the principle of the Asiatic Banking Corporation\u2019s Case[7], the bill constituted an offer by the railway company to any person into whose possession it might come by way of transfer,\u2014 an offer which might be accepted by an endorsee in taking the bill for value,\u2014yet this must be subject to the qualification that such an offer would remain open only so long as the contract remained unperformed. Once the contract had been performed by the railway company by delivery of the goods, at the place of destination, and to the person then entitled to receive the goods under the bill, such an offer would become meaningless.\nThe phrase emphasized by Mr. Symington, \u201ceach party at any time interested in all or any of said bulk grain,\u201d could not be reasonably extended to apply to persons acquiring an interest in the grain after delivery of it by the carrier, pursuant to the terms of the bill of lading.\nMr. Symington, in his able argument, urged that the financing of the grain trade rests upon the credit given to outstanding bills of lading as symbols of property in goods in the possession of the carrier; and he contended that the form and terms of the instrument as settled by the Board of Railway Commissioners manifest (when interpreted from the commercial point of view) an intention to place upon the carrier the burden of protecting transferees of such instruments, by insisting in all cases upon observance of the condition requiring delivery of the bill of lading in exchange for delivery of the goods covered by it. The interests of persons advancing money on the faith of such instruments no doubt deserve proper protection; but the evidence suggests that there may be other interests which might be prejudiced by the establishment of the rule suggested. However that may be, if such were the intention, it has not been very happily expressed. There is nothing, I am convinced, in the form or the terms of the instruments, or in the circumstances of their origin, which furnishes a sound reason for giving to them the effect contended for.\nAs regards the bill no. 209554, the respondent company, as pledgee of the bill, acquired, while the goods were still in transit, a special property in the grain as pledgee. I am unable to perceive the force of the argument presented on behalf of the appellant company based upon its practice, known to the respondent company, of making delivery upon receipt of an indemnity without production of the bill of lading. There is not the slightest ground for a suggestion that any act or omission, on the part of the respondent company, affected the proceedings of the appellant company. That company merely followed its practice.\nNor can I agree that the diversion of the grain from Fort William to Winnipeg, to be delivered to the \u201ccare of McMillan Grain Co.,\u201d amounted to a constructive delivery for any relevant purpose. A different question might have arisen, if there had been a direction to deliver to a third party. The appeal should therefore be dismissed as to the bill of lading no. 209554; and allowed as to the remaining seven bills of lading, and the judgment against the appellant company should be reduced accordingly. If the parties cannot agree upon the amount, the point may be spoken to. The appellant company is entitled to the costs of both appeals. As to the costs of the action, the respondent company is entitled to the general costs of the action, except such costs as are exclusively attributable to that part of its claim upon which it fails; the appellant company\u2019s costs, in so far as so exclusively attributable, will be paid by the respondent company.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Larue, [1925] S.C.R. 275; In re Hudson Fashion Shoppe Ltd., [1926] s.C.R. 26); but the order of dismissal may reserve any right of the applicant to obtain from the court having jurisdiction to grant it (See Bankruptcy Act, ss. 68 (5), 2 (l) an extension of time for making the application or for the service of a notice thereof, and to renew the application in the event of such extension being granted (Order as made in In re Hudson Fashion Shoppe Ltd. followed; see 7 C.B.R. 80).\nRemarks on the desirability of amendment of Rule 72 so as to empower a judge of this Court to extend the time for applying for leave to appeal either before or after its expiration.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec, in a matter arising under the Bankruptcy Act.\nS. M. Clark for the applicant.\nH. Bernier for the respondent.\nMignault J.\u2014In this case, application on behalf of the Providence Washington Assurance Co. was to-day made to me for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Quebec Court of King\u2019s Bench, in a matter arising under the Bankruptcy Act. This judgment was pronounced on the 14th of January, so that this application is made on the thirty-first day after the judgment, and therefore is not within the time specified by Bankruptcy rule 72. Moreover, fourteen days notice of the application was not given to the adverse party. I have no power to extend the time (Boivin v. Larue[1]; In re Hudson Fashion Shoppe, Ltd.[2]) and must dismiss the application.\nWhen the Boivin Case1 was before me, no reference was made by counsel to s. 68, subs. 5, of the Bankruptcy Act, which empowers the court (which means the court which is invested with original jurisdiction in bankruptcy under the Act: s. 2, subs. l), where by the Act or by the General Rules, the time for doing any act or thing is limited, to extend the time either before or after the expiration thereof, upon such terms, if any, as the court may think fit to impose.\nMy attention has been called to an order made by Mr. Justice Fisher, sitting in bankruptcy, in In re Hudson Fashion Shoppe Ltd.2 (the same case in which an application for leave to appeal was made to the Chief Justice of this Court, and dismissed because fourteen days notice of the application had not been given[3]) extending the time for applying to a judge of this court for leave to appeal. Mr. Justice Fisher states that my Lord, the Chief Justice, dismissed the application for leave made to him, without prejudice\nto the right, if any, of the applicant to obtain an extension of time for the making of such application, or for the service of a notice thereof from the Court having jurisdiction to grant such extension, and without prejudice to the right of the said applicant to renew the said application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, in the event of such extension being granted by the Court aforesaid.\nI have decided to follow the decision of the Chief Justice, and to insert this reservation in my order of dismissal of the application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nI must say, however, that I think General Rule 72 should be amended so as to give a judge of this Court the power to extend the time for applying for leave to appeal, either before or after its expiration. It seems incongruous, and it adds to the costs as well as delays the proceedings, to oblige an applicant to go back to the trial court to obtain an extension of the time specified by rule 72. I may add that rule 68, governing appeals to the appeal court, gives a like power to a judge of the court of appeal.\nThe applicant must pay the costs of this application.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitors for the applicant: Savard & Savard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bernier & De Billy.\n[1] [1925] S.C.R. 275.\n[2] (1926) 7 C.B.R. 80.\n1 [1925] S.C.R. 275.\n2 (1926) 7 C.B.R. 80.\n[3] [1926] S.C.R. 26.\n"}

Adopt\u00e9e sur division, l\u2019\u00e9chevin Roy votant contre.\nLes taxes sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9es pour les ann\u00e9es 1922-23 et 1923-24. Les immeubles \u00e0 raison desquels elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es sont ceux qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9solution ci-dessus. MM. Hutchison, Dussault et Chauveau en sont les locataires en vertu d\u2019un bail du 10 f\u00e9vrier 1919, mais ils avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper les immeubles l\u2019automne pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et ils \u00e9n \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession lorsque la r\u00e9solution d\u2019exemption fut adopt\u00e9e.

Hutchison, Dussault et Chauveau portait une clause par laquelle\nles taxes municipales et scolaires dues pour cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 seront, pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du pr\u00e9sent bail, pay\u00e9es par les locataires.

Hutchison, Dussault et Chauveau et n\u2019avait pu \u00eatre valablement transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 MM. Bishop et Fletcher.\nL\u2019exemption \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la condition que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 continu\u00e2t d\u2019\u00eatre exploit\u00e9e comme chantier maritime. Cette exploitation avait cess\u00e9 et, par le fait m\u00eame, l\u2019exemption ne pouvait plus \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e.\nLa plupart de ces moyens avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Deux jugements \u00e9taient intervenus, le 22 f\u00e9vrier et le 18 octobre 1922; et le S\u00e9minaire a r\u00e9pondu que ces jugements avaient d\u00e9finitivement d\u00e9cid\u00e9, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de la cit\u00e9,\n1\u00b0 que la r\u00e9solution d\u2019exemption \u00e9tait valide;\n2\u00b0 que cette exemption s\u2019\u00e9tendait aux taxes fonci\u00e8res;\n3\u00b0 qu\u2019elle subsistait malgr\u00e9 la sous-location \u00e0 Bishop et Fletcher.\nSuivant le S\u00e9minaire, il y avait donc chose jug\u00e9e entre les parties sur ces diff\u00e9rents points.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on dont nous envisageons la cause, nous n\u2019aurons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer sur chacune de ces questions, et nous croyons que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a infirm\u00e9 celui du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance et qui a maintenu l\u2019action de la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis, doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 pour la raison suivante:\nComme le dit tr\u00e8s bien Monsieur le Juge Dorion,\nles deux jugements invoqu\u00e9s laissent intacte la question de savoir si l\u2019exemption est sujette \u00e0 la condition que les locataires, quels qu\u2019ils soient, devront exploiter des chantiers maritimes. L\u2019exemption de taxes a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 5775 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes (S.R.Q. 1909). Cet article se lit comme suit:\nSujet aux articles 5929 et suivants, le conseil peut, par une r\u00e9solution, exempter des taxes municipales, pour une p\u00e9riode de vingt ans ou plus, toute personne qui exerce une industrie ou un m\u00e9tier ou se livre \u00e0 une exploitation quelconque, ou convenir avec cette personne d\u2019une somme de deniers payable annuellement pour un temps n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas vingt ans, en commutation de toute taxe municipale.\nIl peut faire remise du paiement des taxes municipales aux personnes pauvres de la municipalit\u00e9.\nLes exemptions ou conventions autoris\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9sent article ne s\u2019\u00e9tendent pas aux travaux \u00e0 faire aux cours d\u2019eau, foss\u00e9s de ligne, cl\u00f4tures, \u00e9gouts, trottoirs ou chemins d\u00e9pendant des biens imposables ainsi exempt\u00e9s ou commu\u00e9s.\nComme on le voit, le pouvoir qui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au conseil municipal en vertu de cet article est celui d\u2019exempter une personne qui exerce une industrie ou un m\u00e9tier, ou se livre \u00e0 une exploitation. Le pouvoir du conseil municipal est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette condition (Corporation de Cartierville v. Compagnie des Boulevards[2]). En outre, l\u2019article implique que cette condition doit persister pendant la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019exemption de taxes.\nDans la cause de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus v. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[3], il s\u2019agissait surtout de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait l\u2019ayant-cause de M. Edouard Gohier, en faveur de qui l\u2019exemption de taxes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la ville de Notre-Dame des Neiges \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, \u201cses successeurs ou ayants-cause\u201d; mais cette cour a alors pos\u00e9 le principe que le statut subordonne la continuation de l\u2019exemption de taxes \u00e0 la continuation de l\u2019exploitation elle-m\u00eame. L\u2019exemption est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 persister seulement aussi longtemps que l\u2019industrie, le m\u00e9tier ou l\u2019exploitation persiste. En l\u2019absence de l\u2019exercice de l\u2019industrie, du m\u00e9tier, ou de l\u2019exploitation, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019exemption cesse d\u2019exister.\nOr, durant les ann\u00e9es 1922-23 et 1923-24, pour lesquelles la cit\u00e9 r\u00e9clame des taxes de l\u2019appelante, les chantiers maritimes, \u00e0 raison desquels l\u2019exemption avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, avaient cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre exploit\u00e9s par qui que ce soit sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant que les immeubles fussent rest\u00e9s affect\u00e9s \u00e0 la destination qui avait amen\u00e9 la cit\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder l\u2019exemption; il fallait que les chantiers fussent en op\u00e9ration. Ils ne l\u2019\u00e9taient plus. Il n\u2019y avait pas de commandes et il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019ouvrage. Les employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. Pendant la premi\u00e8re partie de cette p\u00e9riode, il n\u2019y avait plus sur les chantiers que le g\u00e9rant, M. Baker; le comptable, M. Odell; et le gardien. M. Baker partit au commencement de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1923, de sorte qu\u2019il ne resta plus que le comptable et le gardien.\nA peine, pendant tout ce temps, The Fletcher Ship Repairing Company, qui occupait les chantiers comme sous-locataire de MM. Hutchison, Dussault et Chauveau, entreprit-elle de r\u00e9parer le vapeur \u201cl\u2019Etoile.\u201d Cette tentative d\u2019op\u00e9ration dura tout au plus quinze jours et fut abandonn\u00e9e\nbecause the company was not in a financial position to carry (on the) work on her,\ndit le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la compagnie. Il nous faut accepter le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier, car le comptable Odell \u00e9tait sur les lieux, \u00e0 L\u00e9vis, mais \u201cla finance \u00e9tait faite \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al,\u201d et Odell est forc\u00e9 d\u2019admettre qu\u2019il est incapable de dire si \u201cla compagnie avait des fonds.\u201d\nLa situation, \u00e0 partir de 1922, est d\u00e9crite par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier dans les termes suivants:\nDuring 1922, there were (sic) a quantity of survey work done on a number of cases, many surveys done after. I say, after the middle of 1922, or, in fact, during the whole of 1922, the company was not in a financial position to undertake any work, but Mr. Odell who was acting in charge of the company here, was naturally very interested in endeavouring to see the company carry on and it was most entirely on his efforts to secure work for the company.\nThe last case in which, to my knowledge, this occurred was in October, 1922, but this was in connection with the s\/s L\u2019Etoile and the company was not in a financial position to carry work on her. As the result, an action was taken against the company, which has been settled out of Court and the Company has paid $300 damages. After that, the only thing that was carried on by the Fletcher Repairing Ship Company was to endeavour to dispose of the plant.\nQ. And you disposed of the majority of the plant as fast . . .\nA. As fast as we could find a buyer.\nUn peu plus loin, il ajoute:\nAt that time (May, 1922) the reports were not coming in as regularly as they should have been, because the company was practically bankrupt and there was little or no interest being taken by the principals in the operations of the company. Therefore these reports were not followed through our demand.\nEt encore:\nThe company had no asset, except the lease * * *. The company did not have enough money to pay outstanding accounts.\nCette preuve \u00e9tablit donc non-seulement qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucune op\u00e9ration des chantiers maritimes pendant les ann\u00e9es 1922-23 et 1923-24 (sauf l\u2019incident de L\u2019Etoile), mais que la compagnie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019exercer l\u2019exploitation. Le comptable Odell tente bien d\u2019expliquer que, s\u2019il y avait eu de l\u2019ouvrage, MM. Bishop et Fletcher personnellement auraient pu lui procurer l\u2019argent n\u00e9cessaire; mais cet espoir probl\u00e9matique ne saurait pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des faits positifs dont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu, pendant les ann\u00e9es 1922-23 et 1923-24, aucune exploitation au sens de l\u2019article 5775 de la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, et que l\u2019exemption de taxes accord\u00e9e \u00e0 raison de cette exploitation ne peut donc \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour ces ann\u00e9es.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a maintenu l\u2019action, doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chauveau & Rivard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bernier & de Billy.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 44 K.B. 165.\n[2] Q.R. 51 S.C. 170.\n[3] [1925] S.C.R. 120.\n"}

The cause of the accident was the passenger\u2019s wrongful act in operating the handle, which he must have known was intended to be operated only by the conductor. There was no evidence to warrant the conclusion that the passenger\u2019s act should have been anticipated by the defendant. As to alleged disregard of a rule requiring the conductor to go to the rear of the car when being moved reversely, it was sufficient to say that, if the rule applied at that point, its breach was not the cause of the accident; moreover, the rule was for an entirely different purpose.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (36 Man. R. 592) reversed.\nNewcombe J. dissented, holding that it was the conductor\u2019s neglect of his duty to be at his post at the rear when the car was backing, that was the direct cause of the accident; it was a consequence of the lack of the control which he was required to exercise that the passenger opened the door for himself; the passenger\u2019s act was natural and should have been foreseen and precautions taken against it.\nThe court expressed the opinion that the case did not belong to the class of cases in which it was contemplated that \u201cspecial leave\u201d might be given under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, from the judgment of that Court[1], affirming, by a majority, the judgment of Stacpoole, Co. C.J., holding the defendant liable in damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff through being struck, while standing on a station platform, by a door of the defendant\u2019s tramcar, the door having been opened by a passenger in the car, while the car, which had overshot the platform, was backing to its stopping place. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed, Newcombe J. dissenting.\nE. H. Coleman for the appellant.\nH. C. Morrison for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by Anglin C.J.C.\u2014By special leave of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the defendant appeals from a judgment of that Court[2], affirming (Fullerton and Trueman, JJ.A., dissenting) the judgment of Stacpoole, Co.J., who awarded the plaintiff $800 damages for personal injuries which he found were sustained through negligence of the defendants. Fullerton, J.A., states the material facts as follows:\nOn the day of the accident, the plaintiff was standing on the platform at Ridge Creek Road, on the Selkirk line of the defendant\u2019s railway, waiting for a car from Selkirk, upon which he intended to travel to Winnipeg. The car overshot the platform about a car length, when it stopped and backed until the front door of the car was opposite the south end of the platform. While it was backing up, a passenger named Fyffe, without the knowledge of either the motorman or conductor, opened one of the rear doors, which struck the plaintiff, knocking him down and seriously injuring him.\nThe evidence shows that the crews of defendant\u2019s cars change at McBeth Siding, which is north of the platform on which the accident happened. After leaving McBeth Siding, the conductor\u2019s duty is to collect the fares of the passengers going to Winnipeg, and it was while he was attending to this duty and away from the handles operating the rear doors that Fyffe opened the door. Until fares have been collected, passengers get on and off by the front door, and the rear doors are not used. The learned trial judge found in favour of the plaintiff, taking the view that it was the duty of the company to have the conductor stationed near the operating levers in order that he might be able to control the opening and shutting of the doors.\nIt is clear that had it not been for Fyffe\u2019s interference the accident would not have happened.\nThe rear door of the car was admittedly designed to be operated only by the conductor, and its construction and the placing of the handle by which it was operated in the box or enclosure within which the conductor ordinarily stood made this so obvious that any sensible person could not fail to be aware of it. The view which prevailed in the Court of Appeal was that the failure of the conductor to lock the rear door when he went forward to collect fares amounted to actionable negligence. That Court, as well as the trial judge, took the view that the act of Fyffe in opening the door as he did was something that the defendants should have anticipated might occur and to prevent which they should have taken precautions, the omission of the latter in the circumstances amounting to actionable negligence. With the utmost respect, we cannot accept that view. The cause of the accident was undoubtedly the act of Fyffe in opening the door. By placing the handles used to operate the doors within the conductor\u2019s box the company had given intimation that passengers were not intended to meddle with the opening of the doors quite as effectively as if it had posted a notice forbidding such meddling. At all events, in the absence of any evidence that such interference by a passenger had occurred before and was, therefore, something that might have been expected, such an inference was, in our opinion, unwarranted. Negligence implies a breach of duty. Finding nothing on which to base an inference that the wanton and mischievous act of the passenger in operating the handle, which he must have known it was intended should be operated only by the conductor, was something that the company ought to have anticipated might occur, there is no basis for the implication of a duty to prevent it.\nThere was, in our opinion, no evidence on which a court could come to the conclusion that such action by a passenger ought to have been anticipated.\nOf other negligence suggested, such as the disregard by the motorman and conductor of a rule requiring the latter to go to the rear of the car when it is being moved reversely, it is sufficient to say that, if the rule applied at the point in question, its breach was not the cause of the accident. Moreover, the rule was made for an entirely different purpose. Nor is it material that when the door was opened the car was moving backwards.\nFor these reasons the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed. Counsel for the appellants having informed the Court that he was instructed not to ask costs, there will be no order as to costs.\nBefore parting with this appeal we feel that we should add that this case does not, in our opinion, belong to the class of cases in which it was contemplated that \u201cspecial leave\u201d might be given under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. It deals with a very ordinary claim based upon negligence, the disposition of which depends upon the inferences to be drawn from a particular set of facts. There is no matter of public interest involved in it. Newcombe J. (dissenting).\u2014I am so unfortunate as to differ from the other members of the Court, and, as I have formed a very definite opinion, I think it better to state it. The view which prevails, if I may presume to express it according to my understanding, is that, while there may have been negligence on the defendant\u2019s part in backing the car with no lookout, and in thus coming to the station without exercising any competent control of the doors at the rear of the car, the company did no more than to create a dangerous condition, in which the act of the passenger who opened the door was the cause productive of the accident.\nTo the contrary, in my opinion, which I express with the utmost respect, not only would the accident not have occurred if the conductor of the ear had discharged his duties, but neglect of these was the direct cause. Intervening, it is true, was the act of the passenger who opened the door, but, seeing that the conductor was not at his post, that act followed in natural course; it was a consequence of lack of the control which the conductor was required to exercise that the passenger opened the door for himself; and the defendant is liable for consequences which should have been foreseen\u2014such as were so likely to ensue that the defendant\u2019s failure to anticipate them and make effective reasonable means of prevention was negligence.\nThe facts are very plain. On 13th November, 1926, at about half-past six in the evening, the plaintiff and two boys were waiting at Ridgecrest Station on the defendant\u2019s railway to take passage into Winnipeg on the incoming car. The accommodation provided for the taking up and discharge of passengers was extremely limited, the platform being only 5 feet long and 2 feet 6 inches wide; it was reached by the sidewalk of Ridgecrest Avenue, from which there were steps leading up. There had been rain and frost during the afternoon, and the platform was icy. When the car came along it passed the platform by a car length or less, then stopped, and, after some hesitation, moved slowly backward, as the motorman says, under \u201cone notch of power, one and a half or two miles an hour probably.\u201d Then, as the car came opposite to the platform, the rear door, which swings outward, was opened from within, projecting over the platform about 1 foot 3 inches, or half the width of the platform, and, in its progress, sweeping off the plaintiff and one of the boys. The plaintiff fell into a ditch or excavation and suffered damages, for the recovery of which the action is brought. The defence is that the defendant company is not responsible for the opening of the door and the consequent overthrow of the plaintiff, because it was one of the passengers in the car, and not a servant of the company, who opened the door. It appears that the defendant, in defining the duties of its employees, had taken care to provide that the doors were not left to the operation of the passengers. On this particular car two men were employed, a motorman and a conductor. The motorman\u2019s place was at the head of the car, and he attended to the driving and to the working of the door in front. There was a place provided for the conductor in the rear compartment of the car, in which were also seats for passengers. There was, between the conductor\u2019s seat and the space occupied by the passengers, a metal rail or bar to which were affixed handles for opening the doors at the rear.\nWhen the motorman desires to reverse his car he gives a signal of four bells to the conductor, whose duty it is then to see that the way is free of obstruction, and so to inform the motorman by repeating the signal. While the reverse operation is in progress the conductor communicates with the motorman by signals to warn of any danger. On this occasion, although backing into a station, the conductor was not at his post in the vestibule at the rear. He had gone forward to collect fares from passengers who were extending their journey beyond that for which they had paid when entering the car, and he was, in fact, so close to the motorman that signals were useless, and the latter, instead of giving the reverse signal, told the conductor orally that he was going to reverse. The conductor paid no attention; he says he did not hear what the motorman said. The motorman looked at his side vision mirror, which gave him a limited view of the situation outside at the rear of the car, and started, as he says, slowly in the reverse direction, intending to stop at the platform. The conductor ignored these movements, but remained in the front of the car, collecting his fares. It was then that a passenger who was riding in the rear vestibule opened the door, and in consequence the man and boy were upset. There were means of locking these doors, and, as to a car which is in the sole charge of a motorman, or, as the saying is, \u201coperated as a one-man car,\u201d the doors at the rear are locked while the car is in motion, and open automatically, or by the passenger\u2019s foot upon a treadle, when the car stops. When there is a conductor, and he is in his place, he controls the handles by which the doors at the rear are opened and closed; but when he is not in his place, no means are substituted or employed to prevent a passenger from opening them, and the handles are conveniently placed for the use of passengers riding in or passing through the vestibule to make their exits. As to what should have been anticipated, such cases are said to be rather of first impression, but, so far as I can perceive, it is just as natural, and just as much to be foreseen, that an outgoing passenger who knows the use of the handles would open the door for himself as if the handles had been knobs or latches affixed to the doors themselves. The company\u2019s standing orders were apt enough, if followed, to prevent such accidents; the trouble was that the conductor in this case failed to comply with them, the instructions which the company gave to its servants were thus set at nought, and the accident followed as a natural result. It is common course for a passenger to open a door when he has only to turn the handle and there is no employee exercising any control. Then, if it be natural and probable that a passenger would let himself out, it is surely not unnatural or improbable that he may on occasion open the door somewhat prematurely, or without due regard to the circumstances of the people who are waiting on the platform. All kinds of passengers ride in tramway cars, and, if the doors of these cars open outwards, and there be nothing to prevent the opening of them by any passenger who is so minded, the use of a lock or some device to prevent the doors becoming sources of danger to persons outside would seem to be a matter which should not escape the attention of those responsible for the operation of the tramway. The defendant relies upon a passage from Lord Dunedin\u2019s judgment in Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins, et al[3], where the law is stated in these words:\nThe duty being to take precaution, it is no excuse to say that the accident would not have happened unless some other agency than that of the defendant had intermeddled with the matter. A loaded gun will not go off unless some one pulls the trigger, a poison is innocuous unless some one takes it, gas will not explode unless it is mixed with air and then a light is set to it. Yet the cases of Dixon v. Bell[4]; Thomas v. Winchester[5]; and Parry v. Smith[6], are all illustrations of liability enforced. On the other hand, if the proximate cause of the accident is not the negligence of the defendant, but the conscious act of another volition, then he will not be liable. For against such conscious act of volition no precaution can really avail.\nAnd it is argued that here the accident was due to the conscious act of another volition, and that the defendant is not liable. But I am satisfied, and indeed the cases cited in the context show, that the passage does not assist a defendant in cases where there is a duty to take prudent precautions, such as, upon the findings, existed in this case, and where the cause of the accident is to be found in the neglect to take those precautions. It is a question of fact whether the negligent act of a third person is such a natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s own neglect in prescribing and enforcing reasonable preventive measures that the defendant is himself guilty of negligence if he fail to anticipate and provide against the negligent actus interveniens, and my finding upholds that of the trial judge, and of the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Anderson, Guy, Chappell & Duval.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morrison & Booth.\n[1] 36 Man.

G. had never carried such clocks on his premises as part of his stock in trade, and there was evidence that it was not usual for a dealer in electrical supplies to do so. For the purpose of installing them under his contract with defendant, he bought them from plaintiff under a conditional sale agreement, and they were shipped direct to the school premises. The conditional sale agreement was not filed pursuant to the Conditional Sales Act (R.S.O., 1914. c. 136), but the seller\u2019s name and address were plainly set out on the clocks. G. failed to pay for them, and plaintiff sued defendant for return of the clocks or for their value.\nHeld, that the delivery to G. was a delivery to \u201ca trader or other person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business\u201d within s. 3 (3), and that there was a resale by G. \u201cin the ordinary course of his business\u201d within s. 3 (4), of the Conditional Sales Act; that, therefore, under the Act, the property in the goods vested in defendant, and plaintiff could not recover.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (61 Ont. L.R. 85, reversing judgment of Riddell J.A., ibid) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff (by special leave granted by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Riddell J.A., in favour of the plaintiff1.\nOne Grinyer, who carried on business as the Grinyer Electric Company, dealers in electrical and radio supplies, contracted with the defendant to install an electric signalling system in the new Guelph Collegiate Institute then in course of construction. The system to be installed included a master clock and secondary clocks, which Grinyer purchased from the plaintiff under an agreement by which the title to the goods was not to pass to Grinyer until the price thereof was paid in full, and until such payment they were to remain the plaintiff\u2019s property. The agreement was not filed pursuant to the Conditional Sales Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 136, s. 3 (1b)), but the name and address of the seller were plainly set out on the face of the clocks (see the Act, s. 3 (5)). The goods were shipped, on Grinyer\u2019s order, direct to the premises of the Guelph Collegiate Institute. There was evidence that Grinyer never had, as part of his stock in trade on his premises, a master clock or secondary clocks such as those in question, and that it is not usual for a dealer or contractor in electrical supplies to have master clocks and secondary clocks on his premises as part of his stock in trade.\nThe defendant paid Grinyer for the equipment installed, but Grinyer failed to pay the plaintiff, the balance remaining due, as fixed by the judgment at trial, being $1,263.37.\nThe plaintiff claimed from the defendant the return of the articles, or, in the alternative, their value. Riddell, J.A., held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the said sum of $1,263.37[2]. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division, which held that the action should be dismissed2.\nSubsections 3 and 4 of section 3 of the said Act (as it then stood) read as follows:\n(3) Where the delivery is made to a trader or other person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business such provision [i.e., the provision in the contract that the ownership is to remain in the seller until payment of the purchase money] shall also, as against his creditors, be invalid and he shall be deemed the owner of the goods unless the provisions of this Act have been complied with.\n(4) Where such trader or other person resells the goods in the ordinary course of his business the property in and ownership of such goods shall pass to the purchaser notwithstanding that the provisions of this Act have been complied with. The Appellate Division held[3]\nthat the delivery of the clocks at the school was a delivery by the plaintiffs to Grinyer in order that Grinyer in the course of his business might install them in the school, and thus resell and deliver them to the defendants pursuant to his contract already made; also that the agreement to install the clocks was made by Grinyer in the ordinary course of his business as a dealer in electrical supplies, and that in the circumstances the goods were delivered to Grinyer for resale in the course of his business, and were resold by Grinyer to the defendants in the ordinary course of his business, within the meaning of subsec. 4 of sec. 3 of the statute.\nH.W.A. Foster for the appellant, contended (inter alia) that Grinyer was not a \u201ctrader or other person\u201d (\u201cother person\u201d being construed according to the ejusdem generis rule) within the said subsections; that there was no evidence to show that Grinyer or other electrical dealers sold such goods as those in question in the ordinary course of business; he bought the goods in question as contractor; they were special articles which he procured to install under his contract with the defendant; he was dealing with both plaintiff and defendant as a contractor; defendant was not misled by any possession or apparent possession by Grinyer, and the design of the Act was to protect purchasers who acquire property on the faith of possession (referring to Liquid Carbonic Co. Ltd. v. Rountree[4]); that there was not a resale within the meaning of subs. 4, which subsection contemplates a resale subsequent to the delivery to the trader.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and Nicol Jeffrey K.C. for the respondent, were not called on.\nOn the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, and without calling upon counsel for the respondent, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014Notwithstanding the very able presentation of this case by counsel for the appellant, we are all of the opinion that the appeal cannot succeed. To us the reasons given by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Appellate Division, Mr. Justice Ferguson, seem convincing. We are satisfied that there was in this case a sale and a delivery to Grinyer within the meaning of subs. 3, and a resale by him within subs. 4 of s. 3 of the Conditional Sales Act. These subsections apply, with the result that the property in the goods vested in the respondents. The appeal accordingly fails, and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ryckman, Denison, Foster & Cody.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Nicol Jeffrey.\n[1] (1927) 61 Ont.

The point in question was whether the effect of subs. 2 of s. 6 of the said Act was to give to the respondent the lien claimed. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nN.W. Rowell K.C. for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the First Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario.\nIn 1925, the appellant, Keenan Brothers, Limited, a company carrying on business as a dealer in and a manufacturer of lumber, was the owner or licensee of a timber berth, and, in September of that year, made a contract with Alex. King & Son to cut and deliver a certain quantity of this timber. Alex. King & Son subsequently entered into an agreement with the respondent to cut, skid and haul a portion of the wood comprised in their contract. The respondent, not having been paid the full amount of his sub-contract, claims against Alex. King & Son payment of the balance due him, and asserts against the appellant, the owner of the timber, a lien on the wood cut by him. His action is based upon The Woodman\u2019s Lien for Wages Act, R.S.O. 1914, ch. 141, and was tried before Judge Powell of the District Court of Parry Sound. The learned judge found that the respondent\u2019s agreement with Alex. King & Son was to take out 25,000 pieces of timber at $14 per thousand feet for logs 8 inches or over, and 1\u00bd cents per lineal foot for logs 6 inches to 8 inches, and that this agreement was made without the knowledge or consent of Keenan Brothers. He gave the plaintiff judgment against Alex. King & Son for a balance of $2,198.76, and also granted him a lien for this amount upon the logs cut by him, which are the property of Keenan Bros. From this judgment Keenan Bros. alone appealed, and having failed before the Appellate Divisional Court, they now bring the case before this Court, seeking to free their timber from the respondent\u2019s alleged lien.\nThe enactment on which the respondent relies reads as follows:\n6. (1) A person performing labour shall have a lien upon the logs or timber in connection with which the labour is performed for the amount due for such labour, and the same shall have precedence over all other claims or liens thereon, except a claim or lien of the Crown for any dues or charges or which a timber slide company or any owner of a slide or boom may have thereon for tolls.\n(2) A contractor who has entered into any agreement under the terms of which he himself or by others in his employ has cut, removed, taken out or driven logs or timber, shall be deemed to be a person performing labour upon logs or timber within the meaning of this section, and such cutting, removal, taking out and driving shall be deemed to be the performance of labour within the meaning of this section.\nThe contention of the appellant in short is that the respondent is a sub-contractor, and that as such he does not come within the intendment of subs. 2 of s. 6 which is retricted to a \u201ccontractor,\u201d that is to say a person making an agreement to cut timber directly with the owner of the wood.\nThe woodman\u2019s lien in question here is essentially a lien for wages. This is shown by the title of the Act, as well as by subs. 6 of s. 12, which states that the judgment shall declare that \u201cthe same is for wages.\u201d The lien is granted for labour, and \u201clabour\u201d is defined as meaning and including\ncutting, skidding, felling, hauling, scaling, banking, driving, running, rafting or booming any logs or timber, and any work done by cooks, blacksmiths, artisans and others usually employed in connection therewith.\nThen subs. 1 of s. 6 gives to \u201ca person performing labour\u201d a lien \u201cupon the logs or timber in connection with which the labour is performed for the amount due for such labour.\u201d The object of subs. 2 is to extend the meaning of the words \u201cperson performing labour\u201d to \u201ca contractor who has entered into any agreement under the terms of which he himself or by others in his employ has cut, removed, taken out or driven logs or timber.\u201d And \u201csuch cutting, removal, taking out and driving shall be deemed to be the performance of labour.\u201d Except in so far as subs. 2 may contain a definition of the word \u201ccontractor,\u201d that expression is not defined in the Act. The contractor contemplated is a contractor who has entered into any agreement to do this work. An agreement with whom? Obviously with the person for whom the wood is to be cut, that is to say, in my opinion, with the owner of the timber. Thus the firm of Alex. King & Son was a \u201ccontractor\u201d within the meaning of subs. 2, and undoubtedly would have had a lien for anything due it for the work it performed. But it is a totally different proposition to say that the \u201ccontractor\u201d can give a sub-contract, and that the sub-contractor has the same lien as the contractor. Were that the true construction of the subsection, it would follow that, although the owner had paid the contractor, or discharged any lien belonging to him, he would not be secure against a claim made by a sub-contractor. In effect, this is what has been decided in the present case.\nThe history of the statute, I think, shows that subs. 2 cannot be so extended. As first enacted in 1891, by 54 Vict., c. 22, The Woodman\u2019s Lien for Wages Act gave a lien merely for labour performed. In 1896, by 59 Vict., c. 36, s. 4, a provision was added to the Act stating that\nany contractor who has entered into any agreement under the terms of which he has cut, removed, taken out and driven, for any licensee of the Crown, by himself or others in his employ, any logs or timber * * * shall be deemed to be a person performing labour * * *.\nThe agreement mentioned there was obviously an agreement made with the licensee of the Crown, that is to say with the owner of the timber. And although the words I have italicized are no longer in the subsection, I think the agreement must be with the owner of the timber, for it is an agreement entered into by a contractor, and a \u201ccontractor\u201d in matters of this kind, and according to the ordinary meaning of the word, is a person who undertakes work for the owner, any other undertaker who deals solely with the contractor, being a \u201csub-contractor.\u201d\nAs I have already pointed out, the lien granted by this statute\u2014and it is a statute subject to strict construction\u2014is primarily a lien for wages. If the sub-contractor performs himself labour, he has a lien for his wages under subs. 1 of s. 6. But he has not a contractor\u2019s lien. The construction I place on subs. 2 fully protects the owner, for the agreement contemplated by subs. 2 is an agreement made with himself. Were the subsection extended so as to include sub-contracts and sub-contractors, the owner would be at the mercy of his contractor, for no notice of a sub-contract need be given him, nor has he any control over the price stipulated in the sub-contract. And the owner might have fully settled with his contractor only to find out afterwards that there are unpaid sub-contractors he knew nothing of.\nThe present case is an illustration of the danger of the construction which has been upheld in the courts below. The appellant paid Alex. King & Son all it owed them under their agreement, with the exception of $1,782 which the appellant stated it was prepared to pay according to the direction of the court. The learned trial judge maintained the lien for $2,198.76 and the costs, while finding as a fact that the contract between Alex. King & Son and the respondent was made without the knowledge or consent of the appellant. As a consequence, the appellant, to obtain the release of his timber, would have to pay several hundred dollars more than it agreed to pay to its contractor. In my opinion, such a result is not authorized by the statute.\nIt follows that the respondent has not succeeded in bringing himself within the terms of subs. 2 of s. 6, and cannot assert a lien under his sub-contract. In so deciding I would, however, reserve him any right he may have to claim the actual balance due by the appellant to Alex. King & Sons.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the appellate court, and the respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed with costs in so far as the appellant is concerned.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rowell, Reid, Wright & McMillan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.E.

L.R. 494) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendants (by leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1]) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[2], which reversed the judgment of Brown C.J. (rendered upon answers by the jury to certain questions submitted) dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, which was brought, under The Open Wells Act, Sask. (R.S.S., 1920, c. 169, as amended by c. 43 of the Statutes of 1924-1925), for damages for injuries to plaintiff\u2019s horses (while lawfully running at large) through eating grain which had run from a granary on the defendants\u2019 premises. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs. E. M. Hall for the appellants.\nC. E. Gregory K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014On December 28, 1925, the respondent\u2019s horses, while running at large lawfully under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, strayed on lands in Saskatchewan owned by the appellant Babb, of which the appellant Glenn was tenant, and ate a quantity of wheat that had run from a granary on the land, with the result that one died, and others were injured. The grain was stored in a granary attached to a building on the premises, which granary was 6 feet wide, 18 feet long, 6 feet high at the low side and 8 feet high at the high side. It was built on 2 by 6 inch joists, with studding 2 by 4 inches, 3 feet apart, to which was nailed a sheathing of inch tongued and grooved boards 6 inches wide, which, with the roof, enclosed the grain.\nThe respondent claims damages against both appellants by virtue of the Open Wells Act, R.S.S., 1920, c. 169, as amended by c. 43 of the Statutes of 1924-1925, s. 4 of which is as follows:\nNo person shall have or store on his premises or on any premises occupied by him any kind of threshed grain accessible to stock of any other person which may come or stray upon such premises when lawfully running at large.\n\u201cStock,\u201d as defined in the Act, includes horses, as well as other domestic animals.\nThe jury answered questions as follows:\n(1) Were the horses damaged as a result of eating wheat from the granary in question? Answered Yes.\n(2) Was the granary reasonably fit for the purpose of storing said wheat as against animals running at large? Answered Yes.\n(3) Did the horses get the grain because the granary was not reasonably fit for that purpose? Answered No.\nOn these answers the trial judge dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal set this judgment aside, and directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for damages to be assessed with costs in the court below and costs of the appeal. The whole question turns on the construction to be placed on the words \u201caccessible to stock\u201d in the section quoted. In the reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, the opinion is expressed that it would have been a good defence to the action if it had been shown that the grain became accessible to the horses by the act of God or the King\u2019s enemies or by the act of a third party for whom the appellants were not responsible. Respondent\u2019s counsel did not combat this view, which to my mind is correct as far as it goes. The section, then, does not impose a duty absolutely to prevent access under all circumstances, so that the words \u201caccessible to stock\u201d must be read with qualifications. The real meaning to be attached to the words must be arrived at by consideration of the mischief that the statute was intended to remedy and the provisions of the statute as a whole, in addition to the particular language of the section in question. An enactment made it lawful for stock to run at large without the owner being liable for trespass to the owners or occupiers of lands on to which the stock might stray. This made it necessary to impose on owners and occupiers of lands to which the stock might stray the obligation of preventing it from being injured or destroyed by the obvious dangers of open wells or excavations or grain exposed to be eatent to excess. S. 3 of the Act provides that no person shall have on his premises any open well or dangerous excavation \u201caccessible to stock,\u201d and s. 5 provides that, in proceedings to recover any penalty for the violation of any of the provisions of the Act, it shall be a sufficient defence thereto if it be shown that such well, excavation or grain was kept enclosed by a lawful fence as defined by The Stray Animals Act, so that the well, excavation and grain are not to be considered \u201caccessible to stock,\u201d if enclosed by such a fence.\nA lawful fence is defined as a substantial fence, not less than 3\u00bd feet high, of woven wire secured to posts not more than 33 feet apart, or of four barbed wires on such posts fastened to droppers not more than 7\u00bd feet apart, or of three barbed wires on posts not more than 16\u00bd feet apart, or of rails, boards or slabs not less than five in number, the lowest not more than 12 inches from the ground, securely nailed or fastened to posts not more than 16\u00bd feet apart, and of one barbed wire at or near the top. A fence surrounding growing crops or in process of being harvested is to be at least eight feet from the crop, and a fence surrounding stacks of hay or grain is to be at least twenty feet from the stacks.\nNo one would seriously argue that such fences would at all times and under all circumstances keep all stock of the kind defined from access to wells, excavations, hay or grain. At most, such fences would ordinarily prevent such access, and are what the Legislature regarded as reasonably fit for the purpose. This indicates the limited sense in which the words \u201caccessible to stock\u201d are used throughout the statute, and there is no reason, in my opinion, for giving them a wider meaning in s. 4 than elsewhere. It could not have been contemplated by the Legislature that such a fence would be the only protection for threshed grain. In s. 4 there is no particular description of the protection required, beyond the provision that the grain is not to be \u201caccessible to stock\u201d; but under s. 5 it will not be deemed accessible if protected by such a fence, which fence, as I have pointed out, would only be reasonably fit to prevent access.\nIt is, I think, highly unlikely that the Legislature intended to impose on the storer of grain in the ordinary way in a closed building or granary the obligation to insure other people\u2019s stock against access to it under all circumstances except where same should arise from the act of God, the King\u2019s enemies or of third persons, and at the same time intended to exempt him from liability if his grain were stored in the open, protected only by a fence such as described.\nReading the statute as a whole, I am of opinion that it is clearly indicated that the phrase \u201caccessible to stock\u201d in s. 4, has a qualified meaning, and calls for only such reasonable protection against access by stock to stored grain as men of ordinary sense would judge to be reasonably fit to prevent access to it by stock. In this I am in accord with the views expressed by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury and expressed by Mr. Justice Elwood in Hill v. M attach[3], cited in the appellant\u2019s factum. The respondent urges us to hold that the jury was unreasonable in finding, in answer to the second question, that the granary was fit, and points out that the learned trial judge has intimated that he would probably have come to a different conclusion. The plaintiff endeavoured to prove that the granary was old, rotted and unfit. The defendant offered evidence that he had had it repaired by two men immediately before placing the grain in it, and these men swore that they had put it in good repair and that it was fit. There was also evidence offered that the boards had been battered by the horses\u2019 hoofs. On this contradictory evidence, the jury has made a finding that the granary was reasonably fit for the purpose of storing wheat as against animals running at large, and it is clear that this Court would not be warranted in reversing this finding. There is no finding as to the precise cause of the horses obtaining access to the grain. There was no evidence as to holes having been eaten in the boards by vermin. The finding that the granary was reasonably fit negatives the suggestion that the pressure of the grain sprung the boards. In view of the evidence as to hoof marks on the boards, it seems probable that the jury concluded that the horses knocked the boards off with their hoofs, and that, having regard to the condition of the granary and the way in which the boards were nailed on, they would not ordinarily be knocked off in that way. With great deference I am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs of this appeal and of the appeal below, and that the judgment at the trial should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hearn & Hall.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

The mortgage was declared to be made in pursuance of The Short Forms of Mortgages Act (Ont.); the mortgagors covenanted that in default the mortgagee should have quiet possession; the mortgage provided that \u201cthe said mortgagee, on default of payment for one month, may, on one month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the said lands,\u201d that \u201cin default of the payment of the interest hereby secured, the principal hereby secured shall become payable,\u201d and that \u201cuntil default of payment the mortgagors shall have quiet possession of the said lands.\u201d The only payment made was of $156 principal and $1.57 interest, on October 3, 1914, and there was no subsequent acknowledgment in any way of the mortgagee\u2019s right or title. The mortgagee never gave notice of entry, or took proceedings to exercise its remedies under the mortgage, or had actual possession or occupation. The question arose, in a proceeding, instituted April 23, 1926, under The Vendors and Purchasers Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 122), whether the mortgage was barred by The Limitations Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 75).\nHeld: Although the evidence seemed insufficient to establish continuous actual possession by the mortgagors or their successors in title, they always retained constructive possession, of the land, and the mortgagee\u2019s right of entry and right to recover out of the land was effectually barred by ss. 5 and 24 of The Limitations Act, unless the application of those sections was precluded by the Ontario \u201cMoratorium Acts.\u201d Their application was not so precluded; s. 2 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1920, (c. 38), invoked by the mortgagee, by its terms applied only to a mortgage to which ss. 2 and 3 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915, applied; and, by reason of s. 4 (3) of said Act of 1915, ss. 2 and 3 of that Act never applied to the mortgage in question. The mortgage, therefore, had ceased to bind the land.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (60 Ont. L.R. 543) affirmed. Mignault and Newcombe JJ. dissented, holding that s. 4 (3) of the Act of 1915 regulated the remedies for the recovery of interest, and did not interfere with the condition for recovery of principal provided by s. 2 of that Act; that the procedure for the recovery of the principal of the mortgage was governed by s. 2, which always applied; hence, s. 2 of the Act of 1920 applied, and it had the effect of postponing payments of principal in respect of which the mortgagors were in default to the date therein prescribed, which became the time when the period of limitation for recovery of the principal began to run; and hence the mortgagee\u2019s remedies were not barred.\nAPPEAL (by leave of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing the appeal by the present appellant from the judgment of Wright J.1 dismissing its appeal from the report of His Honour, E.J. Hearn, Local Judge at Kitchener, Ontario, to whom a motion of the respondent Shantz, instituted by notice dated April 23, 1926, under The Vendors and Purchasers Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 122, had been referred for enquiry and report by order of Fisher J., the said report being to the effect that the objection of the respondent Hallman (purchaser) that a certain mortgage dated 18th December, 1913, registered 12th January, 1914, made by Allan Grauel and E.R. Riener to the present appellant, had not been discharged, had been satisfactorily answered by the respondent Shantz (vendor), and that the said mortgage did not constitute a valid objection to the title, and that a good title had been shown in accordance with the contract of sale between the respondents Shantz and Hallman to certain lands.\nThe question for decision was whether the said mortgage was barred by The Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 75.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, particularly in the judgment of Newcombe J. (dissenting). The appeal was dismissed with costs, Mignault and Newcombe JJ. dissenting.\nW.H. Bouck for the appellant.\nG. Grant K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ.) was delivered by ANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014In a proceeding under The Vendors and Purchasers Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 122), the Appellate Divisional Court, affirming the judgment of Wright J., held a mortgage of the appellant barred by The Limitations Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 75, s. 24)[2]. The material facts sufficiently appear in the judgments below and in the opinion of my brother Newcombe, which I have had the advantage of reading. I concur in his statement that it is not intended to express any view as to the regularity of the proceedings in the courts of Ontario.\nTwo grounds of appeal were urged at bar: (a) that the evidence of actual possession by the mortgagors and their successors, relied on by the Divisional Court, is insufficient, and that, upon the whole case, it should be held that the mortgagee was in constructive possession of the mortgaged property before the statutory period of limitation had expired owing to the mortgagor\u2019s default in payment; (b) that the so-called Moratorium Act of 1920 (10-11 Geo. V, c. 38, s. 2) precluded the application of The Limitations Act to the mortgage in question.\n(a) While inclined to agree with the appellant that the evidence adduced for that purpose was insufficient to establish continuous actual possession by the mortgagors and their successors in title, we are of opinion that they always retained constructive possession of the mortgaged property. The mortgage was made under The Short Forms of Mortgages Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 117) and expressly provided that \u201cuntil default of payment the mortgagors (should) have quiet possession of the said lands,\u201d i.e., should retain possession; and the mortgagors covenanted \u201cthat in default the mortgagee (should) have quiet possession of the said lands.\u201d Interest and an instalment of principal were overdue and unpaid on the mortgage from the 18th of June, 1914. Under the last mentioned covenant the mortgagee was at any time after that date entitled \u201cpeacefully and quietly to enter into, have, hold, use, occupy, possess and enjoy the aforesaid lands, etc.\u201d; but there is no evidence that the mortgagee ever exercised its right of entry; on the contrary, it seems certain that it never took any steps in that direction, with the result that the possession of the mortgagors, actual or constructive, continued undisturbed. There never was, subsequent to the 3rd of October, 1914, any acknowledgment by the mortgagors or their successors in title, by payment on account or otherwise, of the mortgagee\u2019s right or title. It follows that the right of entry of the mortgagee and its right to recover the mortgage money out of the land was effectually barred by sections 5 and 24 of The Limitations Act, unless their application is precluded by the Moratorium Acts.\n(b) The application of s. 2 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1920, (c. 38), invoked by the appellant, is by its terms restricted to \u201ca mortgage * * * of real property to which sections 2 and 3 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915, apply.\u201d The first question for determination, therefore, is whether these latter sections apply to the mortgage now before us. Interest was and continued unpaid on this mortgage from the 18th of June, 1914. Subsection 3 of section 4 of the Act of 1915 (c. 22) reads as follows:\n(3) Where default is made in payment of interest, rent, taxes, insurance or other disbursements which the mortgagor or purchaser has covenanted or undertaken to pay, the mortgagee or vendor, his assignee, or personal representative shall have the same remedies, and may exercise them to the same extent, and the consequences of such default shall in all respects be the same as if this Act had not been passed, but where such interest, rent, taxes or other disbursements are paid into court or tendered to the mortgagee, vendor, assignee or personal representative he shall not continue any proceedings already commenced by him without the order required by section 2 or by section 3, as the case may be.\nThe interest so in arrears was never paid into court nor tendered to the mortgagee. Consequently, in the terms of subs. 3 of s. 4, the mortgagee might from the 18th of June, 1914, have had the same remedies and might have exercised them to the same extent and the consequences of the default were \u201cthe same as if this Act (inclusive of sections 2 and 3) had not been passed.\u201d\nIt follows that to the mortgage now before us sections 2 and 3 of the statute of 1915 never were applicable; the default in payment of interest, already existing when that statute was enacted, never having been put an end to. The case at bar accordingly is excluded from the provisions of s. 2 of the Act of 1920 by its terms.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Mignault and Newcombe JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The questions arise under The Vendors and Purchasers Act of Ontario, R.S.O., 1914, c. 122, upon an objection stated by the purchaser, Hallman, who had contracted with the vendor, Shantz, for the purchase of some lots of land at Queen\u2019s Park, Kitchener, or Berlin, as it was; he objected that a certain mortgage, dated 18th December, 1913, registered 12th January, 1914, made by Allan Grauel and Edward R. Riener to the Modern Realty Company Limited, had not been discharged. The vendor applied for an order declaring that the objection had been satisfactorily answered, and he notified both the purchaser and the Realty Company. The application was heard before Fisher J., who referred the case for inquiry and report to Local Judge Hearn at Kitchener, and, upon the hearing before him, the Realty Company appeared and assumed the carriage of the proceedings in support of the objection. Subsequently a question was raised as to the regularity of this procedure and as to the right of the company to be heard, but none of the parties was desirous of discussing that question, and throughout the case it has not been considered. I mention the point merely to say that it is not one of the questions which comes under consideration upon this appeal, and that it is not the intention of the court to express any opinion about it.\nI shall state the facts very briefly.\nBy deed of 20th March, 1913, Henry M. Schneider conveyed to Allan Grauel and Edward R. Riener a farm consisting of about 125 acres, comprised in which were the lots now in question, and by deed dated four days later, the grantees mortgaged the farm to Schneider to secure the payment of $15,000, part of the purchase money. This mortgage passed through several assignments and was ultimately discharged. The Schneider mortgage is not produced; it is assumed throughout the case that it was a legal mortgage. It was discharged as to lot 435 on 26th September, 1914, but otherwise not until 22nd October, 1924. It is stated in the referee\u2019s report that there had been default in payment of this mortgage \u201cdown through the years from 1913-24,\u201d but I do not see the evidence of this in the record. Grauel and Riener\u2019s object in purchasing the property was to resell it in building lots, and, shortly after purchasing, they caused a survey to be made which appears by a plan showing the streets and layout of the building lots\u2014more than 600 in all. The plan bears the official number 230, and was dated 11th June, 1913, and registered on 3rd July following. The lots were offered for sale and a number of them were sold. There were some transactions with the Modern Realty Company Limited with regard to which difficulties arose; these seem to have been settled between the vendors and the company, with the result, as far as material to the case, that by deed of 18th December, 1913, Grauel and Riener conveyed by way of mortgage to the company six of the lots, nos. 3, 5, and 7 on Queen\u2019s Boulevard, and nos. 431, 432 and 435 on Crescent Road, all in the northern part of the property surveyed, which had received the name of Queen\u2019s Park. The consideration of the mortgage was expressed to be the sum of $1,565, to be paid with interest at 6 per cent., $500 in six months, $500 in nine months and $565 in one year from the date of the mortgage.\nThe said payments of principal to be made on the 18th days of June, September and December in the year 1914, together with interest at the rate aforesaid and taxes and performance of statute labour.\nThe mortgage is declared to be made in pursuance of The Short Forms of Mortgages Act. The mortgagors covenanted to pay the principal and interest; that they had good title and right to convey, and that in default the mortgagee should have quiet possession. There were also the following provisions:\nProvided that the said mortgagee on default of payment for one month, may, on one month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the said lands\n* * * * *\nProvided that in default of the payment of the interest hereby secured the principal hereby secured shall become payable.\nProvided that until default of payment the mortgagors shall have quiet possession of the said lands.\nThe mortgagors, on 3rd October, 1914, paid on account of the mortgage debt to the Realty Company $156, principal, and $1.57, interest. These are the only payments. The mortgagors were therefore in default as to payment of principal and interest after 18th June, 1914. They did not pay the $500, principal stipulated for payment on that day; neither did they pay the interest which fell due at the same time, and so, according to the provisions of the mortgage, the whole principal thereby secured then became payable. The mortgagee never had actual possession or occupation, but alleged that the possession was vacant, and therefore that, after default, it had the right to possession. The local judge found that there had been no abandonment of possession by the mortgagors, or their assigns, at any time; and, in the reasons for his report,\nthat their possession has been open, notorious, absolute and continuous all through the years since default was made in the mortgage and that there was never any intention on their part to abandon possession of any of these lots and in addition to that the paper title as registered has been continuous in the mortgagors and their successors by successive conveyances. Streets in front of these lots were made, sidewalks built, stakes put in and replaced, hay and weeds cut on the lots, the lots advertised for sale, earth from the St. Mary\u2019s Hospital excavation placed in at least three of these lots to improve them, and although these lots have not been fenced that was because they were a part of a large subdivision which is entirely without fences.\nHe accordingly found that the mortgage had ceased to bind the lands and did not constitute an encumbrance or cloud upon the title.\nThere was an appeal to Wright J.[3], who considered that the evidence of possession was not conclusive, although he could not say that the local judge was wrong in his findings. He held that, inasmuch as the legal mortgage, that of Schneider, was not discharged until 22nd October, 1924, and, as the Realty Company therefore did not, in his view, acquire the legal estate in the lots embraced in its mortgage, nor the right of possession, there was nothing to prevent the operation of the Statute of Limitations.\nThere was a further appeal to the Appellate Division3. The case was heard by the learned Chief Justice, Magee, Hodgins, Ferguson and Smith, JJ.A. The Court, while rejecting some of the evidence upon which the local judge relied, nevertheless found sufficient proof of possession by the mortgagors or their assigns to uphold his findings. Ferguson, J.A., dissented; he considered that the company was legally entitled to the possession, and was therefore constructively in possession; that there was no sufficient evidence of actual possession by the mortgagors or their assigns, and that the right of foreclosure was not barred. If it were not for the statutes which I shall now consider, I would not, for reasons which I shall have occasion to indicate, differ from the result reached by the majority of the Court; but, in my opinion, the judgments do not give due effect to c. 38 of 1920, the Act providing for the termination of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915, c. 22 of 1915.\nThe Act of 1915 was a provincial war measure; it was assented to on 8th April, 1915, although directed to take effect as from 4th August, 1914, and it was thereby enacted, among other provisions (s. 2, subs. 1) that, except by leave of a judge,\nNo person shall\n(a) take or continue proceedings by way of foreclosure or sale or otherwise, * * * for the recovery of principal money secured by any mortgage of land or any interest therein made or executed prior to the fourth day of August, 1914;\n(b) take or continue any proceedings under any power of sale, or levy any distress, or take, resume or enter into possession of any land or interest therein for the recovery of principal money under any power contained in a mortgage of land, or of any interest therein, executed prior to the fourth day of August, 1914.\nIt was, however, enacted by s. 4, subs. 1, of the Act of 1915, that, subject to the provisions thereinafter contained, s. 2 should not apply to any mortgage or extension or renewal, thereof made or entered into after 4th August, 1914, nor to proceedings taken for the recovery of interest or rent or taxes or insurance or other disbursements for which the mortgagor was liable in the first instance, and as to which he was in default, \u201cnor to any proceedings or act done by a mortgagee in possession on the 4th day of August, 1914, with respect to the land or interest in land of which he is the mortgagee.\u201d Now, the mortgage to the Realty Company was made previously to 4th August, 1914, and there were no proceedings for the recovery of interest or rent, taxes, insurance or other disbursements for which the mortgagors were liable in the first instance, and as to which they were in default, and unless, therefore, it be found that the Realty Company was mortgagee in possession on 4th August, 1914, s. 2 of the Act of 1915 would apply to its mortgage, and, if s. 2 be applicable, the mortgage would be regulated by The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1920, c. 38 of 1920, to which I shall presently refer. Upon this point I have no doubt. The company admittedly never entered upon nor occupied nor had any actual possession of the mortgaged premises, and, even if the mortgagors were not in possession during their default, the legal fiction by which the possession of vacant land is attributed to the legal owner does not operate to confer upon the mortgagee the rights, nor to subject it to the obligations, of a mortgagee in possession. A mortgagee is not by law compelled to take possession; he must assume the management of the estate; Noyes v. Pollock[4]. It was stipulated by the mortgage, as I have already pointed out, that until default of payment, the mortgagors should have quiet possession of the lands, and it was expressly provided that the mortgagee on default of payment for one month, might, on one month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the lands. No such notice was given. Whatever may be said as to the quality or sufficiency of the possession of the mortgagors and their assigns, whether adverse or not, they would appear, after the execution of the mortgage, to have continued in such possession of the whole property, including the lots in question, as it was capable of, or as it might reasonably have been anticipated that the proprietor would exercise, having regard to the purpose for which the land had been laid out, and to which it was devoted, and it was of the nature of the transaction that the mortgagors should remain in possession as they did. Bagnall v. Villar[5]; Heath v. Pugh[6], affirmed, sub. nom. Pugh v. Heath[7];\nThe law on the subject is clear. The possession of the mortgagor is a lawful possession, and he is entitled to remain in possession until ordered to deliver up possession or until possession is demanded by or on behalf of the mortgagee; and it is also clear that a mortgagee cannot obtain an account of back rents due from the mortgagor in respect of his possession.\nper Chitty J. in Yorkshire Banking Co. v. Mullan[8]. Therefore I am satisfied that the Realty Company was never a mortgagee in possession within the meaning of the statutory exception, and that it never, by any act or proceeding, assumed that relationship to the mortgage premises by which it became the holder of them in pledge subject to account and to the infirmities of a mortgagee\u2019s title. Hence it follows that the Realty Company\u2019s mortgage is not excepted from the application of s. 2 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915.\nIt was expressly provided by subs. 1 of s. 4 that ss. 2 and 3 should not apply to proceedings taken for the recovery of interest, and subs. 3 provided that:\nWhere default is made in payment of interest, rent, taxes, insurance or other disbursements which the mortgagor or purchaser has covenanted or undertaken to pay, the mortgagee or vendor, his assignee, or personal representative shall have the same remedies, and may exercise them to the same extent, and the consequences of such default shall in all respects be the same as if this Act had not been passed, but where such interest, rent, taxes or other disbursements are paid into court or tendered to the mortgagee, vendor, assignee or personal representative he shall not continue any proceedings already commenced by him without the order required by section 2 or by section 3, as the case may be.\nThis subsection regulates the remedies for the recovery of the interest, which had, by the earlier provision of the same section, been expressly excepted from the application of ss. 2 and 3. The Realty Company\u2019s mortgage was, as I have already said, in default for principal before the Act of 1915 was enacted, or became applicable, and the procedure for recovery of the principal was subject to s. 2 of that Act. It was, as stipulated by the mortgage, a consequence of default in payment of interest that the principal became payable, but the procedure for the recovery of principal was still governed by s. 2, and, in my view, that section always applied.\nBy s. 14 the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered at any time to determine the operation of the Act, or to provide by Order in Council that it should have such limited effect as might be declared, but, subject to the operation of the Order in Council, that the Act should have effect during the continuance of the war, and for a period of nine months thereafter, unless \u201cin the meantime\u201d a session of the Legislature were held, in which case the Act should cease to have effect at the expiry of thirty days after the close of the session.\nThe Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1920, assented to 4th June, 1920, provides as follows:\n2. Where under the terms of a mortgage or agreement for sale of real property to which sections 2 and 3 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915, apply, any payment of principal money under a mortgage or of the purchase money under an agreement of sale is overdue on the 1st day of October, 1920, such payment shall be deemed to fall due and be payable on the day upon which the next instalment of interest will be payable after the said date, or on the 1st day of January, 1921, whichever shall be the earlier date, but this shall not apply to or affect any order heretofore made by the court under the provisions of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915, and amendments thereto so as to extend or reduce the period fixed by such order for the making of any payment upon any such mortgage or agreement of sale.\n3. Subject to the provisions of section 2 and notwithstanding anything contained in section 14 of The Mortgagors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Relief Act, 1915, or any Act heretofore passed extending the operation of the said Act, all the other provisions of the said Act shall continue in force and have effect until the 1st day of October, 1920, and from and after the said date the said Act shall be deemed to be repealed.\nNow, there is no doubt that on 1st October, 1920, the mortgage of the Modern Realty Company constituted a valid charge upon the lots in question, and was overdue, both as to principal and interest, and, therefore, by the express words of the Act of 1920, the principal must be deemed to have fallen due and become payable on the day upon which the next instalment of interest was payable after that date, or on 1st January, 1921, whichever date were the earlier. The effect is to provide a statutory rule for the interpretation of the mortgage, so that, after that rule came into effect, on 4th June, 1920, payments of principal in respect of which the mortgagors were in default were postponed to the prescribed date, which became, by legislative effect, the time when the period of limitation for recovery of the principal money began to run against the mortgagee.\nThe interpretation is attended with some difficulty, for the mortgage had, according to its provisions, all along been overdue, but I think the enactment must have been based upon the view that the Act of 1915 stayed the operation of the Statute of Limitations as to the principal, and that it was necessary or desirable, by the Act of 1920, to provide a fresh starting point. We know that, when a legislature resorts to a method of expression whereby that is declared to be the fact which is not so, it is the duty of the court to ascertain the purpose of the enactment and the persons who are meant to be concluded. Ex parte Walton[9]; Hill v. East & West India Dock Co.[10]; De Vesci v. O\u2019Connell[11]. Here the purpose of the Act of 1915 was a temporary measure for the accommodation of the mortgagor, and to ensure that he should not, except subject to the provisions of the Act, be deprived of his possession, for non\u2011ayment of principal, by the exercise of the ordinary remedies of the mortgagee, if, in the opinion of the judge, time should be given by reason of circumstances attributable directly or indirectly to the war. The judge was given absolute discretion to refuse the exercise of any right or remedy, to stay execution, or to postpone any forfeiture, or to extend the time (s. 5, subs. 1, c. 22 of 1915), and the procedure, of course, involved an interference with the liberty of the mortgagee at its own volition to take proceedings for the enforcement of its security, or for obtaining possession of the mortgaged premises for default in payment of principal. In these circumstances it would be manifestly unjust that the mortgagee should, during the interval, and on account of this temporary war measure, be prejudiced by the Statute of Limitations. Consideration was not explicitly given by the Act of 1915 to the relief or protection of the mortgagee, but that seems naturally to have become a subject of attention when the Act of 1920, terminating the special and exceptional provisions of the Act of 1915, was enacted, and therefore it was that, as to overdue mortgages, a date for the payment of the principal money was substituted by the legislature for the date which had been stipulated by the mortgage. Some such provision as this seems to have been thought necessary to meet the justice of the case, and it is not difficult here to see the truth of the maxim in fictione aequitas. However that may be, I do not see how the mortgagee\u2019s right to foreclose can be barred by the Statute of Limitations in this case, when the principal of the mortgage is legally deemed to have fallen due and become payable not earlier than 1st October, 1920.\nIn the courts below the learned judges relied on subs. 3 of s. 4 of the Act of 1915, but that subsection did not interfere with the condition for recovery of principal provided by s. 2 of that Act. The mortgage company did not exercise its remedies respecting the interest while the subsection was in force, and the Act of 1915 has now given place to the Act of 1920, passed while the mortgage was a subsisting security, which declares definitely the date when the principal should be deemed to fall due and be payable, and thus serves to establish the time from which the Statute of Limitations began to run.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the judgment should be reversed, and the objection raised by the purchaser and maintained by the mortgagee should be upheld as valid.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Waldron & Bouck.\nSolicitors for the respondent Shantz: Scellen & Weir.\nSolicitors for the respondent Hallman: Sims, Bray, McIntosh & Schofield.\n[1] (1927) 60 Ont.

H. (appellant), desiring to pay off a debt of $40,000, asked M. (respondent) for a loan of that sum on the security of 1,600 shares in an oil company. M. refused, but negotiations resulted in M. paying the $40,000, taking a transfer from H. of the shares, and giving an option to H. to re-purchase them within one year for $51,280. This sum had been arrived at by including the said sum of $40,000, the sum of $6,000, being the cash payment on a house which M. had stipulated that H. should buy from him, and interest for one year on $40,000 at 12% and on $6,000 at 8%. The option to re-purchase was in writing, and recited that M. had purchased from H. and was now the holder of 1,600 shares in the oil company, and had agreed to give an option for re-purchase for the price and on the terms thereinafter set forth, and it provided that M. \"in consideration of the sale of the said shares by [H.] to [M.], and other good and valuable considerations him thereunto moving, doth hereby give and grant unto [H.] an opinion, irrevocable within the time for acceptance herein limited, to purchase,\" etc.; that M. should deposit the share certificates in a certain bank, and they should be left there so long as the option was open for acceptance; that H. might at any time within the year purchase blocks of not less than 100 shares upon paying $100 for each share so purchased, and receive a transfer thereof, all sums so paid to be deducted from the total purchase price. Before the expiry of the year H. paid the re-purchase price and received a re-transfer of the shares, but in the meantime a dividend had been declared by the oil company, and the question in dispute was as to who was entitled to it. The parties had apparently not contemplated the possibility of the payment of a dividend during the option period, and had not alluded to it in their negotiations or agreement. H. sued to recover it.\nHeld, (a) that the transaction intended by the parties was in reality a sale with an option to re-purchase, and not a loan or mortgage; having regard to the form in which it was deliberately put, it would require most convincing evidence to justify a contrary conclusion; and the evidence in fact tended strongly to support the view that the form of the transaction represented its real nature; (b) that the evidence of the surrounding circumstances and of the negotiations which resulted in the option being given did not warrant the implication of a provision entitling H. to interim dividends; there may be cases in which a court can say that it is inconceivable that, had the parties adverted to the subject, they would not have agreed to the stipulation contended for, and would then imply it; but this was very far from being such a case. M. was entitled to the dividend as incidental to his ownership of the shares at the date specified in the declaration of dividend, and no right to recover it from him, cognizable in a court of law and equity, had been shewn. In the view taken by the court on the evidence, it was unnecessary to decide as to the objection made by M. to the admissibility of the parol evidence relied on by H. The general rules as to admissibility, and the required strength, of extrinsic evidence to shew the alleged real nature of the transaction in such cases are discussed by Duff J.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (23 Alta. L.R. 34) affirming, on equal division of the court, judgment of Ford J. (ibid), affirmed.\nSmith J., dissenting, held that, as the written document did not, nor purported to, contain the whole bargain, parol evidence was admissible to shew what the complete bargain was, and the written document must be construed in the light of it; while not finding that the transaction was intended merely as a loan, he held that the terms of the agreement imported that any incidental advantages accruing to the ownership of the shares during the option period should go with the shares to the party who might ultimately become the absolute owner under the terms of the bargain; and H. was therefore entitled to the dividend. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] affirming, on equal division of the court, the judgment of Ford J. [2]dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe plaintiff was the beneficial owner of 1,600 shares of the stock of the Royalite Oil Company, Limited, which he had assigned to the Royal Bank of Canada as collateral security for an indebtedness of $40,000. Desiring to obtain money to pay off the bank, he approached the defendant Mayland, through one Robinson, asking for a loan on the security of the shares. Mayland refused this, but, after some negotiations, the parties entered into an arrangement by which Mayland paid the sum of $40,000 and took from the plaintiff a transfer of the shares to him, and, by agreement under seal executed by both parties, gave to the plaintiff an option for the re-purchase of the shares within one year for $51,280. As a condition of the arrangement, Mayland had required that the plaintiff should purchase from him a certain house property at the price of $11,500, of which $5,500 should stand secured by a mortgage on that property. The said sum of $51,280 had been arrived at by including the said sum of $40,000, the sum of $6,000 as the cash payment on the house property, and interest for one year on $40,000 at 12% and on $6,000 at 8%.\nThe said agreement giving the option to re-purchase recited that Mayland had purchased from the plaintiff and was now the holder of 1,600 shares in the capital of the oil company, and had agreed to give an option for re-purchase for the price and on the terms thereinafter set forth, and it provided that Mayland \"in consideration of the sale of the said shares by [the plaintiff] to [Mayland,] and other good and valuable considerations him thereunto moving, doth hereby give and grant unto [the plaintiff] an option, irrevocable within the time for acceptance herein limited, to purchase,\" etc.; that Mayland should deposit the certificate or certificates for the shares with the Stockyards Branch of the Bank of Montreal in the city of Calgary, and that they should be left there so long as the option was open for acceptance; that the plaintiff might at any time within the year purchase blocks of not less than 100 shares upon paying $100 for each share so purchased, and receive a transfer thereof, all sums so paid to be deducted from the purchase price payable under the option.\nThe option period expired on November 12, 1926. Before that time, on November 5, 1926, the plaintiff paid the repurchase price and received from Mayland a transfer of the shares. But in the meantime, on October 27, 1926, the Royalite Oil Company, Limited, declared a dividend of $2.50 a share, payable on November 25, 1926, to shareholders of record on November 1, 1926.\nThe question in dispute was as to who was entitled to this dividend. In entering into the arrangement no allusion was made to the question of the right to dividends, and it would appear that neither party contemplated the likelihood of any dividend being declared during the life of the option. The plaintiff sued, asking for an injunction restraining the company from paying the dividend to Mayland and restraining Mayland from receiving it, and for an order directing its payment to him, and, in the alternative, judgment against Mayland for the amount thereof. The grounds of the plaintiff's claim are set out in the judgment of Anglin C.J.C. now reported. Ford J. gave judgment dismissing the action [3] which was affirmed, on equal division of the court, by the Appellate Division[4], and the plaintiff appealed to this Court. The appeal was dismissed with costs, Smith J. dissenting.\nE. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. and H. G. Nolan for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe and Rinfret JJ., was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014Herron, the plaintiff (appellant), being indebted to a bank in the sum of $40,000, for which he had assigned 1,600 shares of the capital stock of the Royalite Oil Company as collateral security, desired to obtain money to pay off the bank. He accordingly approached the de- fendant Mayland, through one Robinson, asking a loan on the security of the Royalite shares. Mayland refused to entertain the idea of a loan, but he suggested his willingness to purchase the shares and to give the plaintiff an option to buy them back within a year if the latter would also purchase from him a house at the price of $11,500. An agreement was eventually arrived at by which Mayland paid $46,000 and conveyed the house to Herron, taking from him a mortgage on the house for $5,500, bearing interest at 8%, and a transfer of the 1,600 shares of Royalite stock. Mayland then gave back to Herron an option to repurchase the Royalite shares for $51,280 at any time before the 12th of November, 1926. The document embodying this option bears date the 12th of November, 1925, and was prepared by the late Mr. Savary, Herron's solicitor, pursuant to his client's instructions. It was partly read over by Herron and was read in its entirety and explained to both Herron and Mayland before its execution by Mr. Bennett, Mayland's solicitor. In this document Mayland undertoook to hold the Royalite shares on deposit in his bank pending the option. The optionee stipulated for the right to make interim payments for not less than 100 shares at a time. Provision was also made for his exercise of the option to repurchase by mailing to a stated address a registered letter containing a marked cheque for the amount of the re-purchase price unpaid.\nHerron states that the terms of this instrument were those on which he understood Mayland to insist; and there is no suggestion of any misapprehension of them on his part or of any mistake in their expression. Upon the execution of the option agreement the shares were transferred by Herron to Mayland who had them registered in the books of the company in his own name.\nNo allusion was made, either in the option itself or in the discussions, to any dividend which might be declared upon the stock, and, none having been theretofore declared, it would appear that neither party contemplated the likelihood of any such dividend becoming payable during the currency of the option. A dividend was, however, declared in October, 1926, payable, on the 1st of November, 1926, to the then registered holders of Royalite Oil Company shares. The dividend on the 1,600 shares held by Mayland amounted to $4,000. Learning of this, Herron desired to exercise his option to repurchase before the 1st of November, but, Mayland being out of town, he was unable to procure the money required because the shares standing in Mayland's name could not be assigned or handed over to the bank which had agreed to advance him $50,000 upon them. After Maryland's return to Calgary Herron saw him on the 3rd of November and suggested a renewal or extension of \"the loan\" and also applied for an order to enable him to collect the $4,000 dividend. Mayland refused to consider this proposition; and Herron, exercising the option, paid Mayland in full on the 5th of November and got back the shares.\nShortly afterwards he brought this action, demanding payment by Mayland to him of the $4,000 of dividends which the latter had collected. He put his claim alternatively on these two grounds: (a) The transfer, though in form one of sale and purchase with an option to repurchase, was in reality a loan, the shares being pledged as security for the repayment of the principal and interest, computed at $51,280, on payment of which sum the borrower would be entitled to the re-transfer of the security with all incidental accretions or advantages, the pledgee's rights being strictly confined to the receipt of his principal and interest, and costs, if any. (b) If the transfer cannot be so regarded, it should be deemed to be an implied term of the agreement between the parties that Herron on exercising his option to repurchase would be entitled to any interim dividends declared upon the shares while under option.\nThe learned trial judge (Ford J.), dismissed the action, holding that the transaction intended by the parties was in reality a sale with an option to repurchase and was not a loan, pledge or mortgage, and that the evidence of the surrounding circumstances and of the negotiations which resulted in the option being given did not warrant the implication of the provision entitling him to interim dividends asserted by the plaintiff.\nOn appeal this judgment was affirmed by a divided court. Harvey, C.J.A., with whom Hyndman, J.A., concurred, agreed with the learned trial judge; while Beck, J.A., would have upheld the plaintiff's claim on both grounds and Clarke, J.A., without passing upon the first ground of the claim, accepted the plaintiff's alternative contention that the evidence warranted the implication of a term or provision that interim dividends should belong to him.\nAt bar counsel for the respondent strenuously combatted the admissibility of the parol evidence relied on by the plaintiff. While entertaining little or no doubt upon this question, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the evidence so objected to was in whole or in part improperly received. Assuming its admissibility, a careful study of it has not disclosed such manifest error in the judgment of the learned trial judge (affirmed on appeal), disposing of what is undoubtedly a question of fact, that we would be justified in setting it aside. On the contrary, we think the learned judge's conclusions as to both branches of the plaintiff's case is supported by the facts disclosed before him.\nAs to the claim that, notwithstanding the inconsistency of the form in which it was deliberately put, the transaction was in reality one of loan or mortgage, it would require most convincing evidence to justify such a conclusion. The uncontradicted testimony that the defendant refused to entertain the idea of making a loan to the plaintiff, and the latter's admissions, that the defendant insisted on the transaction being treated as one of sale and purchase with an option to repurchase and that the document was drawn on the plaintiff's own instructions to evidence a transaction of the latter character, in our opinion preclude any possibility of our holding that the parties in fact intended something so essentially different from what they expressed in a writing the purport of which the plaintiff fully understood.\nAs to the implication of the term which the plaintiff alternatively suggests in regard to the admittedly un-thought of interim dividends, there may be cases in which a court can say that it is inconceivable that, had the parties adverted to the subject, they would not have agreed to the stipulation contended for, and would then imply it. But this is very far indeed from being such a case. We may be satisfied that, had he thought of it at all, the plaintiff would have sought the insertion of such a term\u2014it may even be that, had the defendant declined to assent to its inclusion, the plaintiff would have refused to go on with the transaction; but that the defendant would have agreed to such a provision it is clearly impossible to predicate. Nor can it be said that it is so improbable that the defendant would have insisted upon having the right to appropriate to himself the interim dividends, as incidental to his ownership of the shares, that it should be presumed that, had this particular matter been brought to his attention, he must have acceded to the plaintiff's wishes in regard to it. Unless prepared to take that view we cannot give effect to the alternative ground upon which the plaintiff seeks relief.\nThe obligation of the Royalite Oil Company to pay the dividend in question to the defendant as the registered holder of the shares on the 1st of November, 1926, is unquestionable. Having received the dividend from that company he is entitled to retain it unless a right to recover it from him, cognisable in a court of law and equity, has been shewn. That he has that right the plaintiff, in our opinion, has failed to establish.\nThe appeal accordingly fails and will be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal, and only desire to add a word as to the point made by counsel for the respondent, touching the admissibility of the parol evidence.\nThe rule is well established. The principle upon which it rests is stated by that eminent judge, Turner L.J., in Lincoln v. Wright[5]. Where the real agreement is that the transaction shall be a mortgage transaction, \"it is, in the eye of this Court, a fraud to insist on the conveyance as being absolute, and parol evidence must be admissible to prove the fraud.\" Such being the principle, the rule excluding extrinsic parol evidence offered to contradict, qualify or supplement a document which the parties have made the record of their transaction, was, in Equity, displaced, in cases in which the principle came into play; and since the Judicature Act, this rule in Equity is, of course, the rule in all the courts. On the other hand, it is quite open to two parties of competent years and under- standing, to enter into an agreement for the sale by one to the other of a property, and for the re-purchase within a given nominated period, of the same property at the same price, with or without interest, at the option of the seller. The law recognizes such dealings, and gives effect to them according to their terms, where that is the true description of the dealing into which the parties have deliberately entered. Williams v. Owen[6]. And where, in the documents they have executed, the parties have clearly explained that such is the character of their transaction, it requires powerful collateral evidence to overcome the presumption that the record is a faithful one. Barton v. Bank of New South Wales[7].\nSMITH J. (dissenting).\u2014A general statement of the facts in this case is set out in the reasons for judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice. There was a great deal of discussion as to whether or not the parol evidence given at the trial was admissible. The written document between the parties of the 12th of November, 1925, (Ex. 1), does not purport to contain the whole bargain, and it is clear that it is only part of it. The other portion of the bargain, except the written transfer of the stock in the books of the company and the certificate therefor issued to the defendant, was verbal. In my opinion, therefore, evidence was admissible to show the complete bargain between the parties, and we must construe the written document in the light of that complete bargain.\nThe stock transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant was selling on the market at the time at $105 per share, so that the 1,600 shares were then worth $168,000. The defendant says that he did know at the time of the transfer what the market price was, but that it was liable to run down to almost nothing. The plaintiff was seeking a loan of $40,000, with which to pay off the Royal Bank his indebtedness for that amount, for which the Bank held the 1,600 shares as security. The plaintiff had applied for this loan to one Robinson, who submitted the application to the defendant, with the result that the parties and Mr. Robinson were brought together at the office of Mr. Savary, the plaintiff's solicitor, who prepared the document which was finally signed by the parties at the office of Mr. Bennett. This document is in part as follows:\nWHEREAS the vendor (defendant) has this day purchased from the purchaser (plaintiff), and is now the holder of sixteen hundred (1,600) shares of the capital of Royalite Oil Company, Limited, and has agreed to give to the purchaser an option for the repurchase of the said shares for the price and on the terms hereinafter set forth.\nNow Therefore this Indenture Witnesseth that the vendor, in consideration of the sale of the said shares by the purchaser to the vendor, and other good and valuable considerations * *. * doth hereby give and grant unto the purchaser an option, irrevocable within the time for acceptance herein limited, to purchase from the vendor the said sixteen hundred shares * * *. The option hereby given shall be open for acceptance up to and including, but not after the 12th day of November, A.D. 1926 * * *.\nThe purchase price of the said shares shall be the sum of fifty-one thousand, two hundred and eighty ($51,280) dollars.\n*****\n(1) The vendor shall forthwith on the execution of these presents deposit the certificate or certificates for the said shares with the Stockyards Branch of the Bank of Montreal in the city of Calgary, and so long as the option hereby given shall remain open for acceptance, the said shares shall be left with the said Bank at its said Branch.\nThen follows a provision by which the plaintiff was to be entitled at any time up to the 12th day of November, 1926, to purchase any part of the shares, in blocks of not less than 100 shares, on depositing to the credit of the defendant in the Stockyards Branch of the Bank of Montreal, Calgary, $100 for each share so purchased. All sums so paid were to be credited on the total purchase price of $51,280. The evidence shows that the transfer of the shares by the plaintiff to the defendant was concurrent with the execution of this document, so that the transfer or sale by the plaintiff to the defendant and the option of repurchase evidenced by the document constituted one transaction. The defendant admits that the $51,280 was made up of the $40,000 to be paid to the Royal Bank in satisfaction of the plaintiff's debt, with interest at 12 per cent. for one year, and $6,000, representing the cash payment on the house, with interest for one year at 8 per cent. He also admits that at the time he did not have in mind any dividend that might be earned on the stock. No dividend, apparently, was being paid on the stock at the time, and neither party seems to have had in mind the possibility of such a dividend. On behalf of the appellant it was urged before us that, taking these circumstances into consideration, the transaction ought to be declared to be a loan by the defendant of $46,000 at the stipulated interest. The respondent relies on the fact of his having deliberately insisted on the terms set out in the document as written, and of his having refused to go into the transaction on any other terms. I think the evidence establishes this, and that the plaintiff accepted those terms after having had them read to him, and after having understood that they imported something different from the simple loan on the security of the stock that he had first contemplated. He could scarcely have failed to notice the express provision that the option was not to be open to him after the 12th of November, 1926. There would be no question in his mind as to whether or not that provision could be enforced against him, and there is no doubt on his evidence that he quite understood that by this provision he was agreeing that he was to have the right to get his stock back up to the 12th of November, 1926, but not afterwards.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the document cannot be reformed so as to change its terms, and must be interpreted as it stands, in the light of the whole bargain between the parties, partly verbal and partly written. It follows from the express provision that the plaintiff was to have no right to exercise the option after the 12th of November, 1926; that there was to be no legal liability on the plaintiff to pay the debt. It was an agreement between the parties, so far as the written document goes, that if the plaintiff failed to exercise the option within the stipulated time, he was to lose all interest in the stock, which defendant was in that event to have as his own absolutely, without any right to look to the plaintiff for repayment of his money.\nSuch were the written terms of the contract; but whether or not the plaintiff would have had a right to redeem after the date fixed, notwithstanding the express provision to the contrary, would depend on whether or not it should be held that the transfer to defendant was merely as security for a loan. That question does not arise, because the option was in fact exercised within the stipulated time. If this question had arisen, a decision that there was a right to re deem after the stipulated time, notwithstanding the express provision to the contrary, would not rest on any change of the terms of the bargain, but on the rule of equity which treats as a nullity any such provision where the transaction is to be construed as a transfer of property to secure a loan.\nConsidering, then, the whole bargain just as it was made, we have the significant fact that the defendant stipulated for the interest on his money at the rate mentioned during the year within which the plaintiff was to be entitled to exercise the option, and that he agreed to deposit the shares in the bank and to leave them there during the year for which he was to receive this interest in the event of the option being taken up. He was, by virtue of this term of the agreement, debarred from making any use of these shares during the year, and the plaintiff was necessarily under a like disability in reference to them. They were placed in defendant's name on the books of the company merely to ensure to him the absolute ownership of the shares, without more, in the event of the option not being exercised within the time limited. His ownership was not an absolute ownership during the year, but a limited and conditional ownership, only to become absolute in the event of the option not being exercised.\nIn my opinion, these terms import that the shares and every advantage incident to their ownership were to belong to the party ultimately becoming entitled to the shares under the terms of the agreement. It is, of course, urged that dividends belong to the actual owner, whoever he may be, at the time when the dividend is payable, and therefore in this case belonged to the defendant. It is not, however, disputed that in a transaction such as this the parties were at perfect liberty to provide otherwise, and it becomes a question of construction in the light of the whole bargain, written and verbal, as to whether or not this whole agreement between the parties imports that any incidental advantages accruing to the ownership of the shares during the year should go with the shares to the party who might ultimately become the absolute owner under the terms of the bargain. In my opinion, that is the proper construction to be placed upon the whole bargain between the parties. The defendant in effect agreed not to make use of the shares during the year, and stipulated for the price that he was to be paid for the use of his money and his risk during the year, and had no intention at the time, as he admits, of stipulating for any further advantage or profit. On payment to him in full of his stipulated profit, he is not, in my opinion, entitled to collect a further profit of $4,000, or about nine per cent., for which he did not bargain or intend to bargain. To interpret the whole agreement as I have indicated requires no alteration of either the verbal or written part of the bargain. There can be no doubt that if it had been provided in express terms that any dividend that might be earned on the stock during the year was to go with the stock to the party who might become absolute owner under the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover the dividend in question. If such a term is properly to be inferred from the circumstances and the whole bargain between the parties, the result is the same, although this term is not set out in express language.\nI think there is no force in the argument put forward by the learned Chief Justice in the court below, in his reasons for judgment, where he says:\nAs well, one might say, that the option to purchase a farm would involve the right to an account of all the profits derived from it after the option was given until the exercise.\nI can see no resemblance between such an option and the one in question here. In the case put by the learned Chief Justice there is not as part of the same transaction a transfer of the farm from the party obtaining the option to the party giving it, with an agreement by the latter to put it in possession of a third party during the year within which the option was to run, and to make no use of the property during that year, and a further provision that the latter party was to have interest on the purchase price during the year in case the option should be exercised.\nIt appears to me that the learned Chief Justice arrived at his conclusions through having failed to take into consideration these very important differences between the case that he states and the one here in question. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs of this appeal and of the appeal below, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 23 Alta.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1927: November 9, 10, 11; 1928: February 7.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Invalidity\u2014Anticipation\u2014Radio art\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in which he held that claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 of the Canadian letters patent no. 208,583, issued to the plaintiff as assignee of one Alexanderson, were valid and had been infringed by the defendant.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s patent had to do with radio art, and covered a device by which it was claimed a higher degree of selective tuning could be obtained in a receiving set than had been previously obtainable, while at the same time the desired signal could be received at its maximum effect.\nThe appeal was allowed, on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s patent was invalid, having been anticipated by Schloemilch and Von Bronk.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by Lamont J. After discussing Alexanderson\u2019s device, he said:\n\u201c* * *. That this device gave a high degree of selectivity is not denied and if the patent issued for it be valid there would not seem to be much doubt that the appellants infringed the patent.\n\u201cThe main defences relied upon by the appellants are:\n\u201c1. That Alexanderson\u2019s device does not constitute invention, and, 2. That if it does, he was anticipated by other inventors, particularly Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk, in Germany.\u201d\nHe then proceeded to deal with the latter of these defences, and, in regard thereto, discussed the devices in question, and the evidence, at length.\nIn the course of his discussion of the question, he said: \u201cA comparison [of certain diagrams] shews that the invention of Schloemilch and von Bronk is very similar to that of Alexanderson. It is, however, argued, and it was held by the court below, that the inventions differed in two material respects: (1) That the input circuit of the invention of Schloemilch and von Bronk was not tuned, and that tuning of that circuit was necessary to obtain as high a degree of selectivity as was obtained by Alexanderson, and (2) That their invention was not for the purpose of securing selectivity at all, but simply for securing amplification.\n\u201cThe first question, therefore, is: Did Schloemilch and von Bronk intend the input circuit of their invention to be tuned?\u201d\nAs to this point, after discussing the evidence thereon, he found that in the patents of Schloemilch and von Bronk (no. 293,300 in Germany, and no. 1,087,892 in the United States of America) the input circuit was tuned as well as the others; that \u201cthe grid circuit was intended to be, and was in fact, tuned to the same frequency as the other circuits.\u201d\nHe then proceeded:\n\u201cIt was also contended that the two inventions differed in the objects to be attained; that Alexanderson sought selectivity, while Schloemilch and von Bronk sought amplification only, and that no claim for selectivity is made in any of their patents. That they made no claim for selectivity, the appellants admit, but the reason for that, they say, was because the securing of selectivity by means of tuned circuits arranged in cascade was, to their knowledge, already old in the art and their invention added nothing to the prior art as far as selectivity was concerned.\u201d\nAfter dealing with the evidence as to the prior art, and discussing further the inventions of Schloemilch and von Bronk and of Alexanderson, he said:\n\u201cThat Alexanderson stressed selectivity and made provision for amplification, while Schloemilch and von Bronk stressed amplification only, is, in my opinion, of little moment for although they made no claim that their invention secured selectivity\u2014that having been obtained by prior inventors\u2014the object of both devices was to eliminate undesired signals and secure and strengthen the desired signal and bring it within the compass of the human ear. Had Alexanderson, in February, 1913, possessed their knowledge of the prior art, it seems to me very doubtful if he would have claimed selectivity as he did.\n\u201cI am therefore of opinion that during the last months of 1912 and the early months of 1913, Schloemilch and von Bronk, in Germany, and Alexanderson, in America, working independently, produced devices for securing selectivity and sensitivity in a receiving set by precisely the same means.\u201d\nDealing next with the question as to which device was prior in time, he found, on the evidence, that Alexander-son\u2019s device was anticipated by Schloemilch and von Bronk. He then concluded as follows:\n\u201cHaving reached this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider whether or not either of the inventions added any- thing to the prior art, for Alexanderson\u2019s device, having been anticipated by Schloemilch and von Bronk, Patent no. 208,583 cannot be upheld as valid, and the appellants are therefore not liable for infringing it.\n\u201cI would allow the appeal with costs, set aside the judgment below and enter judgment for the appellants with costs.\u201d\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nW. D. Herridge for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C., R. S. Smart K.C., and F. C. Macfarlarte for the respondent.\n[1] [1927] Ex. C.R. 134.\n"}

Currie Limited (Defendants) Respondents.\n1928: March 5; 1928: April 24.\nPresent: Duff, Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nDebt of Canadian debtor to alien enemy\u2014Money paid into court\u2014Claims by custodian and enemy creditor\u2014Custodian\u2019s right to the money\u2014Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, Parts I and II, especially clauses 3, 5, 6, 10, 26, 32, 33, 34, 41\u2014Treaty of Peace of Versailles, Arts. 296, 297, 298.\nBefore the war, P.F., a German firm, sent to W. Co. in Canada goods on consignment for sale on commission. During the war W. Co. sold the goods and, shortly afterwards, sold its assets to C. Co. which assumed W. Co.\u2019s liabilities, including the liability to P.F. In June, 1920, C. Co., having notice of competing claims by P.F. and its sequestrator in France, for the amount of said liability, applied for and obtained from the Master in Chambers, in the Supreme Court of Ontario, an order for the payment of the amount into court. In November, 1925, P., as attorney for P.F., and the Custodian of Alien Enemy Property each applied for payment to himself of the money in court. Mowat J. (30 O.W.N. 398) ordered payment to the Custodian, but subject to conditions which the Custodian refused to accept, and each party appealed. The Appellate Division (32 O.W.N. 402) ordered payment to P., subject to a right to the Custodian to a further enquiry as to certain facts. The Custodian elected against such an enquiry, and appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Custodian was entitled to the money; it represented an enemy \u201cdebt\u201d owing by a debtor in Canada and recoverable by the Custodian under the regulations of Part I of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920. There was an adequate remedy at law, as for money had and received. It mattered not, for the purposes of the case, whether P.F. looked to C. Co. or to W. Co. as its debtor; and it was none the less a \u201cdebt\u201d because, upon the termination of the war, C. Co., being misinformed as to its duty, paid the money into court for the benefit of P.F. or its estate; the money could not by this means be diverted from its legal destination; nor was the Custodian\u2019s right of recovery affected by the fact that, at the time of the payment into court, he, not being aware of the enemy character of the obligation, did not assert his right.\nThe Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, Parts I and II, especially clauses 3, 5, 6, 10, 26, 32, 33, 34, 41; the Treaties of Peace Act of Canada, 1919, (2nd sess.), c. 30, s. 1 (1), (2); the Treaty of Peace of Versailles, arts. 296, 297, 298; the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy (P.C. 1023, 2nd May, 1916), ss. 26, 28, considered.\nAPPEAL by the Custodian of Alien Enemy Property from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which ordered (no amendment being made to s. 33 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, in accordance with the suggestion and opportunity given in a previous judgment of the Appellate Division[2]) that certain money in court be paid to the present respondent Passavant, and not to the Custodian, such order being made subject to a right to the Custodian to have a further inquiry directed as to certain facts. The Custodian elected against such an inquiry, and appealed to this Court. The material facts of the case, and the history of the proceedings below, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The Custodian\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nT. Mulvey K.C. for the appellant.\nR.H. Sankey for the respondent Passavant.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The parties each assert the exclusive right to receive the sum of $12,678.32, which was paid into the Supreme Court of Ontario by E. & S. Currie, Ltd., of Toronto, pursuant to leave granted, upon the application of that company, by order of the Master in Chambers of 2nd June, 1920. The order is expressed to have been made \u201cIn the matter of Conveyance and Law of Property Act, being R.S.O., 1914, ch. 109.\u201d The facts are shown by the affidavits and exhibits which are produced in the case, and I shall endeavour to submit a brief summary.\nUpon the application for payment into court, it was disclosed by the affidavit of George Edward Watson, the Secretary of E. & S. Currie, Ltd., sworn 1st June, 1920, that, before the commencement of the war, Watson & Haig, Ltd., of Toronto, had received certain merchandise, which elsewhere appears to have consisted of silk goods, on consignment from the firm of Passavant Fr\u00e8res for sale in Canada on commission; that on 9th November, 1914, Watson & Haig, Ltd., received notice from Alfonse Bory of St. Etienne, in France, that he had been appointed sequestrator of Passavant Fr\u00e8res, whose business affairs had been suspended until further order; that in consequence Watson & Haig, Ltd., had made no payments \u201cin respect of the said merchandise to Passavant Fr\u00e8res,\u201d and that shortly afterwards a letter from Passavant Fr\u00e8res, dated 23rd December, 1914, came to the attention of Watson & Haig, Ltd., whereby it was stated that payments due to Passavant Fr\u00e8res, at St. Etienne, must not be paid to the sequestrator, but to their firm at Zurich, Switzerland, and that payments to the sequestrator would not be recognized. It is stated that subsequently E. & S. Currie, Ltd.,\npurchased all the assets and assumed the liabilities of the said Watson & Haig, Ltd., including the liability to Fr\u00e8res Passavant aforesaid, and there is now due and owing to the said Fr\u00e8res Passavant by E. & S. Currie, Ltd., for and on account of Watson & Haig, Ltd., the sum of $12,678.32.\nMr. Watson deposed further that, from time to time since the year 1914, demands for payment had come from Passavant Fr\u00e8res of New York and Frankfort, and that, on 31st December, 1919, Alfonse Bory, the sequestrator, had demanded payment, submiting at the same time copy of the decree of the Civil Court at St. Etienne, whereby he was appointed; that E. & S. Currie, Ltd., having thus notice of competing claims by Passavant Fr\u00e8res and their sequestrator, had submitted the question of payment to the Custodian, in order to ascertain whether he made any claim, and had received a reply in the negative. Mr. Watson, by the penultimate paragraph of his affidavit, states as follows:\nThe said E. & S. Currie, Ltd., is ready and willing at all times to answer all such questions relating to the application of the money in question as this Honourable Court or a Judge thereof may make or direct, and is now desirous of paying such moneys into Court subject to the claims of the said two claimants.\nSome additional evidence is furnished by the two affidavits of the respondent Passavant, sworn at the City of New York on 19th November, 1924, and 13th October, 1925, respectively; he shows that:\nKarl Kotzenberg, Hermann von Passavant and Hans von Passavant have carried on business at St. Etienne, Loire, France; Basle, Switzerland; and Frankfort-on-Maine, Germany, under the partnership names \u201cPassavant Fr\u00e8res\u201d sometimes called \u201cFr\u00e8res Passavant,\u201d \u201cPassavant Fils & Cie\u201d and \u201cGebruder Passavant G.m.b.H.\u201d respectively.\nHe says that, sometime after the outbreak of the war, M. Bory was appointed sequestrator of Passavant Fr\u00e8res at St. Etienne; that, \u201csometime prior to the year 1920, E. & S. Currie, Ltd., of Toronto owed the sum of $12,678.32 to the firm of Passavant Fr\u00e8res of St. Etienne;\u201d that this sum remains in court to their credit, with accrued interest; that the said Karl Kotzenberg, Hermon von Passavant and Hans von Passavant now carry on business as aforesaid; that they are the only persons entitled by law to receive the money, and that the sequestrator, Alfonse Bory, has no claim thereto. He says that the respondent was appointed general attorney of Passavant Fr\u00e8res by instrument of November, 1924, and he produces a certified copy of a letter from M. Bory, dated 22nd October, 1924, in which he acknowledges that he has for some time ceased to be sequestrator of the firm of Passavant Fr\u00e8res, and that his position as such has come to an end. The respondent states also, in one of these affidavits, that it was during the war that Watson & Haig, Ltd., sold the goods consigned to that company which realized the sum in question; and moreover that\nSoon after this Messrs. Watson & Haig sold their assets to E. & S. Currie, Limited, and E. & S. Currie Limited assumed the liabilities of Watson & Haig including the liability to Passavant Fr\u00e8res.\nThe respondent adds, as a statement of fact, that\nThe former sequestrator of Passavant Fr\u00e8res has been discharged and I verily believe that no successor has been or will be appointed.\nThe Custodian, by his affidavit of 11th November, 1925, produces correspondence which he has received from the German Clearing Office and Gebruder Passavant, and the claims filed on their behalf by the German Clearing House, also a letter, dated 6th April, 1920, from Mr. A. Hoffman, who describes himself as a former director of the late firm of Fr\u00e8res Passavant, St. Etienne, to Watson & Haig, Ltd., in which Mr. Hoffman states that he is occupied with arrangements concerning the St. Etienne House, and would like to know what became of the goods, etc., which Messrs. Watson & Haig, Ltd., had on consignment; this letter is written from Frankfort, and Mr. Hoffman says \u201cplease send your answer to me, or, if you prefer, direct to the firm here in Frankfort.\u201d There is no record of any answer to this letter.\nThe money still remains in court. Meantime, on 13th November, 1925, George Claude Passavant, the respondent, acting under his power of attorney from Passavant Fr\u00e8res, upon notice to the Custodian, applied for payment of the money out of court, and, on the same date, the Custodian, upon notice to the respondent, applied for payment to himself. These applications were heard together by Mowat J.[3], who held the Custodian entitled, subject to certain conditions which the Custodian was not disposed to accept, and each of the applicants appealed. When the case came before the Appellate Division[4], a question was suggested by the Court as to the jurisdiction of the Master, who had directed, not only that E. & S. Currie, Ltd., should be at liberty to pay the money into court, but also should, upon such payment, be discharged from all liability. The Court was not satisfied that the Master could discharge the liability, and accordingly ordered that\nthe said E. & S. Currie, Limited, be and it is hereby added as a party to these proceedings, and that the said E. & S. Currie, Limited, shall be bound by any future order made in these proceedings.\nConformably to this direction, the Currie Company was joined, and the hearing proceeded. Upon this occasion[5], the majority of the court considered that the Custodian\u2019s right to payment was not established, because, by clause 33 of The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, the property, rights and interests in Canada, within the meaning of the Order, belonging on 10th January, 1920, to enemies, or theretofore belonging to enemies, were limited to those \u201cin the possession or control of the Custodian\u201d at the date of the Order, and were therefore not vested in or subject to the control of the Custodian, and were therefore excepted from debts to be settled through the Clearing Office. It was suggested, therefore, that an opportunity should be afforded to the Government to amend s. 33, so as to vest the debt in the Custodian. Then the latter applied for and obtained a re-argument of the appeal, and the case came before the Appellate Division for the third time[6], but in the result the Custodian fared no better, except for a dissent. The court remained of opinion that his case was not made out, and that some further inquiries were necessary; that it was not shown that the Currie Company was a debtor of Passavant Fr\u00e8res; that the real debtor might be Watson & Haig, Ltd., and that, if there were to be a further inquiry, that firm should also be added as a party. The Custodian was therefore put to his election as to whether he would proceed with the suggested inquiries, and, he having answered in the negative, the court directed that the money should forthwith be paid to the respondent. The dissenting judge (Ferguson J) was of opinion that it was the duty of the court to determine to whom E. & S. Currie, Ltd., should have paid Watson & Haig\u2019s debt, and that it was, by s. 10 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, made payable to the Custodian, and to him only.\nThe Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy were amended and consolidated on 2nd May, 1916, and, by order 26, subsections 1 and 2, of the Consolidation, it was provided as follows:\n26. (1) Any person who holds or manages for or on behalf of an enemy any property real or personal (including any rights, whether legal or equitable, in or arising out of property, real or personal), shall, within one month after the publication in the Canada Gazette of these orders and regulations, or, if the property comes into his possession or under his control after the said publication, then within one month after the time when it comes into his possession or under his control, by notice in writing communicate the fact to the Custodian, and shall furnish the Custodian with such particulars in relation thereto as the Custodian may require.\n(2) The preceding subsection shall extend and apply to balances and deposits standing to the credit of enemies at any bank, and to debts to the amount of one hundred dollars or upwards, which are due, or which, had a state of war not existed, would have been due to enemies, as if such bank or debtor were a person who held property on behalf of an enemy.\nAlthough these subsections remained in force until repealed and superseded by the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order of 14th April, 1920, it does not appear that any notice in compliance with them was communicated to the Custodian, either on behalf of Watson & Haig, Ltd., or of E. & S. Currie, Ltd., although it was shown that, on 7th May, 1920, the solicitors of the latter had written a letter to the Custodian making some inquiries. This was after the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, came into effect. By Order 28 of the Consolidated Orders,\n28. (1) Any Superior Court of Record within Canada or any Judge thereof may, on the application of any person who appears to the Court or Judge to be a creditor of an enemy or entitled to recover damages against an enemy, or to be interested in any property, real or personal (including any rights, whether legal or equitable, in or arising out of property real or personal), belonging to or held or managed for or on behalf of an enemy, or on the application of the Custodian or any department of the Government of Canada, by order vest in the Custodian any such real or personal property as aforesaid, if the Court or the Judge is satisfied that such vesting is expedient for the purpose of these orders and regulations, and may by the order confer on the Custodian such powers of selling, managing and otherwise dealing with property as to the Court or Judge may seem proper.\nThe jurisdiction conferred by this clause, although it existed, was not invoked nor exercised with regard to the debt in question. The Treaty of Peace between the allied and associated powers and Germany was signed at Versailles on 28th June, 1919, and ratified on 10th January, 1920, which was also the date, as declared, of the termination of the war.\nBy section III, article 296, of the Treaty, entitled \u201cDebts,\u201d it was stipulated provisionally that:\nThere shall be settled through the intervention of Clearing Offices to be established by each of the High Contracting Parties * * * the following classes of pecuniary obligations:\nincluding\n(1) Debts payable before the war and due by a national of one of the Contracting Powers, residing within its territory, to a national of an Opposing Power, residing within its territory;\n(2) Debts which became payable during the war to nationals of one Contracting Power residing within its territory and arose out of transactions or contracts with the nationals of an Opposing Power, resident within its territory, of which the total or partial execution was suspended on account of the declaration of war.\nClearing offices were established pursuant to these provisions; and, by the stipulated regulations governing the clearing offices, admitted debts, and the debt in question is admitted, are at once to be credited by the debtor clearing office.\nBy section IV, article 297, entitled \u201cProperty, Rights and Interests,\u201d it is declared that the question of private property, rights and interests in an enemy country shall be settled according to the principles laid down in this section and the provisions of the annex thereto. By clause (b) of this article, the allied and associated powers reserve the right to retain and liquidate all property, rights and interests belonging at the date of the coming into force of the Treaty to German nationals, or companies controlled by them, within their territories, and by clause 14 of the annex it is stipulated that the provisions of this article, relating to property, rights and interests in an enemy country, and the proceeds of the liquidation thereof,\napply to debts, credits and accounts, Section III regulating only the method of payment.\nBy \u201cAn Act for carrying into effect the Treaties of Peace between His Majesty and certain Other Powers,\u201d enacted by the Parliament of Canada on 10th November, 1919, c. 30 of the second session, referring in the preamble to the Treaties of Peace with Germany and Austria, it is provided by s. 1, subss. 1 and 2, that (1) The Governor in Council may make such appointments, establish such offices, make such Orders in Council, and do such things as appear to Him to be necessary for carrying out the said Treaties, and for giving effect to any of the provisions of the said Treaties.\n(2) Any Order in Council made under this Act may provide for the imposition by summary process or otherwise of penalties in respect of breaches of the provisions thereof, and shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after it is made, and shall have effect as if enacted in this Act, but may be varied or revoked by a subsequent Order in Council.\nIt was pursuant to the powers so conferred that the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, was sanctioned by His Excellency the Administrator in Council on 14th April, 1920. The provisions of this Order, following the preliminary interpretation clauses, are expressed in five Parts. Part I, entitled \u201cDebts and Clearing Office,\u201d comprises clauses 3-31 inclusive, and Part II, entitled \u201cProperty, Rights and Interests,\u201d comprises clauses 32-50 inclusive. The remaining Parts are not material for present purposes. By clause 3 of Part I of this Order \u201cEnemy Debt\u201d is defined to mean:\n(a) A debt payable before the war and due to or by a British subject residing in Canada by or to a German national residing in Germany;\n(b) A debt which became payable during the war\n(i) to a British subject residing in Canada which arose out of a transaction or contract with a German national residing in Germany, or\n(ii) to a German national residing in Germany, which arose out of a transaction or contract with a British subject residing in Canada, of which transaction or contract the total or partial execution was suspended on account of the declaration of war.\nAnd \u201cdebtor\u201d means a person from whom, and \u201ccreditor\u201d a person by whom, an enemy debt is claimed. Provision follows for the establishment in and for Canada, under the control and management of the Custodian, of a local clearing office to perform the functions of a central clearing office for Canada, and to conduct all transactions with the German clearing office through a central clearing office established in the United Kingdom.\nBy clause 5 of this Order:\nExcept in cases where recovery of such debt in a Court of law is allowed as hereinafter provided, no person shall pay, or accept payment of, or have any communication with any German national with respect to any enemy debt, otherwise than through the Clearing Office.\nBy clause 6:\nNo person shall bring or take in any Court in Canada any action or other proceeding relating to the payment of an enemy debt, except as hereinafter provided. The exceptions do not apply to a German creditor in the circumstances of this case.\nBy clause 10:\nEvery debtor in Canada who admits the whole or part of the debt shall within three months from the date of this Order, unless he has already done so, pay to the Custodian the amount admitted with the interest and in the currency (i.e., Canadian) and at the rate of exchange provided by sections 23 and 24 of this Order.\nIn Part II, clause 32, \u201cEnemy\u201d is defined to include a German national who, during the war, resided or carried on business within the territory of a Power at war with His Majesty, and a German national who during the war resided or carried on business within the territory of a Power allied or associated with His Majesty, whose property within such territory has been treated by that Power as enemy property. And, by subs. 2 of the last mentioned clause,\n\u201cProperty, rights and interests\u201d include debts, credits and accounts to which the provisions of this Part shall apply, subject to the provisions of Part I which regulate the method of payment.\nThen follows clause 33, which appears to have led to some confusion in this case. It provides that:\n33. All property, rights and interests in Canada belonging on the 10th day of January, 1920, to enemies, or heretofore belonging to enemies, and in the possession or control of the Custodian at the date of this Order, are hereby vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in any order heretofore made vesting in the Custodian any property, right or interest formerly belonging to an enemy, such property, right or interest shall be vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian, who shall hold the same on the same terms and with the same powers and duties in respect thereof as the property, rights and interests vested in him by this Order.\nBy clause 34 all vesting orders purporting to have been made and given in pursuance of the Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, or in pursuance of any other Canadian war legislation with regard to property, rights and interests of enemies; the sale or management of property, rights or interests; the collection or discharge of debts, etc., \u201cand in general all exceptional war measures, or measures of transfer, or acts done or to be done in the execution of any such measures, are hereby validated and confirmed, and shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons, subject to the provisions of Sections 33 and 41.\u201d Clause 41 authorizes the Custodian to take any action or proceeding which he may think proper to enforce the provisions of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, and to get in any property, right or interest vested in him.\nPart I regulates the method of collection and payment of enemy debts after the war. That is assigned to the clearing offices, subject to the regulations; I have quoted or referred to the governing ones. I have shown that provisions existed during the war for the recovery of enemy debts by the Custodian, and for reducing them into possession. By articles 297 and 298 of the Treaty, and their annex, vesting orders, winding up orders, and other orders, directions and decisions or instructions in pursuance of war legislation with regard to enemy property, rights and interests were confirmed, and the interests of all persons were declared to have been effectively dealt with. Clauses 33 and 34 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, refer to property, rights and interests which were at that time in the possession or control of the Custodian. They were declared to be vested by the effect of the Order, and property, rights or interests previously vested were declared to be held on the same terms and with the same powers and duties as the property, rights and interests vested by the Order. The method of payment of the other German enemy pecuniary obligations, which by subs. 2 of s. 32 of the Order are interpreted to include \u201cdebts, credits and accounts,\u201d is, as that subsection itself states, regulated by Part I of the Order. These payments must go through the clearing office, and, upon my interpretation, the provisions of the Order to which I have referred are compatible only with the Custodian\u2019s right of recovery. There was, I have no doubt, a large area of debts, credits and accounts subject to the provisions of Part I of the Order, and to be administered accordingly, which at the conclusion of the Peace had not been vested in or collected by the Custodian, but which are nevertheless intended to reach the clearing office. This, I hold, is made very plain by the terms of the Order; and moreover, by Clause 26, all sums, which under Part I ought to be paid to the Custodian, shall be recoverable by him in the Exchequer Court.\nIt is said in the respondent\u2019s factum that the money in contest is not a debt, although, by the affidavit upon which E. & S. Currie, Ltd., obtained leave to pay the money into court, it was described as a sum due and owing by that company to Passavant Fr\u00e8res, and it was also so described in the affidavit of the respondent himself upon which he applied to the court for payment out. Apparently it is intended to suggest that, whatever may have been the situation in equity, there was no contract or privity as between E. & S. Currie Co., Ltd., and Passavant Fr\u00e8res. It is not necessary to attribute any special effect or enlarged meaning to the word \u201cdebt\u201d in the Treaty or the legislation. There is a debt here upon the ordinary acceptation of the term. It appears that, during the war, Watson & Haig, Ltd., received $12,678.32, proceeds of the goods of Passavant Fr\u00e8res which would have been payable to the latter, if there had been no war, and that when, also during the war, Watson & Haig, Ltd., assigned their assets to E. & S. Currie, Co., Ltd., the latter became bound to discharge this liability to Passavant Fr\u00e8res. There was thus, during the war, a determinate sum of money in the hands of Watson & Haig, Ltd., and subsequently in the hands of E. & S. Currie, Ltd., which would have been at that time payable to Passavant Fr\u00e8res, if the payment had not been suspended by reason of the war. It matters not, for the purposes of this case, whether Passavant Fr\u00e8res looked to the Currie Company as their debtor, which they evidently did, or to Watson & Haig, Ltd., who still remained liable for the debt. The money was in hand awaiting payment, pending the dispositions which were to attend upon the Peace. By these it fell to the Custodian, if it were a debt, and it was none the less a debt because, upon the termination of the war, E. & S. Currie, Ltd., being misinformed as to its duty, paid the money into court for the benefit of Passavant Fr\u00e8res, or their estate; the money could not by this means be diverted from its legal destination. There is proof of an admitted amount or balance, and that is a debt recoverable upon the money counts. The only trust to execute was that of paying over the money, such as is cognizable at law, as in cases of bailment, and for money had and received for another\u2019s use, where there is a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law. \u201cA Court of Equity was cautious of entertaining suits upon a single transaction where there were not mutual accounts.\u201d Story on Equity, 3rd Ed., pp. 33, 40, 191; Scott v. Surman[7]; and there are many later authorities.\nAt the time of the payment into court the Custodian, not being aware of the enemy character of the obligation, did not assert his right. On the contrary, the Assistant Deputy Custodian, by his letter of 19th May, 1920, expressed his willingness that E. & S. Currie, Ltd., \u201cmay pay the official sequestrator at St. Etienne the amount owing by them to Passavant Fr\u00e8res, St. Etienne.\u201d The E. & S. Currie, Co., Ltd., did not, however, act upon this consent, and the claim of the French sequestrator was subsequently withdrawn. There are now no claims in competition, except that represented by the respondent and that of the Custodian. The money, the subject of the claim, is in court appropriated to the payment of an enemy debt. There are no questions of account, the amount is specific. No question is raised as to the validity of the regulations, and, having regard to the provisions, the Custodian is, in my opinion, certainly entitled to receive the money for the Clearing Office.\nThere will be a declaration accordingly, the appeal will be allowed, and the costs throughout will be borne by the respondent, not including, of course, the costs of the payment into court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilkie & Delamere.\nSolicitors for the respondent Passavant: Worrell, Gwynne & Beatty.\nSolicitors for the respondent E. & S.

The land was part of a tract granted to the municipality by Crown grant, to hold in trust for a public wharf and public purposes connected therewith.\nHeld that, on the evidence, the decision of the Appellate Division, Ont. (61 Ont. L.R. 77), that defendant had failed satisfactorily to establish dispossession, should be sustained.\nSemble, the land granted to the municipality was by the terms of the grant dedicated to a public use, which was accepted by the public, and this dedication gave rise to rights of enjoyment by the public, which rights were not, nor was the municipality\u2019s title which was given for the purpose of supporting and protecting them, capable of being nullified, in consequence of adverse possession, by force of the Statute of Limitations.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of Ross, Co. C.J., Acting Judge of the County Court of the County of Essex) held that the plaintiff municipality was entitled to possession of the land in question. The land was part of a tract granted to the plaintiff municipality by Crown grant dated 12th January, 1869, to hold in trust for a public wharf and public purposes connected therewith. The defendant claimed that the municipality\u2019s title was extinguished by force of the Statute of Limitations. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs. S. Denison K.C. and Bernard Furlong for the appellant.\nF.K. Jasperson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed. The land, the possession of which is in dispute, is part of a tract granted to the respondent municipality by Crown grant, dated the 12th of January, 1869. The habendum is in these words,\nTo have and to hold to the said Corporation of the Township of Colchester and their successors in office forever in trust for a Public Wharf and Public purposes connected therewith.\nThe appellant\u2019s case is that he is in possession of this piece of land from which his predecessors dispossessed the respondent municipality more than ten years before the action was brought, during which period, he, or his predecessors in interest, have been in possession, and that the title of the municipality is consequently extinguished by virtue of the Statute of Limitations. I have been very much impressed by the force of the reasons given by Mr. Justice Hodgins[2] in support of his suggestion that the lands which were the subject of the grant to the municipality were thereby dedicated to a public use, a dedication which was accepted by the public (of this acceptance there is abundant evidence) and that this dedication gave rise to rights of enjoyment by the public, closely analogous to the rights of the public in respect of a public highway, and that such rights are not, nor is a title such as that of the municipality, given for the purpose of supporting and protecting them, capable of being nullified, in consequence of adverse possession, by the provisions of the Statute of Limitations upon which the appellant founds his case. I think there is a great deal to be said for that view. And I venture to add this to what Mr. Justice Hodgins has said in support of it. The appellant can only succeed upon the hypothesis that the municipality has lost its title. If that be so, it follows that, as concerns the piece of land in question, the object of the trust has necessarily failed. It would seem, again, to follow, on ordinary principles, that a resulting trust has arisen in favour of the Crown. The equity of the Crown, of which the appellant had notice, it might be forcibly argued on the authority of In re Nisbet and Potts\u2019 Contract[3], is not affected by the Statute of Limitations, because, independently of the exceptional position of the Crown, the appellant cannot maintain the position of a purchaser for value without notice. And, once more, it would follow, if this be so, that only the bare legal title is extinguished, and whatever possession the appellant may have, is held by him subject to the equitable estate of the Crown. It is difficult to think of so impotent a conclusion as one contemplated by the statute.\nMr. Denison suggests that all property given for charitable purposes is really trust property, and that the title of the property so held is not exempt from the Statute of Limitations. As to this, it should be noticed that here we are only concerned with property which is granted by the Crown to a public body subject to an express trust to permit the public to enjoy in it rights of physical user, as in a highway.\nI do not think, however, that it is strictly necessary to express a decided opinion on this point. The Appellate Division[4] has held that, having regard, inter alia, to the fact that the land was the property of the municipality, and in the same enclosure and held under the same title as an adjoining area from which the municipality was never dispossessed, the appellant has failed satisfactorily to establish dispossession from the piece in dispute. There is no doubt that, as to the critical years 1915 and 1916, the evidence is vague, and in some respects quite unsatisfactory. On the whole, I am not convinced that the Appellate Division has taken an erroneous view.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Furling, Furlong, Awrey, Whyte & St. Aubin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rodd, Wigle & Whiteside.\n[1] (1927) 61 Ont.

An allegation by plaintiff in his statement of claim that he gave such notice does not relieve defendant from stating in his pleading his intention to contest it; plaintiff\u2019s allegation merely expresses what, in its absence, would be implied.\nThe notice must indicate the intending plaintiff with reasonable certainty; but that is accomplished when words are used which are calculated to apprise the addressee of the complainant\u2019s identity.\nThe notice in question was held sufficient, although it was signed with the name \u201cThe Woodstock Sentinel-Review,\u201d and not in the name of the plaintiff, viz., \u201cThe Sentinel-Review Co. Ltd,\u201d which published a newspaper at Woodstock called \u201cThe Daily Sentinel-Review.\u201d\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (61 Ont. L.R. 62) setting aside the verdict and judgment recovered by plaintiff for damages for libel published in defendant\u2019s newspaper, and dismissing the action, reversed.\nThe Court refused to allow defendant a new trial, claimed on the ground of excessive damages awarded by the jury.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Logie J., who, upon the jury\u2019s findings, gave judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $6,000, as damages for libel published in the defendant\u2019s newspaper. The Appellate Division held that the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed, on the ground that it had not given sufficient notice before action, under s. 8 of the Libel and Slander Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 71. Two of the judges (Mulock C.J.O. and Hodgins J.A.) also held that, if they were wrong in their conclusion as to the notice, the damages allowed were excessive and there should be a new trial.\nThe plaintiff is the proprietor and publisher of a newspaper at Woodstock, Ont., called The Daily Sentinel-Review. The defendants are the proprietors and publishers of The Evening Telegram, a newspaper published at Toronto, Ont.\nThe notice in question, specifying the statements complained of, was addressed to the defendants, and read, in part, as follows:\nTake notice that we complain of a certain editorial published of and concerning us in the issue of The Evening Telegram [specifying date and place of issue] as being libellous, which said editorial is as follows:\n* * *\n[Editorials complained of had references to \u201cWoodstock Sentinel-Review\u201d and \u201cSentinel\u2011Review.\u201d]\nAnd further take notice that this notice is served pursuant to the Libel and Slander Act, being R.S.O. 1914, chapter 71, section 8.\nDated at Toronto, this 1st day of September, A.D. 1926.\n\u201cThe Woodstock Sentinel-Review\u201d per \u201cW.T. McMullen,\u201d Esq., K.C., Barrister, etc., Woodstock, Ont., their solicitor,\nBy his Toronto Agents, Messrs. McCarthy & McCarthy, Barristers, etc., Room 22, Canada Life Building, 46 King Street West, Toronto, Ont.\nThe statement of claim alleged:\n8. That the plaintiff pursuant to the provisions of the Libel and Slander Act duly gave notice in writing specifying the statements complained of in this action, which notice was dated the first day of September, 1926, and duly served pursuant to the provisions of the said Act on the said defendants.\nThe statement of defence made no reference to the notice, or to any want or insufficiency thereof.\nThe plaintiff contended that the notice was sufficient, and also that, upon the pleadings, it was not open to the defendants to contest its sufficiency. The defendants contended that the notice was not a notice given by or for the plaintiff company, or a notice on which it could rely; and that this question was in issue. They also complained that the trial judge failed adequately to charge the jury, and that the damages awarded were excessive.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\nA.J. Thompson and James Parker for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The verdict and judgment recovered by the appellants against the respondents for damages for libel published in the respondents\u2019 newspaper, was set aside by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[2], and the action dismissed upon the ground that no sufficient notice of action had been given by the appellants under the statute, s. 8, R.S.O. (1914), cap. 71.\nThe appellants base their appeal upon two contentions. First, they say that the notice was sufficient, and second, they say it was not open to the respondents to object to the sufficiency of the notice because such an objection, by the rules of pleading, ought to have been, and this objection was not, raised by the statement of defence.\nFirst, as to the question of pleading. The pertinent rule is:\u2014\nAny condition precedent, the performance or occurrence of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleading by the party relying thereon, and an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent necessary for the case by the plaintiff or defendant shall be implied in his pleading.\nIn their statement of claim the appellants allege in paragraph 8,\nThat the Plaintiff pursuant to the provisions of the Libel and Slander Act duly gave notice in writing specifying the statements complained of in this action, which Notice was dated the First day of September, 1926, and duly served pursuant to the provisions of the said Act on the said Defendants.\nThis is the only reference which the pleadings contain, to the notice of action.\nThe alleged cause of action, if well founded, was complete under the principles of the common law upon the publication of the libel. The statute imposes the condition of notice before action against a newspaper, in order that the newspaper may be given an opportunity of retracting or explaining the imputations complained of. If the giving of this notice by the appellants is a condition precedent within the meaning of C.R. 146, then the respondents could only contest it, if, in compliance with the rule, non-performance of the condition was specifically alleged in the statement of defence. The Appellate Division holds that the giving of notice is not a condition precedent within the meaning of the rules of pleading.\nThere is a sense, of course, in which any fact that a plaintiff must prove is an element in his right of action. Broadly, common lawyers, in speaking of rights, mean rights which the courts will enforce; nevertheless, the distinction runs all through the law, and is a very familiar one, between rights and remedies, enforceable rights and rights of imperfect obligation; and the distinction is an old one, well recognized in the rules of pleading, between the substantive elements of a cause of action, and conditions precedent which a plaintiff must observe in order to entitle him to sue.\nFormerly a plaintiff was required to set out in his declaration every condition precedent and to aver with particularity performance of it. Later, by the Common Law Procedure Act, it was provided that the plaintiff or defendant might aver performance of conditions precedent generally, and that \u201cthe opposite party shall not deny such averment generally, but shall specify in his pleading the condition or conditions precedent the performance of which he intends to contest.\u201d (Harrison, C.L.P. Act, p. 93). After the enactment of this Act, it was usual to allege in the declaration that \u201call conditions were performed, and all things happened, and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to maintain the action.\u201d\nUnder the practice established by the Judicature Acts, the necessity of a general averment of the performance of conditions precedent was dispensed with, such an averment being implied; but it is still, as required by C.R. 146, incumbent on a party who intends to contest the performance of any condition precedent to specify it distinctly in his pleading. The distinction (between a condition precedent in this sense, and a condition which is one of the constitutive elements of the plaintiff\u2019s right), is perhaps not easily capable of statement in abstract form; and differences of opinion will arise as to the category to which a particular fact belongs. But, as Mr. Justice Magee points out, statutory notices of action, which presuppose the existence of a completely constituted cause of action at common law independently of the notice, have commonly been held to be conditions precedent in this sense, as for example, in the case of notice to a magistrate, Conmee v. Bond[3]. Where a departure from the strict rule of pleading is permitted, the statute expressly authorizes the point to be raised under the general issue. The cases referred to by Hodgins, J.A., seem to fall within one of two classes: first, those in which the fact to be pleaded was an essential part of the cause of action at common law, as in proof of a termination favourable to the plaintiff, of the proceedings complained of in an action for malicious prosecution, and the case of notice of dishonour in an action against an endorser; second, those in which the right of action is statutory, and the existence of the fact in question is one of the prescribed statutory conditions, as notice of the assignment, which must be alleged in an action in the assignee\u2019s name upon an assignment of a legal debt under the provisions of s. 25 of the Judicature Act. With great respect I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the Appellate Division on this point.\nNor are the respondents, by the allegation in paragraph 8 of the statement of claim, relieved from the duty under C.R. 146 to state in their pleading their intention to contest the giving of notice. That allegation merely expresses what, in the absence of it, would be implied.\nNor can I agree that the notice was not sufficient. The statute prescribes no form. The notice is sufficient, if the plaintiff\u2019s intention to sue is notified. The communication must, of course, indicate the intending plaintiff with reasonable certainty. But that is accomplished when words are used which are calculated to apprise the addressee of the identity of the complainant. I have no doubt that the notice in question did in fact inform the respondents that the complainants were the proprietors of the Sentinel-Review.\nA similar point arose in Knott v. Telegram Printing Co. Ltd.[4], although there the question concerned the identification of the addressee. The point of view from which such documents should be considered is indicated in the judgment of Anglin J., as he then was, at p. 342, in these words, with which I agree:\u2014\nIn the present case the notice was properly served. It reached the defendant company and there is not the slightest room for question or doubt that it knew that it was intended for it. It was given the \u201copportunity to publish a full apology,\u201d which it is the purpose of the statute to secure.\nNor do I think the respondents are entitled to a new trial on the ground that the damages are excessive. Many people, perhaps most, would not be disposed to treat very seriously the publications complained of, especially after the apology to Mr. Taylor. But the jury has found that the reflections in the libellous publications were directed against the appellants; and it was within the power of the jury to take a severer view of those reflections, as calculated to injure the position and prestige of the appellants\u2019 papers, and thus to inflict upon them substantial damage in their business as newspaper publishers; and since the jury, as is quite evident, did take that view, there is no ground upon which a court of appeal, acting on the well settled principles governing such matters, can adjudge that the award of damages transgresses the latitude in which the law permits a jury to indulge in actions of libel.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.T.

(R.S.S. 1920, c. 89)\u2014Default by treasurer\u2014Liability of guarantor\u2014Representations by municipality in certificates given to secure renewals of bond\u2014Construction of certificates; contra proferentem rule\u2014Certificate of auditor, whether representation of municipality\u2014Alleged untruth of representations\u2014Jury\u2019s findings\u2014Jurisdiction of court of appeal to substitute its findings for those of jury.\nPlaintiff was a rural municipality incorporated under The Rural Municipality Act, R.S.S. 1920, c. 89. Defendant executed a bond as security for the faithful discharge by P. of his duties as plaintiff\u2019s treasurer. The bond was renewed from year to year on a certificate, signed each year by plaintiff\u2019s reeve and auditor, in the form forwarded by the defendant, which contained representations, the truth of which, in certificates of March 1, 1922, and March 16, 1923, was challenged by defendant, to the effect that all moneys in P.\u2019s control or custody had been accounted for, and that he had \u201cperformed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner.\u201d P. being found short in his cash, plaintiff sued on the bond. The jury found that said representations were material and relied on by defendant, but that they were true, and judgment was given at trial against defendant. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal (21 Sask. L.R. 551) which held that the jury\u2019s finding that the representations were true was perverse.\nHeld (1): As the members of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that they had all the facts before them and that no further evidence could be produced which would alter the result, that court had jurisdiction to draw inferences of fact inconsistent with the jury\u2019s finding, and to give effect to the same (Sask. Court of Appeal Rule 44; Calmenson v. Merchants\u2019 Warehousing Co. Ltd., 125 L.T. 129, at p. 131; Skeate v. Slaters Ltd., [1914] 2 K.B. 429; Everett v. Griffiths, [1921] 1 A.C. 631).\n(2): Even if, as The Rural Municipality Act now reads, the auditor of a municipality can properly be called an officer thereof, he is not an officer or agent to make any representations binding the municipality; nor did the fact that he signed the certificates constitute a holding out by plaintiff that he was authorized to make any representation on its behalf; the information required by defendant by the auditor\u2019s signature to the certificates was secured at defendant\u2019s own risk from the auditor as an individual and not as a representative of the municipality. (3): Although the truth of the representations was not the subject of warranty (as in Dom. of Canada Guaranty & Accident Co. Ltd. v. Halifax Housing Commission, [1927] S.C.R. 492, and other cases referred to), yet, it being found that they were material and were relied upon, defendant was entitled to have the renewal of the bond set S aside if it could successfully challenge their truth. (The certificate being framed by defendant, any ambiguity in its language should be construed in plaintiff\u2019s favour\u2014Ont. Metal Products Co. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, [1924] S.C.R. 35, at p. 41; Condogianis v. Guardian Ass. Co. [1921] 2 A.C. 125, at p. 130). As to the certificate of March 1, 1922, in view of the evidence, and having regard to the questions and answers in the application for the bond, from which the jury would be justified in concluding that defendant knew that plaintiff would depend on the auditor\u2019s statement, and as the reeve was not obliged to check the auditor\u2019s statement or P.\u2019s books, the jury were entitled to affirm, as they did, the truth of the representations. But as to the certificate of March 16, 1923, the members of the council of plaintiff municipality knew at that time of a discrepancy between the surplus shown on the auditor\u2019s balance sheet and P.\u2019s cash; the reeve should not have been satisfied with P.\u2019s explanation of this, and should not have certified without notifying defendant of the discrepancy; the representation that all moneys in P.\u2019s custody had been properly accounted for was not true, and, even if innocently made, it induced a renewal of the bond, which renewal defendant was entitled to have declared void. In the result, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was allowed in part, the defendant being held liable only for the sum (with interest) in which the jury found that P. was in default when the bond was renewed in 1923.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[1] which reversed the judgment of Embury J. who, after certain findings of fact by the jury, gave judgment for the plaintiff against the present respondent (defendant) for the sum of $10,000 on a claim made by the plaintiff under a bond entered into by the present respondent as security for the faithful discharge by one Paisley of his duties as treasurer of the plaintiff, a rural municipality incorporated under the Rural Municipality Act of Saskatchewan. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of Embury J. and ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s action against the present respondent be dismissed with costs. By the judgment now reported the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was allowed in part, with costs in this Court, and judgment directed to be entered for the plaintiff for $3,600 with the costs of the action, the costs in the Court of Appeal to go to the appellant in that court (the present respondent). The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nG. H. Yule K.C. for the appellant.\nE. B. Jonah K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[2], reversing the judgment in favour of the appellant municipality entered by the trial judge upon the findings of the jury. The action was brought by the municipality against J. R. Paisley, its former secretary-treasurer, for moneys misappropriated by him, and against the respondents (hereinafter called the company) on its bond as surety for Paisley\u2019s fidelity.\nThe material facts briefly are: In January, 1920, the municipality was established under the provisions of The Rural Municipality Act. J. B. Fitzmaurice was its first reeve, and J. R. Paisley its first secretary-treasurer. Under the Act the secretary-treasurer was required to furnish to the municipality a bond for the faithful discharge by him of his duties as treasurer, and Paisley furnished the bond sued on herein, which was for $10,000.\nOn December 18, 1920, the respondents sent to Paisley the following communication:\nRenewal No................................ Regina, Sask., Dec. 18, 1920.\nTo. Jared R. Paisley,\nArdkenneth, Sask.\nDear Sir:\nWe beg to notify you that Bond No. 8132 for $10,000 issued by this Company on your behalf to Rural Municipality of Victory No. 226 will expire on the 1st day of January next. Issued the 1st day of January, 1920.\nThe premium $40 should be paid on or before the date of expiration and a RENEWAL CERTIFICATE secured, otherwise the bond will lapse.\nKindly have the certificate below filled in and signed by your employer and forwarded with remittance for premium to McCallum, Hill & Co., Regina, Sask., when the renewal receipt will be sent you.\nYours respectfully,\nE. A. McCALLUM,\nPresident. To THE SASKATCHEWAN GUARANTEE & FIDELITY COMPANY, LIMITED,\nThis is to certify, that the books and accounts of Mr. Jared R. Paisley, Secy.-Treas., were examined by us from time to time in the regular course of business and we found them correct in every respect, all moneys or property in his control or custody being accounted for with proper securities and funds on hand to balance his accounts and he is not now in default.\nHe has performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner and no change has occurred in the terms or conditions of his employment as specified by us when the bond was executed.\nDated at....................................this.................................day of.....................................\nSignature of Employer,\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nOfficial Capacity,\n............................................Auditor.\nOn February 5, 1921, Fitzmaurice, as reeve, signed the said certificate and returned it to the company. On March 1st, 1922, he signed a similar certificate. On March 16, 1923, W. J. Swan, who was then reeve, signed a further certificate, couched in the same language. The certificates were also signed by Wm. C. Inkster, who had been appointed auditor. In the fall of 1923 the council appointed Ronald Griggs & Co., chartered accountants, to make an audit of the accounts of the municipality. Their report shewed that Paisley was short in his cash some $15,000. Hence this action. The main defence of the company was that the allegations of fact contained in the certificates of the reeve, of March 1, 1922, and March 16, 1923, were not true, and that, by reason of the representations contained therein, the company had been induced to continue the bond in force from year to year.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Embury with a jury.\nThe questions submitted to the jury were as follows:\u2014\n1. Did the defendant Paisley misappropriate moneys of the plaintiff municipality? Answer: Yes.\n2. If so, to what amount? Answer: $11,518.69.\n3. Did plaintiff municipality on March 1, 1922, represent to the company:\n(a) That books and accounts of defendant Paisley had been examined by the municipality and its officials from time to time and in the regular course of business and found correct in all respects? Answer: Yes.\n(b) That all moneys in his control and custody were properly accounted for? Answer: Yes. (c) That th\u00e9 said Paisley had performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner? Answer: Yes.\n4. Were the said representations true? Answer: Yes.\n5. If not, were they made falsely or recklessly? Answer: No answer.\n6. Was each of the said representations material? Answer: Yes.\n7. Did defendant the Saskatchewan Guarantee and Fidelity Company rely upon the said representations in agreeing to a renewal of the existing bond? Answer: Yes.\n* * * * *\nQuestions and answers 8 to 12, inclusive, were exactly the same as questions and answers 3 to 7, inclusive, except that they referred to the representations made on March 16, 1923, instead of those made March 1, 1922, the answer to question 9 being the same as to question 4.\nQuestions 13 and 14 were as follows:\n13. Was the defendant, Paisley, in default to the plaintiff municipality on March 1, 1922, and if so, what amount? Answer: No.\n14. Was the defendant, Paisley, in default to plaintiff municipality on March 16, 1923, and if so what amount? Answer: Yes. $3,600.\nThe jury having found that the representations made were true, the trial judge entered judgment for the municipality against the company for $10,000, and against Paisley for $11,518.69.\nThe company appealed, with the result that this judgment was set aside and judgment entered for the company.\nThe reasons given by the Court of Appeal for setting aside the judgment were:\nThat the answers of the jury to questions 4 and 9 were perverse and unreasonable and contrary to the evidence; that Paisley\u2019s books and accounts had not been kept in any proper or satisfactory manner; that this was known to Inkster and his knowledge should be imputed to the council, and also that Inkster\u2019s representation in the certificates that the books and accounts had been correct in every respect, constituted a representation by the municipality. From that judgment the municipality now appeals to this court and asks that the judgment of the trial judge be restored for the following reasons:\n1. That the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the jury.\n2. That the auditor, Inkster, was neither an officer nor an agent of the municipality to make any representations on its behalf, and his signature to the certificate in no way-bound the municipality.\n3. That there was evidence on which the jury were entitled to find that the representations made in the said certificates were true.\n1. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to set aside the finding of the jury and to substitute therefor its own finding of fact, has its foundation in Rule 44, which declares that \u201cthe court shall have power to draw inferences of fact, and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made, and to make such further or other order as the case may require * * *.\u201d These words are identical with the language of Order 58, R. 4 of the English Rules, which has been under review in a number of cases, and, although there has been some difference of judicial opinion, the weight of authority is in favour of the view expressed by Lord Atkinson in Calmenson v. Merchants\u2019 Warehousing Company Limited[3], in the following words:\nThe principle which should guide the Courts of Review in setting aside, as against the weight of evidence, a verdict found by a jury on issues of fact is shortly and neatly laid down by Lord Herschell in Metropolitan Railway Company v. Wright[4], in these words: \u201cThe case was one within the province of a jury, and in my opinion the verdict ought not to be disturbed unless it was one which a jury, viewing the whole evidence reasonably, could not properly find.\u201d\n* * * * *\nOrder LVIII, r. 4, enables a Court of Review to give to the defendant in such an action certain relief in addition to, and going much beyond, that of setting aside the verdict of the jury. It enables the court in certain cases to enter judgment for the defendant. But, according to the authorities, this extra relief should only be granted where the members of the court are of opinion (1) That they have all the facts before them; and (2) that, if a new trial were granted, no further evidence could be given which would alter the result (see Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[5]).\nSee also Skeate v. Slaters, Limited[6]; Everett v. Griffiths[7].\nAs the members of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the answers of the jury to questions 4 and 9 were perverse and that they had all the facts before them and that no further evidence could be produced which would alter the result, the court, in my opinion, had jurisdiction to draw inferences of fact inconsistent with the finding of the jury, and to give effect to the same.\n2. As The Rural Municipality Act now reads, I am very doubtful if the auditor of a municipality can properly be called an officer of the corporation but, even if he can, he is an officer only to \u201caudit and report upon all books and accounts affecting the municipality\u201d and certify to the same, and to \u201cnotify the minister, the reeve and all the councillors of any negligence, irregularity or discrepancy which he finds in the books or accounts.\u201d In no other capacity can he be employed by the municipality. S. 156. He is, therefore, not an officer or agent to make any representation on behalf of the municipality so as to bind it thereby. Nor, in my opinion, does the fact that he signed the certificates constitute a holding out by the municipality that he was authorized to make any representation on its behalf. The company requested Inkster\u2019s signature to the certificates because prima facie he was the person who had the most accurate knowledge of the state of the books and accounts. The obtaining of his certificate would ordinarily afford the company the most reliable information obtainable as to the performance by Paisley of his duties. That information, however, the company, in my opinion, secures at its own risk from the auditor as an individual and not as a representative of the municipality.\n3. Was there evidence upon which the jury as reasonable men could find that the representations contained in the certificates were true?\nBefore referring to the evidence it may not be inadvisable to point out that the bond in question in this action was not a contract of warranty. There was no express agreement in this case that the truth of any representation made should be a condition precedent to the validity of the bond as in the cases referred to in the respondents\u2019 factum, of Town of Arnprior v. U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co.[8]; Railway Passengers\u2019 Assurance Co. v. Standard Life Assurance Co.[9]; Dominion of Canada Guaranty & Accident Co. v. Housing Commission of Halifax[10]. When the truth of a particular statement has been made the subject of warranty, it is no defence to say that the declaration was made in good faith and with a firm conviction of its accuracy. Neither is it a defence to shew that the representation was immaterial or not relied upon. Where the parties have agreed that the truth of the representation shall form the basis of the contract, the contract is voidable unless the representation is true in fact. Where the truth of the representation is not warranted, its materiality and the reliance placed upon it may be inquired into. Where, however, the truth of the representation is not warranted, but the jury have found that the representation was material and was relied upon, the contract is likewise voidable unless the representation is true, for a material misrepresentation which induces a contract, though innocently made, entitles the other contracting party to have the contract set aside. In the case before us, the jury having found that the representations made in the certificates of March 1, 1922, and March 16, 1923, were material and were relied upon, the company is entitled to have the bond set aside if it can successfully challenge the truth of the statements made. Their truth has been challenged by the company in their notice of appeal to the court below in respect of four representations\u2014two contained in each certificate. The representations challenged in each certificate are: (a) That all moneys in the control and custody of the defendant Paisley had been accounted for, and (b) that the said Paisley had performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner.\nDealing first with the challenged representations contained in the certificate of March 1, 1922: What evidence had the jury before them as to their truth or falsity?\nIn the first place, they had the questions and answers furnished by the municipality when the bond was applied for, and which it was agreed should be taken as the basis of the bond and any subsequent renewal.\nQuestion 12 reads as follows:\n(a) What means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct? Answer: Auditors.\n(b) How frequently will they be examined? Answer: Has to be decided by council. In view of these questions and answers the jury, in my opinion, would be amply justified in concluding that the company knew and understood that the municipality would depend upon the auditors, and the auditors alone, to ascertain the correctness of Paisley\u2019s accounts. As to the correctness of these accounts they had the certificate of Inkster that he had examined the books and accounts for the year 1921, and that he found the same to be correct. They also had his evidence in court that when he finished the final audit for 1921, which was in the month of February, 1922, he checked up the cash and found that Paisley had on hand the amount of money which the audit shewed he should have. Inkster, although not a chartered accountant, had a certificate from the Government of Saskatchewan as an official auditor. As against Inkster\u2019s evidence the jury had the testimony of W. T. Scott of the firm of Griggs & Co., chartered accountant, who made the special audit, and whose testimony was to the effect that Paisley had not accounted for all the moneys coming to his hands in 1921. As between these two the jury were at liberty to accept the testimony of one and reject the other.\nAs to the proper performance by Paisley of his duties, it was contended before us, and held in the court below, that the books were not kept in an acceptable and satisfactory manner; that the test must be: Were they kept in a manner which would be satisfactory to a reasonable man? The fault attributed to Paisley was that he did not keep the books posted up to date. When money was paid to him he would give a receipt therefor, and the stub of the receipt would shew the amount which had been paid, and by whom. But when the auditor came to make his audit he found that all the amounts on the stubs had not been posted in the books, and he himself made the entries in the books which Paisley should have made. This was admitted by Paisley. Notwithstanding that Inkster swore that in making the entries he had written them up as well as he knew how, W. T. Scott, in his evidence, stated that the books had never been properly kept from the first.\nNow it is important to note the information the company was seeking to obtain from the municipality by means of the certificate. Although put in the form of an allegation the company was really asking the question: Has he performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner? Counsel for the appellant contended that the reeve by that question would understand that the company was asking him if Paisley had performed his duties in a manner satisfactory to him and his fellow councillors, and not if he had performed them in a manner which would be satisfactory to a reasonable man. It is not, in my opinion, material in this case to determine the construction which the reeve should put upon the question, because, applying the test adopted by the Court of Appeal, any man occupying the position of reeve and having before him the auditor\u2019s report for the preceding year, might very reasonably answer the question in the affirmative.\nFurthermore the certificate, being in the language of the company, is to be construed in favour of the municipality, if it is ambiguous. In Ontario Metal Products Co. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York[11], Anglin J. (now Chief Justice) said:\nThe insurers put such questions and in such form as they please, but they \u201care bound so to express them as to leave no room for ambiguity.\u201d To such a case the rule contra proferentem is eminently applicable.\nIn Condogianis v. Guardian Assurance Co.[12], Lord Shaw, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\u2014\nThe more serious proposition arose on the construction of the question and answer. In a contract of insurance it is a weighty fact that the questions are framed by the insurer, and that if an answer is obtained to such a question which is upon a fair construction a true answer, it is not open to the insuring company to maintain that the question was put in a sense different from or more comprehensive than the proponent\u2019s answer covered. Where an ambiguity exists, the contract must stand if an answer has been made to the question on a fair and reasonable construction of that question.\nThat the reeve did consider Paisley\u2019s work satisfactory is clear. Both he and the other members of the council were abundantly satisfied, not only as to Paisley\u2019s integrity, but also with the manner in which he performed his duty.\nIt was further contended that if any reasonable man had looked into the books he would have known that they had not been kept posted up. I fail to see how he would have known that, unless he also checked over the stubs of receipts for money received. But in any event the reeve testified that he looked at the books generally at each monthly meeting of the council and that as far as his knowledge went the books were kept in good shape. He further says that up to the time he signed the certificate, on March 1, 1922, the auditor had never made a suggestion that there was anything wrong with Paisley\u2019s performance of his duties. In his testimony at trial Inkster said that on one occasion he had addressed the council and drawn attention to the fact that Paisley was not keeping his books up to date. At first, he said that this was at the meeting in March, 1922, afterwards, he said it was in 1921. If the jury accepted his first statement they could readily find on the evidence of the reeve that up to March 1, 1922, Inkster had not informed the council of any failure on Paisley\u2019s part to keep his books posted to date. The duty of the reeve was\nto be vigilant and active in causing the laws governing the municipality to be duly executed, to inspect the conduct of all municipal officers and so far as in his power to cause all negligence, carelessness and violation of duty to be duly prosecuted and punished. (s. 42).\nHe was, however, under no obligation to re-audit the auditor\u2019s statement, nor was he required to have such a knowledge of book-keeping as would enable him to know whether or not the books were being properly kept. It is clear from his testimony that he did not have that knowledge and I have no doubt that in the western provinces, particularly in those districts which were settled by people from southern or central Europe, there are hundreds of reeves who, if they looked through the books of their respective municipalities from cover to cover, would be unable to tell if they were being properly written up.\nAs the reeve was not called upon to check either the auditor\u2019s statement or the secretary\u2019s books, and as the company knew he would rely upon the auditor\u2019s statement, the jury, in my opinion, were entitled to affirm the truth of the representations made by the municipality on March 1, 1922: (a) that all the money in Paisley\u2019s control and custody had been accounted for, and (b) that he had performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner.\nThere was another contention to which I refer merely to shew that it has not been overlooked. That contention was that the knowledge of the auditor that the books were not written up was the knowledge of the municipality and, therefore, the certificate of March 1, 1922, could not be true. The answer to this, in my opinion, is two-fold. First, where the parties contract on the understanding that the means which the municipality will take to ascertain the correctness of the accounts contained in the books will be the auditor, and the auditor certifies that he has examined the books and accounts and found them correct, the company cannot be heard to say that any knowledge as to the want of correctness of the books possessed by the auditor, but not communicated to the council, is the knowledge of the municipality. And secondly, that the jury found (3a) that the representation that the books had been examined and found correct was true, and no appeal was taken from the finding.\nNow we come to the representations contained in the certificate of March 16, 1923. In addition to the matters already referred to we have here additional evidence to consider. That evidence is, that when the representations of March 16, 1923, were made, the reeve and the other members of the council had in their hands the auditor\u2019s balance sheet for the year 1922, which shewed a surplus on hand of over $23,000, and they knew that the money representing that surplus was not on hand. To their knowledge they owed the bank over $4,000, and they knew that the school districts were clamouring for payments due which the municipality had no funds to meet. Being convinced that the municipality did not have the money which the balance sheet shewed should have been on hand, Swan asked Paisley for an explanation. His evidence as to the explanation received, is as follows:\u2014\nhe explained that that was redemption account, cross-entries, some of it, and some of it was bank loans. Cross-entries and bank loans anyway, I am sure of that. And he seemed to give a fairly good explanation of the matter.\nSwan testified that he was satisfied with this explanation. In my opinion he should not have been. However plausible the explanation might appear to Swan to be, he, knowing that the surplus shewn was not on hand, should not have certified to the company that Paisley\u2019s accounts were correct, without calling attention to the fact that there was a discrepancy between the auditor\u2019s surplus and the treasurer\u2019s cash. On this point I need say no more than that I agree with the Court of Appeal. The representation of March 16, 1923, that all moneys in Paisley\u2019s custody had been properly accounted for was not true, and, even if innocently made, it induced a renewal of the bond for that year. This renewal the company is entitled to have declared void.\nIn the result, therefore, the finding of the jury that the representations contained in the certificate of March 1, 1922, were true, should be restored. The jury found that when the bond was renewed in 1923, Paisley was already in default to the municipality in the sum of $3,600. For that sum the company, in my opinion, is liable.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal in part and enter judgment for the municipality for $3,600, with interest, the costs of this appeal and the costs of the action, but not the costs of appeal in the court below which go to the appellant in that court.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

Act, 1867, and therefore are not eligible for appointment by the Governor General to the Senate of Canada.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The authority of Chorlton v. Lings (L.R. 4 C.P. 374) is conclusive alike on the question of the common law incapacity of women to exercise such public functions as those of a member of the Senate of Canada and on that of their being expressly excluded from the class of \u201cqualified persons\u201d within s. 24 of the B.N.A. Act by the terms in which s. 23 is couched, so that (if otherwise applicable) Lord Broughams\u2019 Act (which enacts that \u201cwords importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females) cannot be invoked to extend the term \u201cqualified persons\u201d to bring \u201cwomen\u201d within its purview. Per Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The various provisions of the B.N.A. Act passed in the year 1867 bear to-day the same construction which the courts would, if then required to pass upon them, have given to them when they were enacted. If the phrase \u201cqualified persons\u201d in section 24 includes women to-day, it has so included them since 1867. But it must be inferred that the Imperial Parliament, in enacting sections 23, 24, 25, 26 and 32 of the B.N.A. Act, when read in the light of other provisions of the statute and of relevant circumstances proper to be considered, did not give to women the power to exercise the public functions of a senator, at a time when they were neither qualified to sit in the House of Commons nor to vote for candidates for membership in that House.\nPer Duff J.\u2014It seems to be a legitimate inference that the B.N.A. Act, in enacting the sections relating to the \u201cSenate,\u201d contemplated a second Chamber, the constitution of which should, in all respects, be fixed and determined by the Act itself, a constitution which was to be in principle the same, though, necessarily, in detail, not identical, with that of the Legislative Councils established by the earlier statutes of 1791 and 1840; and, under those statutes, it is hardly susceptible of dispute that women were not eligible for appointment.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, under and pursuant to the Supreme Court Act of certain question for hearing and consideration as to the meaning of the word \u201cpersons\u201d in section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867.\nThe Order in Council providing for the reference was dated 19th October, 1927 and reads as follows:\n\u201cThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before \u201cthem a Report, dated 18th October, 1927, from the \u201cMinister of Justice, submitting that he has had under \u201dconsideration a petition to Your Excellency in Council dated \u201cthe 27th August, 1927 (P.C. 1835), signed by Henrietta \u201cMuir Edwards, Nellie L. McClung, Louise C. McKinney, \u201cEmily F. Murphy and Irene Parlby, as persons interested \u201cin the admission of women to the Senate of Canada, \u201cwhereby Your Excellency in Council is requested to refer \u201cto the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and \u201cconsideration certain questions touching the power of the \u201cGovernor General to summon female persons to the Senate of \u201cCanada.\n\u201cThe Minister observes that by section 24 of the British\u201d North America Act, 1867, it is provided that:\u2014\n\u2018The Governor General shall from Time to Time, \u2018in the Queen\u2019s Name, by Instrument under the Great \u2018Seal of Canada, summon qualified Persons to the \u2018Senate; and, subject to the Provisions of this Act, \u2018every Person so summoned shall become and be a \u2018Member of the Senate and a Senator.\u2019\n\u201cIn the opinion of the Minister the question whether \u201cthe word \u2018Persons\u2019 in said section 24 includes female \u201cpersons is one of great public importance.\n\u201cThe Minister states that the law officers of the Crown \u201cwho have considered this question on more than one \u201coccasion have expressed the view that male persons only \u201cmay be summoned to the Senate under the provisions of \u201cthe British North America Act in that behalf.\n\u201cThe Minister, however, while not disposed to question \u201cthat view, considers that it would be an Act of justice to \u201cthe women of Canada to obtain the opinion of the \u201cSupreme Court of Canada upon the point.\n\u201cThe Committee therefore, on the recommendation of \u201cthe Minister of Justice, advise that Your Excellency may \u201cbe pleased to refer to the Supreme Court of Canada for \u201chearing and consideration the following question:\u2014\n\u201cDoes the word \u2018Persons\u2019 in section 24 of the British \u201cNorth America Act, 1867, include female persons?\u201d\nPursuant to an order of the court, notification of the hearing of the reference was sent to the Attorneys General of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Alberta and Saskatchewan and to the above petitioners. The Attorneys General of the provinces of Quebec and Alberta were represented by counsel at the hearing.\nHon. Lucien Cannon K.C., Solicitor-General, Eng. Lafleur K.C. and C. P. Plaxton K.C. for the Attorney General of Canada.\nN. W. Rowell K.C. and G. C. Lindsay for the petitioners.\nChas. Lanctot K.C. for the Attorney General for Quebec.\nN. W. Rowell K.C. for the Attorney General for Alberta. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014By Order of the 19th of October, 1927, made on a petition of five ladies, His Excellency the Governor in Council was pleased to refer to this court \u201cfor hearing and consideration\u201d the question:\n\u201cDoes the word \u2018Persons\u2019 in section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, include female persons?\u201d\nNotice of this reference was published in the Canada Gazette and notice of the hearing was duly given to the petitioners and to each of the Attorneys General of the several provinces of Canada. Argument took place on the 14th of March last when counsel were heard representing the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorneys General of the provinces of Quebec and Alberta and the petitioners.\nSection 24 is one of a group, or fasciculus of sections in the British North America Act, 1867, numbered 21 to 36, which provides for the constitution of the Senate of Canada. This group of sections (omitting three which are irrelevant to the question before us) reads as follows:\nTHE SENATE\n21. The Senate shall, subject to the Provisions of this Act, consist of Seventy-two Members, who shall be styled Senators.\n* * * *\n23. The Qualification of a Senator shall be as follows:\n(2) He shall be of the full age of Thirty Years;\n(2) He shall be either a Natural-born Subject of the Queen, or a Subject of the Queen naturalized by an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or of the Legislature of One of the Provinces of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick, before the Union, or of the Parliament of Canada after the Union;\n(3) He shall be legally or equitably seised as of Freehold for his own Use and Benefit of Lands or Tenements held in free and common Socage, or seised or possessed for his own Use and Benefit of Lands or Tenements held in Francalleu or in Roture, within the Province for which he is appointed, of the value of Four thousand Dollars, over and above all Rents, Dues, Debts, Charges, Mortgages, and Incumbrances due or payable out of or charged on or affecting the same;\n(4) His Real and Personal Property shall be together worth Four Thousand Dollars over and above his Debts and Liabilities;\n(5) He shall be resident in the Province for which he is appointed;\n(6) In the case of Quebec he shall have his Real Property Qualification in the Electoral Division for which he is appointed, or shall be resident in that Division.\n24. The Governor General shall from Time to Time, in the Queen\u2019s Name, by Instrument under the Great Seal of Canada, summon qualified Persons to the Senate; and, subject to the Provisions of this Act, every Person so summoned shall become and be a Member of the Senate and a Senator.\n25. Such Persons shall be first summoned to the Senate as the Queen by Warrant under Her Majesty\u2019s Royal Sign Manual thinks fit to approve, and their Names shall be inserted in the Queen\u2019s Proclamation of Union.\n26. If at any Time on the Recommendation of the Governor General the Queen thinks fit to direct that Three or Six Members be added to the Senate, the Governor General may by Summons to Three or Six qualified Persons (as the Case may be), representing equally the Three Divisions of Canada, add to the Senate accordingly.\n27. In case of such Addition being at any Time made the Governor General shall not summon any Person to the Senate, except on a further like Direction by the Queen on the like Recommendation, until each of the Three Divisions of Canada is represented by Twenty-four Senators and no more.\n28. The Number of Senators shall not at any Time exceed Seventy-eight.\n29. A Senator shall, subject to the Provisions of this Act, hold his Place in the Senate for Life.\n30. A Senator may by Writing under his Hand addressed to the Governor General resign his Place in the Senate, and thereupon the same shall be vacant.\n31. The Place of a Senator shall become vacant in any of the following Cases:\u2014\n(1) If for Two consecutive Sessions of the Parliament he fails to give his Attendance in the Senate.\n(2) If he takes an Oath or makes a Declaration or Acknowledgment of Allegiance, Obedience, or Adherence to a Foreign Power, or does an Act whereby he becomes a Subject or Citizen, or entitled to the Rights or Privileges of a Subject or Citizen, of a Foreign Power;\n(3) If he is adjudged Bankrupt or Insolvent, or applies for the Benefit of any Law relating to Insolvent Debtors, or becomes a public Defaulter;\n(4) If he is attainted of Treason or convicted of Felony or any Infamous Crime;\n(5) If he ceases to be qualified in respect of Property or of Residence; provided that a Senator shall not be deemed to have ceased to be qualified in respect of Residence by reason only of his residing at the Seat of the Government of Canada while holding an Office under that Government requiring his Presence there.\n32. When a Vacancy happens in the Senate by Resignation, Death, or otherwise, the Governor General shall by summons to a fit and qualified Person fill the Vacancy.\n33. If any question arises respecting the qualification of a Senator or a Vacancy in the Senate the same shall be heard and determined by the Senate.\n* * *\n35. Until the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides, the Presence of at least Fifteen Senators, including the Speaker, shall be necessary to constitute a Meeting of the Senate for the Exercise of its Powers.\n* * * The British North America Act, 1867, does not contain provisions in regard to the Senate corresponding to its sections 41 and 52, which, respectively, empower the Parliament of Canada from time to time to alter the qualifications or disqualifications of persons to be elected to the House of Commons and to determine the number of members of which that House shall consist. Except in regard to the number of Senators required to constitute a quorum (s. 35), the provisions affecting the constitution of the Senate are subject to alteration only by the Imperial Parliament.\nSection 33 which empowers the Senate to hear and determine any question that may arise respecting the qualification of a Senator, applies only after the person whose qualification is challenged has been appointed or summoned to the Senate. That section is probably no more than declaratory of a right inherent in every parliamentary body. (Vide clause 1 of the preamble to the B.N.A. Act and the quotation of Lord Lyndhurst\u2019s language made from Mac-Queen\u2019s Debates on The Life Peerage Question, at p. 300, by Viscount Haldane in Viscountess Rhondda\u2019s Claim[1].\nIt should be observed that, while the question now submitted by His Excellency to the court deals with the word \u201cPersons,\u201d section 24 of the B.N.A. Act speaks only of \u201cqualified Persons\u201d; and the other sections empowering the Governor General to make appointments to the Senate (26 and 32) speak, respectively, of \u201cqualified Persons\u201d and of \u201cfit and qualified Persons.\u201d The question which we have to consider, therefore, is whether \u201cfemale persons\u201d are qualified to be summoned to the Senate by the Governor General; or, in other words\u2014Are women eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada? That question it is the duty of the court to \u201canswer\u201d and to \u201ccertify to the Governor in Council for his information * * * its opinion * * * with the reasons for * * * such answer.\u201d Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. [1927] c. 35, s. 55, subs. 2.\nIn considering this matter we are, of course, in no wise concerned with the desirability or the undesirability of the presence of women in the Senate, nor with any political aspect of the question submitted. Our whole duty is to construe, to the best of our ability, the relevant provisions of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, and upon that construction to base our answer.\nPassed in the year 1867, the various provisions of the B.N.A. Act (as is the case with other statutes, Bank of Toronto v. Lambe)[2] bear to-day the same construction which the courts would, if then required to pass upon them, have given to them when they were first enacted. If the phrase \u201cqualified persons\u201d in s. 24 includes women to-day, it has so included them since 1867.\nIn a passage from Stradling v. Morgan[3], often quoted, the Barons of the Exchequer pointed out that:\nThe Sages of the Law heretofore have construed Statutes quite contrary to the Letter in some appearance, and those Statutes which comprehend all things in the Letter they have expounded to extend but to some Things, and those which generally prohibit all people from doing such an Act they have interpreted to permit some People to do it and those which include every Person in the Letter they have adjudged to reach to some Persons only, which Expositions have always been founded upon the Intent of the Legislature, which they have collected sometimes by considering the cause and Necessity of making the Act, sometimes by comparing one part of the Act with another, and sometimes by foreign Circumstances. So that they have been guided by the Intent of the Legislature, which they have always taken according to the Necessity of the Matter, and according to that which is consonant with Reason and good Discretion.\n\u201cIn deciding the question before us\u201d, said Turner L. J., in Hawkins v. Gathercole)[4],\nwe have to construe not merely the words of the Act of Parliament but the intent of the Legislature as collected, from the cause and necessity of the Act being made, from a comparison of its several parts and from foreign (meaning extraneous) circumstances so far as they can be justly considered to throw light upon the subject.\nTwo well-known rules in the construction of statutes are that, where a statute is susceptible of more than one meaning, in the absence of express language an intention to abrogate the ordinary rules of law is not to be imputed to Parliament (Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[5]); and,\nas they are framed for the guidance of the people, their language is to be considered in its ordinary and popular sense, per Byles J., in Chorlton v. Lings[6].\nTwo outstanding facts or circumstances of importance bearing upon the present reference appear to be (a) that the office of Senator was a new office first created by the B.N.A. Act.\nIt is an office, therefore, which no one apart from the enactments of the statute has an inherent or common law right of holding, and the right of any one to hold the office must be found within the four corners of of the statute which creates the office, and enacts the conditions upon which it is to be held, and the persons who are entitled to hold it; (Beresford-Hope v. Sandhurst[7], per Lord Coleridge, C.J.);\n(b) that by the common law of England (as also, speaking generally, by the civil and the canon law: foeminae ab omnibus officiis civilibus vel publicis remotae sunt) women were under a legal incapacity to hold public office,\nreferable to the fact (as Willes J., said in Chorlton v. Lings[8], that in this country in modern times, chiefly out of respect to women, and a sense of decorum, and not from their want of intellect, or their being for any other such reason unfit to take part in the government of the country, they have been excused from taking any share in this department of public affairs.\nThe same very learned judge had said, at p. 388:\nWomen are under a legal incapacity to vote at elections. What was the cause of it, it is not necessary to go into: but, admitting that fickleness of judgment and liability to influence have sometimes been suggested as the ground of exclusion, I must protest against its being supposed to arise in this country from any underrating of the sex either in point of intellect or worth. That would be quite inconsistent with one of the glories of our civilization, the respect and honour in which women are held. This is not a mere fancy of my own, but will be found in Selden, de Synedriis Veterum Ebraeorum, in the discussion of the origin of the exclusion of women from judicial and like public functions, where the author gives preference to this reason, that the exemption was founded upon motives of decorum, and was a privilege of the sex (honestatis privilegium): Selden\u2019s Works, vol. 1, pp. 1083-1085. Selden refers to many systems of law in which this exclusion prevailed, including the civil law and the canon law, which latter, as we know, excluded women from public functions in some remarkable instances. With respect to the civil law, I may add a reference to the learned and original work of Sir Patrick Colquhon (sic) on the Roman Law, vol. 1, c. 580, where he compares the Roman system with ours, and states that a woman \u201ccannot vote for members of parliament, or sit in either the House of Lords or Commons.\u201d\nAs put by Lord Esher, M. R. (who, however, says he had \u201ca stronger view than some of (his) brethern\u201d) in Beresford-Hope v. Sandhurst[9]\nI take the first proposition to be that laid down by Willes J., in the case of Chorlton v. Lings[10]. I take it that by neither the common law nor the constitution of this country from the beginning of the common law until now can a woman be entitled to exercise any public functions. Willes J., stated so in that case, and a more learned judge never lived. While Willes, J., had spoken of \u201cjudicial and like public functions\u201d at p. 388, the tenor of his judgment indicates unmistakably that it was his view that to the legal incapacity of women for public office there were few, if any, exceptions. See De Soma v. Cobden[11].\nThe same idea is expressed by Viscount Birkenhead L.C., in rejecting The Viscountess Rhondda\u2019s Claim to a Writ of Summons to the House of Lords[12].\nBy her sex she is not\u2014except in a wholly loose and colloquial sense\u2014disqualified from the exercise of this right. In respect of her dignity she is a subject of rights which ex vi termini cannot include this right\nViscount Haldane, who dissented in the Rhondda Case12, said, at p. 386:\nThe reason why peeresses were not entitled to it (the writ of summons) was simply that as women they could not exercise the public function. That appears to have been the considered conclusion of James Shaw Willes J., one of the most learned and accurate exponents of the law of England who ever sat on the Bench. He says in Chorlton v. Lings[13] that the absence of all rights of this kind is referable to the fact that by the common law women have been excused from taking any part in public affairs.\nReference may also be had to Brown v. Ingram[14]; Hall v. Incorporated Society of Law Agents[15]; Rex v. Crossthwaite[16], and to the judgment of Gray C.J., in Robinson\u2019s Case[17], and also to Pollock & Maitland\u2019s History of English Law, vol. 1, pp. 465-8.\nPrior to 1867 the common law legal incapacity of women to sit in Parliament had been fully recognized in the three provinces\u2014Canada (Upper and Lower), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which were then confederated as the Dominion of Canada.\nMoreover, paraphrasing an observation of Lord Coleridge C.J., in Beresford-Hope v. Sandhurst[18], it is not also perhaps to be entirely left out of sight, that in the sixty years which have run since 1867, the questions of the rights and privileges of women have not been, as in former times they were, asleep. On the contrary, we know as a matter of fact that the rights of women, and the privileges of women, have been much discussed, and able and acute minds have been much exercised as to what privileges ought to be conceded to women. That has been going on, and surely it is a significant fact, that never from 1867 to the present time has any woman ever sat in the Senate of Canada, nor has any suggestion of women\u2019s eligibility for appointment to that House until quite recently been publicly made.\nHas the Imperial Parliament, in sections 23, 24, 25, 26 and 32 of the B.N.A. Act, read in the light of other provisions of the statute and of relevant circumstances proper to be considered, given to women the capacity to exercise the public functions of a Senator? Has it made clear its intent to effect, so far as the personnel of the Senate of Canada is concerned, the striking constitutional departure from the common law for which the petitioners contend, which would have rendered women eligible for appointment to the Senate at a time when they were neither qualified to sit in the House of Commons nor to vote for candidates for membership in that House? Has it not rather by clear implication, if not expressly, excluded them from membership in the Senate? Such an extraordinary privilege is not conferred furtively, nor is the purpose to grant it to be gathered from remote conjectures deduced from a skilful piecing together of expressions in a statute which are more or less precisely accurate. (Nairn v. University of St. Andrews[19]). When Parliament contemplates such a decided innovation it is never at a loss for language to make its intention unmistakable. \u201cA judgment\u201d, said Lord Robertson in the case last mentioned, at pp. 165-6\nis wholesome and of good example which puts forward subject-matter and fundamental constitutional law as guides of construction never to be neglected in favour of verbal possibilities.\nThere can be no doubt that the word \u201cpersons\u201d when standing alone prima facie includes women. (Per Lore-burn L.C., Nairn v. University of St. Andrews18). It connotes human beings\u2014the criminal and the insane equally with the good and the wise citizen, the minor as well as the adult. Hence the propriety of the restriction placed upon it by the immediately preceding word \u201cqualified\u201d in ss. 24 and 26 and the words \u201cfit and qualified\u201d in s. 32, which exclude the criminal and the lunatic or imbecile as well as the minor, who is explicitly disqualified by s. 23 (1). Does this requirement of qualification also exclude women?\nEx facie, and apart from their designation as \u201cSenators\u201d (s. 21), the terms in which the qualifications of members of the Senate are specified in s. 23 (and it is to those terms that reference is made by the word \u201cqualified\u201d in s. 24) import that men only are eligible for appointment. In every clause of s. 23 the Senator is referred to by the masculine pronoun\u2014\u201che\u201d and \u201chis\u201d; and the like observation applies to ss. 29 and 31. Frost v. The King[20]. Moreover, clause 2 of section 23 includes only \u201cnatural-born\u201d subjects and those \u201cnaturalized\u201d under statutory authority and not those who become subjects by marriage\u2014a provision which one would have looked for had it been intended to include women as eligible.\nCounsel for the petitioners sought to overcome the difficulty thus presented in two ways:\n(a) by a comparison of s. 24 with other sections in the B.N.A. Act, in which, he contended, the word \u201cpersons\u201d is obviously used in its more general signification as including women as well as men, notably ss. 11, 14 and 41.\n(b) by invoking the aid of the statutory interpretation provision in force in England in 1867\u201413-14 Vict., c. 21, s. 4, known as Lord Brougham\u2019s Act\u2014which reads as follows:\nBe it enacted that in all Acts words importing the Masculine Gender shall be deemed and taken to include Females, and the Singular to include the Plural, and the Plural the Singular, unless the contrary as to Gender or Number is expressly provided.\n(a) A short but conclusive answer to the argument based on a comparison of s. 24 with other sections of the B.N.A. Act in which the word \u201cpersons\u201d appears is that in none of them is its connotation restricted, as it is in s. 24, by the adjective \u201cqualified.\u201d \u201cPersons\u201d is a word of equivocal signification, sometimes synonymous with human beings, sometimes including only men.\nIt is an ambiguous word, says Lord Ashbourne, and must be examined and construed in the light of surrounding circumstances and constitutional law Nairn v. University of St. Andrews[21]. In section 41 of the B.N.A. Act, which deals with the qualifications for membership of the House of Commons and of the voters at elections of such members, \u201cpersons\u201d would seem to be used in its wider signification, since, while in both these matters the legislation affecting the former Provincial Houses of Assembly, or Legislative Assemblies, is thereby made applicable to the new House of Commons, it remains so only \u201cuntil the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides.\u201d It seems reasonably clear that it was intended to confer on the Parliament of Canada an untrammelled discretion as to the personnel of the membership of the House of Commons and as to the conditions of and qualifications for the franchise of its electorate; and so the Canadian Parliament has assumed, as witness the Dominion Elections Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 53, ss. 29 and 38. It would, therefore, seem necessary to give to the word \u201cpersons\u201d in s. 41 of the B.N.A. Act the wider signification of which it is susceptible in the absence of adjectival restriction.\nBut, in s. 11, which provides for the constitution of the new Privy Council for Canada, the word \u201cpersons\u201d, though unqualified, is probably used in the more restricted sense of \u201cmale persons.\u201d For the public offices thereby created women were, by the common law, ineligible and it would be dangerous to assume that by the use of the ambiguous term \u201cpersons\u201d the Imperial Parliament meant in 1867 to bring about so vast a constitutional change affecting Canadian women, as would be involved in making them eligible for selection as Privy Councillors. A similar comment may be made upon s. 14, which enables the Governor General to appoint a Deputy or Deputies.\nAs put by Lord Loreburn in Nairn v. University of St. Andrews[22]:\nIt would require a convincing demonstration to satisfy me that Parliament intended to effect a constitutional change so momentous and far-reaching by so furtive a process.\nWith Lord Robertson (ibid. at pp. 165-6), to mere \u201cverbal possibilities\u201d we prefer \u201csubject-matter and fundamental constitutional law as guides of construction.\u201d When Parliament intends to overcome a fundamental constitutional incapacity it does not employ such an equivocal expression as is the word \u201cpersons\u201d when used in regard to eligibility for a newly created public office. Neither from s. 11 or s. 14 nor from s. 41, therefore, can the petitioners derive support for their contention as to the construction of the phrase \u201cqualified persons\u201d in s. 24.\nSection 63 of the B.N.A. Act, the only other section to which Mr. Rowell referred, deals with the constitution of the Executive Councils of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. But, since, by s. 92 (1), each provincial legislature is empowered to amend the constitution of the province except as regards the office of Lieutenant-Governor, the presence of women as members of some provincial executive councils has no significance in regard to the scope of the phrase \u201cqualified persons\u201d in s. 24 of the B.N.A. Act.\n(b) \u201cPersons\u201d is not a \u201cword importing the masculine gender.\u201d Therefore, ex facie, Lord Brougham\u2019s Act has no application to it. It is urged, however, that that statute so affects the word \u201cSenator\u201d and the pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201chis\u201d in s. 23 that they must be \u201cdeemed and taken to include Females\u201d, \u201cthe contrary\u201d not being \u201cexpressly provided.\u201d\nThe application and purview of Lord Brougham\u2019s Act came up for consideration in Chorlton v. Lings[23], where the Court of Common Pleas was required to construe a statute (passed, like the British North America Act, in 1867) which conferred the parliamentary franchise on \u201cevery man\u201d possessing certain qualifications and registered as a voter. The chief question discussed was whether, by virtue of Lord Brougham\u2019s Act, \u201cevery man\u201d included \u201cwomen\u201d. Holding that \u201cwomen\u201d were \u201csubject to a legal incapacity from voting at the election of members of Parliament\u201d, the court unanimously decided that the word \u201cman\u201d in the statute did not include a \u201cwoman\u201d. Having regard to the subject-matter of the statute and its general scope and language and to the important and striking nature of the departure from the common law involved in extending the franchise to women, Bovill C.J., declined to accept the view that Parliament had made that change by using the term \u201cman\u201d and held that\nthis word was intentionally used expressly to designate the male sex; and that it amounts to an express enactment and provision that every man, as distinguished from women, possessing the qualification, is to have the franchise. In that view, Lord Brougham\u2019s Act does not apply to the present case, and does not extend the meaning of the word \u201cman\u201d so as to include \u201cwomen.\u201d (386-7).\nWilles J., said, at p. 387:\nI am of the same opinion. The application of the Act, 13-14 Vict., c. 21, (Lord Brougham\u2019s Act) contended for by the appellant is a strained one. It is not easy to conceive that the framer of the Act, when he used the word \u201cexpressly,\u201d meant to suggest that what is necessarily or properly implied by language is not expressed by such language. It is quite clear that whatever the language used necessarily or even naturally implies, is expressed thereby. Still less did the framer of the Act intend to exclude the rule alike of good sense and grammer and law, that general words are to be restrained to the subject-matter with which the speaker or writer is dealing.\nByles J., said, at p. 393:\nThe difficulty, if any, is created by the use of the word \u201cexpressly\u201d But that word does not necessarily mean \u201cexpressly excluded by words\u201d . . . The word \u201cexpressly\u201d often means no more than plainly, clearly, or the like; as will appear on reference to any English dictionary.\nAnd he concluded:\nI trust * * * our unanimous decision will forever exorcise and lay this ghost of a doubt, which ought never to have made its appearance.\nKeating J., said, at pp. 394-5:\nConsidering that there is no evidence of women ever having voted for members of parliament in cities or boroughs, and that they have been deemed for centuries to be legally incapable of so doing, one would have expected that the legislature, if desirous of making an alteration so important and extensive as to admit them to the franchise, would have said so plainly and distinctly: whereas, in the present case, they have used expressions never before supposed to include women when found in previous Acts of Parliament of a similar character. * * * But it is said that the word \u201cman\u201d in the present Act must be construed to include \u201cwoman\u201d because by 13-14 Vict., c. 21, s. 4, it is enacted that \u201cIn all Acts, words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females, unless the contrary is expressly provided.\u201d Now all that s. 4 of 13 and 14 Vict., c. 21 could have meant by the enactment referred to was, that, in future Acts, words importing the masculine gender should be taken to include females, where a contrary intention should not appear. To do more would be exceeding the competency of Parliament with reference to future legislation.\nThe later Interpretation Act of 1889 (52-53 Vict., c. 63), which (s. 41) repealed Lord Brougham\u2019s Act, substituted by s. 1, under the heading \u201cRe-enactment of Existing Rules\u201d for its words \u201cunless the contrary as to Gender and Number is expressly provided\u201d their equivalent, suggested by Mr. Justice Keating, \u201cunless the contrary intention appears\u201d. Frost v. The King[24]. Keating J. concluded his judgment by saying (p. 396):\nMr. Coleridge, who ably argued the case for the appellant, made an eloquent appeal as to the injustice of excluding females from the exercise of the franchise. This, however, is not a matter within our province. It is for the legislature to consider whether the existing incapacity ought to be removed. But, should Parliament in its wisdom determine to do so, doubtless it will be done by the use of language very different from anything that is to be found in the present Act of Parliament.\nSimilar views prevailed in The Queen v. Harrald[25], and Bebb v. The Law Society[26].\nThe decision in Chorlton v. Lings[27] is of the highest authority, as was recognized in the House of Lords by Earl Loreburn, L.C., in Nairn v. University of St. Andrews[28], and again by Viscount Birkenhead, L.C., in rejecting the claim of Viscountess Rhondda to sit in the House of Lords, with the concurrence of Viscount Cave, and Lords Atkinson, Phillimore, Buckmaster, Sumner and Carson, as well as by Viscount Haldane, who dissented[29].\nIn his speech, at p. 375, the Lord Chancellor said:\u2014\nIt is sufficient to say that the Legislature in dealing with this matter cannot be taken to have departed from the usage of centuries or to have employed such loose and ambiguous words to carry out so momentous a revolution in the constitution of this House. And I am content to base my judgment on this alone.\nIn our opinion Chorlton v. Lings26 is conclusive against the petitioners alike on the question of the common law incapacity of women to exercise such public functions as those of a member of the Senate of Canada and on that of their being expressly excluded from the class of \u201cqualified persons\u201d within s. 24 of the B.N.A. Act by the terms in which s. 23 is couched (New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer)[30], so that Lord Brougham\u2019s Act cannot be invoked to extend those terms to bring \u201cwomen\u201d within their purview.\nWe are, for these reasons, of the opinion that women are not eligible for appointment by the Governor General to the Senate of Canada under Section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, because they are not \u201cqualified persons\u201d within the meaning of that section. The question submitted, understood as above indicated, will, accordingly, be answered in the negative. Duff J.\u2014The interrogatory submitted is, in effect, this: Is the word \u201cpersons\u201d in section 24 of the B.N.A. Act the equivalent of male persons? \u201cPersons\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word includes, of course, natural persons of both sexes. But the sense of words is often radically affected by the context in which they are found, as well as by the occasion on which they are used; and in construing a legislative enactment, considerations arising not only from the context, but from the nature of the subject matter and object of the legislation, may require us to ascribe to general words a scope more restricted than their usual import, in order loyally to effectuate the intention of the legislature. And for this purpose, it is sometimes the duty of a court of law to resort, not only to other provisions of the enactment itself, but to the state of the law at the time the enactment was passed, and to the history, especially the legislative history, of the subjects with which the enactment deals. The view advanced by the Crown is that following this mode of approach, and employing the legitimate aids to interpretation thus indicated, we are constrained in construing section 24, to read the word \u201c persons \u201c in the restricted sense above mentioned, and to construe the section as authorizing the summoning of male persons only.\nThe question for decision is whether this is the right interpretation of that section.\nIt is convenient first to recall the general character and purpose of the B.N.A. Act. The object of the Act was to create for British North America, a system of parliamentary government under the British Crown, the executive authority being vested in the Queen of the United Kingdom. While the system was to be a federal or quasi federal one, the constitution was, nevertheless, to be \u201csimilar in principle\u201d to that of the United Kingdom; a canon involving the acceptance of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in two senses, first that Parliament and the Legislatures, unlike the legislatures and Congress in the U.S., were, subject to the limitations necessarily imposed by the division of powers between the local and central authorities, to possess, within their several spheres, full jurisdiction, free from control by the courts; and second, in the sense of parliamentary control over the executive, or executive responsibility to Parliament. In pursuance of this design, Parliament and the local legislatures were severally invested with legislative jurisdiction over defined subjects which, with limited exceptions, embrace the whole field of legislative activity.\nMore specifically, the legislative authority of Parliament extends over all matters concerning the peace, order and good government of Canada; and it may with confidence be affirmed that, excepting such matters as are assigned to the provinces, and such as are definitely dealt with by the Act itself, and subject, moreover, to an exception of undefined scope having relation to the sovereign, legislative authority throughout its whole range is committed to Parliament. As regards the executive, the declaration in the preamble already referred to, involves, as I have said, as a principle of the system, the responsibility of the executive to Parliament.\nThe argument advanced before us in favour of the limited construction is this: Women, it is said, at the time of the passing of the B.N.A. Act, were, under the common law, as well as under the civil law, relieved from the duties of public office or place, by a general rule of law, which affected them (except in certain ascertained or ascertainable cases) with a personal incapacity to accept or perform such duties; and, in particular, women were excluded by the law and practice of parliamentary institutions, both in England and in Canada, and indeed in the English speaking world, from holding a place in any legislative or deliberative body, and from voting for the election of a member of any such body. It must be assumed, it is said, that if the authors of the B.N.A. Act had intended, in the system established by the Act, to depart from this law or practice sanctioned by inveterate policy, the intention would have been expressed in unmistakeable and explicit words. The word \u201cpersons,\u201d it is said, when employed in a statute, dealing with the constitution of a legislative body, and with cognate matters, does not necessarily include female persons, and in an enactment on such a subject passed in the year 1867 prima facie excludes them.\nIn support of this view, a series of decisions and judgments, from 1868 to 1922, delivered by English judges of the highest authority, are adduced, in which it was held that such general words were not in themselves adequate evidence of an intention to reverse the inveterate usage and policy in respect of the exclusion of women from the parliamentary franchise, from the legal professions, from a university Senate, from the House of Lords; and in particular, two judgments of Lord Loreburn and Lord Birkenhead, which, pronounced with convincing force, against reading a modern statute in such a manner as to effect momentous changes in the political constitution of the country, by, in the one case, admitting women to the parliamentary franchise, and in the other, to the House of Lords, in the absence of words plainly and explicitly declaring that such was the intention of Parliament.\nSection 24, of course, in applying this principle, must not be treated as an independent enactment. The Senate is part of a parliamentary system; and, in order to test the contention, based upon this principle, that women are excluded from participating in working the Senate or any of the other institutions set up by the Act, one is bound to consider the Act as a whole, in its bearing on this subject of the exclusion of women from public office and place. Obviously, there are three general lines or policy which the authors of the statute might have pursued in relation to that subject. First, they might by a constitutional rule embodied in the statute, have perpetuated the legal rule affecting women with a personal incapacity for undertaking public duties, thus placing this subject among the limited number of subjects that are withdrawn from the authority of Parliament and the legislatures; second, they might, by a constitutional rule, in the opposite sense, embodied in the Act, have made women eligible for all public places or offices, or any of them, and thus, or to that extent, also, have withdrawn the subject from the legislative jurisdiction created by the act. They might, on the other hand, with respect to all public employments, or with respect to one or more of them, have recognized the existence of the legal incapacity, but left it to Parliament and the legislatures to remove that incapacity, or to perpetuate it as they might see fit. For example, they might have restricted the Governor in Council, in summoning persons to the Senate under section 24, by requiring him to address his summons to persons only who are under no such legal incapacity, which would have made women ineligible, but only so long as such incapacity remained, and at the same time have left it within the power of the Parliament to obliterate the cause of the disability. The generality of the word \u201cpersons\u201d in section 24 is, in point of law, susceptible of any qualification necessary to bring it into harmony with any of those three possible modes of treating the subject.\nI have been unable to accept the argument in support of the limited construction, in so far as it rests upon the view that in construing the legislative and executive powers granted by the B.N.A. Act, we must proceed upon a general presumption against the eligibility of women for public office. I have come to the conclusion that there is a special ground, which I will state later, upon which the restricted construction of section 24 must be maintained but before stating that, I think it is right to explain why it is I think the general presumption contended for, has not been established.\nAnd first, one must consider the provisions of the Act themselves, apart from the \u201cextraneous circumstances\u201d, except for such references as may be necessary to make the enactments of the Act intelligible.\nIt would, I think, hardly be disputed that, as a general rule, the legislative authority of Parliament, and of legislatures enables them, each in their several fields, to deal fully with this subject of the incapacity of women. You could not hold otherwise without refusing effect to the language of secs. 91 and 92; and indeed, one feels constrained to say, without ignoring the fact that the authors of the Act were engaged in creating a system of representative government for the people of half a continent. Counsel did, in the course of argument, suggest the possibility that Parliament, in extending the Parliamentary franchise to women, had exceeded its powers, but I do not think that was seriously pressed.\nThere can be no doubt that the Act does, in two sections, recognize the authority of Parliament and of the legislatures, to deal with the disqualification of women to be elected, or sit or vote as members of the representative body, or to vote in an election of such members. These sections are 41 and 84. I quote section 41 in full,\nUntil the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides, all Laws in force in the several Provinces at the Union relative to the following Matters or any of them, namely,\u2014the Qualifications and Disqualifications of Persons to be elected or to sit or vote as Members of the House of Assembly or Legislative Assembly in the several Provinces, the Voters at Elections of such Members, the Oaths to be taken by Voters, the Returning Officers, their Powers and Duties, the Proceedings at Elections, the Periods during which Elections may be continued, the Trial of controverted Elections, and Proceedings incident thereto, the vacating of Seats of Members, and the Execution of new Writs in case of Seats vacated otherwise than by Dissolution,\u2014shall respectively apply to Elections of Members to serve in the House of Commons for the same several Provinces.\nProvided that, until the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides, at any Election for a Member of the House of Commons for the District of Algoma, in addition to Persons qualified by the Law of the Province of Canada to vote, every male British Subject, aged Twenty-one Years or upwards, being a Householder, shall have a Vote.\nTo appreciate the purport of this section, it is necessary to note that in all the confederated provinces, women were disqualified as voters, that in one of the provinces, they were excluded, co nomine, from places in the Legislative Assembly, and that in another, they were expressly excluded, but referentially, by the disqualification of all persons not qualified to vote; the right to vote having been confined explicitly to males. The phrase therefore \u201cdisqualification of persons to be elected or to sit or vote as members of the House of Assembly or Legislative Assembly in the various provinces\u201d, denotes disqualifications, which include inter alia disqualifications of women, while at the same time, the section recognizes the authority of the Dominion to legislate upon that subject. Mr. Rowell seemed to suggest that the legislative authority of Parliament, on the subject of qualification of members and voters, is derived from this section. I do not think so. It is given, it seems to me, under the general language of section 91, which obviously in its terms embraces it; but that does not affect the substance of the argument founded upon the section, which recognizes in the clearest manner, and by express reference, the authority of Parliament to deal with the subject of the disqualification of women in those aspects, women being demonstrably comprehended under the nomen generale \u201cpersons\u201d. This section 41 is taken almost verbatim from section 26 of the Quebec Resolutions, upon which the B.N.A. Act was mainly founded. It is difficult to suppose that the members of the Conference, who agreed upon these Resolutions, were unaware that, in that section, they were dealing with the subject. Section 84 is expressed in the same terms, and there can, I think, be no warrant for attributing to the phrase quoted (or to the word \u201cpersons\u201d which is part of it), diverse effects in the two sections. Indeed, there can be no doubt, that the province of Canada had enjoyed full authority under the Act of Union (and probably the Maritime provinces as well) to legislate upon the constitution of the Legislative Assembly, and the right to vote in the election of members to that body. Nor is it, I think, doubtful that, under section 1 of the Union Act Amendment Act, 1854, the legislature of Canada had full power to deal with the subject of qualifications of members of the Legislative Council, and to determine (subject it is true, to any bill upon the subject being reserved for Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure), whether or not women (here again comprehended in that section under the generic word \u201cpersons\u201d) should be eligible for places therein.\nThe subject of the qualification and disqualification of women as members of the House of Commons, being thus recognized as within the jurisdiction of Parliament, is it quite clear that the construction of the general words of section 11 dealing with the constitution of the Privy Council, is governed by the general presumption suggested? Inferentially, in laying down the \u201cprinciple\u201d of the British Constitution as the foundation of the new policy, the preamble recognizes, as stated above, the responsibility of the Executive to Parliament, or rather to the elective branch of the legislature, and the right of Parliament to insist that the advisers of the Crown shall be persons possessing its \u201cconfidence\u201d, as the phrase is.\nThe subject of \u201cresponsible government,\u201d as the phrase went, had been for many years the field of a bitter controversy, especially in the province of Canada. The Colonial office had encountered great difficulties in reconciling, in practice, the full adoption of this principle with proper recognization of the position of the Governor as the representative of the Imperial Government. It was only a few years before 1867 that Sir John Macdonald\u2019s suggestion had been accepted, by which \u201cGovernor-in-Council\u201d in Commissions, Instructions and Statutes was read as the Governor acting on the advice of his Council, which was thus enabled to transact business in the Governor\u2019s absence. There can be no doubt that this inter-relation between the executive and the representative branches of the government was, in the view of the framers of the Act, a most important element in the constitutional principles which they intended to be the foundation of the new structure.\nIt might be suggested, I cannot help thinking, with some plausibility, that there would be something incongruous in a parliamentary system professedly conceived and fashioned on this principle, if persons fully qualified to be members of the House of Commons were by an iron rule of the constitution, a rule beyond the reach of Parliament, excluded from the Cabinet or the Government; if a class of persons who might reach any position of political influence, power or leadership in the House of Commons, were permanently, by an organic rule, excluded from the Government. In view of the intimate relation between the House of Commons and the Cabinet, and the rights of initiation and control, which the Government possesses in relation to legislation and parliamentary business generally, and which, it cannot be doubted, the authors of the Act intended and expected would continue, that would not, I think, be a wholly baseless suggestion.\nThe word \u201cpersons\u201d is employed in a number of sections of the Act (secs. 41, 83, 84 and 133) as designating members of the House of Commons, and though the word appears without an adjective, indubitably it is used in the unrestricted sense as embracing persons of both sexes; while in secs. 41 and 84, where males only are intended, that intention is expressed in appropriate specific words.\nSuch general inferences therefore as may arise from the language of the Act as a whole cannot be said to support a presumption in favour of the restricted interpretation.\nNor am I convinced that the reasoning based upon the \u201cextraneous circumstances\u201d we are asked to consider\u2014the disabilities of women under the common law, and the law and practice of Parliament in respect of appointment to public place or office\u2014establishes a rule of interpretation for the British North America Act, by which the construction of powers, legislative and executive, bestowed in general\nterms is controlled by a presumptive exclusion of women from participation in the working of the institutions set up by the Act.\nWhen a statutory enactment expressed in general terms is relied upon as creating or sanctioning a fundamental legal or political change, the nature of the supposed change may, in itself, be such as to leave no doubt that it could have been effected, or authorized, if at all, only after full deliberation, and that the intention to do so would have been evidenced in apt or unmistakable enactments. In Cox v. Hakes[31], Lord Halsbury was content to rest his judgment on his conviction that, in a matter affecting vitally the legal securities for personal freedom, the \u201cpolicy of centuries\u201d would not be reversed by Parliament, by the use of a single general phrase; and in the decisions concerning the disabilities of women, from 1868 to 1922, a similar line of reasoning played no insignificant part, as we have seen. Such reasoning has also been considered to give support to the view that the prerogative of Her Majesty, in relation to appeals, was left untouched by the British North America Act; Nadon v. The King[32]; and by the (Australian) Commonwealth Constitution Act, Webb v. Outrim[33]; and was applied by the Supreme Court of the United States in reaching the conclusion that the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution did not compel the States to admit women to the exercise of the legislative franchise. Minor v. Happissett[34].\nBut this mode of approach, though recognized by the courts as legitimate, must obviously be employed with caution. The \u201cextraneous facts\u201d upon which the underlying assumption is founded, must be demonstrative. It will not do to act upon the general resemblances between the questions presented here, and that presented in the cases cited. Those cases were concerned with the effect of statutes which might at any time be repealed or amended by a majority. They had nothing to do with the jurisdiction of Parliament or with that of His Majesty in Council executing the highest and constitutional functions under his responsibility to Parliament; and were not intended to lay down binding rules, for an indefinite future, in the working of a Constitution. And, above all, they were not concerned with broad provisions establishing new parliamentary institutions, and defining the spheres and powers of legislatures and executives, in a system of representative government. Passages in the judgments, of seemingly general import, must be read secundum subjectam materiam.\nLet me illustrate this by reference to the Canadian Privy Council and the Provincial Executives. In 1867, it would have been a revolutionary step to appoint a woman to the Privy Council or to an Executive Council in Canada\u2014nobody would have thought of it. But it would also have been a radical departure to make women eligible for election to the House of Commons, or to confer the electoral franchise upon them; to make them eligible as members of a provincial legislature, or for appointment to a provincial legislative council. And yet it is quite plain that, with respect to all these last-mentioned matters, the fullest authority was given and given in general terms to Parliament and the legislatures within their several spheres; the \u201cpolicy of centuries\u201d being left in the keeping of the representative bodies, which with the consent of the people of Canada, were to exercise legislative authority over them.\nIn view of this, I do not think the \u201cextraneous facts\u201d relied upon are really of decisive importance, especially when the phraseology of the particular sections already mentioned is considered; and their value becomes inconsiderable when compared with reasons deriving their force from the presumption that the Constitution in its executive branch was intended to be capable of adaptation to whatever changes (permissible under the Act) in the law and practice relating to the election branch might be progressively required by changes in public opinion.\nThen, assuming that the considerations relied upon are potent enough to enforce some degree of restrictive qualification, what should be the extent of that qualification? Should it go farther than limiting the classes of persons to be appointed, or summoned, to those not affected for the time being by a personal incapacity under some general rule of law, leaving it to Parliament or the legislatures to deal with the rule or rules entailing such disabilities?\nFor these reasons I cannot say that I am convinced of the existence of any such general resumption as that contended for. On the other hand, there are considerations which I think specially affect, and very profoundly affect, the question of the construction of sec. 24. It should be observed, in the first place, that in the economy of the British North America Act, the Senate bears no such intimate relation to the House of Commons, or to the Executive, as each of these bears to the other. There is no consideration, as touching the policy of the Act in relation to the Senate, having the force of that already discussed, arising from the control vested in Parliament in respect of the Constitution of the House of Commons, and affecting the question of the Constitution of the Privy Council. On the other hand, there is much to point to an intention that the constitution of the Senate should follow the lines of the Constitution of the old Legislative Councils under the Acts of 1791 and 1840.\nIn 1854, in response to an agitation in the province of Canada, the Imperial Parliament passed an Act amending the Act of Union, (17 and 18 Vic., Cap. 118 already mentioned) which fundamentally altered the status of the Legislative Council. Before the enactment of this Act, the Constitution of the Legislative Council had been fixed (by secs. 4 to 10 of the Act of Union) beyond the power of the legislature of Canada to modify it. By the Statute of 1854, that constitution was placed within the category of matters with which the Canadian Legislature had plenary authority to deal. Now, when the British North America Act was framed, this feature of the parliamentary constitution of the province of Canada, the power of the legislature of the province to determine the constitution of the second Chamber, was entirely abandoned. The authors of the Confederation scheme, in the Quebec Resolutions, reverted in this matter (the Constitution of the Legislative Council, as it was therein called) to the plan of the Acts of 1791 (save in one respect not presently relevant) and of 1840. And the clauses in these resolutions on the subject of the Council, follow generally in structure and phraseology the enactments of the earlier statutes. It seems to me to be a legitimate inference, that the British North America Act contemplated a second Chamber, the constitution of which should, in all respects, be fixed and determined by the Act itself, a constitution which was to be in principle the same, though, necessarily, in detail, not identical, with that of the second Chambers established by the earlier statutes. That under those statutes, women were not eligible for appointment, is hardly susceptible of controversy.\nIn this connection, the language of sections 23 and 31 of the British North America Act deserves some attention. I attach no importance (in view of the phraseology of secs. 83 and 128) to the use of the masculine personal pronoun in section 23, and, indeed, very little importance to the provision in section 23 with regard to nationality. But it is worthy of notice that subsection 3 of section 23 points to the exclusion of married women, and subsection 2 of section 31 would probably have been expressed in a different way if the presence of married women in the Senate had been contemplated; and the provisions dealing with the Senate are not easily susceptible of a construction proceeding upon a distinction between married and unmarried women in respect of eligibility for appointment to the Senate. These features of the provisions specially relating to the constitution of the Senate, in my opinion, lend support to the view that in this, as in other respects, the authors of the Act directed their attention to the Legislative Councils of the Acts of 1791 and 1840 for the model on which the Senate was to be formed.\nI have not overlooked Mr. Rowell\u2019s point based upon section 33 of the British North America Act. Sec. 33 must be supplemented by sec. 1 of the Confederation Act Amendment Act of 1875, and by section 4 of c. 10, R.S.C., the combined effect of which is that the Senate enjoys the privileges and powers, which at the time of the passing of the British North America Act were enjoyed by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom. In particular, by virtue of these enactments, the Senate possesses sole and exclusive jurisdiction to pass upon the claims of any person to sit and vote as a member thereof, except in so far as that jurisdiction is affected by statute. That, I think, is clearly the result of sec. 33, combined with the Imperial Act of 1875, and the subsequent Canadian legislation. And the jurisdiction of the Senate is not confined to the right to pass upon questions arising as to qualification under sec. 33; it extends, I think, also to the question whether a person summoned is a person capable of being summoned under sec. 24. In other words, when the jurisdiction attaches, it embraces the construction of sec. 24, and if the Governor General were professing, under that section, to summon a woman to the Senate, the question whether the instrument was a valid instrument would fall within the scope of that jurisdiction. I do not think it can be assumed that the Senate, by assenting to the Statute, authorizing the submission of questions to this Court for advisory opinions, can be deemed thereby to have consented to any curtailment of its exclusive jurisdiction in respect of such questions. And therefore I have had some doubt whether such a question as that now submitted falls within the Statute by which we are governed. It is true that an affirmative answer to the question might give rise to a conflict between our opinion and a decision of the Senate in exercise of its jurisdiction; but strictly that is a matter affecting the advisability of submitting such questions, and therefore within the province of the Governor in Council. As yet, no concrete case has arisen to which the jurisdiction of the Senate could attach. We are asked for advice on the general question, and that, I think, we are bound to give. It has, of course, only the force of an advisory opinion.\nThe existence of this jurisdiction of the Senate does not, I think, affect the question of substance. We must assume that the Senate would decide in accordance with the law.\nMignault J.\u2014The real question involved under this reference is whether, on the proper construction of the British North America Act, 1867, women may be summoned to the Senate. It is not apparent why we are asked merely if the word \u201cpersons\u201d in section 24 of that Act includes \u201cfemale persons\u201d. The expression \u201cpersons\u201d does not stand alone in section 24, nor is that section the only one to be considered. It is \u201cqualified persons\u201d whom the Governor General shall from time to time summon to the Senate (sec. 24), and when a vacancy happens in the Senate, it is a \u201cfit and qualified person\u201d whom the Governor General shall summon to fill the vacancy (sec. 32). On the proper construction of these words depends the answer we have to give. It would be idle to enquire whether women are included within the meaning of an expression which, in the question as framed, is divorced from its context. The real controversy, however, is apparent from the statement in the Order in Council that the petitioners are \u201cinterested in the admission of women to the Senate of Canada,\u201d and that His Excellency in Council is requested to refer to this court \u201ccertain questions touching the power of the Governor General to summon female persons to the Senate of Canada.\u201d It is with that question that we have to deal.\nThe contentions which the petitoners advanced at the hearing are not new. They have been conclusively rejected several times, and by decisions by which we are bound. Much was said of the interpretation clause contained in Lord Brougham\u2019s Act, but the answer was given sixty years ago in Chorlton v. Lings[35]. It appears hopeless to contend against the authority of these decisions.\nThe word \u201cpersons\u201d is obviously a word of uncertain import. Sometimes it includes corporations as well as natural persons; sometimes it is restricted to the latter; and sometimes again it comprises merely certain natural persons determined by sex or otherwise. The grave constitutional change which is involved in the contention submitted on behalf of the petitioners is not to be brought about by inferences drawn from expressions of such doubtful import, but should rest upon an unequivocal statement of the intention of the Imperial Parliament, since that Parliament alone can change the provisions of the British North America Act in relation to the \u201cqualified persons\u201d who may be summoned to the Senate.\nWhile concurring generally in the reasoning of my Lord the Chief Justice, I have ventured to state the grounds on which I base my reply to the question submitted, as I construe it.

It was found in the courts below that defendant had negligently failed to provide an adequate outlet for the waters collected, and that to this negligence the damages were due. These findings this Court refused to disturb, as defendant had failed to point to any specific error vitiating them. But defendant contended (1) that as the works were constructed under the authority, and in accordance with the provisions, of the Good Roads Act, Man., 1914, c. 42, it was not responsible for injury arising from the execution of the works; and (2) that by virtue of ss. 634 and 684 of the Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 133, the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy, if any, was by way of arbitration.\nHeld (1): Defendant\u2019s first contention failed, as; on the evidence, it had not shewn that the injury caused by the works executed by it was caused by a work authorized and executed according to plans approved under the provisions of the Good Roads Act; as defendant thus failed on the evidence, it was not necessary to consider what, otherwise, would have been the effect as to plaintiff\u2019s right of action.\n(2): Defendant\u2019s second contention failed, as the provision for compensation in s. 634 of the Municipal Act applies only to damages suffered by reason of diversion of \u201cwater from its original course\u201d; that section has no application to flooding by surface water; it contemplates only a diversion of water flowing in a defined water course; s. 684, which deals generally with the right to compensation for damages caused by municipal works, and accords compensation for \u201cdamages necessarily resulting\u201d from such works, had no application.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (37 Man. R. 26) affirmed. APPEAL by the defendant (a rural municipality under the laws of Manitoba) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming, with a variation disallowing damages for the year 1919, the judgment of Macdonald J.[2], who held the plaintiff entitled to recover against the defendant for damage to the plaintiff\u2019s crops in the years 1919, 1921, 1922 and 1923, caused, as alleged, from flooding by reason of negligence in the construction by the defendant of certain roads and ditches. The main points dealt with in the judgment now reported (the court refusing, for reasons given in the judgment, to disturb the findings of fact in the courts below bearing on the question of negligent construction) were with regard to the application and effect, as to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery in this action, of the Good Roads Act of Manitoba, 1914, c. 42, and of ss. 634 and 684 of the Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 133. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nH. A. Bergman K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. C. Collinson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal concerns the right of the respondent to recover damages due to the flooding of her lands in 1921, 1922 and 1923. She is the owner of the S.E. quarter section of sec. 26-22-2 within the municipality of Bifrost. Past the east boundary of the respondent\u2019s land runs a road known as the Jacobson Road, extending southward to the Icelandic River and north for a distance of about ten miles from the river.\nIn 1920, the appellants applied under the Good Roads Act of Manitoba for approval of an extensive scheme of road construction, including the Jacobson Road, and a branch road extending eastwardly for two miles from the Jacobson Road along the town line between townships 22 and 23. The scheme was approved and the Order in Council was passed on 1st April, 1920, which required that the roads be improved (inter alia) by draining, and the Jacobson Road and the branch road were constructed, in the years 1920 and 1921, with appurtenant ditches, on the routes prescribed in the Order in Council.\nThe respondent alleges that the flooding of her property was the consequence of the negligent construction of these roads and ditches. The learned trial judge, and the majority of the Court of Appeal, agreed in the view that the appellants had negligently failed to provide an adequate outlet for the waters collected by the roads and ditches, and that to this negligence the damages complained of were due.\nThese findings of fact could only be successfully impugned in this court by pointing to some specific error in the courts below, vitiating the findings, and this counsel for the municipality has quite failed to do. It would serve no good purpose to discuss the evidence in detail. The appeal must be considered on the footing that the respondent\u2019s loss, owing to the flooding of her land, was due to the failure to make reasonable provision for the discharge of the surplus water collected in the roads and ditches constructed by the appellants.\nOn behalf of the appellants, the grounds of appeal now to be considered are, first: that the works mentioned were constructed under the authority of the Good Roads Act, 1914, and in accordance with the provisions of that Act, and, such being the case, the municipality is not responsible for any injury arising from the execution of the works, and, second: that by virtue of the provisions of the Municipal law of Manitoba, the only remedy of the respondent, if she has any, even for negligence, is to proceed to arbitration under those provisions.\nAs to the first of these contentions, the difficulty in the appellants\u2019 way appears to be this. In order to establish the defence based upon the allegation that the work was constructed under the authority of the Good Roads Act, it was necessary to identify the work authorized under that statute. The Order in Council, approving the decision of the Good Roads Board, in respect to certain works in the municipality, is produced, and these works include what has been referred to above as the Jacobson road and the branch road to the east. The Order in Council provided for the improvement of the roads by draining, grading and gravelling the same. But the report of the engineer, the maps, plans, drawings, profiles and specifications of the works which should have accompanied the report of the engineer, and which would shew in detail the character of the work authorized under the statute, including the measures for dealing with waters collected by the works contemplated by the scheme, which it was the duty of the Board to transmit to the Clerk of the Municipality, were not produced. In the absence of these documents, which would have afforded authentic information as to the precise nature of the work authorized, with the concomitant protective measures, if any, the learned trial judge, and the judges of the Court of Appeal, were obliged to determine as best they could, whether the flooding of the respondent\u2019s land was in truth due to works executed pursuant to the plan and approved by the Good Roads Board, and so under the authority of the statute. Facts were adduced in evidence, of more or less cogency, pointing to the conclusion, that as a part of the statutory plan, the municipality had contemplated the construction of an outlet leading from the eastern terminus of the eastern branch into a lake called Crooked Lake, and thence into Icelandic River, at a point much below the outlet actually provided. Such an outlet would have given the most natural and effective method of freeing the roads actually constructed, and the adjacent lands from the menace of flooding. It was in point of fact in 1923, actually put into execution. In addition to that, certain ditching constructed in the year 1923, considerably added to the accumulation of surplus water, and there is no pretence for suggesting that this ditching formed any part of the statutory scheme. The evidence seems to indicate that the government engineer visited the works only occasionally, and that the works were really under the control of the municipality.\nThe learned trial judge, as well as the majority of the Court of Appeal, were convinced that the works, as actually executed, did not make reasonable provision for the escape of the water collected, and, on general principles, the appellants can only escape responsibility by shewing that the very thing which they did was that which the statute authorized. There is no satisfactory ground for differing from the view of the courts below, that the appellants have failed to shew that their works were executed according to the plans approved.\nThe decision on this point, it will be observed, turns entirely upon the issue of fact. The appellants fail because they have not shewn that the injury caused by the works executed by them was caused by a work authorized and executed according to plans approved under the provisions of the Good Roads Act. Had this been established, it would have been necessary to consider the appellants\u2019 contention that, in such circumstances, they are not answerable in an action by a plaintiff, who alleges that in consequence of the works he has suffered damage, and that his remedy, if any, must be found in some statutory provision for compensation, if there be any.\nI now turn to the defence advanced by the appellants, based upon sections 634 and 684 of the Municipal Act. I have no hesitation in holding that the provision for compensation in s. 634 applies only to damages suffered by reason of diversion of \u201cwater from its original course.\u201d I agree with the majority of the court below that this section has no application to flooding by surface water, and that it contemplates only a diversion of water flowing in a defined water course.\nSec. 684, which is the enactment dealing generally with the right to compensation for damages caused by municipal works, accords compensation for \u201cdamages necessarily resulting\u201d from such works, and has no application here.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Anderson & Seeman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. W. Coleman.\n[1] 37 Man. R. 26; [1927] 3 W.W.H. 49.\n[2] [1926] 2 W.W.R. 324.\n"}

Plaintiffs claimed damages from the city.\nHeld, that the place of the accident was not a \u201csidewalk\u201d within s. 460 (3) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922 (c. 72), Ont., and, therefore, the question whether the city\u2019s servants\u2019 negligence amounted to \u201cgross negligence\u201d did not arise.\nHeld, further, that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, being special damages sustained by reason of a nuisance on a highway, negligently created by the city\u2019s servants under the circumstances above mentioned, did not fall within s. 460 (1) of said Act, and, consequently, failure to give the notice prescribed by s. 460 (4) for claims based on default within s. 460 (1) was not available as a defence.\nThe introduction in 1913 of the phrase \u201cwhether the want of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance\u201d into s. 460 (2) (which bars actions based on s. 460 (1) begun after three months from the time when the damages were sustained) did not have the effect that all the provisions of s. 460 should thereafter apply to every liability of a municipal corporation for disrepair on a highway caused by its servants\u2019 misfeasance. There existed in Ontario, before the 1913 amendment, a common law right of action against a municipality for a nuisance on a highway caused by its servants\u2019 negligence amounting to misfeasance, and which had caused special damage, apart from and in addition to any statutory liability for non-repair; and the abrogation of a well established common law right should not be inferred from a change of doubtful import, such as that made in 1913 by the introduction of the provision as to misfeasance into a subordinate clause of the section imposing the liability\u2014a clause ex facie dealing only with a limitation of the time for bringing action where the claim rests on the statute. Moreover, if the amending words should be imported into s. 460 (1), their operation would still be confined to the subject matter of that subsection, i.e., actions based on default in discharging the duty of keeping in repair thereby imposed, which entails a liability entirely distinct from, and independent of, that resulting at common law from the creation of a nuisance on a highway.\nHistory of the legislation in question discussed. Glynn v. City of Niagara Falls (29 Ont. L.R. 517, at 521); Biggar v. Crowland (13 Ont. L.R. 164, at pp. 165-6); Keech v. Smith\u2019s Falls (15 Ont. L.R. 300); Weston v. Middlesex (30 Ont. L.R. 21; 31 Ont. L.R. 148); Halifax v. Tobin (50 Can. S.C.R. 404); and Patterson v. Victoria (5 B.C.R. 628, at p. 645; affd. [1899] A.C. 615, at p. 620) referred to.\nPer Duff J. (concurring in the result): The exercise of the plaintiff husband\u2019s right of access was wrongfully made dangerous by a nuisance for which the city was responsible. The right to complain of such a wrong is not limited to the owner, but inheres also in his wife and other members of his family residing with him. This injuria is an invasion of a private right incidental to the ownership and occupation of property\u2014Lyon v. Fishmongers\u2019 Company (1 A.C. 662). S. 460 has no application.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (61 Ont. L.R. 246) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which reversed the judgment of Rose J. at the trial.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiffs, husband and wife, against the defendant, a city corporation, for damages by reason of personal injuries suffered by the female plaintiff through slipping and falling on a patch of ice, existing, as was alleged, as the result of negligence of the city\u2019s servants, in the course of flushing a private sewer of a neighbour of the plaintiffs, undertaken by the city, in the exercise of its statutory powers, by contract in its capacity as owner and operator of a public water service. The ice in question was on a part of a private houseway, lawfully constructed, leading from the street sidewalk to the plaintiff\u2019s residence; such part of the houseway being on the highway and immediately adjoining the sidewalk.\nNotice of the claim and injury was not served in accordance with subs. 4 of s. 460 of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, 12-13 Geo. V (Ont.), c. 72. Apart from the issues of fact (as to which this Court sustained the findings at trial in favour of the plaintiffs) the questions involved had to do with the construction and application of s. 460 of the said Act, and are indicated in the above headnote.\nROSE J. gave judgment for the female plaintiff for $2,500, and for the male plaintiff for $100 (cutting in two, by reason of his contributory negligence, the damages of $200 assessed to him). The Appellate Division reversed this judgment, and dismissed the action, basing its decision upon the non-compliance with said subs. 4 of s. 460, which it held to be aplicable[2]. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. By the judgment now reported the appeal was allowed, with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of Rose J. was restored.\nSir William Hearst K.C. for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014An experienced trial judge found that the servants of the defendant municipal corporation, in the course of flushing a private sewer of a neighbour with water drawn through a leaky hose from a city hydrant adjacent to the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, had negligently created a nusiance (consisting of a patch of dangerous ice) on a portion of a private houseway, lawfully constructed and leading from the sidewalk of Church street in the city of Sault Ste. Marie to the residence of the plaintiffs; that the portion of such houseway on which the nusiance existed was on the highway and immediately adjoined the city sidewalk; and that the female plantiff was severely injured, without any contributory negligence attributable to her, by slipping and falling on such portion of the houseway as a result of the nusiance so created; but that the male plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence, as great as that of the defendant\u2019s servants, in having failed to take some steps to obviate the danger they had created, of the existence of which he was aware from the 22nd of February to the 7th of March, when the accident to his wife occurred. While he accordingly allowed the female plaintiff the full amount of damages which she had sustained, assessed by himself at $2,500, the learned judge cut in two the damages assessed to the male plaintiff at $200, and restricted his recovery to $100.\nThe learned judge held that the place where the female plaintiff fell was not a sidewalk within s. 460 (3) of the Ontario Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, 12-13, Geo. V., c. 72, and, consequently, that the question whether the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants had amounted to \u201cgross negligence\u201d did not arise. He further held that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, being special damages sustained by reason of a nusiance on a highway negligently created by the defendant\u2019s servants, did not fall within s. 460 (1) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, and, consequently, that failure to give the notice prescribed by subs. 4 for claims based on defaults within subs. 1 was not available as a defence.\nThe defendant municipality appealed. There was no appeal by the male plantiff against the judgment reducing the damages recoverable by him to $100.\nFully accepting the findings of fact of the trial judge, the Appellate Divisional Court[3] reversed his judgment and dismissed the action solely because, in its opinion, s. 460 (1) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, applies to a claim for damages based on negligent misfeasance of a municipal corporation occasioning disrepair, amounting to a nusiance, on a public highway, in consequence of the introduction, in 1913, of the phrase: \u201cwhether the want of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance\u201d into subs. 2, which bars actions based on subs. 1 unless begun within three months from the date on which the damages were sustained. Both plaintiffs appeal to this court and ask the restoration of the judgment of the trial court. Special leave to appeal was obtained by John Prentice from the Appellate Division.\nA perusal of the judgment delivered by Riddell J., in the Appellate Division, concurred in by Latchford C.J., and Masten J.A., (Middleton and Orde JJ.A., agreeing in the result), leaves the impression that the Appellate Court agreed with the opinion expressed by the trial judge as to the purview of subs. 3, which also commends itself to our judgment. On the issues of fact a careful perusal of all the testimony has satisfied us that there is evidence which, if believed, supports the findings of fact made in the trial court and that we cannot, especially in view of their having been affirmed without dissent by the Appellate Divisional Court, say that error in any of such findings has been demonstrated. They must, therefore, stand and will form the basis on which we dispose of the present appeal.\nThe sole question requiring further consideration is whether, on the proper construction of s. 460 (1), as was held in the Appellate Division, the cause of action against the defendant municipality, based on misfeasance of its servants which created a nusiance in the highway whereby special damage was caused to the plaintiffs, falls within that subsection and must accordingly fail, because the notice of the claim and injury provided for by subs. 4 was not given, or whether, as the trial judge held, such a claim is not within s. 460.\nSection 460 of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, 12-13 George V. (Ontario), Chapter 72, so far as material, reads as follows:\n460 (1) Every highway and every bridge shall be kept in repair by the corporation the council of which has jurisdiction over it, or upon which the duty of repairing it is imposed by this Act, and in case of default, the corporation shall be liable for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default.\n(2) No action shall be brought against a corporation for the recovery of damages occasioned by such default, whether the want of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance, after the expiration of three months from the time when the damages were sustained.\n(3) Except in case of gross negligence a corporation shall not be liable for a personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk. 3-4 Geo. V, c. 43, s. 463 (1-3).\n(4) No action shall be brought for the recovery of the damages mentioned in subsection 1 unless notice in writing of the claim and of the in- jury complained of has been served upon or sent by registered post to the head, or the clerk of the corporation, in the case of a county or township within ten days, and in the case of an urban municipality within seven days after the happening of the injury, nor unless where the claim is against two or more corporations jointly liable for the repair of the highway or bridge, the prescribed notice was given to each of them within the prescribed time. 3-4 Geo. V, c. 43, s. 460 (4); 11 Geo. V, c. 63, s. 22.\n(5) In case of the death of the person injured, failure to give the notice shall not be a bar to the action, and, except where the injury was caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk, failure to give or insufficiency of the notice shall not be a bar to the action if the court or judge before whom the action is tried is of the opinion that there is reasonable excuse for the want or insufficiency of the notice and that the corporation was not thereby prejudiced in its defence.\nTwo grounds were urged by counsel for the appellants why subsections 1 and 4 do not apply to this case:\n(a) A claim based on negligent misfeasance by servants of the municipality creating a nuisance in a highway which caused special damage is not within subss. 1 and 4 of s. 460;\n(b) Although a claim based on negligent misfeasance in the doing of work in the construction or repair of a highway, or occurring in the course of work done in the discharge of the municipal duty of keeping the highways in repair, should be within subs. 1 of s. 460, a claim based on a misfeasance of municipal servants, in doing an act or in carrying on work in no wise connected with the discharge of municipal duty in regard to the condition of highways and bridges, whereby a nuisance was negligently created in a highway which became the cause of special damage to the plaintiff, is not within the purview of s. 460 (1) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, but gives him a cause of action against the municipality at common law independently of any liability which might arise under s. 460 (1) by reason of failure to abate such nuisance amounting to default in keeping the highway in repair as required by the statute.\nAlthough the distinction between grounds (a) and (b) may, perhaps, be of importance for other purposes (Brown v. City of Toronto[4]), in the present case they do not seem to call for separate discussion.\nSection 460 (1) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, is identical in substance with its predecessor in the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1903 (3 Edw. VII, c. 19, s. 606 (1)), except that the latter subsection also contained, as its last member, but differently phrased, the three months\u2019 limitation provision now found in subsection 2. This latter clause was detached from subsection 1 in the consolidation of 1913 (3-4 Geo. V, c. 43), and was enacted as subsection 2 in its present form. The words: \u201cwhether the want of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance\u201d were then first inserted.\nSection 606 (1) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1903, and its antecedents, alluded to by Riddell J., were dealt with in Ontario in a \u201cline of decisions,\u201d which, as the late Chancellor Boyd observed in Glynn v. City of Niagara Falls[5],\nrestricted (their application) to cases wherein the default is attributable to nonfeasance. Cases of misfeasance were held to lie beyond the statute and untouched by its preliminaries as to notice and time of suing. True it is that, owing perhaps to the many subtle distinctions which have been drawn between nonfeasance and misfeasance, the Legislature has by the Municipal Act, 1913, 3-4 George V, c. 43, sec. 460 (2), limited the time for bringing actions occasioned by municipal default, whether the want of repair was the result of misfeasance or nonfeasance.\nA list of the decisions referred to will be found in Meredith & Wilkinson\u2019s Municipal Manual, at pp. 620-1. Of these special reference may be made to Biggar v. Township of Crowland[6]; Keech v. Town of Smith\u2019s Falls[7]; and Weston v. County of Middlesex[8].\nAs put by Rose J., in the case now before us:\nA municipality, like everyone else, may be liable, apart from statute, for creating a nuisance in a highway, and if a person sustains damages\u2014that is, special damage, different from the damage suffered by others\u2014by reason of the nuisance so created, the person, whether a municipality or anyone else, who created it is liable for those damages; that rule being subject, however, in the case of a person or corporation exercising a statutory authority, to the qualification that if the nuisance is created in the exercise of that statutory authority, liability does not result unless the nuisance was created negligently. The case, therefore, * * * raises, as I think, only the question, did these defendants, exercising their statutory powers as a sewer authority, create a nuisance negligently, and if so did the nuisance so created cause the damage of which the plaintiffs complain. The common law right of action against a municipal corporation for a nuisance on a highway caused by negligence of its servants amounting to misfeasance and which has caused special damage, apart from and in addition to any statutory liability for non-repair, admits of no doubt. City of Halifax v. Tobin[9]. Its existence in Ontario up to 1913 is not seriously contested. The provisions of s. 606 of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1903, including that requiring notice of claim to the municipality within thirty days (as it then was), were held in many cases not to apply to such common law actions. The abrogation of a well-established common law right should not be inferred from a change of doubtful import, such as that made in 1913 by the introduction of the provision as to misfeasance into a subordinate clause of the section imposing the liability\u2014a clause ex facie dealing only with a limitation of the time for bringing action where the claim rests on the statute. In order that this amendment should affect subs. 4 and extend its requirement of notice to additional claims (if any) to which the limitation provision was thus made applicable, it is necessary to import the amendment of subs. 2 into subs. 1 and to read subs. 1 as if the Legislature had amended it instead of, or as well as, subs. 2. Indeed, if the intent had been that all the provisions of s. 460 should thereafter apply to every liability of a municipal corporation for disrepair on a highway or bridge caused by misfeasance of its servants, the only logical place for the amending words inserted in 1913 (if otherwise sufficient) would have been after the word \u201cdefault\u201d where it first occurs in subs. 1. It seems reasonably clear that the Legislature can have intended to affect only the limitation provision by the amendment made to it.\nMoreover, if the amending words should be imported into subs. 1 as suggested, their operation would still be confined to the subject matter of that subsection, i.e., actions based on default in discharging the duty of keeping in repair thereby imposed, which entails a liability entirely distinct from, and independent of, that resulting at common law from the creation of a nuisance on a highway. Patter- son v. City of Victoria[10]. It is noteworthy that the phrase inserted in subs. 2 is not restricted to misfeasance by a municipal corporation: it includes as well cases where disrepair of a bridge or highway has been caused by the misfeasance of others. The misfeasance of servants of the municipal corporation in the presence instance may be assimilated to an act of a third party creating a nuisance on a highway. Assuming notice to the municipality of a nuisance so created sufficient to entail its statutory liability for non-repair to a person sustaining special damage, there can be no doubt that the common law liability of the third party could also be invoked by him. Here the municipal servants were carrying out an obligation for which the municipality had contracted with a private citizen, not qua guardian of the highways but in its capacity as owner and operator of a public water service, which might have been in the hands of a private body. There would seem to be no reason for doing away with the common law liability of a municipal corporation in such a case.\nBut the words \u201cwhether the want of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance,\u201d if imported into subs. 1, would still apply only to a default in the statutory duty of keeping the highway in repair imposed by that subsection. They would merely declare that the statutory liability of the municipality for failure to discharge that duty would be the same whether the original cause of disrepair had been misfeasance or nonfeasance. The amendment was, perhaps, futile, as such liability might well exist under subs. 1 without it. But that is not a sufficient ground for giving to it an effect which it is most improbable the Legislature meant it to have, namely, the extinction of the well-known common law right of action against a municipality for a nuisance created by it on a highway which has caused special damage, and the substitution therefor of the greatly restricted statutory remedy conferred by s. 460.\nWe would require a declaration in express terms, or at least language leaving no doubt as to the necessity of the implication as a basis for imputing such an intention to the Legislature. For these reasons the appeal, in our opinion, should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the result. The legal effect of the findings of the learned trial judge, which apparently were accepted by the Appellate Division, appears to be this. The exercise of the husband\u2019s right of access was wrongfully made dangerous by a nuisance for which the municipality is responsible. The right to complain of such a wrong is not limited to the owner, but inheres also in his wife and other members of his family residing with him. This injuria is an invasion of a private right incidental to the ownership and occupation of property. Lyon v. Fishmongers\u2019 Company.

Strong and Another (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1928: February 20; 1928: February 21.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA, EN BANC\nSale\u2014Payment\u2014Right to inspection\u2014Condition\u2014The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.N.S.C. 206, s. 35, subs. 2\nThe plaintiffs were grain merchants at Calgary, Alberta, and the defendant company was doing business at Truro, Nova Scotia. The action is brought to recover $4,400 damages. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant company by telegrams and letters agreed to buy, and plaintiffs agreed to sell, a quantity of oats, approximately 10,000 bushels, at $1.15 per bushel; that defendant company wrongfully repudiated the contract and refused to accept the oats; and that the plaintiffs were obliged to sell and did sell them at 47 cents per bushel. The defendant company alleged that if there was a contract it was terminated by the wrongful refusal of the plaintiffs to ship the oats and to deliver them at Truro as required by the contract, except upon condition that payment was guaranteed by the bank of the defendant company. On the trial a further ground was raised and discussed as to the plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to ship the goods with permission to defendant company to inspect them before payment.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (59 N.S.R. 339), that the right of the purchaser to inspection, in the absence of a term in the contract inconsistent therewith, is determined by section 35 (2) of The Sale of Goods Act and that nothing in the terms of the contract in this case was so inconsistent as to preclude the appellant company from inspecting the oats before payment.\nHeld, also, that the provision for payment to the Bank of Nova Scotia at Truro by the appellant company on arrival of the car at Truro does not preclude the right of inspection by the purchaser before such payment is made.\nHeld, further, that, in view of the insistence by the respondents in their letter of the 26th of February, 1925, upon the appellants\u2019 obtaining a bank guarantee of the payments of their drafts, not withdrawn so far as the correspondence shews, it cannot be said that they were always ready and willing to make delivery according to the terms of their contract, which is essential to their right to recover upon an anticipatory breach by the appellant company.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (1), reversing the judgment of Harris C.J.[1] and maintaining the respondents\u2019 action.\nIn addition to the statement of facts contained in the above head-note, the letters and telegrams exchanged between the parties and forming the contract are as follows:\nTruro, N.S., Jan. 14, 1925.\nStrong & Dowler,\nCalgary, Alta.\nWould book six cars each five hundred and sixty sacks number one government inspected banner seed oats at one dollar twenty-five cents bushel delivered Truro, March shipment sight draft payable on arrival car to Nova Scotia Truro wire reply.\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd. The reply to this was as follows:\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.,\nTruro, N.S.\nHave booked six cars five hundred sixty sacks each number one government inspected banner seed oats at one dollar twenty-five cents bushel delivered Truro March shipment.\nStrong & Dowler.\nIn a letter dated January 17, 1925, from the appellant company to the respondents they, after referring to these telegrams, said:\n\u201cKindly have all drafts for seed oats made through Bank of Nova Scotia, Truro.\u201d\nOn February 11, 1925, the appellant company sent a telegram to the respondents asking if they could re-sell the oats ordered at one cent profit, or if not whether they would exchange or substitute six cars of double recleaned two Canadian Western oats and what the difference in price would be.\nTo this the respondents replied as follows:\nFebruary 12, 1925.\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.,\nTruro, N.S.\nCannot resell, but will exchange for six cars double re-cleaned two Canadian Western new sacks at discount of ten cents per bushel.\nStrong & Dowler.\nAnd the appellant company accepted this by the following telegram:\nTruro, N.S., Feb. 13\/25.\nStrong & Dowler,\nCalgary, Alta.\nWe accept your exchange to two Canadian Western double recleaned new sacks ten cents bushel discount.\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd. On the 14th February the respondents wired the appellant company about further business and asked apparently with reference to the contract already made: \u201cCan you arrange bank guarantees of our drafts.\u201d\nThe following communications then passed between the parties:\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.\nTruro, N.S., Feb. 20, 1925.\nMessrs. Strong & Dowler,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear sirs,\nIn reference to oats on order, we must ask that you put on bills of lading for all cars to \u201cAllow inspection\u201d before paying draft; otherwise we cannot pay drafts.\nWe are in receipt of your wire quoting us on 1 feed and 3 C.

Must have payment drafts guaranteed against documents. We will attach to each draft 2 CW government grade certificate and declaration signed by supt. government elevator that he has double cleaned the oats in each car.

Eighty-seven Truro new sacks lowest we can quote to-day.\nStrong & Dowler. And the appellant company wired:\nHalifax, N.S., Feb. 27.\nStrong & Dowler,\nCalgary, Alta.\nWire received we will not have bank guarantee drafts nor will we lift drafts until each car is inspected on arrival it matters not whether they are true named or double recleaned have been patiently waiting for large sample of double recleaned but as yet have not received any.\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.\nIn a letter dated March 2, 1925, the respondents say:\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.,\nTruro, N.S.\nGentlemen,\u2014\nWe have received your wire under date February 27th and have carefully noted contents. We of course were very much surprised at your statement that you expected oats to be shipped to Truro, N.S., for inspection before guaranteeing payment. This is the first time that we have ever been asked for anything of the kind during our experience in the grain business. Grain is always delivered on basis of government documents and it was on basis of government documents that we made the original sale to you. In changing from the original sale to double re-cleaned no. 2 C W oats we expected you of course to demand proof that the oats had been double re-cleaned and this we expected to furnish by affidavit from the manager of the government elevator at Calgary. If this affidavit is not satisfactory we suggest that you have some disinterested person here in Calgary examine the oats at time of making shipment. It is our desire to give you best class double re-cleaned no. 2 C W oats, but we cannot ship these oats 3,000 miles away to be accepted or declined by a purchaser who may be influenced by the rise or fall of the market. We are very sure that you would not do anything of the kind if conditions were reversed. We are sending you to-day under separate cover samples of the oats that we are shipping to you. These samples have been delayed until we could get the oats double re-cleaned. If these oats are not satisfactory when accompanied with government no. 2 C W grade certificate and affidavit from manager of the government elevator that they have been double re-cleaned then we must insist upon filling the original contract which is based strictly on payment against documents.\nWe wish to be absolutely fair in every particular and wish to have you protected in every way possible and intend to give you just what you have purchased and hope it will be even better than you expected, but you can well understand that we cannot leave the acceptance to you without any protection for ourselves. We are very sure that you wish also to be fair in the matter and that you will provide some one here to examine the oats for you at time of making shipment.\nVery truly yours,\nStrong & Dowler.\nThe appellant company wired in reply:\nHalifax, N.S., March 11.\nStrong & Dowler,\nCalgary, Alta.\nLetter received as you refuse allow inspection please cancel cannot handle now under any conditions.\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.\nTruro, N.S.\nAnd the respondents\u2019 answed to this was a telegram reading:\nMarch 11, 1925.\nScotia Flour & Feed Co., Ltd.,\nTruro, N.S.\nHolding oats ready to fill order in accordance with terms of sale. Unless we receive shipping instructions promptly will sell for your account and charge you with loss.\nStrong & Dowler.\nL. A. Forsyth for the appellant.\nT. R. Robertson K.C. for the respondents. At the conclusion of the argument by counsel for the appellant and for the respondents, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by the Chief Justice.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We have had an opportunity, during the argument of this appeal, of fully considering this case and we are convinced that the construction placed by the learned Chief Justice who tried the action upon the terms of the contract between the parties was correct. The right of the purchaser to inspection, in the absence of a term in the contract inconsistent therewith, is determined by sec. 35 (2) The Sale of Goods Act. The learned Chief Justice was of the opinion that nothing in the terms of the contract was so inconsistent. The court en banc was of the contrary view. We are satisfied that the provision for payment to the Bank of Nova Scotia at Truro by the defendant on arrival of the car at Truro, relied on by the respondent, does not preclude the right of inspection by the purchaser before such payment is made.\nMoreover, we incline to think that the insistence by the respondents in their letter of the 26th of February, 1925, upon the appellants\u2019 obtaining a bank guarantee of the payment of their drafts, not withdrawn so far as the correspondence shews, precludes a holding that they were always ready and willing to make delivery according to the terms of their contract, which is essential to their right to recover upon an anticipatory breach by the defendants.\nThe contract certainly contained nothing warranting their insistence on such a guarantee.\nWe are for these reasons of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs here and in the court en banc and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. M. Davidson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: H. O. MacLatchy.\n[1] (1927) 59 N.S. Rep. 539\n"}

On the day the action was to be returned, the secretary\u2019s brother, Father Lafrance, former parish priest of the respondent, without his brother\u2019s knowledge, so as to stop the action and allow a full settlement at a more opportune moment, came to see Bouffard\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Morin, and deposited with him the sum of $3,000. The matter remained thus until the month of April, 1926. Then Bouffard\u2019s lawyer remitted to the corporation respondent his cheque to the amount of $2,544.49, having deducted his costs. This cheque was returned to the lawyer by the corporation, with a letter saying that the corporation had no such claim against the former secretary Lafrance. Then Mr. Morin remitted another cheque to the amount of $2,980.85, said cheque remaining in the respondent\u2019s secretary Delisle\u2019s possession without being cashed. Former secretary Lafrance being present at the meeting of the counsel when the first cheque of $2,544.49 was refused, protested against the acceptance of the cheque, saying he owed nothing to the corporation. The matter remained thus and the second cheque was not accepted. On the 7th of April, 1927, therefore a year after, the appellants, of whom Bouffard was the agent, took the present mandamus as ratepayers, in order to force the corporation to receive, cash and collect the cheque of $2,980.85.\nLouis Morin K.C. for the appellants.\nP. H. Bouffard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered orally by the Chief Justice, after hearing counsel as well for the respondent as for the appellants.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiffs appellants seek a mandamus to compel the defendant municipality to accept payment by a third party of an alleged debt of its secretary-treasurer. In order to succeed they must make out a case within article 1141 C.C., or establish agency of such third party in making the payment for the alleged debtor.\nTwo essential elements appear to be lacking in the proof necessary to bring the case within article 1141 C.C. The debt of the secretary-treasurer is not admitted by the defendant and it is contested by himself. Unless such debt is established it cannot be said that the payment is for the benefit of the alleged debtor.\nThe payment by the third party was not made by him as representative or as agent of the debtor. He had no authority to represent the debtor. This is clearly established by the evidence. And the only possible inference from the proof before us is that the third party did not pro- fess to act in the capacity of agent for the alleged debtor but, on the contrary, made the payment avowedly on his own behalf, whether intending it to be taken in satisfaction of any claim against the debtor or, as seems more probable, to be held as a deposit, or guarantee, for the eventual settlement of any such claim by the debtor himself. It is urged that this payment was subsequently ratified by the debtor and, therefore, is as binding upon him and the respondent as if made by his authority. The alleged act of ratification, however, is quite consistent with the debtor\u2019s position denying the existence of the debt and with the payment itself having been made not on his behalf but by the third party for his own account. Moreover, it is trite law that liability by virtue of ratification can arise only when in doing the act to be ratified the agent purported to act as such and on behalf of the principal.\nUpon these grounds we think it quite clear that neither under article 1141 C.C., nor by virtue of the alleged agency of the third party for the debtor, is any liability established.\nThe appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Louis Morin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bouffard & Bouffard.\n[1] (1928) Q.R. 44 K.B. 400\n"}

[2]upon an application by a trustee for an order interpreting certain clauses of a will.\nThe deceased, a bachelor, possessed of a considerable estate, made his will on the 21st of September, 1926, disposing of almost the entire estate to his nephews and nieces and their children. He having subsequently died and the executor, the Imperial Canadian Trust Company, being in doubt as to the legal effect of certain of the dispositions, it applied to the court for an interpretation of the terms of the will in question.\nThe dispositions in question to the nephews and nieces, of whom there are seven mentioned, are with one slight exception all in the following terms: \"To my niece * * * I give and devise a life estate in the * * * and after her death to her children in equal shares per stirpes\" The one exception is the gift of a life estate to two nephews \"as tenants in common\" and after their deaths to their children \"in equal shares per stirpes\"\nAfter the specific devises appears the following provision: \"In the event of any of the persons to whom I have devised a life estate in the land herein, dying without issue, I direct that my trustee sell the land so devised to such person and the proceeds derived from such sale be divided among the sons and daughters of my brother Frank Simpson in equal shares per stirpes\"\nH. S. Patterson, for five nephews, nieces, devisees.\nL. E. Ormond, for two nieces, licensees.\nA. Macleod Sinclair K.C. for the official guardian and for a daughter of F. Simpson.\nJohn W. Moyer for the executor. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The questions in controversy on this appeal concern the construction of the will of the late Robert H. Simpson, and, admittedly, the decision of them turns upon the application or non-application of the rule in Shelley's Case [3] to the provisions in dispute.\nThe following paragraph is typical of the clauses to be construed:\u2014\nTo my niece Fern McDaniels, wife of Chester McDaniels, of Carmangay, in the province of Alberta, I give and devise a life estate in the east \u00bd sec. 3-13-24-W 4 and after her death to her children in equal shares per stirpes.\nThere is also a gift over to be considered in these words:\u2014\nIn the event of any of the persons to whom I have devised a life estate in land herein, dying without issue, I direct that my Trustee sell the land so devised to such person and the proceeds derived from such sale be divided among the sons and daughters of my brother Frank Simpson in equal shares per stirpes.\nIf the rule in Shelley's Case (1) governs, Fern McDaniels takes an estate tail, which, by statute, is in effect an estate in fee: if not, she takes a life interest only. The Appellate Division in Alberta has held that the rule in Shelley's Case (1) has not the force of law in Alberta. The learned judge of first instance, Clarke J., held that the rule applies. It is unnecessary, in my view, to consider whether or not the rule is in force in Alberta. I have come to the conclusion that, assuming it to be in force, it does not apply.\nThe precise question is this: Are the words \"to her children in equal shares per stirpes,\" words of designation or words of limitation; do these words, \"include the whole line of succession capable of inheriting\"? (Foxwell v. Van Grutton[4].) Prima facie, the word \"children,\" in such a context, denotes persons of the first degree of descent, and therefore is a word of designation. There is another proposition, which I will state in the words of Lord Cairns in Bowen v. Lewis[5]:\nI take it also to be clear upon the authorities that if you have a gift to children, with words of division or of inheritance, the children would take as purchasers; and then if you have a gift over in the event of death without issue, those words pointing to death without issue are to be construed referentially, and to have the explanation from the gift to the particular individuals that you have had before.\nThis proposition, which Lord Cairns gives as the result of the authorities, and about which he says there was no dispute in the House of Lords, would suffice at once for the determination of the dispute before us but for the presence of the phrase per stirpes in the clause in question, upon which the appellant's counsel largely builds his argument.\nThe argument is that the phrase per stirpes is insensible as applied to a division among children in the restricted prima facie sense, and, therefore, that \"children\" should be read in such a sense as to conform to the terminology of the gift over, that is to say as \"issue.\" In examining that argument, you must look at the whole of the will. (Per Lord Cairns)[6].\nThe words in which the gift over is expressed are significant. On the death of the life tenant without issue, the trustee is to sell the land, and the proceeds are to-be divided among \"the sons and daughters of my brother Frank Simpson in equal shares per stirpes\" Whatever may be said about the word \"children,\" it would require a very demonstrative context\u2014a context having the force and value of an interpretation clause\u2014to impart to the phrase \"sons and daughters\" a meaning embracing the whole line of descendants capable of inheriting; especially so when employed in describing the destination of a gift of money. Here there is no such demonstrative context. \"Sons and daughters\" must be read, I think, according to the primary import of the words. It follows that, whatever be the effect he ascribed to them, the testator did not regard the words \"per stirpes\" as meaningless when applied to a direction for distribution among descendants of the first degree\u2014among children in the primary sense of the word. So read, moreover, the terms of the gift over, the nominated beneficiaries being of the first generation only, seem to give evidence of an intention that it was to take effect not on an indefinite failure of issue, but on the death of the life tenant, without having had a child in whom an interest could vest under the terms of the devise to the child- ren. I cannot therefore agree that the phrase per stirpes has the effect contended for, and it follows that the gift to the life tenant takes effect according to the intention declared.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. In view of the differences of judicial opinion, it seems to be a case for directing that the costs be paid out of the estate as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1927] 3 W.W.R. 534.\n[2] [1927] 2 W.W.R. 107.\n[3] (1581) 1 Rep. 93b.\n[4] [1897] A.C. 658, at p. 677.\n[5] (1884) 9 A.C. 890, at p. 905.\n[6] 9 A.C. 890, at p. 906.\n"}

Payment of these instalments was further secured by a right of cancellation of the sale, stipulated by the original vendor, the assignor of these instalments. One Dub\u00e9 was president and a large shareholder of Vaillancourt & Co. Limited. Two of the instalments payable to Mercier were in arrears in October, 1924, and an instalment assigned to Gr\u00e9goire was to fall due on November 1 of that year. The company had enough of funds to pay Mercier, but was not in position to meet the instalment payable to Gr\u00e9goire, who threatened proceedings to enforce payment. Under these circumstances, it was agreed between the company and Dub\u00e9 that the latter would pay Mercier with the company\u2019s moneys and would take from him a transfer of his hypothecary claim, which he would hold for the benefit of the compan3\u2019, this being done with the hope that Dub\u00e9 would thus be in a better position to negotiate for delay with Gr\u00e9goire. This transfer of Mercier\u2019s claim to Dub\u00e9 was made on October 29, 1924. Less than three months afterwards both Dub\u00e9 and the company made an authorized assignment for the benefit of their creditors under the Bankruptcy Act. The evidence was that the company was insolvent at the date of the transfer by Mercier to Dub\u00e9 to the knowledge of the latter. After the assignment of the company and of Dub\u00e9 under the Bankruptcy Act, Dub\u00e9\u2019s trustee, the respondent, brought an hypothecary action against the company\u2019s trustee, the appellant, with the usual conclusions. On this action the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench came to the conclusion that the transfer from Mercier to Dub\u00e9 was a simulated transaction, and that in view of this simulation the rule applicable was that laid down by art. 1212 C.C., with respect to the effect of contre-lettres, so that, the creditors of Dub\u00e9 being third parties, the appellant, trustee of the company, could not set up against the respondent the fact that Dub\u00e9 had acquired and held Mercier\u2019s claim for the benefit of the company, and not for himself.\nHeld (without deciding whether or not simulation had been established, or whether or not the mandate between the company and Dub\u00e9 could be set up against the latter\u2019s creditors), that Dub\u00e9, being the president of the company, and having moreover acquired Mercier\u2019s claim with the company\u2019s moneys, could not obtain for himself any benefit, or acquire any right of action against the company, out of the transfer to him of Mercier\u2019s claim, and that Dub\u00e9\u2019s trustee, even as representing the latter\u2019s creditors, had no right of action against the insolvent company\u2019s estate, to enforce payment of the claim acquired by Dub\u00e9 from Mercier.\nHeld, also, that these transactions having taken place less than three months before the authorized assignment of the company, the transfer against the company obtained by Dub\u00e9 from Mercier, could not be set up by Dub\u00e9\u2019s trustee against the insolvent estate of the company (Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 11, s. 64).\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 557) rev,\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Stein J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.

Audet for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014Ce litige s\u2019est engag\u00e9 entre deux syndics autoris\u00e9s sous la Loi de Faillite, et de part et d\u2019autre on invoque les droits des cr\u00e9anciers des faillis qui, le m\u00eame jour, le 28 janvier 1925, ont fait cession de leurs biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de leurs cr\u00e9anciers respectifs. L\u2019appelant est syndic \u00e0 la faillite de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 est syndic \u00e0 la faillite de Duncan Napol\u00e9on Dub\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident et l\u2019un des principaux actionnaires de cette compagnie. Voici, aussi bri\u00e8vement que possible, les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au proc\u00e8s.\nLe 12 mai 1920, Fran\u00e7ois Vaillancourt, fils, a vendu \u00e0 Joseph Vaillancourt plusieurs lots de cadastre avec les b\u00e2tisses y \u00e9rig\u00e9es, ainsi que des pouvoirs d\u2019eau, chevaux, voitures, animaux de ferme, etc., et les droits du vendeur en vertu d\u2019un grand nombre de contrats, le tout pour le prix de $25,000, payable comme suit: $3,000 le 1er novembre 1920, et $3,000 le 1er novembre de chacune des ann\u00e9es suivantes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 parfait paiement, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 six pour cent. Le vendeur a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 son privil\u00e8ge pour le paiement du prix et a stipul\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution de plein droit de la vente \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019acheteur de payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance deux versements cons\u00e9cutifs du prix.\nQuelques jours plus tard, le 19 mai 1920, Joseph Vaillancourt vendit \u00e0 Duncan Napol\u00e9on Dub\u00e9 les deux tiers indivis de ce qu\u2019il avait acquis de Fran\u00e7ois Vaillancourt, pour les deux tiers du m\u00eame prix, payable aux m\u00eames \u00e9ch\u00e9ances, et Joseph Vaillancourt et Dub\u00e9 convinrent d\u2019exploiter ensemble ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, leur part dans leur soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tant d\u2019un tiers pour Joseph Vaillancourt et de deux tiers pour Dub\u00e9. Cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fut subs\u00e9quemment chang\u00e9e en une compagnie \u00e0 fonds social, Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, \u00e0 qui Dub\u00e9 et Joseph Vaillancourt vendirent les m\u00eames propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour un prix d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 comptant. Cette vente fut faite avec garantie, mais l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas oppos\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire que l\u2019intim\u00e9 exerce du chef de Dub\u00e9, l\u2019exception de garantie de l\u2019article 2068 du Code Civil. Il n\u2019y a donc pas lieu de se demander si le syndic de Dub\u00e9 pouvait, \u00e0 raison de cette promesse de garantie, \u00e9vincer Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e.\nPar l\u2019effet de la vente entre Joseph et Fran\u00e7ois Vaillancourt, celui-ci \u00e9tait cr\u00e9ancier de huit versements de $3,000, payables le 1er novembre des ann\u00e9es 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926 et 1927, et d\u2019un versement de $1,000 devant \u00e9choir le 1er novembre 1928. Le premier versement fut pay\u00e9. Fran\u00e7ois Vaillancourt transporta \u00e0 Alfred Mercier, avec garantie de fournir et faire valoir et b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la condition r\u00e9solutoire, les trois versements \u00e9ch\u00e9ant en 1921, 1922 et 1923. Plus tard, il c\u00e9da \u00e0 Napol\u00e9on Gr\u00e9goire, \u00e9galement avec garantie de fournir et faire valoir et b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la condition r\u00e9solutoire, les trois versements de $3,000 qui \u00e9taient payables en 1925, 1926 et 1927, et le dernier versement de $1,000 \u00e9ch\u00e9ant le 1er novembre 1928. Il garda pour lui le versement du 1er novembre 1924, mais il le c\u00e9da ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 Napol\u00e9on Gr\u00e9goire. Le premier versement de $3,000 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 Alfred Mercier, celui du 1er novembre 1921, lui fut pay\u00e9 par Joseph Vaillancourt. Les deux autres versements de la cr\u00e9ance de Mercier ne furent pas rencontr\u00e9s \u00e0 leur \u00e9ch\u00e9ance.\nEn octobre 1924, la Compagnie Vaillancourt se trouvait dans une situation embarrassante. Mercier n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 des versements \u00e9chus en 1922 et 1923, et il pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir de la clause r\u00e9solutoire. Le 1er novembre 1924, le premier des versements dont Gr\u00e9goire \u00e9tait cr\u00e9ancier devenait exigible. La Compagnie Vaillancourt avait suffisamment de fonds pour payer Mercier, mais ne pouvait rencontrer le versement qui allait devenir d\u00fb \u00e0 Gr\u00e9goire. Si elle \u00e9teignait la dette de Mercier, la cr\u00e9ance de Gr\u00e9goire, qui d\u00e9j\u00e0 commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 faire des menaces, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9clamation contre sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans ces circonstances, Dub\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, et Joseph Vaillancourt, son g\u00e9rant, s\u2019avis\u00e8rent, sur le conseil d\u2019un avocat, de satisfaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation de Mercier, tout en laissant subsister sa cr\u00e9ance contre l\u2019immeuble. Dub\u00e9 re\u00e7ut $6,600 de la compagnie et paya \u00e0 Mercier $6,992, se faisant transporter la cr\u00e9ance de celui-ci. La date du transport et du paiement des $6,600 est le 29 octobre 1924. Dub\u00e9 dit qu\u2019il voulait prot\u00e9ger la compagnie et ses cr\u00e9anciers. Il ajoute qu\u2019en devenant titulaire de la cr\u00e9ance de Mercier, il pensait \u00eatre en meilleure posture pour n\u00e9gocier avec Gr\u00e9goire et obtenir de lui un sursis afin de permettre \u00e0 Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, de faire assez de profits pour payer la cr\u00e9ance de Gr\u00e9goire.\nCeci se passait moins de trois mois avant la mise en faillite de Dub\u00e9 et de la compagnie, car leurs cessions de biens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites le 28 janvier suivant. Il est d\u2019ailleurs certain que la compagnie Vaillancourt \u00e9tait insolvable, \u00e0 la connaissance de Dub\u00e9, \u00e0 la date du paiement des $6,600 et du transport consenti par Mercier. Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli que Dub\u00e9 se faisait faire ce transport pour le compte de la compagnie et comme mandataire de cette derni\u00e8re. Il d\u00e9tenait donc la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire de Mercier pour Vaillancourt et Compagnie.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019empare maintenant de ce transport de Mercier \u00e0 Dub\u00e9, et, en sa qualit\u00e9 de syndic \u00e0 la faillite de celui-ci, intente contre la faillite Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e (qui n\u2019avait pas assum\u00e9 l\u2019obligation personnelle de payer le prix de vente stipul\u00e9 par Fran\u00e7ois Vaillancourt), une action hypoth\u00e9caire avec les conclusions usuelles de d\u00e9laisser l\u2019immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9, si mieux n\u2019aime la d\u00e9fenderesse, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019appelant \u00e8s qualit\u00e9, payer la dette en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais.\nSi la faillite Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, paye cette dette, elle l\u2019aura pay\u00e9e une seconde fois. Et si la faillite Dub\u00e9 re\u00e7oit ce paiement\u2014ou si, ce qui revient au m\u00eame, elle l\u2019obtient par la vente en justice de l\u2019immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9\u2014elle recevra de nouveau ce que Dub\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour obtenir pour cette derni\u00e8re le transport de la cr\u00e9ance de Mercier. Cette cr\u00e9ance, disons-le encore, aura \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e deux fois, une fois \u00e0 Mercier, et l\u2019autre fois au cessionnaire de Mercier, mais chaque fois \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e.\nOn ne peut s\u2019emp\u00eacher de trouver choquant ce r\u00e9sultat qui enrichirait les cr\u00e9anciers de Dub\u00e9 aux d\u00e9pens des cr\u00e9anciers de la faillite Vaillancourt. Et on peut bien se demander si les principes de droit que la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour du Banc du Roi invoquent justifient le jugement qu\u2019elles ont rendu en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nLes deux cours ont appliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce les r\u00e8gles de la simulation, ce qui est beaucoup la faute de l\u2019appelant qui, \u00e0 l\u2019audition en cour de premi\u00e8re instance, et pour ouvrir la porte \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale, a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contrat simul\u00e9. Et se pla\u00e7ant dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de la simulation, les deux cours ont jug\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre est celle de l\u2019article 1212 du Code Civil, qui dit que\nles contre-lettres n\u2019ont leur effet qu\u2019entre les parties contractantes; elles ne font point preuve contre les tiers.\nOr, ajoutent-elles, les cr\u00e9anciers de Dub\u00e9 sont des tiers, et on ne peut leur opposer ce qu\u2019on appelle la contre-lettre, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le fait que Dub\u00e9 agissait comme mandataire et non pas pour lui-m\u00eame et pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel.\nIl ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu ou non simulation dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M\u00eame en supposant qu\u2019on ne saurait opposer aux tiers, ou aux cr\u00e9anciers de Dub\u00e9, le mandat qui est intervenu entre Dub\u00e9 et la Compagnie Vaillancourt, il reste acquis que c\u2019est avec les deniers de celle-ci que Dub\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, a pay\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance de Mercier. Dans ces circonstances, Dub\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pu, sans fraude tant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, que de ses cr\u00e9anciers, garder pour lui-m\u00eame le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la cr\u00e9ance qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9e. Et comment son syndic peut-il invoquer le transport Mercier \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la faillite Vaillancourt sans se rendre lui-m\u00eame coupable de fraude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette derni\u00e8re?\nDans ces circonstances, il est clair que Dub\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas pu poursuivre Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, sur le transport qu\u2019il a obtenu de Mercier, et je suis d\u2019avis que son syndic, m\u00eame comme repr\u00e9sentant ses cr\u00e9anciers, ne peut faire valoir, du chef de Dub\u00e9, une r\u00e9clamation que Dub\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais eue. Ce syndic d\u00e9rive son titre de la cession de biens que Dub\u00e9 lui a faite sous l\u2019empire de la Loi de Faillite, et l\u2019action qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend exercer en cette cause ne faisait pas l\u00e9galement partie du patrimoine c\u00e9d\u00e9. Elle ne rentre pas, non plus, dans le cadre des actions que la Loi de Faillite permet au syndic de faire valoir au nom des cr\u00e9anciers.\nJe n\u2019ai donc pas besoin d\u2019exprimer une opinion sur les principes de droit que les jugements invoquent, ni sur les autorit\u00e9s que l\u00e9s savants juges citent. Ces principes et ces autorit\u00e9s sont sans application dans cette cause, et certaines solutions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise moderne, dont on fait \u00e9tat, me paraissent assez discutables. Il y a, surtout en mati\u00e8re de mandat, des diff\u00e9rences notables entre le Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et le Code Napol\u00e9on. Ainsi nos articles 1716 et 1727, pour ne parler que de ceux-l\u00e0, n\u2019existent pas dans le code fran\u00e7ais. En France, les tiers qui traitent avec un pr\u00eate-nom, ou avec un mandataire qui parle en son propre nom, n\u2019ont pas d\u2019action directe contre le mandant (Planiol, 8e \u00e9d., t. 2, n\u00b0 2271; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire pratique, vo. Mandat, n\u00b0 301). Il en est autrement sous notre code (art. 1716 C.C.) qui s\u2019inspire de la doctrine de Pothier (Mandat, n\u00b0 88). La situation apparente, en France, semble avoir une importance, en regard de la situation r\u00e9elle, qu\u2019elle n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre pas dans notre droit o\u00f9 nous n\u2019avons pas la r\u00e8gle, si importante en mati\u00e8re mobili\u00e8re, possession vaut titre (art. 2279 C.N. et art. 2268 Code civil, Qu\u00e9bec). Sur tout cela je crois devoir faire des r\u00e9serves, car la question peut se pr\u00e9senter de nouveau d\u2019une mani\u00e8re concr\u00e8te, mais pour le moment je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 trancher le d\u00e9bat.\nIl y a du reste une raison additionnelle dans cette cause pour rejeter l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les transactions en question sont intervenues dans les trois mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la mise en faillite de Dub\u00e9 et de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e. Ce serait contraire aux dispositions formelles de la Loi de Faillite que de permettre \u00e0 Dub\u00e9 ou \u00e0 son syndic de garder une partie importante de l\u2019actif de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, qui \u00e9tait insolvable \u00e0 la connaissance de Dub\u00e9 lors de la remise des $6,600, soit \u00e0 titre de paiement d\u2019une dette, ce qui serait un paiement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel, soit \u00e0 tout autre titre (art. 64 Loi de Faillite, chapitre 11, S.R.C., 1927). Et les principes fondamentaux de cette loi s\u2019opposent \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que le syndic \u00e0 la faillite Dub\u00e9 puisse r\u00e9clamer de Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, \u00e9galement en faillite, une dette qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9e. A tous \u00e9gards l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\nIl y a eu une objection \u00e0 la preuve du mandat intervenu entre Dub\u00e9 et Vaillancourt et Compagnie, Limit\u00e9e, dans le but d\u2019obtenir le transport, pour cette derni\u00e8re, de la cr\u00e9ance Mercier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas insist\u00e9 sur cette objection devant nous, et je crois que la preuve du mandat \u00e9tait admissible en vue des aveux de Dub\u00e9, la partie adverse (art. 1233 Code civil). Avec beaucoup de respect, ma conclusion est que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et que l\u2019action doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e, avec les frais de toutes les cours.\nAppeal alloived with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gagnon & Simard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Shink & Audet.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 43 K.B. 557.\n"}

Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FFOM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Accident\u2014Electric current\u2014Interior installation\u2014Electric power furnished by another person\u2014Electric storm\u2014Transformer out of order\u2014Current of 2,200 volts getting into the interior circuit\u2014Liability\u2014Articles 1053, 1054 C.C.\nThe respondent\u2019s husband, one Leon Claveau, an experienced mechanic, while employed as foreman in charge of the machine shop of the appellant company, was instantly killed by an electric shock as he was holding in his hands a portable electric lamp fixed to an extension cord. In the machine shop the interior installation for electricity was the property of the appellant and was used solely for lighting purposes. The wiring was extremely simple and consisted of two wires running on insulators with, here and there, what is known as rosettes from which lamps were hung. Some of these lamps were furnished with wire sufficiently long to permit of their being used within a certain radius. These extension lamps were attached to insulated wire, had wooden handles, and the globe itself was protected by a sort of wire basket attached to the wooden handle. At the entrance to the shop there was a cut out with fuses generally known as block switch with fuses, and of the kind generally used in such installations. The current contracted for and furnished for the lighting system was 110 volts. Outside the shop, the secondary wires passed through the block switch mentioned, and from there lead to a post situated about fifty feet away, and on which was installed a transformer for the purpose of reducing the high tension current of 2,200 volts to the voltage of 110 required and used for lighting. This transformer was the property of La Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas St. Laurent, which supplied the current and under whose care and control it was. Beyond such trans- former were the primary wires which carried the high tension current to the transformer where it was reduced to 110 volts and delivered to the appellant at the entrance to its shops. At the time of the accident a very intensive electric storm was raging and had been for some time. The accident occurred in this way: Claveau was overlooking some repairs to an engine and as it was dark, he picked up a portable lamp. The persons in the shop heard a cry and saw a flash of light, and Claveau fell holding the portable lamp in his hands. Apparently he was holding it by the wire screen used to protect the globe. Death was practically instantaneous. The expert evidence showed that the end of one of the primary wires stretching from one of the insulators on the post which held the transformer was broken and burnt, permitting the high tension current to enter the secondary system within the building belonging to the appellant, without passing through the transformer, the breaking and burning of this wire having been caused by a stroke of lightning or some similar occurrence. The respondent sued as well personally as in her quality of tutrix to her four minor children and claimed damages from the appellant company in an amount of $20,000. The respondent\u2019s action, having been dismissed by the trial court, was maintained by the appellate court for an amount of $6,000.\nHeld that the appellant company was not liable, Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting.\nHeld, also, Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting, that it was not the lamp, or at least it was not shown to have been the lamp, which caused the accident.\nHeld also, Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting, that the burden of proof that the damage was caused by a thing which the appellant had under its care was upon the respondent. Assuming that Claveau\u2019s death was caused by an electric shock emanating from the wires by which the lamp was connected with the source of the electric supply, and seeing that the source of supply and the transmission were under the care and operation of the power company, and not under the care of the appellant, it follows that the burden of proof that the lamp caused the damage is not satisfied, and cannot be discharged, without evidence that the electric current which caused the death of Claveau did not exist apart from the lamp, and this has not been established.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.\u2014In the eyes of the law and under the present conditions of modern life electricity is an industrial product, which is carried from one place to another. In practice, it has a material existence independent of the metallic wires or conduits through which it is supplied. It is legislatively recognized as susceptible of being measured, bought and sold, distributed and stolen.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.\u2014Companies supplying electricity for lighting purposes have under their care the electrical current which they supply; and the responsibility under art. 1054 C.C. for a death caused by an excessive electrical current which has escaped from their primary wires and has found its way in the interior installation of the house of one of their clients rests with such companies and not with the consumer, even if the interior installation through which the excessive electrical current is carried is under the care of such consumer. Per Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.\u2014The interior installation, comprising the electric current of 110 voltage, being the only \u201cthing\u201d which the appellant had under its care, was not the cause of the accident; the \u201cthing\u201d which caused the death of the respondent\u2019s husband,, i.e., the excessive electric current of 2,200 volts, was entirely under the care of the power company.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014There was evidence in the case upon which the trial judge might reasonably find as he did, and therefore his judgment should be restored (Supreme Court Act, s. 51).\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014If the lamp and the mysterious death-dealing agency, or force, or energy known as the electric current, can be considered as separate entities, it was the latter which was the direct operative cause\u2014the fatal instrument, if it may be so described\u2014and the lamp was no more than a sine qua non.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014The burden of proof that the damage was caused by a thing which the appellant company had under its care was upon the respondent. Assuming that Claveau\u2019s death was caused by electric shock emanating from the wires by which the lamp was connected with the source of the electric supply, and seeing that the source of supply and the transmission were under the care and operation of the power company, and not under the care of the appellant, it follows that the burden of proof that the lamp caused the damage is not satisfied, and cannot be discharged, without evidence that the electric current which caused the death of Claveau did not exist apart from the lamp, and this has not been established.\nPer Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting\u2014The appellant company is responsible under art. 1053 C.C. in not having taken all the precautions which a reasonable and competent regard for the safety of its employees would require. The appellant company must be presumed to have known that, unless the transformer was grounded, the employees in the shop were exposed to serious risk of an invasion of the interior circuit by the high-tension current. That risk was created by the connection of the company\u2019s installation with the secondary coil of the transformer, and thereby, through the primary coil, with the high-tension current as the source of energy. It was a risk arising from the tapping of that source of energy, and the connection of it with the shop, for the benefit and by the consent and direction of the appellant company. Having regard to the gravity of the risk, the appellant incurred an obligation to exercise the highest degree of care; and this obligation was not performed by simply assuming that the power company had not been negligent. The appellant ought to have ascertained that the proper precautions had been taken before connecting their interior circuit with the transformer.\nPer Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting. The death of the respondent\u2019s husband was \u201ccaused\u201d by a thing under the care of the appellant, in the sense of article 1054 C.C.; and the appellant has failed to bring itself within the clause of that article, which, upon certain conditions being satisfied, exonerates it from responsibility. The wires and other appliances of the interior circuit, constituted, in their totality, a thing in the care, and under the control, of the appellant. Its function was that of a conductor of electricity. The service it performed was to receive energy from the primary circuit, and to distribute that energy to the various points at which it was utilized in the production of electric light. It was by the act of the appellant and solely by its act, that the connection was maintained, through which alone, electrical energy was, or could be transferred, from the high-tension circuit of the power company to the interior circuit. It was from this circuit that Claveau received the discharge. Whatever other causes may have co-operated, the interior circuit, as the instrument by which the diversion was effected and by which the energy diverted, was directed and conveyed into Claveau\u2019s body and was one of the factors which directly co-operated in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\nPer Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting: A statutory enactment, assigning responsibility, for damage \u201ccaused\u201d by a given act or thing, would not, in the absence of a controlling context, naturally be read as limited in its application to damage exclusively so caused\u2019; but would ordinary be considered to apply to damage caused by the designated person or thing functioning in conjunction with other co-operating causes. Charing Cross v. Hydraulic Power Co. ([1914] 3 K.B. 772 at p. 782. There seems to be no good reason for limiting the application of article 1054 C.C., in such a way as to exclude from its scope all damages except such as are exclusively caused by the thing under the care of the person alleged to be responsible.\nPer Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting. Whatever difficulties may be encountered in determining, for the purpose of applying it to other circumstances, the precise limits of the conception denoted by the word \u201ccaused\u201d in the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., there is no doubt that, where the damages are of such a character as to fall within the purview of risks which a person ought to recognize as arising from his maintenance of the thing which is in debate, then that paragraph comes into operation.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 562) reversed, Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Pouliot J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages resulting from the death of her husband.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. C. M. Thomson K.C. and P. E. Gagnon for the appellant.\nL. G. Belley K.C. for the respondent. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Rinfret.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The pertinent facts are stated from the point of view of the appellants for the purpose of supporting the appeal, in the following extracts from the appellants\u2019 factum.\nIn the machine shop * * * there was an interior installation for electric lighting, which was the property of the defendant-appellant, and used solely for lighting purposes. This wiring was extremely simple and consisted of two wires running on insulators and with here and there what is known as rosettes from which lamps were hung. * * * Some of these lamps were furnished with wire sufficiently long to permit of their being used within a certain radius. These extension lamps were attached to insulated wire, had wooden handles, and the globe itself was protected by a sort of wire basket attached to a wooden handle * * *. At the entrance to the shop there was a cut out with fuses generally known as block switch with fuses, and was of the kind generally used in such installations. The current contracted for and furnished for the lighting system was 110 volts * * *.\nOutside the shop, the secondary or interior wires passed through the block switch mentioned, and from there lead to a post situated about forty feet away, and on which was installed a transformer for the purpose of reducing the high tension current of 2,200 volts to the voltage of 110 required and habitually used for lighting. This transformer was the property of La Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas St. Laurent, who furnished the current, and whose property and under whose charge and control it was * * *. Beyond such transformer were the primary wires which carried the high tension current to the transformer where it was reduced to 110 volts and delivered to the defendant at the entrance to its shops. * * *\nThe accident occurred in this way: Claveau, the foreman of the machine shop was overlooking some repairs to an engine. The work was being done by Messrs. Lachance, father and son. They told Claveau that the portable lamp which they were using was too short and Claveau replied that he would lengthen it. He did not do this, however, but went to another part of the shop, where he picked up another portable lamp. The witnesses heard a cry and saw a flash of light, and Claveau fell holding the portable lamp in his hands. * * * Apparently he was holding it by the wire screen used to protect the globe. Death was practically instantaneous. * * *\nThe expert evidence shows * * * and there is no contradictory evidence, that the end of one of the primary wires stretching from one of the insulators on the post which held the transformer, had broken and burnt, permitting the high tension current to enter the secondary system within the building belonging to the defendant-appellant, without passing through the transformer. The breaking and burning of this wire was caused by a stroke of lightning or some similar occurrence. * * *\nThe essential facts which have a considerable bearing on the present case may be resumed as follows:\n1. A very heavy electric storm was in progress at the time of the accident;\n2. The storm had resulted in the primary system of wires carrying the high tension current being struck in such a way that either the high tension current or the current from the lightning itself entered the appellant\u2019s building and ran along its secondary system intended for 110 volts only;\n3. That the high tension current and the system upon which it was carried, including the transformer, were things belonging to and in charge of, not the appellant but a third party.\nThis statement requires only one word of comment, for the purpose of putting aside (and thereby simplifying the consideration of the case) the suggestion in the last paragraph not very seriously made that Claveau\u2019s injury was due to a stroke of lightning passing from the line of the power company through the interior circuit. The substantive view put forward in the factum is that, the rupture of the main line having been caused by a stroke of lightning, the high potential of that line was applied to the secondary circuit by direct contact of the broken end of the primary wire with the metal supports of the transformer, and that a current or electrostatic charge of abnormally high potential was thus communicated to the secondary circuit. This was the view advanced by Walsh, the only independent expert called by the appellants who negatived explicitly the suggestion that Claveau was killed in consequence of receiving a stroke of lightning. The other witnesss, M\u00e9th\u00e9, who maintained the opposite, was the engineer of the power company, and was obviously concerned to protect his own company from responsibility for its negligence in failing to take the necessary measures to prevent an escape of current from the main line into the secondary circuit. Under pressure of cross examination, he affirmed he was not an electrician, and not competent to give expert evidence upon subjects within the domain of an electrician. His evidence upon this point, should for these reasons, be disregarded.\nIt should further be observed that the fair deduction from the evidence of the appellants themselves is that in order to protect the interior circuit from risk of invasion by the high pressure current in the main line, it is usual to ground the transformer, and furthermore that this precaution is as a rule effective, and would have been effective in the circumstances in evidence, if it had been, as it was not, observed.\nI have been unable to convince myself that the appellants are not responsible under article 1053 C.C. Nobody would dispute the obligation of an employer to take reasonable measures for the safety of his employees, and for that purpose to take all the precautions which a reasonable and competent regard for such safety would require. Particularly, if the employees in the course of their duties are brought into contact with or proximity to dangerous things, or things that may become dangerous in the absence of proper precautions, it is his duty to take all reasonable measures, for their protection. The employees are entitled to assume that they are not exposed to risks which do not present themselves to their observation, and which can be avoided, and are commonly and usually avoided by well-known precautions.\nThe appellant company must be presumed to have known that unless the transformer was grounded, the employees in the shop were exposed to serious risk of an invasion of the interior circuit by the high-tension current. That risk was created by the connection of the company\u2019s installation with the secondary coil of the transformer, and thereby, through the primary coil, with the high-tension current as the source of energy. It was a risk arising from the tapping of that source of energy, and the connection of it with the shop, for the benefit and by the consent and direction of the appellant company. It is quite true that the transformer was apparently not situated on the appellant company\u2019s premises, and it seems to have been the property of the power company; but the transformer could only function in relation to a circuit connected with its secondary coil, and existed only for the purpose of providing, by the permission of the appellant company, and under contract with it, a current for that circuit. The connection between the high-tension current and the wires and other appliances constituting the appellant company\u2019s installation, was, and could only be effected, by the act of the appellants. It was the appellant company\u2019s own act, therefore, which in part directly, in part through the instrumentality of the power company, established this potentially dangerous thing in its own shop.\nIt was held by the Privy Council in Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[2], that the duty of an employer to take reasonable care to provide a safe place for his work people, and a proper plant, is a duty which cannot be delegated. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this appeal to decide whether the performance of that duty in the circumstances before us could have been delegated to an independent contractor or an expert employee. Proper precautions were not in fact taken, and that under the circumstances of this case is sufficient prima facie to establish that the employer\u2019s duty was not performed, and there is not the slightest evidence to show that the duty was by the appellants delegated to anybody, either contractor or servant. Assuming that the appellants could have performed their duty by employing a competent expert to report upon the proper measures to be taken for the protection of their servants, with authority to take such measures, or by entering into a contract with an independent contractor undertaking to do the same thing, there is no evidence to show that anything of the kind was done by them. It is no answer to say that the power company in failing to take the necessary precautions was guilty of fault, or that it was the duty of the power company to take such precautions. Having regard to the gravity of the risk, the appellants incurred an obligation to exercise the highest degree of care; and I cannot agree that this obligation was performed by simply assuming that the power company had not been negligent. The appellants ought to have ascertained that the proper precautions had been taken before connecting their interior circuit with the transformer.\nI now come to the consideration of article 1054 C.C. The wires and other appliances of the interior circuit, constituted, in their totality, a thing in the care, and under the control, of the appellants. Its function was that of a conductor of electricity. The service it performed was to receive energy from the primary circuit, and to distribute that energy to the various points at which it was utilized in the production of electric light. It was by the act of the appellants and solely by their act, that the connection was maintained, through which alone, electrical energy, was, or could be transferred from the high-tension circuit of the power company to the interior circuit. It was from this circuit that Claveau received the discharge. Whatever other causes may have been involved, the interior circuit, as the instrument by which the diversion was effected, and by which the energy diverted, was directed and conveyed into Claveau\u2019s body, was one of the factors which directly co-operated in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s loss. That seems to me to be only another way of saying that Claveau\u2019s death was \u201ccaused\u201d by a thing under the care of the appellants in the sense of article 1054 C.C.; and, as we shall see presently, the appellants have failed to bring themselves within the clause of that article, which, upon certain conditions being fulfilled, exonerates them from responsibility.\nTo this, the appellants\u2019 principal answer is that the true cause, that is to say, the only cause within the meaning of article 1054 C.C., was the escape of a high-tension electric current into Claveau\u2019s body, and that this high-tension electric current was a thing, not in the \u201ccare\u201d of the appellants in the sense of article 1054 C.C. This contention of course involves the proposition that the circuit which was in the care and under the control of the appellants, and played the part just indicated in producing Claveau\u2019s death, was not a cause of it, in that sense.\nNow, neither in common language, nor in law, has the word \u201ccause\u201d a fixed meaning, which can be formulated in a strict definition. Out of the numberless antecedents of a given effect, we are in the habit of selecting those which attract our attention from a particular point of view, and ascribing to those antecedents the character of cause.\nLawyers, concerned only with assigning juridical responsibility, address themselves primarily to human acts or omissions and their consequences; and as a given effect may result from the co-operation of several such acts or omissions, each of them may serve as the foundation of legal responsibility, as the legal cause from one point of view.\nA statutory enactment, assigning responsibility, for damage \u201ccaused\u201d by given act or thing, would not, in the absence of a controlling context, naturally be read, as limited in its application to damage exclusively so caused; but would ordinarily be considered to apply to damage caused by the designated person or thing functioning in conjunction with other co-operating causes. Charing Cross v. Hydraulic Power Co.[3]. There seems to be no good reason for limiting the application of article 1054 C.C., in such a way as to exclude from its scope all damages except such as are exclusively caused by the thing under the care of the person alleged to be responsible. And indeed, this is not permissible in view of the decision in City of Montreal v. Watt[4].\nArticle 1054 C.C., envisages the \u201cthings\u201d to which it applies, as objects of care, and as potential instruments of harm, and interpreting the article in that light, we can without difficulty, arrive at at least one conclusion as to the scope of the word \u201ccaused.\u201d Responsibility is displaced if the damage dealing act or event is shown to be something that the person having care of the thing, could not prevent by any exertions that might reasonably be required of him. There can be no doubt, that if the thing which is the subject of care, does, in the circumstances in which it is placed, give rise to a risk of harm, recognizable by a reasonably competent forethought, then any harm which actually supervenes from the realization of that risk, is damage \u201ccaused\u201d by the thing within the contemplation of article 1054 C.C., and the person having the care of the thing, must, in order to escape responsibility, show that he could not by anything he could reasonably be called upon to do, have averted it. The scope of the word \u201ccaused\u201d may be much wider, but for the present it is sufficient that it is broad enough to embrace all such cases. In the legal sense, you would be emptying the word \u201ccause\u201d of all meaning by holding that such cases are not within the intendment of article 1054 C.C.\nThe occurrence which led to Claveau\u2019s death was, as I have pointed out above, one which ought to have been anticipated by the appellants as within the risk created by the maintenance of the interior circuit in connection with the power company\u2019s transformer.\nIt is a little important in this connection not to be misled by descriptive epithets commonly found in legal treatises and even in judgments, which while they have their value for descriptive purposes, cannot, without grave risk of error, be treated as furnishing, even approximately, a criterium for differentiating the kinds of casual connection which the law does or does not recognize as entailing responsibility. In Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[5], Lord Sumner refers to some of these. Effective cause, he observes, is simply that which causes. Proximate cause has acquired a special connotation through its employment in insurance law. He suggests that direct cause is the least objectionable of all phrases because it is consistent with the possibility of the concurrence of more direct causes than one, operating at the same time and leading to a common result, and he refers to Burrows v. March, Gas & Coke Co.[6] and Hill v. New River Co.[7], which are not without a noticeable resemblance to the present case. In British Columbia Electric Ry. v. Loach[8], Lord Sumner, speaking for the Judicial Committee, which included Lord Haldane and Lord Parker, as well as himself, said: observed as to inquiries into responsibility for torts:\nThe inquiry is a judicial inquiry. It does not always follow the historical method and begin at the beginning. Very often it is more convenient to begin at the end, that is at the accident, and work back along the line of events which led up to it. The object of the inquiry is to fix upon some wrong-doer the responsibility for the wrongful act which has caused the damage. It is in search not merely of a causal agency but of the responsible agent. When that has been done, it is not necessary to pursue the matter into its origins; for judicial purposes they are remote. Till that has been done there may be a considerable sequence of physical events, and event of acts of responsible human beings, between the damage done and the conduct which is tortious and is its cause. It is surprising how many epithets eminent judges have applied to the cause, which has to be ascertained for this judicial purpose of determining liability, and how many more to other acts and incidents, which for this purpose are not the cause at all. \u201cEfficient or effective cause,\u201d \u201creal cause,\u201d \u201cproximate cause,\u201d \u201cdirect cause,\u201d \u201cdecisive cause,\u201d \u201cimmediate cause,\u201d \u201ccausa causans,\u201d on the one hand as against, on the other, \u201ccausa sine qua non,\u201d \u201coccasional cause,\u201d \u201cremote cause,\u201d \u201ccontributory cause,\u201d \u201cinducing cause,\u201d \u201ccondition,\u201d and so on. No doubt in the particular cases in which they occur they were thought to be useful or they would not have been used, but the repetition of terms without examination in other cases has often led to confusion, and it might be better, after pointing out that the inquiry is an investigation into responsibility, to be content with speaking of the cause of the injury simply and without qualification.\nI repeat, however, that whatever difficulties may be encountered, in determining, for the purpose of applying it to other circumstances, the precise limits of the conception denoted by the word \u201ccaused\u201d in the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., of this there seems at least to be no room for doubt, that where the damages are of such a character as to fall within the purview of those risks which the defendant ought to recognize as arising from his maintenance of the thing which is in debate, then that paragraph comes into operation. This seems to be involved in City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott[9].\nWe may now examine a little more closely from this point of view, the facts with which we have to deal. The immediate agency in Claveau\u2019s death was the discharge of electrical energy into his body. The immediate cause of that discharge, so far as we know, was Claveau\u2019s own act in grasping the electric lamp. From the point of view of responsibility, that is of no consequence, because Claveau seems to have had no reason to suspect the risk he was encountering, and there is no suggestion of fault on his part; but Claveau\u2019s act took effect in co-operation with two other things, first, the presence in the wire of an electrostatic charge of high potential, or an electrical current of high pressure, and moreover, as an equally essential thing, which such a state of the wire and its appurtenances as permitted the discharge. As concerns Claveau, or Claveau\u2019s representatives, either of these things might equally, that is to say, with no distinction from the juridical point of view, be the cause of the discharge. If the presence of the electric charge or electric current was due to the negligence of A, and the state of the appliances which made the discharge possible, was due to the negligence of B, then, from the point of view of A\u2019s responsibility, under article 1053 C.C. the first was the cause, in the legal sense, while in the same sense, the second was the cause from the point of view of B\u2019s responsibility. Neither A nor B could escape responsibility by attempting to cast it exclusively upon the other.\nThen the transfer of electricity, under inordinate pressure, from the high voltage lines of the power company, to the interior circuit of the appellants, involved, first, a condition of the power company\u2019s wires, permitting its escape, then a condition of the interior circuit and of the appliances for tapping the high-tension current of the power company which permitted the application of a dangerously high potential to the circuit, and if the condition of the circuit which permitted this, or the condition of the transformer which permitted it, or the condition of the power company\u2019s lines, which permitted it, was due to the negligence of the persons severally responsible for each of these things, then each of them was, in its turn, from the point of view of responsibility, under article 1053 C.C., a cause of the respondent\u2019s damage. If the absence of grounding for the transformer, was due to the negligence of the appellants, as well as to the negligence of the power company, then they were jointly responsible, under that article, for that state of affairs, and if grounding would have prevented the accident, the absence of grounding is, from the point of view of both of them, a cause.\nIt seems equally clear that from the point of view of the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., any one of these things\u2014the state of the interior circuit, and of the lamp attached to it, as conductors of electricity, in other words, the interior circuit and the lamp, in the state in which they were, permitted the discharge into Claveau\u2019s body; the condition of the circuit which permitted the high tension current to pass into the interior of the shop from the transformer; the condition of the power company\u2019s main line and the transformer, which permitted the escape of the current from the main line of the transformer\u2019s support, and thence to the interior circuit\u2014any one of these things, it seems clear, was in the sense of that paragraph, a co-operating cause of the damage.\nI will not dwell upon the effect of this conclusion as touching the responsibility of the appellants. The appellants could only exonerate themselves by showing that no reasonable precautions within their power, would, if taken, have prevented the damage. In this, they failed in three respects. First, apart altogether from the matter of the grounding of the transformer, they failed to show\u2014the evidence is silent upon it\u2014that there was no available means by which they could have protected their interior circuit from such an invasion as that which occurred. Second, the testimony adduced on behalf of the appellants themselves, shows that the lamp was not of the type commonly in use, and there was no evidence justifying the conclusion that, by a proper insulation, persons using the lamp could not have been made secure against the risk of such a discharge as that which Claveau received. And lastly, there is the matter of the grounding of the transformer, which has been sufficiently discussed already. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNewcombe j.\u2014The trial judge found that the defendant company was not guilty of any fault, and that it had not under its care the excessive electric current, found to be the thing which caused the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband. Upon appeal, the majority of the learned judges considered, as I interpret the judgment of the court, that the fatal occurrence was due to the fact that, accidentally, during a violent thunder storm, the portable extension lamp became charged with a current of 2,200 volts, which it was not intended to carry, and that death was caused by the shock communicated to the man\u2019s body when he grasped the lamp so charged; that although this electric current was not under the care of the defendant, the lamp was; that, while it was not shown that the defendant was negligent, there was room for the application of article 1054 of the Civil Code of Quebec, and that the defendant should have established that it could not have prevented the accident, which, in the view of the court, it had failed to do, because it was not shown that by the use of a better or safer lamp, or one more qualified to afford protection against the perils which were encountered, the accident could not possibly or probably (fort possible, sinon fort probable) have been avoided. The ground of obligation found by the Court of King\u2019s Bench is thus the said article in its relation to the lamp, and the absence of proof of defeasance of the liability held to be thereby imposed, namely, proof of inability to prevent the act (le fait) which caused the damage.\nI would interpret article 1054 C.C. in its application to this case as providing that every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by things which he has under his care, but only if he fail to establish (ne peut prouver) that he was unable to prevent the act (le fait) which caused the damage, and I shall assume for the purposes of what I am going to say that the word \u201cperson\u201d in this context includes a corporation such as the defendant company.\nI would have upheld the judgment of the learned trial judge, and, therefore, in the discharge of what I conceive to be the duty of the court under s. 51 of the Supreme Court Act, the appeal should, I think, be allowed. In my judgment there was evidence in the case upon which the trial judge might reasonably find as he did. I am not prepared to replace his finding by one of negligence against the defendant; neither apparently was the Court of King\u2019s Bench. Moreover, as to the thing which caused the accident, if it were a thing, I am persuaded that it was not the lamp, or at least it is not shown to have been the lamp. If the lamp and the mysterious death-dealing agency, or force, or energy, known as the electric current, can be considered as separate entities, it was the latter which was the direct operative cause\u2014the fatal instrument, if it may be so described, and the lamp was no more than a sine qua non. There are many English cases which illustrate the principle of this conclusion; see for example. Wilson v. Xantho[10]; and Hamilton vs. Pandorf[11], which, though relating to very different conditions of fact, exemplify the application of a rule of causality which is common to both systems.\nIt is not necessary to go further, but, if it were, I should wish to consider whether the defendant would not escape liability under article 1054 for the reason that it was unable to prevent the occurrence which caused the damage. This means \u201cunable by reasonable means\u201d; City of Montreal vs. Watt and Scott[12]. If there had been negligence on the defendant\u2019s part it would have been liable under article 1053, but negligence is excluded by the findings; there was therefore, in that sense, no failure to adopt reasonable means, and I am in a frame of mind to question whether it does not appear to be unreasonable that the defendant should have anticipated what happened and provided extraordinary means of safety against such a combination of unforeseen occurrences, and the intrusion of a resulting current twenty times greater than that for which its works were constructed and equipped, if indeed it were possible to do so.\nAs to the burden of proof that the damage was caused by a thing which the defendant company had under its care, it was upon the plaintiff. Although the lamp may have afforded a passage for the electric current which caused the shock, it seems to be clear, upon the case as it stands, that La Compagnie du Pouvoir de Bas St. Laurent, the power company which supplied the electricity to the premises of the defendant company, produced the current and had the care of the apparatus and the exterior wires by which the current was transmitted, and would have been responsible for the damages upon an allegation of fault or negligence on the part of that company. Assuming that the man\u2019s death was caused by electric shock emanating from the wires by which the lamp was connected with the source of the electric supply, and, seeing that the source of supply and the transmission were under the care and operation of the power company, and not under the care of the defendant, it follows that the burden of proof that the lamp caused the damage is not satisfied, and, I should think, cannot be discharged, without evidence that the electric current which caused the death of Claveau did not exist apart from the lamp. No attempt was of course made to establish this, but, to the contrary, the proof proceeds upon the assumption that the lamp and its attachments served only as the conductor of something foreign to the lamp\u2014a source of power, not the lamp, possessing that inherent or latent capacity to produce the fatal result which was excited to action by contact with the man\u2019s hand. It is consistent with the absence of liability on defendant\u2019s part that electricity is not more intimately known to science than as a name applied to the source of its well recognized phenomena, while its material existence cannot be denied if, as in practice and legislatively recognized, it can be measured, bought and sold, exported, distributed and stolen. (See Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act, c. 16 of 1907; Criminal Code, s. 351; Electric Lighting Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII, c. 34, Imp., etc.) Moreover in the judicial authorities to which my brother Rinfret refers the electric current is treated as an independent causative agent. It has the quality and habit of travelling by wire, but for the damage which it causes in transit, expressing my opinion with some diffidence and with the utmost respect, the Civil Code does not, in the circumstances of this case, attach liability to a person who has the care only of the wire, or of the lamp in which the wire terminates, when the damage is not caused by his fault, even though he have failed to prove that he was unable, within the meaning of the article, to prevent the act which caused the damage.\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019appelante, Canada and Gulf Terminal Railway Company, poss\u00e9dait \u00e0 Mont-Joli une usine de r\u00e9paration. L\u2019\u00e9clairage s\u2019y faisait au moyen de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 fournie par La compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas St-Laurent. A cette fin, le r\u00e9seau de cette compagnie, compos\u00e9 de fils primaires charg\u00e9s d\u2019un courant de 2200 volts, se rendait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une distance d\u2019environ cinquante pieds de l\u2019usine. L\u00e0, le courant \u00e9tait transform\u00e9 \u00e0 110 volts et, ainsi r\u00e9duit, suivait des fils secondaires jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019usine o\u00f9 il rejoignait l\u2019installation int\u00e9rieure.\nLe r\u00e9seau et le transformateur \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la compagnie d\u2019\u00e9clairage, qui en avait la garde, le contr\u00f4le et la direction. Les fils secondaires et l\u2019installation \u00e9lectrique int\u00e9rieure \u00e9taient sous la garde de la compagnie de chemin de fer Canada and Gulf Terminal.\nL\u00e9on Claveau, l\u2019\u00e9poux de la demanderesse et le p\u00e8re des autres demandeurs, \u00e9tait contrema\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la compagnie de chemin de fer. Le 9 juin 1925, dans l\u2019usine, il surveillait la r\u00e9paration d\u2019une locomotive. C\u2019\u00e9tait au cours d\u2019un orage tr\u00e8s violent, accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9clairs et de tonnerre. Les ouvriers eurent besoin d\u2019\u00e9clairer l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la locomotive. Il y avait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 une lampe \u00e9lectrique portative, attach\u00e9e \u00e0 un long fil, et que l\u2019on pouvait ainsi transporter d\u2019un endroit \u00e0 un autre. La lampe consistait en une ampoule dans un socle en cuivre, entour\u00e9e d\u2019un grillage m\u00e9tallique, et fix\u00e9e \u00e0 une poign\u00e9e en bois.\nClaveau traversa la salle de l\u2019usine pour aller chercher cette lampe. On entendit un cri et, en m\u00eame temps dans la direction d\u2019o\u00f9 venait le cri, on vit une grosse lueur, \u201ccomme un \u00e9clair\u201d. Claveau \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 foudroy\u00e9. On le trouva avec la lampe portative dans la main gauche. Il avait (dit l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins) les doigts crisp\u00e9s dans la broche. Il \u00e9tait br\u00fbl\u00e9 sur les doigts. Il la tenait serr\u00e9e, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de lui ouvrir la main.\nLe m\u00e9decin, Docteur J. A. Ross, aussit\u00f4t appel\u00e9, constata\nune br\u00fblure pouvant s\u2019\u00e9tendre sur toute la longueur du poignet, tr\u00e8s profonde. M\u00eame les chairs \u00e9taient carbonis\u00e9es.\nIl attribua la mort \u00e0 un choc \u00e9lectrique et \u00e0 la br\u00fblure.\nL\u2019\u00e9pouse et les enfants de Claveau ont voulu faire d\u00e9clarer la Compagnie Canada and Gulf Terminal Railway responsable de sa mort pour n\u2019avoir pas tenu\non bon ordre l\u2019installation ext\u00e9rieure et int\u00e9rieure de la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique et (avoir laiss\u00e9) p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans la lampe un courant meurtrier.\nIls ont fait ainsi reposer leur demande sur une all\u00e9gation de faute et de n\u00e9gligence. Mais ils ont ajout\u00e9 que l\u2019accident fut caus\u00e9 par la lampe et le courant \u00e9lectrique dont, suivant eux, la compagnie Canada & Gulf Terminal avait le contr\u00f4le et la garde, et ils tent\u00e8rent par l\u00e0 d\u2019appuyer leur r\u00e9clamation sur l\u2019article 1054 du Code civil.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9:\nla demanderesse n\u2019a rapport\u00e9 la preuve d\u2019aucune faute r\u00e9sultant du fait personnel de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1054 C.C., la cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en fait, que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019avait sous sa garde que l\u2019installation d\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019usine; qu\u2019il\nn\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que la mort de Claveau soit la cons\u00e9quence de cette installation;\nque la cause prochaine de cet accident fut une d\u00e9charge \u00e9lectrique excessive et impr\u00e9vue occasionn\u00e9e par le fait que la foudre est tomb\u00e9e sur un fil primaire de l\u2019installation ext\u00e9rieure et l\u2019a rompu. Comme r\u00e9sultat: le fluide \u00e9lectrique ainsi d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, ou le courant de plus de 2000 volts dont les fils primaires \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s, s\u2019est communiqu\u00e9 aux fils secondaires et a p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans l\u2019usine, o\u00f9 il a provoqu\u00e9 la mort de Claveau. Cette mort a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 le fait ou des forces de la nature ou d\u2019un courant \u00e9lectrique dont la Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas St-Laurent avait seule la garde. Les fils secondaires et la lampe ne furent que les agents occasionnels du dommage. En premi\u00e8re instance, l\u2019action fut donc rejet\u00e9e.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi ne fut pas d\u2019avis diff\u00e9rent sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019accident \u00e9tait survenu. Elle dit, dans son jugement: L\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9 parce que, anormalement et contrairement \u00e0 toute attente, le panier protecteur (de la lampe) se trouvait charg\u00e9 d\u2019un fort courant \u00e9lectrique, (lorsque ledit L\u00e9on Claveau a pris ladite lampe pour s\u2019en servir. Il est prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit pendant un violent orage \u00e9lectrique. Par le fait de l\u2019orage, ou autrement peu importe, un fil reliant le transformateur \u00e0 un des fils primaires du r\u00e9seau \u00e9tant venu \u00e0 se rompre, le courant de 2,200 volts du fil primaire se communiqua \u00e0 la caisse m\u00e9tallique du transformateur et, de l\u00e0, au fil secondaire conduisant \u00e0 l\u2019usine, sans passer par les bobines destin\u00e9es \u00e0 le r\u00e9duire, etc.\nLe majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, comme la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, rejeta les all\u00e9gations de faute contre la d\u00e9fenderesse. La preuve avait \u00e9tabli que le transformateur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u201cterr\u00e9\u201d (i.e. en communication avec le sol par un fil conducteur ou \u201cgrounded\u201d), ce qui aurait probablement emp\u00each\u00e9 l\u2019accident. Mais la cour d\u00e9cida que la compagnie de chemin de fer n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sujette \u00e0 reproche sur ce point. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire du transformateur. Elle n\u2019en avait pas la garde. Il n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle connaissait cette d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9.\nCe serait trop exiger d\u2019un simple consommateur d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique et, pour employer le langage du Conseil Priv\u00e9: ce ne serait pas raisonnable (de) dire qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9, en ne se donnant pas la peine d\u2019aller v\u00e9rifier si le transformateur \u00e9tait install\u00e9 suivant les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019art.\nCependant la cour fut d\u2019avis que la mort de Claveau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la lampe \u00e9lectrique portative, alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait sous la garde de la d\u00e9fenderesse. La majorit\u00e9 des juges d\u00e9cida, en cons\u00e9quence, que la compagnie Canada and Gulf Terminal \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement responsable de cette mort parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait \u201cpu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage\u201d. Pour monsieur le juge Greenshields, au contraire, la preuve que l\u2019accident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute de la Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas St-Laurent, qui avait omis de \u201cterrer\u201d son transformateur, \u00e9tait suffisante pour faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier la d\u00e9fenderesse de la clause \u201cdisculpatoire\u201d de l\u2019article 1054 C.C.\nC\u2019est dans ces conditions que la cause nous est maintenant soumise. Et, comme on le voit, le conflit entre la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi ne porte que sur l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. Les deux cours se sont accord\u00e9es pour absoudre la d\u00e9fenderesse de toute responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. Le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi signale que la lampe portative n\u2019\u00e9tait pas irr\u00e9prochable, mais ce n\u2019est que pour accentuer, dans son raisonnement, le d\u00e9faut de la d\u00e9fenderesse de se disculper. L\u2019emploi d\u2019une lampe diff\u00e9rente (avec socle en porcelaine, poign\u00e9e recouverte de caoutchouc, etc.), de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la lampe avec socle en cuivre qu\u2019il y avait ici, est la seule pr\u00e9caution raisonnable que l\u2019on a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e comme pouvant \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019accident, par application du principe: \u201cunable by reasonable means to prevent the damage complained of\u201d pos\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de City of Montreal v. Watt and Scott Ltd.[13]. Mais il est prouv\u00e9 que la lampe dont on a fait usage en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait suffisante (\u201ccorrecte\u201d) pour le voltage qu\u2019elle devait normalement recevoir; et il n\u2019est nullement \u00e9tabli que, par l\u2019emploi d\u2019une lampe diff\u00e9rente, telle que d\u00e9crite, l\u2019appelante e\u00fbt \u201cpu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage\u201d (art. 1054 C.C.).\nL\u2019appelante, pour pr\u00e9venir un fait de ce genre, avait d\u2019ailleurs, comme la preuve le d\u00e9montre, employ\u00e9 un moyen plus efficace. Elle avait fait installer dans l\u2019usine\nun appareil qui fait d\u00e9claneher le coupe-circuit et (qui) ouvre automatiquement s\u2019il arrivait des d\u00e9charges ou un courant tr\u00e8s fort. Ce sont des pr\u00e9cautions dans l\u2019usine qui sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 laisser passer la charge normale de la ligne sans travailler, mais s\u2019il passe un courant double ou triple de la charge normale, il y a un piston-plongeur qui se soul\u00e8ve et qui occasionne un d\u00e9clanchement, et le courant, le circuit se trouve interrompu par le fait m\u00eame.\nLors de l\u2019accident qui nous occupe, le coupe-circuit n\u2019a pas fonctionn\u00e9 automatiquement. L\u2019inspection qui a suivi n\u2019y a cependant rien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de d\u00e9fectueux; et la pr\u00e9somption de l\u2019expert a port\u00e9 sur les \u00e9clairs.\nLe fait que le primaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9 en avant du transformateur, pr\u00e8s de l\u2019usine du Canada & Gulf Terminal, ne devait pas n\u00e9cessairement faire tomber la \u201cswitch\u201d automatique, parce qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les fils qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0, les fils n\u00b0 10, \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s faibles, ils auraient br\u00fbl\u00e9 sous l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de l\u2019arc et puis le coupe-circuit de l\u2019usine n\u2019aurait pas eu le temps de sauter.\nL\u2019accident s\u2019est donc produit malgr\u00e9 la protection du coupecircuit; et il fut instantan\u00e9, puisque le coupe-circuit n\u2019a \u201cpas eu le temps de sauter\u201d, ce qui favorise davantage la th\u00e9orie qu\u2019il fut caus\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9clair.\nAucune pr\u00e9caution additionnelle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9e pour \u00e9viter cet accident. Personne n\u2019a signal\u00e9 un autre \u201cmoyen raisonnable\u201d par lequel l\u2019appelante aurait pu \u201cemp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage\u201d. Nous serions donc d\u2019accord avec monsieur le juge Greenshields pour dire que l\u2019appelante, en assumant que ce f\u00fbt sa chose qui a caus\u00e9 la mort de Claveau, a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se disculper au sens de l\u2019article 1054 du Code civil.\nMais le d\u00e9bat se r\u00e9tr\u00e9cit encore davantage. Nous ne pouvons admettre que la mort de Claveau a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la chose de l\u2019appelante.\nCette mort, comme nous l\u2019avons vu,\u2014les deux cours qui ont eu jusqu\u2019ici \u00e0 se prononcer se sont accord\u00e9es pour le d\u00e9cider et il est impossible d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une autre conclusion d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve\u2014fut le r\u00e9sultat direct du choc \u00e9lectrique.\nComment s\u2019est produit ce choc \u00e9lectrique?\nVoici l\u2019explication de M. Philippe M\u00e9th\u00e9, ing\u00e9nieur civil, dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9cole polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, au service de la Shawinigan Water & Power Company pendant cinq ans, et, au moment o\u00f9 il rendait son t\u00e9moignage, au service de la compagnie du Pouvoir du Bas St-Laurent, de Rimouski, depuis cinq ans.\nD\u00e8s le soir de l\u2019accident, il s\u2019est rendu sur les lieux et a examin\u00e9 l\u2019installation pr\u00e8s du transformateur. Il a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019un des fils primaires \u00e9tait coup\u00e9. On lui demande:\nQ. D\u2019apr\u00e8s vous, qu\u2019est-ce qui a pu couper ce fil?\nR. C\u2019est un arc qui s\u2019est produit entre le fil et la caisse du transformateur, le support du transformateur, sur lequel le transformateur est boulonn\u00e9.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui pouvait provoquer cet arc-l\u00e0?\nR. Urne d\u00e9charge \u00e9lectrique. Un \u00e9clair pouvait parfaitement provoquer cet arc-l\u00e0, dans les conditions o\u00f9 c\u2019\u00e9tait install\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019a pu constater d\u2019autre cause et n\u2019a vu rien \u201cautre chose qui aurait pu provoquer ce coupement de fil\u201d.\nOn lui pose alors la question:\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s ces constatations-l\u00e0 que vous avez faites, par quoi croyez-vous que Claveau a pu \u00eatre tu\u00e9?\nR. Par un \u00e9clair.\nQ. Par un \u00e9clair. Est-ce que l\u2019\u00e9clair pouvait le tuer directement?\nR. Oui. En frappant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le primaire est coup\u00e9, et passant par le support du transformateur et la caisse du transformateur, et de l\u00e0 se transmettant sur le secondaire et en entrant directement dans l\u2019usine.\nQ. Est-ce que, sans que le courant fasse ce trajet-l\u00e0, il pouvait \u00eatre tu\u00e9 directement par l\u2019\u00e9clair?\nR. L\u2019\u00e9clair pouvait frapper aussi directement sur les secondaires.\nQ. Vous avez entendu les t\u00e9moins d\u00e9crire la lueur, le feu caus\u00e9, et \u00e0 la switch d\u2019entr\u00e9e, et \u00e0 la lampe, vis-\u00e0-vis de la lampe que tenait Claveau dans ses mains, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est fait tuer?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Voulez-vous dire si cette lueur-l\u00e0, d\u2019apr\u00e8s votre exp\u00e9rience, pouvait \u00eatre caus\u00e9e par le courant de 110 volts?\nR. Non. Q. Cette lueur semblait-elle d\u00e9noter du 2200, ou plut\u00f4t un \u00e9clair, un courant produit par le tonnerre?\nR. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t un coup de tonnerre.\nQ. Normalement, le 2200 ferait-il une d\u00e9monstration de flamme aussi consid\u00e9rable?\nR. Je ne crois pas.\nQ. Dites-vous, monsieur M\u00e9th\u00e9, que la mort pouvait \u00eatre caus\u00e9e par un coup de tonnerre, ou si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement caus\u00e9e par un coup de tonnerre?\nR. Je dis que c\u2019est mon opinion qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par un coup de tonnerre.\nMonsieur N. S. Walsh, examinateur \u00e9lectricien \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du gouvernement provincial, t\u00e9moigne comme suit:\nQ. Vous avez entendu les t\u00e9moins qui ont d\u00e9crit la flamme, le rideau de flamme \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e de l\u2019usine et \u00e9galement dans la figure de Claveau lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. D\u2019apr\u00e8s votre exp\u00e9rience, cette flamme-l\u00e0 pouvait-elle d\u00e9noter un courant de 110 volts?\nR. Non, pas du tout.\nQ. 2,200 volts?\nR. \u00c7a prendrait au moins 2,200 volts.\nQ. Est-ce que l\u2019\u00e9clair pouvait faire le m\u00eame travail?\nR. Non. L\u2019\u00e9clair ne ferait pas le m\u00eame travail que \u00e7a.\nQ. L\u2019\u00e9clair ne ferait pas le m\u00eame travail?\nR. Il me semble pas toujours.\nQ. Maintenant, vous avez entendu et vu la description qu\u2019on a faite du fil qui raccordait du primaire, qui raccordait au poteau, de l\u2019isolateur sur le poteau au transformateur. Il y avait une quinzaine de pouces de distance. Est-ce qu\u2019un fil de cette longueur-l\u00e0 peut se couper sans raison?\nR. Bien, dans ce bout-l\u00e0, je ne pense pas. \u00c7a doit \u00eatre fait par quelque chose \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, comme un \u00e9clair comme \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9.\nQ. Est-ce que \u00e7a pourrait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par d\u2019autres causes que le coupage du fil?\nR. Bien, je ne pense pas que \u00e7a pourrait \u00eatre fait par autre chose qu\u2019un \u00e9clair.\nA la demande de la cour, il r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019il attribue\nau choc ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u00e9clair le fait que le 2,200 volts qu\u2019il y avait dans les primaires serait pass\u00e9 dans les secondaires et serait entr\u00e9 dans l\u2019usine.\nM\u00e9th\u00e9 et Walsh sont les deux seuls hommes de l\u2019art qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s dans la cause \u00e0 fournir une explication scientifique de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Il r\u00e9sulterait de leurs t\u00e9moignages que l\u2019accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t provoqu\u00e9 par r\u00e9clair. Mais la seule autre conclusion que l\u2019on puisse en tirer est que l\u2019\u00e9clair, en rompant le fil primaire, a fait \u00e9chapper le courant de 2200 volts qui a d\u2019abord \u201cpass\u00e9 sur les \u2018braces\u2019 du transformateur\u201d et de l\u00e0 \u201cs\u2019est connect\u00e9 avec les secondaires\u201d, puis \u201cest venu dans l\u2019usine m\u00eame\u201d. Sous l\u2019article 1054 C.C., c\u2019est sur le demandeur que retombe indubitablement le fardeau de prouver que le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par une chose que le d\u00e9fendeur avait sous sa garde. Si l\u2019enqu\u00eate nous laisse dans l\u2019incertitude \u00e0 ce sujet, le d\u00e9fendeur doit en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, si nous admettons l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que l\u2019accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9clair, il est \u00e9vident que, dans ce cas, nous devons dire qu\u2019il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte pour l\u2019appelante aucune responsabilit\u00e9. Si nous acceptons, au contraire, l\u2019explication la plus favorable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir: que la mort de Claveau aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par le courant de 2200 volts \u00e9chapp\u00e9 du fil primaire, l\u2019appelante est encore soustraite \u00e0 toute responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. parce que la cause du dommage ne peut d\u00e8s lors \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 une chose qu\u2019elle avait sous sa garde.\nPersonne ne pr\u00e9tend que la lampe seule, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dont elle s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e charg\u00e9e, a caus\u00e9 la mort de Claveau. Tous les faits positifs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9s s\u2019accordent directement avec l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019une mort par \u00e9lectrocution. La lampe par elle-m\u00eame n\u2019a rien fait et n\u2019aurait pu rien faire. D\u00e9fectueuse ou non, sans l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle elle a servi de v\u00e9hicule, cette lampe \u00e9tait inoffensive. La d\u00e9claration qui sert de base \u00e0 l\u2019action, les constatations faites lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, l\u2019avis donn\u00e9 par les experts sont d\u2019accord pour \u00e9tablir que cette mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par le \u201ccourant \u00e9lectrique\u201d. Il s\u2019agit donc de d\u00e9terminer, \u00e0 l\u2019aide, bien entendu, des donn\u00e9es qui se trouvent au dossier, la personne qui avait ce courant sous sa garde au moment de l\u2019accident.\nQuelles que puissent \u00eatre les discussions de la science au sujet des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes \u00e9lectriques, nous n\u2019avons pas ici \u00e0 en rechercher l\u2019explication m\u00e9canique, ni \u00e0 nous inqui\u00e9ter de leur nature physique. Aux yeux de la loi, et dans les conditions de la vie moderne, l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est un produit industriel, qui se transporte d\u2019un lieu \u00e0 un autre. Elle a une existence objective ind\u00e9pendante des corps ou fils m\u00e9talliques employ\u00e9s pour la transmettre \u00e0 distance, puisque son producteur peut \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 y provoquer ou en soustraire ce qu\u2019on est convenu d\u2019appeler la circulation du courant; puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ailleurs que le producteur soit en m\u00eame temps le propri\u00e9taire des fils et qu\u2019il pourra tout aussi bien fournir son \u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique au moyen d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de distribution appartenant \u00e0 un autre, ou allumer une lampe chez son abonn\u00e9 en se servant de fils et d\u2019appareils qui sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier.\nUne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9clairage est propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique produite par ses machines g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019elle l\u2019est du gaz qui circule dans ses conduites et tout autant que la compagnie d\u2019aqueduc a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019eau qui est dans ses tuyaux. Chacune de ces choses, du moment qu\u2019elle est capt\u00e9e et rendue utilisable, devient une marchandise que la compagnie exploite commercialement et qu\u2019elle fournit, en lui mesurant le courant au moyen d\u2019un compteur, au consommateur qui en prend livraison. Les fils, les conduites, les tuyaux ne sont que les moyens de livraison. Ils sont susceptibles de possession et de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 distinctes. Leur propri\u00e9taire n\u2019a pas n\u00e9cessairement sous sa garde l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, le gaz ou l\u2019eau qu\u2019ils contiennent.\nNous trouvons dans le dossier de cette cause tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments des donn\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9rales que nous venons d\u2019\u00e9noncer. Nous savons que la Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas Saint-Laurent produisait l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique pour fournir l\u2019\u00e9clairage, entre autres \u00e0 l\u2019usine de la d\u00e9fenderesse. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dont il s\u2019agit faisait donc l\u2019objet d\u2019un contrat de fourniture. Le contrat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier, mais il est constant que, dans le but de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter, la Compagnie de Pouvoir transportait son produit \u00e0 un voltage de 2,200 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un transformateur pos\u00e9 \u00e0 50 pieds de l\u2019usine. A cet endroit, elle livrait \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse un courant de 110 volts, dont cette derni\u00e8re prenait possession au moyen de ses propres fils,\u2014que nous avons d\u00e9sign\u00e9s plus haut sous le nom de fils secondaires. Ces fils et ce courant de 110 volts sont tout ce dont la d\u00e9fenderesse pouvait avoir le contr\u00f4le et la garde. Ce courant de 110 volts est le seul pour lequel la d\u00e9fenderesse avait pass\u00e9 contrat avec la compagnie d\u2019\u00e9clairage, le seul qu\u2019elle pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 recevoir dans son usine. Mais la preuve est indiscutable qu\u2019il n\u2019a exist\u00e9 aucun lien causal entre ce courant de 110 volts et la mort de Claveau. Comme nous l\u2019avons constat\u00e9 plus haut, la conclusion la plus probable est que cette mort fut provoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9clair qui a rompu le fil primaire. La seule autre hypoth\u00e8se est qu\u2019elle fut caus\u00e9e par le courant de 2,200 volts \u00e9chapp\u00e9 du fil primaire. Dans l\u2019un comme dans l\u2019autre cas, la cause du dommage ne peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 une chose que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait sous sa garde.\nDans les circonstances, le fil secondaire et la lampe n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 que la voie accidentelle par laquelle le courant s\u2019est \u00e9chapp\u00e9. Il aurait pu suivre tout autre conducteur m\u00e9tallique, comme, par exemple, le fil d\u2019un paratonnerre. Va-ton dire que, dans ce cas, il se f\u00fbt identifi\u00e9 avec le paratonnerre au point de devenir l\u00e9galement la chose du propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019usine? C\u2019est par hasard que, d\u00e9clanch\u00e9 dans les conditions impr\u00e9vues que l\u2019on sait, il a suivi d\u2019abord les fils secondaires puis le treillis de la lampe. La \u201cchose\u201d meurtri\u00e8re, si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019\u00e9clair, fut ce courant de 2,200 volts et non la lampe ou son treillis protecteur.\nOr, ce courant de 2,200 volts \u00e9tait sous la garde de la Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas Saint-Laurent. Ce n\u2019est pas ici le proc\u00e8s de cette compagnie; il se peut que, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire, elle e\u00fbt d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019e\u00fbt \u201cpu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage\u201d. Mais c\u2019est elle qui avait le devoir de garder ce courant de 2,200 volts et d\u2019emp\u00eacher qu\u2019il ne d\u00e9pass\u00e2t la barri\u00e8re du transformateur. Cette barri\u00e8re ou ce transformateur \u00e9taient \u00e9galement sous sa garde. \u201cSi\u201d, comme le dit Demogue (Trait\u00e9 des Obligations, vol. 5, n\u00b0 1128), \u201cil y a devoir de garder, la responsabilit\u00e9 subsiste si on cesse de garder\u201d. Il ajoute (n\u00b0 1129):\nPour les installations \u00e9lectriques, la compagnie d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 r\u00e9pond de la chute des poteaux ou des fils le long de ses lignes. Elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme en ayant la garde (Toulouse, 9 f\u00e9v. 1910, S. 1910, 2, 275\u2014Bordeaux, 17 juin 1907. Droit, 23 nov. 1907\u2014Lyon, 25 avril 1899, Gaz. Pal., 1899, 2, 149\u2014Trib. Vire, 22 juin 1922. Gaz. Pal. 1922, 2, 395), car elle en avait la surveillance et le profit. De m\u00eame, si les c\u00e2bles passant \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d\u2019un toit provoquent un incendie, sa responsabilit\u00e9 est engag\u00e9e, bien que, pour surveiller les fils au-dessus du toit de l\u2019abonn\u00e9 et son branchement sp\u00e9cial, elle ait d\u00fb stipuler le droit de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer chez lui. Cette circonstance ne fait pas dispara\u00eetre son pouvoir de garde (Toulouse, 11 juin 1912, D. 1914, 2, 174. Rappr. trib. Tours, 9 d\u00e9c. 1920, Gaz. Trib. 1921, 2, 454). La compagnie a m\u00eame la garde de cette force sp\u00e9ciale, l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui circule dans ses c\u00e2bles, comme dans le cas ci-dessus, ou dans le cas o\u00f9 un courant trop fort va tuer l\u2019abonn\u00e9 dans sa maison (Grenoble, 6 nov. 1906, D. 1909, 2, 20, Paris, 15 mars 1919, Gaz. Trib. 1919, 2, 122. Rev. dr. civil, 1919, p. 504. Rappr. Trib. corn. Marseilles, 11 mai 1920. Gaz. Pal. 1920, 2, 436).\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, dans un article publi\u00e9 dans la Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil (ann\u00e9e 1919, p. 499, \u00e0 la page 504), le m\u00eame auteur avait \u00e9crit:\nPour les compagnies \u00e9lectriques, on admet qu\u2019elles ont la garde des appareils et du courant, et cela non seulement chez elle ou sur la voie publique o\u00f9 passent les fils (Toulouse, 9 f\u00e9vr. 1910, S. 1910, 2, 275 et 13 juin 1914, D. 1914, 2, 174), mais m\u00eame chez les abonn\u00e9s. Cette derni\u00e8re solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e soit si celui-ci est tu\u00e9 chez lui par l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un courant trop fort (Grenoble, 6 nov. 1906, D. 1909, 2, 30, Revue. 1907, p. 100), soit s\u2019il est \u00e9lectrocut\u00e9 en s\u2019approchant \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un arr\u00eat d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 d\u2019un transformateur \u00e9lectrique que la compagnie devait fournir, poser et entretenir (Paris, 15 mars 1919, Gaz. Trib. 1919, 2, 123). La notion de garde est donc tr\u00e8s large.\nCette id\u00e9e que la compagnie d\u2019\u00e9clairage est responsable de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui s\u2019\u00e9chappe est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence. Il y a analogie sur ce point avec la situation du gardien d\u2019un barrage d\u2019eau qui se brise et cause un dommage mat\u00e9riel \u00e0 autrui (Voir la cause de The National Telephone Company v. Baker[14], et aussi ce que dit notre coll\u00e8gue, Monsieur le Juge Duff, dans la cause de Vandry v. The Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Company[15]. Il est int\u00e9ressant, \u00e0 ce sujet, de lire le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 (compos\u00e9 de Lord Macnaghten, Lord Shand, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson et Lord Lindley) dans la cause de Eastern & South African Telephone Company v. Cape Town Tramways Limited[16]. Notre intention, en y r\u00e9f\u00e9rant, n\u2019est pas d\u2019en faire l\u2019une des bases de notre jugement, car il est toujours dangereux de chercher un appui dans des arr\u00eats prononc\u00e9s sous l\u2019empire de lois diff\u00e9rentes; mais l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour nous r\u00e9side dans la fa\u00e7on dont Lord Robertson, parlant au nom de la cour, traite cette question\n\u201cof the escaped current\u201d et y r\u00e9f\u00e8re constamment comme\n\u201cthis electricity having escaped and being at large\u201d * * * \u201cthe mode of escape of the electricity.\u201d * * * \u201cElectricity (in the quantity which we are now dealing with) is capable when uncontrolled of producing injury to life and to property; and in the present instance it was artificially generated in such quantity, and it escaped from the respondents\u2019 premises and control.\nUne partie du jug\u00e9 en cette cause fut:\nThe principle of Rylands v. Fletcher[17] is not inconsistent with the Roman law. It applies to a proprietor who stores electricity on his land if it escapes therefrom and injures a person or (interferes with) the ordinary use of property.\nIl convient d\u2019insister cependant sur deux arr\u00eats qui ont fait l\u2019application de la loi telle qu\u2019elle est contenue dans l\u2019article 1054 du Code civil de Qu\u00e9bec. L\u2019un est de la cour d\u2019appel de Grenoble, France, et l\u2019autre est le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Quebec R. L. H. and P. Co. v. Vandry[18].\nLa cause de Grenoble est celle de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des forces motrices du Haut Gr\u00e9sivaudan v. Veuve Richard[19]. Le sieur Richard avait \u00e9t\u00e9 foudroy\u00e9 par un choc \u00e9lectrique au moment o\u00f9 il appr\u00e9hendait, dans sa cuisine, pour en constater l\u2019\u00e9tat, une lampe \u00e9lectrique mobile qui ne donnait qu\u2019une faible clart\u00e9. Sa veuve, agissant tant en son nom personnel que comme tutrice l\u00e9gale de ses quatre enfants, avait poursuivi la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui fournissait et distribuait l\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique dans la maison de la victime.\nL\u00e0, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, les constatations faites \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s par les m\u00e9decins qui avaient examin\u00e9 le cadavre de Richard et par les experts entendus \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tablissaient irr\u00e9futablement que la victime avait \u00e9t\u00e9 foudroy\u00e9e (nous citons le jugement)\npar un courant d\u2019une tension excessive, sup\u00e9rieur de plusieurs milliers de volts \u00e0 celui que le transformateur, qui re\u00e7oit le courant primaire, doit distribuer aux abonn\u00e9s, et qu\u2019ainsi cet accident est le r\u00e9sultat direct de l\u2019installation \u00e9lectrique de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et du fonctionnement de son transformateur.\nLa cour, en Tendant jugement, rappelle d\u2019abord le principle de l\u2019article 1384 C.N., d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel on est responsable non-seulement du dommage que l\u2019on cause par sa propre faute, mais encore de celui qui est caus\u00e9 par le fait des choses que l\u2019on a sous sa garde. Elle proc\u00e8de ensuite \u00e0 dire:\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des forces motrices a la garde de l\u2019installation qui est son \u0153uvre, \u00e0 l\u2019aide de laquelle elle distribue de la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique, et il est constant que l\u2019accident mortel survenu \u00e0 Richard, dans son habitation, au moment o\u00f9 il saisissait de la main gauche une lampe mobile a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la chose m\u00eame de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, puisque Richard a \u00e9t\u00e9 foudroy\u00e9 par le courant qui circulait sur la ligne ext\u00e9rieure et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis presque int\u00e9gralement au fil qui desservait son installation int\u00e9rieure.\nApr\u00e8s avoir insist\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on sur le fait que la \u201cchose\u201d qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage fut\nle courant qui circulait sur la ligne ext\u00e9rieure et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis presque int\u00e9gralement au fil qui desservait son installation int\u00e9rieure,\nla cour rend bien claire son id\u00e9e que ce courant doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 comme une \u201cchose\u201d distincte de l\u2019installation \u00e9lectrique, des fils conducteurs et de la lampe mobile, car elle ajoute:\nIl est ainsi sans int\u00e9r\u00eat de rechercher si Richard avait la charge de l\u2019entretien et de la r\u00e9paration de son installation int\u00e9rieure qu\u2019il avait pay\u00e9e, au dire de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il suffit de consid\u00e9rer, pour la solution du litige, que sa mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l\u2019afflux sur le fil qui transporte la force \u00e9lectrique d\u2019un courant extr\u00eamement fort qui est arriv\u00e9 presque int\u00e9gralement sur le fil de Richard alors qu\u2019il ne devait normalement lui \u00eatre transmis par le transformateur que tr\u00e8s diminu\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de courant secondaire.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de la question de faute personnelle de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des forces motrices ou de la faute des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au fonctionnement du transformateur ou \u00e0 la distribution du courant, la conclusion de la cour de Grenoble fut que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait responsable envers la veuve Richard, \u00e0 raison du fait que le courant \u00e9lectrique \u00e9tait sous sa garde. Pour employer les termes du jugement, la cour a tenu\nladite Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 responsable envers la veuve Richard \u00e8s qualit\u00e9, du fait dommageable de la chose dont elle a la garde, et de la mort du sieur Richard, etc.\nMais la cause de Qu\u00e9bec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Company v. Vandry[20] m\u00e9rite ici une attention sp\u00e9ciale. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 aussi \u201cof the escape of the electric current\u201d. Nous empruntons des Law Reports ce court r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits:\nThe appellant company, acting under statutory powers, had erected along a road in Quebec two overhead cables for the distribution of electric current at tensions of 2,200 volts and 108 volts respectively, and they supplied current at 108 volts to the respendents\u2019 premises. A violent wind (not amounting to force majeure) tore a branch from a tree growing about 28 feet away from the cables, and drove it against them. In consequence the cables were broken down, and the high tension current found its way along the low tension cable into the respondents\u2019 premises, and caused a fire. The respondents brought an action for damages against the appellants:\u2014\nComme on s\u2019en souvient, la compagnie Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e responsable par le Conseil Priv\u00e9. Et l\u2019on voit la similitude des faits entre cette cause et le cas qui nous occupe. L\u00e0, le fil primaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rompu par une branche d\u2019arbre transport\u00e9e par un vent violent. Ici, le fil primaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 rompu par un \u00e9clair. Dans les deux cas, comme cons\u00e9quence de cet accident, le courant de 2200 volts s\u2019est communiqu\u00e9 du fil primaire au fil secondaire. A la maison Vandry, le courant \u00e9lectrique \u00e9tait fourni \u00e0 108 volts; \u00e0 l\u2019usine de la compagnie Canada & Gulf Terminal Railway, il \u00e9tait fourni \u00e0 110 volts. Chose digne de remarque, dans la cause de Vandry comme dans la pr\u00e9sente, on avait trouv\u00e9 that the electric wiring in the premises in question, though old-fashioned, was not defective and was capable of carrying a current of 108 volts\n(ici de 110 volts). Et ce n\u2019est pas parce qu\u2019elle fut trouv\u00e9e coupable de faute ou de quasi-d\u00e9lit que la compagnie Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power fut condamn\u00e9e. La base du jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 fut le principe de la garde de la chose. Le point sur lequel nous devons insister dans cette d\u00e9cision et dans celle de la cour d\u2019appel de Grenoble est le suivant: Ces tribunaux ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le courant \u00e9lectrique excessif, sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui que le transformateur devait distribuer aux abonn\u00e9s, \u00e9tait la chose qui avait caus\u00e9 le dommage; et bien qu\u2019il f\u00fbt, dans le premier cas, dans la lampe mobile qui appartenait \u00e0 Richard, et, dans le second cas, dans l\u2019installation int\u00e9rieure de la maison de Vandry, nonobstant cela, ce courant \u00e9lectrique continuait aux yeux de la loi, d\u2019\u00eatre sous la garde de la compagnie d\u2019\u00e9clairage.\nIl suffit d\u2019ajouter que si, dans chacun de ces deux cas, le tribunal de Grenoble et le Conseil Priv\u00e9 avaient envisag\u00e9 le courant \u00e9lectrique comme faisant partie de l\u2019installation int\u00e9rieure ou de la lampe mobile, le r\u00e9sultat e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent. Comme la lampe mobile \u00e9tait sous la garde de Richard, et comme l\u2019installation int\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait sous la garde de Vandry, par application du principe de la garde de la chose, le r\u00e9sultat in\u00e9luctable e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 que la veuve Richard ou Vandry eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9s de leur action.\nNous devons donc ici appliquer de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. en concluant que la chose qui a caus\u00e9 la mort de Claveau (\u00e0 savoir le courant \u00e9lectrique de 2,200 volts) \u00e9tait sous la garde de la Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas Saint-Laurent, et non pas sous la garde de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Comme cons\u00e9quence, suivant nous, l\u2019action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e contre cette derni\u00e8re devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu et le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance r\u00e9tabli, avec d\u00e9pens tant devant cette cour que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, si la compagnie appelante juge \u00e0 propos de les r\u00e9clamer des intim\u00e9s.\nLamont J.

The optionee required that F. furnish an accountant\u2019s statement showing the company\u2019s assets and liabilities and profit and loss to August 31, 1926, and an affidavit that the company\u2019s liabilities would not exceed the amount shown by such statement. A statement and affidavit were furnished, and the acceptance of the option was expressed to be based on said statement. Preference shares had been issued by the company, non-participating and non-assessable, entitling the holders thereof to a first, fixed, cumulative dividend of 8 per cent. per annum.\nHeld, that cumulative dividends on preference shares, to August 31, 1926, undeclared and unpaid, constituted a liability of the company within the meaning of the contract, and should have been included as such in the said statement; and that, therefore, upon a certain stated issue, the decision of which, on its proper construction, was held to depend on the determination of said question of law, the said liability should be borne by F.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (61 Ont. L.R. 305, reversing judgment of Grant J., ibid) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, reversing the judgment of Grant J.1, held that a certain issue, directed to be tried between the parties, should be determined in favour of the plantiff. The issue arose out of a dispute as to whether or not cumulative dividends on preference shares in a company, which had not been declared (and, therefore, had not been paid) should be taken into account in the adjustments in the carrying out of a certain contract for the sale, by the defendant to a purchaser represented in these proceedings by the plaintiff, of certain common shares in the company. The material facts of the case, and the issue to be determined, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nW.P. Harvie for the appellant.\nBernard Furlong for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Second Appellate Division of Ontario[2] setting aside (Latchford, C.J., and Masten, J.A., dissenting) the judgment of Mr. Justice Grant2 on an issue which Mr. Justice Logie had directed to be tried between the parties.\nThe facts giving rise to the controversy are not in dispute and may be briefly stated.\nBy a writing dated the 28th of August, 1926, the appellant gave White Star Refining Company (represented in these proceedings by the respondent) an option to purchase 1,352 shares of the common stock of Western Motor Corporation, Limited, the purpose of the optionee being, if it purchased, to secure the control of that corporation. White Star Company, on the 7th of September, 1926, accepted this option upon the following conditions (agreed to by the appellant): viz. that the appellant would furnish that company \u201ccertified public accountant\u2019s statement showing the assets and liabilities and profit and loss of Western Motor Corporation, Ltd., to and including August 31st, 1926,\u201d and that the appellant would \u201cattach to certified public accountant\u2019s statement of assets and liabilities as above affidavit sworn to by yourself before a notary public to the effect that the liabilities of the company will not exceed the amount shown by said accountant\u2019s statement.\u201d There were further conditions which it will suffice to mention summarily, such as the right of the optionee to examine the confidential records of the corporation, and its right to withdraw if after investigation it was deemed imprudent or unwise to proceed further. In pursuance of the condition above quoted, the appellant furnished White Star Refining Company the report and balance sheet prepared by Riddell, Stead, Graham and Hutchison, chartered accountants. This balance sheet shows certain liabilities of the Motor Corporation, and there is no criticism of this statement of liabilities as far as it goes. The point is that what is alleged to constitute a liability within the meaning of the contract was not disclosed.\nThe appellant also furnished the White Star Company his affidavit in which he said:\nThat I have examined Auditors\u2019 Report and financial statements prepared by Riddell, Stead, Graham and Hutchison, Certified Accountants of Windsor, Ontario, attached, and that said statement correctly sets forth assets and liabilities of Western Motor Corporation Limited as of August 31, 1926. And I do further make oath and state that Western Motor Corporation Limited has no liabilities other than those shown in said Auditors\u2019 statement attached.\nThe Motor Corporation had a share capital of $100,000, divided into 10,000 shares of $10 each, of which 7,500 shares were to be preference shares, non-participating and non\u2011assessable, entitling the holders thereof to a first, fixed, cumulative dividend of 8 p.c. per annum. The financial statement of Riddell & Co. shows that 2,981 preference shares, representing $29,810, fully paid, had been issued. It also states that the sum of $1,028.56 had been paid for dividends, which admittedly refers to dividends on preference shares. The White Star Company subsequently obtained a financial statement from its own auditors to which a note was appended stating that \u201cat October 6, 1926, cumulative preferred stock dividends amounting to $2,518.33 for the period from June 30, 1925, to September 30, 1926, had not been declared.\u201d It is therefore clear that the $1,028.56 paid for dividends on preference shares were for dividends declared for some period anterior to June 30th, 1925.\nWhat ensued between the parties after the receipt of the financial statement and affidavit may be briefly stated.\nOn October 6th, 1926, the White Star Company wrote to the appellant stating that it accepted the option and that its acceptance was based upon the statement of assets and liabilities as set forth in the statement of Riddell & Co. which he had furnished the Company. When the time for settlement arrived (all other conditions for placing the White Star Company in control and having its nominees elected as directors of the Motor Corporation having been fulfilled), a difficulty was encountered with regard to the undeclared and unpaid dividends on preference shares mentioned in the audit of the White Star Company\u2019s auditor. The appellant at the trial frankly admitted that the dispute arose as a result of the fact that Riddell and Co. did not show cumulative dividends outstanding against the preferred stock, while the White Star Company\u2019s auditors showed these dividends as being charges against the Motor Corporation. The amount in dispute was $3,158.12 (it does not appear how it was made up), and the appellant admits that the money was paid into the Canadian Bank of Commerce in a trust account, with a letter stating that it was to be paid out on the determination of this question.\nAn application was then made to the court for judgment to declare and determine to whom the $3,158.12 paid into the bank should be paid. On this application, Mr. Justice Logie directed that an issue should be tried between the applicant, Butler, plaintiff, and Fairhall, defendant, this issue to be as follows:\nThe plaintiff affirms and the defendant denies: That the cumulative dividends on the outstanding preferred stock of the Western Motor Corporation, Limited, from January 1, 1925, to August 31, 1926, undeclared and unpaid as of August 31, 1926, constitute a liability under the contract that is not disclosed in Riddell, Stead, Graham & Hutchison\u2019s report of the said company as of that date, and that this liability, in pursuance of the contract, is to be borne by the Respondent Fairhall.\nIt is clear that anything outside this issue is irrelevant, and therefore the appellant cannot be heard to contend, as he did in the courts below as well as on this appeal, that he had given notice to the officers of the White Star Company, before they finally accepted the option on October 6th, 1926, that these preference dividends had not been declared and that the acceptance was made with full knowledge of this fact. The only question with which we are concerned is that stated in the issue on which the parties proceeded to trial.\nThe learned trial judge[3] considered that the undeclared dividends were not a liability of the Motor Corpora- tion and therefore did not require to be disclosed in the auditors\u2019 report furnished by the appellant. He also relied on the fact that the White Star Company had accepted the option with full knowledge that these dividends had not been declared.\nThis judgment was reversed by the Second Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario, Latchford, C.J. and Masten, J.A. dissenting3.\nThe majority of the learned judges were of the opinion that within the meaning of the option and its acceptance the undeclared dividends on preference shares were a liability of the Motor Corporation which the appellant should have disclosed in the report furnished by his auditors, and consequently that the issue should be determined in favour of the respondent.\nThe dissenting judges agreed with the trial judge that the undeclared dividends were not such a liability. But they also took another ground, fully explained by Mr. Justice Masten, and which, with all deference, appears to me to be based on a misconstruction of the issue. This ground, Mr. Justice Masten observes, was not presented by counsel for the respondent (the appellant here), and is that \u201cthe issue is as to whether the dividends in question \u2018constitute a liability under the contract\u2019\u201d (the italics are those of the learned judge). Mr. Justice Masten says that the real issue \u201cis the liability of the plaintiff (Butler; possibly the learned judge meant the defendant Fairhall), not the liabilities of the Company (the Motor Corporation)\u201d. He adds:\u2014\nThe form of the issue might at first sight suggest that the question is, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the term \u2018liability\u2019?\u201d But the real question is, does the contract by its terms entitle the purchaser to a reduction of $3,158.12 in the price which it had agreed to pay for the defendant\u2019s shares? I find no such term or condition anywhere in the agreement.\nThe conclusion of the learned judge on this question is that:\nif the plaintiff has any claim it is not a claim in pursuance of the contract, but must be founded in tort on false and fraudulent misrepresentations anterior to the contract.\nWith respect, the issue states a proposition of law which the plaintiff (the respondent) affirms and the defendant (the appellant) denies. This proposition is that the un- declared dividends constitute a liability under the contract (i.e. the option and its acceptance under conditions agreed to by the appellant) not disclosed in the report of Riddell & Co. on the Motor Corporation, and that this liability, in pursuance of the contract, is to be borne by the appellant Fairhall.\nI think it is unquestionable, as shewn by the admissions of Fairhall at the trial above referred to, that the intention of the parties was that if the court came to the conclusion that these undeclared dividends were a liability within the meaning of the contract, which should have been disclosed in the financial statement, this liability should be borne by Fairhall, and that, if the court so decided, the sum of $3,158.12 paid into the bank to await the decision on the issue should go to the respondent.\nThis being the only point in the case, my opinion is that within the meaning of the contract, as understood by the parties, the undeclared dividends on preference shares were a liability which should have been diclosed in the report of the appellant\u2019s auditors.\nIt is nihil ad rem that until a dividend is declared no action on behalf of a shareholder lies to enforce its payment, and from that point of view it can no doubt be said that a company incurs no liability until a dividend is declared by it. But it was not in that sense that the White Star Company employed the word \u201cliabilities\u201d in its letter of October 7th. The purchase was of a block of common shares giving the control of the company to the purchaser. It was an essential condition of the respondent\u2019s acceptance that the assets and liabilities of the company should be truly shewn in the financial statement of a certified public accountant which the vendor undertook to furnish the purchaser. And for the additional protection of the latter, and so that it could determine whether it was imprudent or unwise to proceed further, the appellant was required to make an affidavit \u201cto the effect that the liabilities of the company will not exceed the amount shown by said accountant\u2019s statement.\u201d For a purchaser of common stock of the Motor Corporation, undeclared but overdue dividends on its preference shares were certainly a liability of the company, in the sense that he could obtain no dividend on his common shares before the payment of all accrued dividends on preference shares, whether in fact a dividend had or had not been declared. I would therefore, on this issue, say that these dividends constituted a liability under the contract that was not disclosed by the auditors\u2019 report. It follows that this liability must be borne by the appellant in pursuance of the contract.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.P.

The appellant\u2019s appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench was dismissed, but one judge dissented on the question of law as to whether or not there was error on the part of the trial judge in not having warned the jury as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the girl Couture, an accomplice.\nHeld that the appellant was entitled to have a new trial.\nPer Duff, Mignault, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\u2014Although there is no case in which it has been explicitly laid down that the warning must be given where there is some corroborative evidence to go to the jury, it necessarily follows from the principle laid down in the cases referred to in the judgment now reported, where the evidence of the accomplice is necessary to sustain the conviction and the corroborative evidence may or may not be accepted as sufficient by the jury. In this case, there was in fact no admissible corroborative evidence to be submitted to the jury, and it was the duty of the trial judge to have given the warning. It is not, however, to be taken that the warning would have been unnecessary, had there been some corroborative evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. It is for the jury to say whether or not the corroborative evidence is to be believed, and if it is not believed by the jury, and yet they convict, no warning having been given, they are convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice without having been warned of the danger of doing so. On that ground and also in view of other improper evidence having been introduced at the trial, it cannot be said that the appellant has suffered no substantial wrong.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014The evidence upon which the Crown relied for corroboration of the woman\u2019s testimony did not corroborate in the essential particulars; and there was no warning to the jury, such as required by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the well-known case of Rex vs. Baskerville ([1916] 2 K.B. 658).\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, criminal side, which had found the appellant guilty of manslaughter upon the verdict of a jury.\nThe material facts of the case and its questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. and J. M. Gu\u00e9rard for the appellant.\nValmore Bienvenue for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault, Rinfret and Smith J.J.) was declared by\nSmith J.\u2014The accused was convicted on an indictment for manslaughter by performance of an illegal operation on one Alice Couture, causing a miscarriage that resulted in her death on 29th June, 1927. The trial took place on the 3rd day of November, 1927, and the accused was sentenced on the 8th of that month to imprisonment for life. The fact of an illegal operation having been performed causing the miscarriage that resulted in the young woman\u2019s death was clearly established, and the further question remaining for the jury was as to whether or not the evidence established that the accused was the person who performed the illegal operation.\nOn May 16th, 1927, the accused was arrested on a charge, under section 303 of the Criminal Code, of using means to procure an abortion on Alice Couture. On the same day the magistrate, Judge Lachance of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, the clerk of the court and the crown solicitor attended at the hospital to proceed with the preliminary enqu\u00eate by taking the evidence of Alice Couture, then lying there very ill. She testified that the accused had performed the operation in question, giving details of what had happened. The accused, then under arrest, was present at this hearing with his solicitor, who cross-examined the witness on his behalf.\nAlice Couture having died in the meantime, these depositions were read at the trial to the jury as evidence against the accused, after objection taken by his counsel to their admissibility had been over-ruled by the trial judge.\nThe accused appealed from the conviction to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (in appeal), and the appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment of that court, Justice Letourneau, with the permission of the court, writing a dissenting judgment on the question of law raised as to whether or not the learned trial judge had erred in not having warned the jury that it was dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated testimony of Alice Couture, an accomplice.\nBy special leave[1] the accused was allowed to also appeal on the question of whether the depositions of Alice Couture, mentioned above, should have been admitted as evidence against the accused on his trial for manslaughter.\nDealing first with the latter ground, it was argued that, it having been shewn that Alice Couture was at the time dangerously ill and, in the opinion of Dr. Marois, not likely to recover, the method of taking her evidence under these circumstances is by commission, as expressly laid down by sections 995 and 996 of the Criminal Code, and that it could not be taken otherwise. If this argument were sound, the strong ground of objection would seem to me to be that there was no commission, but what was specially urged was that accused was not served with a written notice of the intended taking of evidence as had been held by English courts to be necessary under the corresponding sections of the English Act, citing Reg. v. Shurmer[2]; Rex v. Harris[3]; Rex v. Quigley[4]. As there was no written notice in this case, it is urged that there is conflict on a question of law between the judgment of the court below and the judgments in the English cases cited.\nThe Criminal Code, by section 999, expressly provides for reading the depositions of a witness taken at a preliminary investigation against the accused at his trial for the same cause where the witness has died in the meantime, and section 1000 provides that these depositions may also be read under the same circumstances on his trial on any other charge. The depositions in question were read as evidence under these sections and not as having been taken under sections 995 and 996, which have clearly no application. The appeal, therefore, on this ground must be dismissed. We are not, however, passing on the question of whether or not this is an appealable matter, even with leave.\nProceeding, then, to the other ground of appeal, involving the question of law as to whether or not there was error on the part of the learned trial judge in not having warned the jury as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of Alice Couture, an accomplice, it is urged on behalf of the Crown that there was in fact corroborative evidence, and that therefore such warning was not necessary.\nThe practice to be followed by a trial judge in reference to the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice was carefully considered and authoritatively laid down in the case of Rex v. Baskerville[5].\nIn the subsequent case of Rex v. Beebe[6], Lord Hewart, C.J., gives in a few words the rule as laid down in the Baskerville case. He says the jury should be told\nthat it is within their legal province to convict; they are to be warned in all such cases that it is dangerous to convict; and they may be advised not to convict.\nHe points out that there is no reference to a case in which it may be the duty of the learned judge to advise the jury in such a case that they ought to convict, and further on states that such a direction would not be according to the law laid down in the Baskerville Case5.\nFollowing what Lord Hewart had thus laid down, this court, in Rex v. Gouin[7], set aside a conviction, although there was corroborative evidence where the learned trial judge had told the jury that if they were quite certain that the girl (an accomplice) was telling the truth, though uncorroborated, they ought to act on it.\nThese cases, however, do not expressly lay down what is necessary where there is some corroborative evidence. It is urged on behalf of the accused that in this case there was in fact no corroborative evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. Alice Couture had stated, in her depositions read to the jury, that the accused had performed on her in the previous year (1926) an illegal operation to procure a miscarriage, which resulted at her sister\u2019s house, and that she took the foetus to the accused. The fact of the miscarriage, and of the placing of the foetus in a box furnished by her \u201ccavalier,\u201d Adrien Letourneau, was testified to by the sister Madame Turgeon. Blanche Pouliot testified to having been shewn the foetus in this box at the house of Madame Turgeon, to having gone for a walk with Alice Couture and to having seen the latter, after they had separated on the street, go into the office of the accused, having with her this box. The question is: Was this evidence of a previous crime committed by accused admissible\nThe leading case on this subject is Makin v. The King. L.R. 1894 A. C., 57. The headnote gives the effect of the decision in the following words:\nEvidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment is not admissible unless upon the issue whether the acts charged against the accused were designed or accidental, or unless to rebut a defence otherwise open to him.\nThis case and many others are reviewed in The King v. Bond,[8], where the charge was using instruments on Ethel Anne Jones on October 25th, 1905. It was not disputed that accused had used instruments, the defence being that they were used for a lawful purpose. Evidence was given by one Gertrude Taylor that the accused had in January, 1905, used similar instruments on her to procure a miscarriage. It was held by five of the judges that the evidence was admissible as proof of intent, Alberstone, C.J., and Ridley, J., dissenting.\nThe subject is again discussed in the House of Lords in Thompson v. The King[9], which deals mainly with the application of the rule laid down in the previous cases to the circumstances of the particular case under consideration. In the present case there was no question of proving the intent of the accused in performing an operation, the sole question being as to whether he was the party who did perform it. All the evidence, therefore, offered to shew that accused had performed an illegal operation on Alice Couture in 1926 was inadmissible, and it need hardly be said that the evidence of J. Juneau, a discharged servant who had been fined for an assault on the accused, of having found the body of an infant behind a door on the accused\u2019s premises about 1918, was also inadmissible.\nThere remains the evidence of Adrien Letourneau, described by Madame Turgeon as the \u201ccavalier\u201d of the deceased Alice Couture. He says he regarded her as a girl of light morals, and that he was in the habit of seeing her two or three times a week. He is the party who went with her to Madame Turgeon\u2019s when she had the miscarriage there in 1926, and he supplied the box spoken of. His evidence, relied on as corroborative, is that in the month of April, some short time before Alice Couture had the miscarriage in question, in 1927, he went with her on two occasions, and parted with her not far from the office of the accused, and saw her, on each occasion after parting from him, enter the accused\u2019s office. The accused testified that he had no recollection of ever having seen Alice Couture, and that if he had seen her, she was one of many who called in the course of a day, and had not impressed herself on his memory. He, of course, denied all her statements about having operated on her. He also testified about having been out of the city during part of the month of April.\nIn the first place, the jury might on the evidence before them have found that Letourneau was an accomplice, and if the evidence was admissible, it should have been left to the jury to determine if he was an accomplice, with a warning as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of two accomplices. Rex v. Malouf[10]. Letourneau\u2019s evidence was offered in chief as proof of the crime, and was not corroborative because it did not tend to implicate the accused in the commission of the crime. If it were true that the girl entered the office of the accused as he stated, the evidence did not establish that she saw him or implicate him in the commission of the crime.\nA Morris chair, such as Alice Couture in her depositions said had been used for the operation, and three instruments such as doctors usually have in their office, with which an abortion might be brought about, but with which, apparently, it would not be possible to cut up the foetus as was done in this case, were found in the office of the accused. This again would not be evidence tending to implicate the accused. It seems clear, therefore, that there was in fact no admissible corroborative evidence to be submitted to the jury, and that it was the undoubted duty of the learned judge to have given the warning. It is not, however, to be taken that the warning would have been unnecessary had there been some corroborative evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. It is for the jury to say whether or not the corroborative evidence is to be believed, and if it is not believed by the jury, and yet they convict, no warning having been given, they are convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice without having been warned of the danger of doing so. As stated, there seems to be no case in which it is explicitly laid down that the warning must be given where there is some corroborative evidence to go to the jury, but I think it necessarily follows from the principle laid down in the cases referred to, where the evidence of the accomplice is necessary to sustain the conviction and the corroborative evidence may or may not be accepted as sufficient by the jury. This seems to be assumed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Feighenbaum[11]. The appellant was convicted of inciting boys to steal, the boys, accomplices, having given evidence against him. The corroborative evidence was that of a police officer as to the conduct of the accused when he interviewed him before proceedings and stated to him the names of the boys and what they had related. Darling J. delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nIn this case the deputy chairman rightly directed the jury as to the danger of believing the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplices, and as to what was, or might be, corroboration; and in our opinion, it would in the circumstances of this case have been wrong for him to say that in his opinion there was no corroboration of the boys\u2019 evidence.\nHere there was corroboration, and it is stated that the jury were rightly warned.\nIn Baker v. The King[12], it seems also to have been assumed that the warning should have been given, although there was the corroboration of uncontroverted facts;\nfacts established by the admissions of the appellants or by independent and unchallenged evidence.\nThe trial judge warned the jury that though they might convict on the evidence of an accomplice, it would be dangerous to do so, and warned them that one of the witnesses, Sowash, must be treated as an accomplice, but failed to give the same warning as to the other witness, Stromkins. One of the grounds of appeal was that the warning was not sufficient, but there was in addition the objection that the learned trial judge did not explain that corroboration means\ncorroboration not only in respect of some fact tending to shew that the crime was committed, but also in respect of some evidence implicating or tending to implicate the accused.\nThese objections were disposed of on the ground that the accused suffered no substantial wrong. The failure to warn as to the evidence of the accomplice Stromkins is commented on, but there is no suggestion that the objection on that ground was untenable because there was corroboration, doing away with the necessity of giving the warning.\nHere the learned trial judge in substance said to the jury: You have the evidence of Alice Couture, categorically relating that the accused performed the illegal operation; you have confirmative evidence of her story; and, on the other hand, you have the evidence of the accused denying that he performed the operation. He has admitted that he was convicted previously for a similar offence, which is a strong circumstance to be taken into consideration in deciding whether you are to believe him or not. It is a question, then, of which story you believe. If you believe the accused, he is not guilty; if you don\u2019t believe him, but believe Alice Couture, he is guilty.\nIn addition to the defects of the charge, there was the improper admission of evidence to which I have referred, and many other irregularities. The accused was put in the box and testified as to his previous conviction and as to a long list of subscriptions that he had since made for charitable and religious objects. Presumably this was intended as evidence of good character, and was clearly inadmissible as such or otherwise. It was made the basis for a cross-examination of the accused on all the details of the previous offence and on his subsequent conduct. A few sample questions will shew the character of this cross-examination:\u2014\nQ. You remember that Miss Vachon said in court in her evidence that you had worked in the same manner as in this case? (Miss Vachon was the girl operated on in the former case.)\nCounsel goes on in this way to repeat a great part of the evidence given in the former trial.\nThe following are further samples:\u2014\nQ. Is it not true that at the time of your condemnation in 1917 you were recognized as a public abortioner?\nQ. Is it not true that you are recognized as such at present by the public?\nIf the evidence of accused referred to had been rejected, as it should have been, the cross-examination as to character would have been limited to what was relevant on the question of his credibility. In any case, the questions referred to should not have been allowed. The latter two were, in effect, a declaration of fact by the Crown prosecutor to the jury. The impropriety of introducing the evidence given by a witness on a previous occasion by stating it to the accused and asking him if he remembers hearing it, is pointed out in Allen v. The King[13].\nIt cannot be said that the accused suffered no substantial wrong. The appeal is therefore allowed, and a new trial ordered.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I agree that there must be a new trial, because, in my view, the evidence upon which the Crown relied for corroboration of the woman\u2019s testimony did not corroborate in the essential particulars; and there was no warning to the jury, such as required by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the well-known case of Rex v. Baskerville[14].\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1928] S.C.R. 161.\n[2] 17 Q.B.D. 323.\n[3] 26 Cox, C.L.C. 143.\n[4] 18 L.T.R., N.S. 211.\n[5] [1916] 2 K.B. 658.\n[6] 19 Cr.

By deed of partition, December 24, 1880, a certain number of lots, among which was lot no. 279, were allotted to L. A. Boyer. It is provided in that deed of partition that lots nos. 328-278, 279 and 308 shall be used in perpetuity as lanes for the benefit of the proprietors of the lots as subdivided. In 1892, February 3, L. A. Boyer sold to P. A. Lariviere some 160 of the lots allotted to him, including lot no. 279 with \u201ctoutes servitudes actives et passives.\u201d On the 12th of April of the same year, P. A. Larivi\u00e8re sold to J. A. Stevenson a certain number of those lots with the use in common of the lane no. 279. In 1904, November 11, the estate Boyer ceded, by error, to the appellant that same lot 279. On the 15th of November, 1913, P. A. Larivi\u00e8re gave in payment to his sister Eulalie Larivi\u00e8re that same lot 279, with another lot bearing no. 352. On the 10th of November, 1914, Eulalie Larivi\u00e8re brought an action against the appellant in which she alleges that she is the owner of lot 279, that the deed of cession of the 11th of November, 1904, by the estate Boyer to the appellant did not confer to the city any title to said lot no. 279 and is illegal and without effect, that the appellant is illegally in possession of said lot which was converted into a public street, and by the conclusions of her declaration, she asked that the sale by L. A. Boyer to P. A. Larivi\u00e8re be declared valid; that she was entitled to the possession of the lot and that the city be ordered to cease to use that lot as a public street. That action was contested by the appellant. During the pendency of the suit, Eulalie Larivi\u00e8re and her successor P. A. Larivi\u00e8re died and the respondents, in their quality of testamentary executors of P. A. Larivi\u00e8re, were authorized to continue the suit. By judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Surveyer on the 6th of February, 1925, the action was maintained in part and dismissed in part, the sale by L. A. Boyer to P. A. Larivi\u00e8re was declared valid, the respondents were declared owners of the lot, reserving to the city all its rights deriving from its charter and specially from section 43 of 3 Geo. V, c. 54. No appeal was taken from that judgment. On the 3rd of February, 1926, the respondents brought the present action whereby they claim the sum of $21,000 as being in their opinion the value of the lot no. 279. By the conclusions of their declaration they give to the appellant the option to proceed by expropriation of the lot instead of paying the said sum of $21,000, said option to be exercised within 30 days from the date of the judgment to be rendered. The appellant contested that action on many grounds and especially on the grounds that there was chose jug\u00e9e between the parties, that the works done on lot 279 were authorized by the law and especially by the statute 3 Geo. V, c. 54, s. 43, and that in any event the lot 279 had no real or commercial value and the amount claimed was excessive.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and Honor\u00e9 Parent K.C. for the appellant.\nOscar P.

Boyer, \u00e0 qui il \u00e9chut en vertu d\u2019un partage des biens d\u00e9pendant de la succession de feu Louis Boyer; et, dans l\u2019acte de partage, il est d\u00e9crit comme une ruelle priv\u00e9e\nservant de passage \u00e0 l\u2019usage et entretien commun des lots qui y touchent, pour communiquer desdits lots \u00e0 la rue Boyer.\nLes intim\u00e9s, pr\u00e9tendant que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al s\u2019\u00e9tait empar\u00e9e de cette ruelle et en avait fait une rue publique, se sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pr\u00eats \u00e0 transporter tous leurs droits et \u00e0 passer titre en faveur de la cit\u00e9 sur le paiement d\u2019une somme de $21,000 \u201cou de toute autre somme juste et raisonnable qui sera adjug\u00e9e\u201d comme repr\u00e9sentant la valeur de cette lisi\u00e8re de terrain, \u00e0 moins que la cit\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u201cproc\u00e9der par voie d\u2019expropriation pour fins d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique, suivant la loi.\u201d\nLa cit\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait content\u00e9e de faire sur ces lots les travaux municipaux autoris\u00e9s par la loi 3 Geo. V, c. 54, art. 43, en vertu de laquelle elle est dispens\u00e9e, en pareil cas, de payer aucun dommage ou aucune indemnit\u00e9 pour l\u2019usage et la possession des ruelles priv\u00e9es.\nElle a invoqu\u00e9, en outre, un jugement, rendu le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1925, dans une cause mue entre les m\u00eames parties, o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s revendiquaient \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taires la possession du lot num\u00e9ro 279 et o\u00f9, tout en reconnaissant leur droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le jugement leur aurait refus\u00e9 la possession \u00e0 rencontre de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Il y aurait donc chose jug\u00e9e, et les intim\u00e9s ne tenteraient que de recommencer un proc\u00e8s qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 contre eux.\nEnfin la cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que, si elle est tenue de payer une indemnit\u00e9, le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 est consid\u00e9rablement exag\u00e9r\u00e9, parce que la valeur de cette ruelle, pour les intim\u00e9s, est pratiquement nulle \u00e0 raison des servitudes conventionnelles et statutaires auxquelles elle est assujettie.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le jugement du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1925 avait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 tout le litige. Elle a trouv\u00e9 bien fond\u00e9 le plaidoyer de chose jug\u00e9e et elle a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s de leur action.\nCe jugement a trouv\u00e9 faveur aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019un des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi; mais la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour exprima, au contraire, l\u2019opinion que, le jugement de 1925 ayant reconnu le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s sur la ruelle, leur r\u00e9clamation actuelle \u00e9tait la cons\u00e9quence logique de ce jugement et devenait la justification m\u00eame de leur action pour paiement de la valeur de la ruelle, au lieu cle constituer une fin de non recevoir.\nQuant au statut 3 Geo. V, l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 fut qu\u2019il ne saurait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 autoriser la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 s\u2019emparer des ruelles priv\u00e9es et \u00e0 confisquer effectivement le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL\u2019action fut donc maintenue pour un montant de $7,000 auquel la valeur du terrain fut fix\u00e9e. Sur cette question d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, Monsieur le juge Dorion enregistra cependant sa dissidence, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il n\u2019accorderait qu\u2019un \u201cmontant nominal d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l\u2019utilit\u00e9 bien probl\u00e9matique que peut avoir ce qui reste de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u201d (aux intim\u00e9s).\nLe litige soul\u00e8ve donc trois questions principales sur lesquelles nous avons \u00e0 nous prononcer.\nLa loi 3 Geo. V, c. 54, art. 43, se lit comme suit:\nLa cit\u00e9 est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 faire dans et sur toutes les rues ou ruelles priv\u00e9es tous travaux municipaux quelconques sans \u00eatre tenue de payer aucun dommage ou indemnit\u00e9 pour l\u2019usage et la possession de telle rue ou ruelle priv\u00e9e, et \u00e0 charger le co\u00fbt de ces travaux suivant les dispositions de la charte ou des r\u00e8glements.\nLa lisi\u00e8re de terrain dont il s\u2019agit s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 est (approximativement) des lots 280 \u00e0 307g de la subdivision du lot num\u00e9ro 328; et, dans l\u2019intention de l\u2019auteur de la subdivision, elle \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 servir de ruelle pour l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de ces lots qui viennent y aboutir \u00e0 angle droit. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al y a construit des \u00e9gouts et un trottoir et elle y a fait les pavages, comme sur toutes les autres rues publiques. En plus, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 cette ruelle, elle a ouvert la rue Mentana; puis elle a trait\u00e9 la ruelle comme faisant partie de cette rue Mentana, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que ruelle et rue forment un seul tout et soient livr\u00e9es indiff\u00e9remment \u00e0 la circulation publique. A toutes fins, la ruelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e \u00e0 la rue; et, lors de l\u2019argument devant cette cour, l\u2019avocat de la cit\u00e9 admit qu\u2019elle en avait fait une rue publique qui figurait au registre des rues et voies publiques et au plan de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nNous n\u2019avons aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 dire que la loi 3 Geo. V n\u2019a pas autoris\u00e9 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 en agir ainsi. Elle pouvait faire tous travaux municipaux dans et sur la ruelle priv\u00e9e des intim\u00e9s; elle pouvait prendre possession de cette ruelle pour y faire ces travaux; elle en avait l\u2019usage pendant le temps requis pour les faire; elle en conservait l\u2019usage et la possession dans le sens que les travaux devaient subsister dans et sur la ruelle sans aucune indemnit\u00e9 au propri\u00e9taire; mais ce dernier conservait sur la ruelle tous ses droits, sujets aux servitudes de passage qu\u2019il avait conc\u00e9d\u00e9es pour l\u2019utilit\u00e9 des lots riverains. Malgr\u00e9 la loi 3 Geo. V, le fonds de la ruelle \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9 seulement \u00e0 cette servitude restreinte. La cit\u00e9 y a superpos\u00e9 une servitude d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique qui constitue, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, une prise de possession compl\u00e8te du terrain. En en faisant une rue publique, elle a d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est certainement aller au del\u00e0 des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l\u2019article 43 de la loi 3 Geo. V, c. 54. Cette loi n\u2019a pas la port\u00e9e que \u2022 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a voulu lui donner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle ne justifie pas la cit\u00e9, qui persiste dans sa confiscation, de refuser aux propri\u00e9taires la juste indemnit\u00e9 qui leur est due en vertu de la loi.\nNous ajouterons que cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par le jugement du 9 avril 1925. Ce jugement a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9fini les droits des intim\u00e9s et de l\u2019appelante sur la ruelle priv\u00e9e dont il s\u2019agit. Les intim\u00e9s avaient alors affirm\u00e9 leur titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un autre titre que leur opposait la cit\u00e9. Ils demandaient que leur titre f\u00fbt reconnu, que celui de la cit\u00e9 f\u00fbt invalid\u00e9, et\nqu\u2019ordre soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al de d\u00e9laisser ledit lot \u00e0 titre de rue publique et d\u2019en donner possession aux intim\u00e9s pour qu\u2019ils puissent y exercer leur droit de propri\u00e9taires. Le jugement reconnut bon et valable le titre des intim\u00e9s et les d\u00e9clara propri\u00e9taires du lot num\u00e9ro 279, mais\nsujet \u00e0 la servitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e en faveur des lots adjacents par l\u2019acte de partage du 24 novembre 1880 et sujet aux droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la (cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al) par sa charte et, en particulier, par la loi 3 Geo. V, c. 54, s. 43, de faire des travaux dans, sur et sous ledit lot.\nIl rejeta les d\u00e9fenses et les autres conclusions de la demande.\nLa cit\u00e9 veut en tirer la cons\u00e9quence que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en refusant dans ce jugement d\u2019ordonner son d\u00e9guer-pissement, l\u2019a ipso facto confirm\u00e9e dans la possession de la ruelle et a reconnu son droit d\u2019utiliser le lot en litige comme une rue publique ouverte \u00e0 la circulation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis, au contraire, que ce jugement a r\u00e9parti entre les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s les droits qu\u2019ils pouvaient, de part et d\u2019autre, exercer sur le lot num\u00e9ro 279. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du fonds fut d\u00e9finitivement attribu\u00e9e aux intim\u00e9s; la servitude restreinte cr\u00e9\u00e9e en faveur des lots riverains fut confirm\u00e9e; et les droits statutaires de la cit\u00e9 furent simplement admis sans toutefois y \u00eatre d\u00e9finis. Mais il ne fut pas jug\u00e9, en fait, que la cit\u00e9 avait transform\u00e9 la ruelle en rue publique. Encore moins fut-il d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en droit, que la cit\u00e9 avait le pouvoir d\u2019op\u00e9rer cette transformation. La cit\u00e9 fut maintenue dans l\u2019usage et la possession qu\u2019elle faisait de la ruelle pour ses \u00e9gouts, son trottoir et son pavage conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi 3 Geo. V. Pour cette raison, la d\u00e9possession fut refus\u00e9e; mais la confirmation du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s repousse absolument l\u2019id\u00e9e que le jugement de 1925 ait voulu reconna\u00eetre la prise de possession municipale compl\u00e8te et absolue, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, qui, de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de ses avocats, existe \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle.\nLes intim\u00e9s, dans leur premi\u00e8re action, n\u2019avaient fait aucune r\u00e9clamation d\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Bien loin de penser que le jugement qui fut rendu en cette premi\u00e8re instance constitue une fin de non recevoir \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de leur demande actuelle, nous sommes d\u2019avis que cette demande est plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat n\u00e9cessaire de ce premier jugement et qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 est la seule ressource qui reste ouverte aux intim\u00e9s.\nMais, d\u2019accord avec la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous croyons que le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 est la difficult\u00e9 la plus s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 envisager dans cette cause. Sur cette question nous n\u2019avons pas l\u2019avantage de l\u2019opinion du juge du proc\u00e8s parce que, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que l\u2019action devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, il ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9 sur la valeur p\u00e9cuniaire des droits des intim\u00e9s dans la ruelle.\nLa preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ne peut gu\u00e8re nous aider. L\u2019un des intim\u00e9s a expliqu\u00e9 que la somme de $21,000 qu\u2019il demandait est bas\u00e9e sur les indemnit\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d\u2019expropriations de certains terrains voisins. Mais l\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019a pas d\u00e9voil\u00e9 les circonstances particuli\u00e8res qui ont pu induire les commissaires ou les arbitres \u00e0 fixer ces indemnit\u00e9s. Dans l\u2019ignorance o\u00f9 la preuve nous laisse \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, nous manquons absolument de points de comparaison; et nous ne pouvons donc nous appuyer sur ces sentences arbitrales. Une indemnit\u00e9, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019expropriation, est principalement une question de fait o\u00f9 chaque cas doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 suivant son aspect individuel. Aucun des juges n\u2019a cru, pour les fins del\u00e0 pr\u00e9sente cause, pouvoir accepter comme base ces sentences rendues en d\u2019autres instances; et, \u00e0 notre tour, nous pensons que cette suggestion des intim\u00e9s doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\nIl reste au dossier le t\u00e9moignage de quatre courtiers d\u2019immeubles, dont deux furent appel\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s et les deux autres par l\u2019appelante.\nL\u2019un d\u2019eux nous a donn\u00e9 \u201cla valeur des terrains vacants dans cette localit\u00e9-l\u00e0\u201d comme variant entre $1.50 et $1.70 du pied, suivant la position des lots. Mais il parle \u201cde la moyenne g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u201d; il admet qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u201cpas parl\u00e9 de lisi\u00e8res de terrain\u201d; qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u201cpas examin\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment (le) num\u00e9ro ici sur le plan\u201d; et qu\u2019il ne lui est jamais \u201carriv\u00e9 de vendre des terrains sur une servitude comme cela\u201d. Il finit par d\u00e9clarer n\u2019\u00eatre \u201cpas en mesure, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, d\u2019\u00e9tablir une valeur * * * pour ce morceau-l\u00e0\u201d.\nUn autre fixe \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au m\u00eame montant la valeur des lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir (building lots) avoisinants; mais, lorsqu\u2019on lui fait remarquer que \u201cthe whole lot is taken by the right of way\u201d, il est forc\u00e9 d\u2019admettre que l\u2019unique valeur du lot num\u00e9ro 279 est que \u201cit is useful for a street\u201d.\nLes deux autres courtiers d\u2019immeubles consid\u00e8rent que cette ruelle priv\u00e9e, en tenant compte des servitudes auxquelles elle est subordonn\u00e9e, n\u2019a pas de valeur commerciale (puisque) les lots qu\u2019elle est cens\u00e9e desservir sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 vendus. Le propri\u00e9taire ne pourrait pas en disposer pour les fins ordinaires des agents d\u2019immeubles, soit pour constructions ou autres choses.\nIl ne trouverait pas preneur; et encore: \u201cUne ruelle o\u00f9 les lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus avec droit de passage n\u2019a aucune valeur commerciale.\u201d\nIls ajoutent, tous deux, qu\u2019il est de coutume, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, lorsqu\u2019un propri\u00e9taire subdivise son terrain en lots, d\u2019inclure dans le co\u00fbt de ces lots \u201cun montant pour couvrir la superficie des ruelles et des rues\u201d. Et cela est in\u00e9vitable. Pour faire une op\u00e9ration profitable, l\u2019auteur d\u2019une subdivision doit se rembourser sur le prix des lots de la valeur des rues et ruelles qu\u2019il met \u00e0 part et qu\u2019il abandonne pour l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de ces lots. Les intim\u00e9s, qui en avaient l\u2019opportunit\u00e9, n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9tendu que cela n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas qui nous occupe.\nNous avons l\u00e0 le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de toute la preuve qui peut nous guider pour fixer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s doivent recevoir. Comme on le voit, et comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi, cette preuve est fort \u201cpeu satisfaisante\u201d. Aussi n\u2019en a-t-elle pas tenu compte; et, pour accorder un montant de $7,000, s\u2019est-elle appuy\u00e9e sur une r\u00e8gle en vertu de laquelle le terrain d\u2019une rue ou d\u2019une ruelle vaudrait les deux cinqui\u00e8mes du terrain en bordure de cette rue ou ruelle. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les deux cinqui\u00e8mes repr\u00e9senteraient 50c. du pied, soit pour les 14,000 pieds une somme de $7,000.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9vite, autant que possible, de modifier la quotit\u00e9 des dommages ou de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui est accord\u00e9e par les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance. Ces tribunaux sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en meilleure posture qu\u2019elle pour en peser tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation. Mais ici, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a pas fix\u00e9 le montant, et la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e9tait dans la m\u00eame situation que les juges de cette cour.\nEn outre, les tribunaux d\u2019appel ont toujours reconnu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir dans la fixation du montant d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019un principe erron\u00e9. La seule justification de la base adopt\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi en cette cause-ci est l\u2019allusion faite incidemment par l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 la pratique de la Commission des Utilit\u00e9s Publiques. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, et sans que la question lui f\u00fbt pos\u00e9e, ce t\u00e9moin dit inopin\u00e9ment, en parlant de cas semblables:\nSi vous me demandez quelle est la coutume, je crois que la Commission des Utilit\u00e9s Publiques accorde les deux cinqui\u00e8mes,\n* * *\nQ. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019exp\u00e9rience que vous avez avec la Commission des Utilit\u00e9s Publiques, vous dites que la pratique a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 votre connaissance, de demander les deux cinqui\u00e8mes de la valeur des lots en bordure?\nR. Assez souvent.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 tout ce qu\u2019on trouve sur ce point. C\u2019est une mention passag\u00e8re dont personne n\u2019a paru faire \u00e9tat \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible en preuve; on ne pouvait \u00e9tablir ainsi verbalement la teneur ou la port\u00e9e de certaines sentences arbitrales de la Commission des Utilit\u00e9s Publiques de Qu\u00e9bec, maintenant connue sous le nom de Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec.\nSi toutefois l\u2019on \u00e9carte la question d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de cette preuve, l\u2019on peut concevoir qu\u2019il se soit rencontr\u00e9 des cas o\u00f9 cette Commission a cru que les circonstances particuli\u00e8res, dans certaines causes qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 juger, lui permettaient d\u2019adopter la m\u00e9thode de calcul que l\u2019on vient d\u2019indiquer. Mais on n\u2019en saurait faire une r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re d\u2019expropriation et, \u00e0 notre humble avis, les faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s ici n\u2019en justifient pas l\u2019application \u00e0 la cause actuelle.\nNous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9duit \u00e0 sa plus simple expression. Tous les lots qui bordent la ruelle sont vendus. La ruelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201ccr\u00e9\u00e9e et (n\u2019est) conserv\u00e9e (que) pour l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de ces lots\u201d. La servitude de passage couvre toute la superficie de la ruelle et elle est perp\u00e9tuelle. A part les lots qui jouissent de la servitude, tout le terrain qui entoure la ruelle est compris dans la rue Mentana. Cela \u00e9limine la possibilit\u00e9 de constructions voisines qui auraient besoin d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir du propri\u00e9taire de la ruelle des droits de vue, d\u2019\u00e9gouts, ou de passage. Les intim\u00e9s ont un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pratiquement d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 de tous ses attributs. Ils n\u2019ont le jus utendi, jus fruendi et jus abutendi ni sur la surface, ni sur le dessus. Il leur reste des droits sur le dessous (art. 414 C.C.); mais ils n\u2019y auront acc\u00e8s qu\u2019\u00e0 condition de faire l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un droit de passage souterrain \u201c\u00e0 la charge d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 proportionn\u00e9e au dommage qu\u2019il peut causer\u201d (arts. 540 C.C. et suiv.).\nEn outre, la valeur de la ruelle est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans le prix des lots qu\u2019elle dessert; et les intim\u00e9s ou leur auteur sont donc suppos\u00e9s en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 rembours\u00e9s.\nIl faut tout de m\u00eame accorder une indemnit\u00e9 quelconque. Cette indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une expropriation. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al s\u2019est empar\u00e9e du terrain et en a fait une rue publique. Elle a omis les formalit\u00e9s que la loi lui imposait pour en faire r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement l\u2019acquisition. Elle n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9alable (art. 407 C.C). Les intim\u00e9s ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 en revendication, et un premier jugement leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable. Il ne leur restait plus que le recours qu\u2019ils exercent maintenant (Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al vs Villeneuve[2]. Ce sont les principes de l\u2019expropriation qui doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s, quoique les formalit\u00e9s n\u2019en aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies (Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al vs L\u00e9veill\u00e9[3]); Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al vs Hogan[4].\nSous la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (art. 421),\nl\u2019indemnit\u00e9, en cas d\u2019expropriation, comprendra la valeur r\u00e9elle de l\u2019immeuble, partie d\u2019immeuble ou servitude expropri\u00e9s, et les dommages resultant de l\u2019expropriation.\nL\u2019estimation de cette valeur r\u00e9elle doit \u00eatre faite du point de vue du propri\u00e9taire et non du point de vue de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, \u201cthe value to be paid for is the value to the owner * * * not to the taker\u201d (dictum de Lord Dunedin in Cedar Rapids vs Lacoste[5]. De prime abord, cela r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 l\u2019expert qui a fait remarquer: \u201cIt is useful for a street\u201d L\u2019envisager ainsi serait se placer du point de vue de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et non pas de celui du propri\u00e9taire de la ruelle.\nLord Buckmaster (Fraser vs Fraserville[6] est encore plus pr\u00e9cis. Il dit:\nThe value to be ascertained is the value to the seller of the property.\nIl ajoute qu\u2019il faut tenir compte de tous les avantages et de toutes les possibilit\u00e9s\nexcluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property it compulsorily acquired.\nIci la seule possibilit\u00e9 qui pouvait \u00eatre raisonnablement envisag\u00e9e \u00e9tait celle o\u00f9 la municipalit\u00e9 aurait besoin de la ruelle pour en faire une rue. S\u2019il en existait d\u2019autres, il incombait aux intim\u00e9s de les faire voir \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Ce sont eux qui r\u00e9clamaient l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et sur eux retombait le fardeau de la preuve. Ils n\u2019auront qu\u2019eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer si d\u2019autres usages auxquels la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvait s\u2019adapter n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9s. D\u2019ailleurs il est difficile, pour ne pas dire impossible, d\u2019en envisager d\u2019autres. Il n\u2019existait donc qu\u2019un acheteur possible: la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al; et pour une seule fin: utiliser la ruelle comme rue publique. Cette situation \u00e9cartait toute concurrence et, par cons\u00e9quent, tout march\u00e9. Pour cette raison, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de \u201csp\u00e9cial adaptability\u201d, s\u2019il existe ici, qui entre en ligne de compte dans le calcul des indemnit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019expropriation, n\u2019a aucun poids dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle. Appr\u00e9cier l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sur la base que la ruelle a une certaine valeur pour la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al parce qu\u2019elle est sp\u00e9cialement adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019usage que la cit\u00e9 veut en faire, ce serait aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du principe pos\u00e9 dans la cause de Fraser v. Fraserville[7] et accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour\nany advaritage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired.\nIl n\u2019y a plus lieu de discuter les raisons qui ont conduit \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de ce principe. Elles sont clairement expos\u00e9es dans le jugement du juge Rowlatt dans la cause de Sydney v. North Eastern Rly. Co.[8].\nNous partageons l\u2019opinion de Monsieur le Juge Dorion, de la Cour du Banc du Roi, que le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour a fix\u00e9 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 un montant trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 (Dillon, Municipal Corporations, 5e \u00e9d., vol. 3, n\u00b0 1143). En plus, nous avous dit pourquoi nous sommes respectueusement d\u2019avis que ce montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 en vertu d\u2019un principe erron\u00e9. Nous croyons donc que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 sur ce point. \u201cLa valeur r\u00e9elle de l\u2019immeuble\u201d (suivant l\u2019expression de l\u2019article 421 de la\u2019 charte de Montr\u00e9al que nous avons reproduit plus haut) c\u2019est, dans le cas qui nous occupe:\nla valeur du fonds\n(a) appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e en tenant compte des droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s sur ce fonds \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al par sa charte et, en particulier, par la loi 3 Geo. V, c. 54, s. 43; (b) diminu\u00e9e de toute la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation qui r\u00e9sulte de la servitude de passage impos\u00e9e sur ce fonds par Fauteur des intim\u00e9s.\nCe que les intim\u00e9s perdent par la transformation de leur ruelle en rue publique peut \u00eatre insignifiant du point de vue p\u00e9cuniaire; mais l\u2019enqu\u00eate devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ne nous fournit aucune donn\u00e9e pour en \u00e9tablir la valeur, comprise comme nous venons de l\u2019indiquer. Dans les circonstances, toute somme que nous fixerions serait arbitraire.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi cependant n\u2019a prononc\u00e9 contre la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al aucune condamnation d\u00e9finitive. L\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de payer la somme de $7,000 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9e. Elle pouvait, en vertu du jugement, omettre ce paiement et tenter d\u2019en faire modifier le montant en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec qui, ainsi qu\u2019il fut admis devant nous, est le corps comp\u00e9tent en mati\u00e8re d\u2019expropriations de ce genre. Elle n\u2019a pas cru devoir profiter de ce choix qui lui fut laiss\u00e9. Elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 se pourvoir en appel devant nous. Elle peut faire valoir, en faveur de la voie qu\u2019elle a suivie, l\u2019argument que si le montant fix\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi est excessif, l\u2019effet du jugement est, comme seule alternative, de la forcer ii payer une somme injuste, pour \u00e9viter d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 F expropriation; et le r\u00e9sultat, du point de vue pratique, est de la priver virtuellement de son option.\nD\u2019autre part, nous n\u2019avons pas juridiction pour contraindre les parties \u00e0 aller devant la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec; nous pouvons seulement retourner le dossier \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y faire d\u00e9terminer la\n\u201csomme juste et raisonnable\u201d, que r\u00e9clament les intim\u00e9s par leur action et qu\u2019ils ont consenti d\u2019accepter en \u00e9change de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9, dont la cit\u00e9 s\u2019est empar\u00e9e.\nIl faut \u00e9viter cependant la multiplicit\u00e9 des enqu\u00eates \u00e0 laquelle les parties seraient expos\u00e9es si nous laissions \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, apr\u00e8s que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure aura fix\u00e9 le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, la facult\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019option de proc\u00e9der par voie d\u2019expropriation.\nNous pourrions dire qu\u2019en inscrivant devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, sans r\u00e9serve ni restriction, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al peut \u00eatre tenue pour avoir abandonn\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 *cette option. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, en nous rendant \u00e0 sa demande de modifier le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous pouvons certainement y mettre comme condition qu\u2019elle renonce \u00e0 ce droit.\nNous ordonnons donc, \u00e0 la condition que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al renonce \u00e0 l\u2019option de proc\u00e9der, par voie d\u2019expropriation, que le dossier soit retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y faire d\u00e9terminer le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui devra \u00eatre pay\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s. A d\u00e9faut par la cit\u00e9 d\u2019abandonner express\u00e9ment cette option en en donnant avis aux intim\u00e9s dans les trente jours de la signification du pr\u00e9sent jugement, le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi sera maintenu purement et simplement. Sous tous autres rapports, ce jugement est confirm\u00e9.\nQuant aux frais, nous croyons que l\u2019objet principal du litige \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al avait eu raison de s\u2019emparer de la ruelle et d\u2019en faire une rue publique sans payer d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s. Tout ce litige doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme une cause d\u2019expropriation et les frais de l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette cour doivent \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019appelante.\nJudgment of appellate court varied.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Damphousse, Butler & St-Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dorais & Dorais.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 43 K.B. 213.\n[2] Q.R. 41 K.B. 218.\n[3] Q.R. 4 K.B. 216, at pp. 216 et seq.\n[4] Q.R. 8 K.B. 534, at pp. 544 et seq.\n[5] [1914] A.C. 569, at p. 576.\n[6] [1917] A.C. 187, at p. 194.\n[7] [1917] A.C. 187, at p. 194.\n[8] [1914] K.B. 629, at pp. 636, 637.\n"}

The respondent also prayed that the defendant be condemned to pay the said sum of $3,643. The respondent, having sold and delivered to the defendant Davis materials for the construction of a series of thirteen contiguous houses, erected on twelve lots, and having received payments on account after the delivery of the materials, had still a claim amounting to $3,643 and registered against certain of the lots on which the aforesaid constructions had been erected a declaration of privilege in the sum of $3,643. By the conclusions of its action, the respondent prayed that Davis be personally condemned to pay this sum and that the immovables on which the constructions were erected be declared affected by privilege for the payment of the said sum. Davis filed a defence but did not appear when the case came before the Superior Court. Before the hearing, the appellant intervened in this cause and prayed for the complete dismissal of the action, pretending that it had become owner of the immovables, against which the declaration of privilege had been registered, before the registration had been effected of this declaration, and that, consequently, the registration had been made super non domino.\nBy a second intervention, the appellant pretended that the materials furnished by the respondent on the lots of land affected by privilege, were not worth the sum claimed, but in all at the most were not worth more than $1,506.20, and the appellant tendered this sum with a further amount for the costs, in all $1,700, which the appellant deposited with its intervention and prayed for the dismissal of the action inasmuch as the ratification of the privilege was concerned and asked that this privilege be radiated. The judgment of the Superior Court condemned Davis to pay the total amount claimed and maintained the privilege against the immovables thereby affected for the full sum.\nC. Laurendeau K.C. and A. E. J. Bissonnet K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. L. St.-Jacques K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of this court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed. The only question requiring discussion is that which arises upon the contention of Mr. Laurendeau as to the effect of article 2103 C.C. as enacted by 7 George V (1916) c. 52. The other contentions advanced by him in support of the appeal were fully discussed on the argument, and concerning them, it is now sufficient to say that there appears to be no ground for disagreeing with the views of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nMr. Laurendeau\u2019s contention is that by force of the enactment just mentioned, of 1916, the lien claimant in respect of materials has a privilege which does not come into existence until the registration of a memorial pursuant to that enactment. If this is the law, admittedly the appellants must succeed, because they acquired their title prior to the registration of any memorial by the respondent. On behalf of the respondent, while it is not disputed that the lien of a furnisher of materials can only be preserved by registration of the statutory memorial within the statutory period, that is to say, by registration of it before the expiration of thirty days after the completion of the work, it is maintained that the privilege may nevertheless be effectively constituted at an earlier date, at the date when the obligation of the owner or the contractor arises; and it was then, it is said, that the privilege now asserted came into being, and if the respondent is right in this, the appeal must fail.\nIt is necessary to consider article 2013e C.C. as enacted by 7 Geo. V (1916), c. 52, and in its amended form, as enacted by 14 Geo. V (1924), c. 73. First then, article 2013e as enacted in 1916 is one of a series of articles which by that enactment were inserted in the Civil Code as articles 2013, and 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d, 2013e, 2013f; and by the same statute, article 2103 of the Civil Code was repealed as to its first paragraph which was replaced by a new paragraph.\nArticle 2013 C.C. as enacted in that year provides generally for the privilege of the workman, the supplier of materials and the builder and the architect, while the sub-articles contain special provisions dealing severally with these kinds of privilege. Article 2103 (1) C.C. is as follows:\nThe privilege of every person, except the workman, mentioned in article 2013, is created and preserved by registration within the proper delay at the registry office of the division in which the immovable is situated, of a notice or memorial, drawn up in the form of an affidavit of the creditor or his representative, sworn to before a justice of the peace, a commissioner of the Superior Court, or a notary, setting forth the name, occupation and residence of the creditor, the nature and amount of his claim, and the cadastral number of the immovable so affected.\nThis, it is said, is in effect a declaration that the privilege, in any case but that of the workman, does not arise until the registration of the notice or memorial there provided for. It may be, however, that in the case of the supplier of materials, the notice mentioned in article 2103 (1) C.C. is intended to be the same notice as that prescribed for in the second paragraph of article 2013e C.C. (as enacted in the same statute), which I copy:\u2014\nSuch privilege, however, shall take effect only upon the registration of a notice, given to the proprietor or his representative, informing him of the nature and cost of the materials to be supplied, as well as the cadastral number of the immovable property affected, and shall apply only to those furnished, or those specially prepared and not delivered, for the immovable in question, after the receipt of such notice by the proprietor, and its registration.\nArticle 2013e C.C. provides only for this notice, article 2013f C.C., on the contrary, which relates to the lien of the architect and the builder, provides only for a memorial. It may be possible to read the adjectival clause in article 2103 (1) C.C. beginning \u201cdrawn up in the form of an affidavit,\u201d as relating only to the immediate antecedent, that is to say to the word \u201cmemorial,\u201d and not to \u201cnotice\u201d; and to treat the words \u201cnotice or memorial\u201d distributively, one referring to the \u201cnotice\u201d provided for in article 2013e C.C., and the other to the \u201cmemorial\u201d prescribed in article 2013f C.C. In support of this it might be urged that the contents of the \u201cnotice\u201d are fully set forth in article 2013e C.C., while those of the memorial are not stated in article 2013f C.C.\nNo doubt, if the Act of 1916 stood alone, this view might present rather serious difficulties, but article 2013e C.C., as amended by the statute of 1924, seems to remove these difficulties. It is in these words:\u2014\nArticle 2013e of the Civil Code, as enacted by the Act 7 Geo. V, Chapter 52, section 3, is amended:\n(a) By replacing the second paragraph thereof by the following:\n\u201cHowever, in the case where the supplier of materials contracts with the proprietor himself, such privilege is conserved only by registration, before the expiration of thirty days after the end of the work, of a memorial containing:\n1. The names, surname and domicile of the creditor and of the debtor;\n2. The description of the immovable affected by the privilege;\n3. A statement of the claim specifying the nature and price of the materials supplied to the proprietor or specially prepared to be supplied to him.\nIn the case where the supplier of materials contracts with the builder, he must notify the proprietor of the immovable in writing that he has made a contract with the builder for the delivery of materials. His privilege is conserved for all the materials supplied after such notice provided he registers, within thirty days after the end of the work, a memorial similar to that mentioned in the preceding paragraph.

C.\nThe appellants seek leave to appeal from an unanimous judgment of the appellate court in Quebec dismissing their appeal from their conviction on an indictment laid against them under section 498 Cr. C., which deals with conspiracies in restraint of trade; and the question at issue in this appeal is whether that section is within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nHeld that leave to appeal cannot be granted as the judgment appealed from does not conflict with the judgment of any other appellate court in a like case. (S. 1025 Cr. C.).\nAttorney-General for Ontario v. Canadian Wholesale Grocers Association (53 Ont. L.R. 627); Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Alberta ([1922] 1 A.C. 191), and Fort Frances Pulp & Paper Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. ([1923] A.C. 695) disc. MOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec upholding the conviction of the appellants on an indictment laid against them under section 498 of the Criminal Code.\nForsyth for the motion.\nBertrand K.C. contra.\nMignault J.\u2014This is a petition by the appellants for leave to appeal, under section 1025 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36), from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Quebec) dismissing their appeal from their conviction on an indictment laid against them under section 498 of the Criminal Code, which deals with conspiracies in restraint of trade.\nFollowing their conviction, the appellants brought two appeals to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, one on questions of law alone, and the other on questions stated to be of mixed law and fact. On the latter appeal one of the learned judges dissented, and a further appeal has been brought to this Court and is now pending. The appeal on questions of law alone was unanimously rejected, and the object of this application is to seek leave to appeal on the question whether section 498 of the Criminal Code is within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nSuch leave cannot be granted unless the judgment to be appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case (s. 1025 Cr. C.). The petitioners rely on three cases which they say are in conflict with the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench: Attorney-General for Ontario v. Canadian Wholesale Grocers Association[1]; Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Alberta[2]; Fort Frances Pulp & Paper Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co.[3].\nThe first case was a decision of the Appellate Division of Ontario, Meredith C.J.O. and Magee, Hodgins and Ferguson JJ.A. Subject to a further reference to this decision, I may say that, on the point in question, the constitutionality of section 498, one only of the learned judges, the Chief Justice, was of the opinion that section 498 was ultra vires. Magee J.A., concurred in the result; Hodgins J.A., expressed the view that section 498 was not ultra vires, and Ferguson J.A., found it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of that section, inasmuch as, in his judgment, the appeal failed on the merits. There was therefore no pronouncement of the appellate court on this question, and therefore there is no conflict.\nAttorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Alberta[4], which I will call the Board of Commerce Case, is the well known decision of the Judicial Committee whereby two statutes of the Dominion Parliament, The Board of Commerce Act (9 and 10 Geo. V, c. 37), and The Combines and Fair Prices Act (9 and 10 Geo. V, c. 45) were held to be ultra vires.\nThat this judgment of the Judicial Committee may conceivably lend support to the contention that section 498 of the Criminal Code transcends the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion, is shewn by the judgment of Chief Justice Meredith in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Canadian Wholesale Grocers Association[5]. Nevertheless, upon full consideration, I do not think I can say that the Board of Commerce Case is a like case within the meaning of section 1025 Cr. C. The question there arose on a case stated by the Board of Commerce, under section 32 of The Board of Commerce Act, for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada. The Judicial Committee, on appeal from this court, answered in the negative the question submitted by the Boards which was whether the Board had lawful authority to make a certain order prohibiting retail dealers in clothing in Ottawa from charging as profits more than a certain percentage on cost. Section 498 of the Criminal Code was not involved in the question submitted. I do not think therefore that the petitioners can rely on the Board of Commerce Case.\nIn my opinion, the third case referred to by the petitioners, Fort Frances Pulp & Paper Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. (1), is not in any way a like case, nor has it any bearing on the validity of section 498.\nThe petition therefore fails and should be dismissed.\nLeave to appeal refused.\n[1] 53 Ont. L.R. 627.\n[2] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[3] [1923] A.C. 695.\n[4] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[5] 53 Ont. L.R. 627.\n"}

The appellant, by its plea, first denied any liability and further alleged:\u2014\nDuring the periods mentioned in the information filed herein the defendant has overpaid for taxes under the said Special War Revenue Act, 1915, the sum of $134,423.03 and if it should be found that the defendant is liable for any sums of money in respect of any of the claims made by reason of the facts specified in the said information, the defendant craves leave to set off against such sum the said sum of $134,423.03 so overpaid by the defendant. At the opening of the trial before Mr. Justice Audette, counsel for the respondent made an application to strike out this paragraph.\nAfter argument by counsel for the respondent and for the appellant, the Honourable Mr. Justice Audette granted the motion to strike out the paragraph, with costs in favour of the respondent, on the ground that a set off or counterclaim cannot be urged against the Crown without a \u201cfiat.\u201d\nThe defendant seeks to appeal to this court from that judgment.\nThe appellant moves before me for an order approving the security offered by it, and the respondent served a notice of motion upon the appellant to the effect that, upon the hearing of the appellant\u2019s motion, he would move to have the security refused on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nBoth motions were made returnable before me on the same day and the respondent\u2019s motion was first argued.\nAppeals from the Exchequer Court of Canada are regulated by section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act which says:\u2014\n82. Any party * * * who is dissatisfied with any final judgment or with any judgment upon any demurrer * * * given therein by the Exchequer Court * * * and who is desirous of appealing against such judgment may * * * deposit with the Registrar of the Supreme Court the sum of $50 by way of security for costs.\nCounsel for the appellant and for the respondent having intimated that there would be an appeal from my decision in any case, expressed their desire to have my decision at an early date. I did not have time therefore to consider the merits of this case as much as I would have otherwise owing to the importance of the question raised by the motion.\nThe counsel for the respondent, in support of his motion, urged the following grounds:\u2014\n1. That the judgment appealed from is not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of section 2 of the Supreme Court Act.\n2. That the judgment appealed from is not a judgment upon a demurrer;\n3. That the judgment appealed from is a \u201cjudgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d (Section 38, Supreme Court Act). 4. That the judgment appealed from deals with a question of practice and procedure.\nI think the respondent cannot succeed on the third point.\nOwing to the conclusion that I have reached on the first point, it is not necessary for me to decide the second one.\nAs to the fourth point, I am of the opinion that this appeal is not one upon a question of practice and procedure: the question in controversy is whether a person can allege a set off against the Crown without a fiat. Even if this was a question of practice and procedure, I presume this court will be inclined to take it into consideration as it \u201cinvolved substantial rights or (the) decision appealed from may cause grave injustice.\u201d Lambe v. Armstrong[1].\nUpon the first point, I have come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from determines a substantial right of the appellant within the meaning of section 2 of the Supreme Court Act and is therefore a final judgment appealable to this court. Bulger v. Home Insurance Co.[2].\nCounsel for the respondent argued that the judgment appealed from is not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d because the appellant does not lose his rights to the amount claimed by the set off as the appellant\u2019s right to sue the respondent by direct action still remains.\nI have been unable to follow this argument as the appellant cannot be denied the right to proceed by way of a set off, if he chooses to do so; and by the judgment appealed from, he is deprived of such right.\nI have not found any decision precisely upon the point raised by this motion.\nBut this court has already held, in McLennan v. McLennan[3] that\nthe Supreme Court of Canada (can entertain) an appeal from a judgment confirming an order, by a judge in chambers, to strike out a scandalous and irrelevant paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s reply to the defence pleaded.\nThe decision in Dominion Textile Co. v. Skaife[4] also held that this court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment which had maintained an inscription in law asking that certain allegations be struck off from the plea.\nOn the whole I am of the opinion that the respondent\u2019s motion to have the security refused should be dismissed with costs and that the appellant\u2019s motion for an order approving security should be granted with costs to follow the event. Armand Grenier, Acting Registrar.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada after hearing counsel for the motion and without calling the appellant\u2019s counsel, dismissed the motion with costs and affirmed its jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The oral judgment delivered by the Chief Justice held that the judgment appealed from had determined a substantial right of the appellant and was therefore a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of par. e of s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nF.

The car fell to the bottom of the shaft and the appellant\u2019s son received bodily injuries which caused his death the same day.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 198), that the respondents were not liable.\nHeld also that, upon the evidence, it could be found that the appellant\u2019s son was \u201cthe author of his own injury.\u201d As a skilled workman he should have realized the risk to which he was exposed in working upon the unbraked car while in gear, situated as it was and he must have known that the means of avoiding such risk were entirely in his own hands. But, at least, it must be held that the appellant had failed to prove that her son\u2019s death was caused by actionable fault of the respondents necessary to entail their liability under article 1053 C.C.\nHeld, further, that before a plaintiff can invoke a presumption of fault against a defendant under art. 1054 C.C., he is obliged to establish (a) that the damage was in fact caused by the thing in question within the meaning of that article, and (b) that that thing was at the time under the care of the defendant. The automobile on which the deceased was working was safe and harmless while in the position in which he had placed it and it became dangerous only because it either started of itself or was put in motion. If the proper inference from the evidence was that the automobile started of itself, i.e., without the intervention of human agency, and owing to something inherent in the machine, the ensuing damage might be ascribable to it as a \u201cthing\u201d and be within the purview of art. 1054 C.C. But if its movement was due to an act of the deceased, conscious or unconscious, the damage was caused, not by the thing itself, but by that act, whether it should be regarded as purely involuntary and accidental or as amounting to negligence or fault. On the latter hypotheses, the provision of art. 1054 C.C., invoked by the appellant, does not apply: either the case was one of pure accident, entailing no liability; or, if there be liability, it must rest on fault to be proven and not presumed. Upon the evidence, the most likely cause of the movement of the automobile was the act of the deceased workman in pressing down the self-starter, probably inadvertently, as the car was in gear and unbraked in a place where it was dangerous to start it, and the workman must have known that fact unless he were utterly careless or indifferent as to his own safety.\nQuaere whether, upon the facts in this case, the automobile was not, for the purposes of art. 1054 C.C., at the time of the accident under the care of the deceased who was an expert workman, rather than under the care of the respondents.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, D\u00e9saulniers J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe appellant brought action to recover damages occasioned by the death of Lionel Tremblay, her son, who was killed on the 11th of May, 1925, while in the employ of the respondents. The respondents, at the time of the accident, were carrying on business as vendors of motor cars, and they maintained a garage or work shop for repairs and service. It was a rented building of four stories (counting the ground floor), and in that garage was a platform elevator or hoist at the back which was used to bring cars and materials to the various floors. On the day of the accident, Lionel Tremblay was working on the third floor. About one o\u2019clock in the afternoon he brought up on the elevator from the main floor an automobile sent in for repair. The hoist stopped at the third floor and the deceased ran it off and stopped it opposite to, a few feet from and facing the elevator. The elevator continued to the fourth floor, where another employee got off and the operator lowered the hoist to the main floor where it was usually kept. The deceased then worked for over an hour upon the car; at the time of the accident he was standing with one knee on the running-board and his body inside the car, and, while he was so employed the car suddenly started, crashed through the wooden barrier, and fell down the elevator shaft to the bottom, carrying with it the appellant\u2019s son, who was so injured in falling that he died the same day. The appellant brought an action for $4,999.99, alleging fault on the part of the respondents in the following particulars:\n(a) In allowing the deceased to work on the car near the elevator; (b) In lowering the elevator to the ground floor without warning the deceased; (c) In failing to provide any barrier (garde-corps) around the elevator shaft.\nJ. E. Cadotte for the appellant.\nF. J. Laverty K.C. for the respondents.\nAfter hearing argument for the appellant, and after hearing for a short time counsel for the respondent, the court gave judgment dismissing the appeal with costs. The judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014In her declaration the appellant undoubtedly confined her claim to a cause of action based on art. 1053 C.C., alleging fault in three respects attributable to the respondents. Here her counsel sought also to invoke the provision of art. 1054 C.C., which renders every person responsible for all damage caused \u201cby things which he has under his care.\u201d It is not clear whether this position was taken in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, but two of the learned judges in that court base their dissent largely upon an application of art. 1054 C.C.\nBefore the plaintiff can invoke a presumption of fault against the defendants under art. 1054, she is obliged to establish (a) that the damage was in fact caused by the thing in question within the meaning of that article, and (b) that that thing was at the time under the care of the defendant. The automobile on which the deceased was working was safe and harmless while in the position in which he had placed it on the third floor of the defendants\u2019 garage. It became dangerous only because it either started of itself or was put in motion. If the proper inference from the evidence was that the automobile started of itself, i.e., without the intervention of human agency, and owing to something inherent in the machine, the ensuing damage might be ascribable to it as a \u201cthing\u201d and be within the purview of art. 1054 C.C. But if its movement was due to an act of the deceased, conscious or unconscious, the damage was caused, not by the thing itself, but by that act, whether it should be regarded as purely involuntary and accidental or as amounting to negligence or fault. On the latter hypotheses, the provision of art. 1054 C.C., invoked by the appellant, does not apply: either the case was one of pure accident, entailing no liability; or, if there be liability, it must rest on fault to be proven and not presumed.\nOn the evidence before us, the most likely cause of the movement of the automobile was the act of the deceased workman in pressing down the self-starter\u2014probably inadvertently, as the car was in gear and unbraked in a place where it was dangerous to start it, and the workman must have known that fact unless he were utterly careless or indifferent as to his own safety. That the car was started in any other way would seem highly improbable and may not be assumed in the absence of any evidence of facts which would warrant such an inference.\nMoreover, as was pointed out during the argument, we should have to consider very carefully whether, upon the facts before us, the automobile was not, for the purposes of art. 1054 C.C., at the time of the accident under the care of the deceased, Tremblay himself, who was an expert workman, rather than under the care of the defendants. The action cannot, in our opinion, be maintained under that article.\nNor has the plaintiff established fault of the defendant which was the cause of the death of Tremblay so as to render them liable therefor under art. 1053 C.C. Assuming that the deceased was obliged to work upon the car where it was, he might have averted any danger by turning the front wheels sideways or by throwing the transmission out of gear and setting the brakes. As a skilled workman he should have realized the risk to which he was exposed in working upon the unbraked car while in gear, situated as it was, and he must have known that the means of avoiding such risk were entirely in his own hands. Under such circumstances the maxim volenti non fit injuria would seem to be much in point. The place was in fact dangerous only because the deceased neglected obvious precautions which would have made it quite safe.\nTremblay probably actually knew, at all events he should have seen, that the elevator was not stationed at the third, floor, and that the elevator shaft was open, save for the light railing which served as a guard to prevent persons passing accidentally falling into it. There was no duty incumbent on the defendants to guard against such an occurrence as that which actually happened. We are not prepared to impose on the proprietor of every garage such as that operated by the defendants, the duty of maintaining at each opening of an elevator shaft a barrier of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of any automobile which may be allowed to run against it. There may be circumstances under which such a duty would arise, but there is no evidence of their existence in the present case. The defendants owed no such duty to the deceased Tremblay. Had he taken the precaution either of turning the front wheels of the car away from the direction of the elevator shaft or of throwing the transmission out of gear and setting the brakes before attempting to do work upon the automobile which involved danger of his accidentally pressing the self-starter, the unfortunate occurrence which cost him his life would not have happened. If he was not \u201cthe author of his own injury,\u201d at least the plaintiff has failed to prove that his death was caused by actionable fault of the defendants necessary to entail their liability under art. 1053 C.C.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Godin, Dussault & Cadotte.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Laverty, Hale & Dixon.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 43 K.B. 198.\n"}

Jansen by that contract agreed to pay for such goods, and to pay carriage, freight, etc., thereon. The appellant claimed that under this contract Jansen became indebted to it in the sum of $1,545.18, and on November 25, 1922, the appellant forwarded to Jansen a new contract similar to the previous one, dated November 25, 1922, signed by it, and asking him to execute the same and obtain the signatures of two sureties thereto. This is the contract sued on by the appellant. In this contract Jansen\u2019s indebtedness to the appellant is mutually agreed between him and the appellant to be $1,545.18. The contract is in two parts: (1) a contract with the principal Jansen; and (2) an underwritten contract with the sureties. It bore the signature of Jansen, and provided that it would expire on March 1, 1924. Some time in May, 1923, Jansen obtained the signatures of the respondents Minke and Bort to the under written contract, which, after reciting the consideration therefor, among which is the sale and delivery by the appellant to Jansen of goods and other articles, and the extension of the time of payment of the indebtedness then due from Jansen to the appellant proceeds as follows:\u2014\nWe, the undersigned sureties, do hereby waive notice of the acceptance of this agreement and diligence in bringing action against said second party, and jointly, severally and unconditionally promise, agree and guarantee the full and complete payment of said indebtedness the amount of which is now written in said agreement or if not, we hereby expressly authorize the amount of said indebtedness to be written therein, and jointly, severally and unconditionally promise to pay for said goods and other articles, and the prepaid freight, cartage, postal, or express charges thereon, at the time and place, and in the manner in said agreement provided.\nThe effect of this was to divide the guarantee into two parts, one a guarantee for the payment of a past due debt, the other a guarantee for the payment of future advances. On the termination of this second contract the appellant claimed that Jansen still owed them $1,129.54 on the old indebtedness of $1,545.18, and brought this action against Jansen as the principal debtor and Minke and Bort as sureties, to recover the said $1,129.54. In other words, the action is brought on the guarantee for the payment of the past due debt.\nThe action was dismissed by the trial judge, Taylor J., and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for the appellant and the respondents, reserved judgment, and, on a later date, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is a plea of non est factum.\nThe learned trial judge, in his reasons for judgment, says:\u2014\nI am very dear that in signing the documents these two defendants were not aware and had not called to their attention in any way the covenant under which it is suggested that they assumed liability for the past indebtedness of Jansen, and that Jansen deceived them as to the contents of the document which he asked them to sign. These two defendants could then neither read nor write anything beyond their names. Bort has since, through the assistance of his children now growing up and at school, acquired a little proficiency. But they are both men of very limited understanding, limited vocabulary, slow of perception and without education. Even could they have read or had they had the document read to them, they could not without explanation have understood its meaning or effect.\nThese findings were not disturbed by the Court of Appeal, although, in view of one paragraph of the defence, that court thought the respondents must be held to have known they were signing a guarantee for future advances.\nOn these findings, the case stands as one where a document was falsely explained to illiterate persons, and they signed it believing it to contain only what was represented to them. Under these circumstances, they were not bound by that portion of the document containing a liability never explained to them and indeed entirely different from that which they were told they were assuming. As to that part of it, the document cannot be taken to be their act and deed.\nIt follows that the respondents could not be held for the-past due indebtedness of Jansen, which they never intended to\u2014and in fact never did\u2014guarantee. The action, seeking to hold them responsible for such indebtedness was; therefore rightly dismissed.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nF. H. McLorg for the appellant.\nH. Fisher K.C. and S. M. Clark for the respondents.\n[1] [1928] 1 W.W.R. 199.\n"}

Stafford (Defendant) Respondent.\n1928: May 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Automobile accident\u2014Injury to passenger\u2014Presumption of fault\u2014Motor Vehicles Act (R.S.Q. [1925] c. 35, s. 53 (2)\u2014Liability of owner under Arts, 1053 and 1054 C.C.\nThe appellant claimed damages resulting from an automobile accident, and alleged that, while at the invitation of respondent\u2019s chauffeur he was a passenger on respondent\u2019s truck, he was injured through fault of the chauffeur by being caught between the car and the pavement, when the truck struck the curb and broke a wheel.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 251), that the respondent was not liable.\nHeld, also, that section 53 (2) (a) of the Motor Vehicles Act (R.S.Q. [1925] c. 35), which creates a presumption of fault against the owner of a motor vehicle which he must rebut, applies only in the case of a person injured while travelling upon a highway and does not apply in favour of a passenger in an automobile which is driven by the owner\u2019s servant.\n(a) 53 (2) Quand un v\u00e9hicule automobile cause une perte ou un dommage \u00e0 quelque personne dans un chemin public, le fardeau de la preuve que cette perte ou ce dommage n\u2019est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du propri\u00e9taire ou de la personne qui conduit ce v\u00e9hicule automobile, incombe au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 la personne qui conduit le v\u00e9hicule automobile.\n(a) 53 (2) Whenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver. Held, also, that a presumption of fault cannot be urged against the defendant under article 1054 C.C. on the ground that the injury was caused by a thing under her care. That provision has no application to a case where, as in this case, the real cause of the accident is the intervention of some human agency; the question whether such human agency\u2014that of the driver in this case\u2014is at fault being a question of fact. Damage is not caused by a thing which is in the care of the owner within the meaning of Art. 1054 C.C., where it is really due to some fault in the operation or handling of the thing by the person in control of it.\nHeld, further, that the defendant is not liable under Art. 1053 C.C. as in the circumstances of this case this court would not interfere with the concurrent findings of the courts below that fault of the driver, a person under the defendant\u2019s control, had not been proved.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Philippe Demers J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action in damages.\nThe respondent is a funeral director and occasionally employed the appellant. On the 26th of April, 1926, the appellant, after having completed the services for which he had been retained, was about to leave the respondent\u2019s premises, when the driver of a truck owned by the respondent asked the appellant to help him to carry some furniture to its destination. On the way back, the chauffeur drove the respondent\u2019s car onto the sidewalk, broke a front wheel, upsetting the car, and the appellant, being caught between the car and the pavement was seriously injured. The appellant claimed $5,000 damages.\nErnest Lafontaine for the appellant.\nH. J. Trihey K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the close of the argument for the appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We are all of the opinion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nThree distinct grounds of claim are presented.\nFirst, it is said that, on the interpretation of section 53 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 35) there is a presumption of fault against the owner of the motor vehicle in which the plaintiff was injured, which he must rebut; that that presumption applies equally in favour of a passenger in the car and of a person travelling on the highway. We are entirely against that view of the construction of the article. In our opinion, the article applies only in the case of a person travelling upon the highway; it does not apply in favour of the plaintiff who was a passenger in the automobile which was owned by the defendant and driven by his servant. The French version of the statute removes any possible doubt on this point.\nIn the second place, it is contended that fault is presumed against the defendant under article 1054 of the Civil Code, because the injury was caused by a thing under her care. Our view is that that provision has no application to a case where, as here, the real cause of the accident is the intervention of some human agency\u2014the question whether such human agency\u2014that of the driver in this case\u2014is at fault being a question of fact. Damage is not caused by a thing which is in the control of the defendant within the meaning of art. 1054 C.C. where it is really due to some fault in the operation or handling of the thing by the person in control of it.\nThe third ground is that there was fault of the driver, a person under the defendant\u2019s control. In that case such fault must be proved just as under art. 1053 C.C. fault of the defendant himself, where he is in personal control, must be established. There are concurrent findings against the appellant in this respect. These findings would be very difficult in any case to overcome. But they are particularly so, in this case, where there is only one witness who gives evidence relating the facts, and that witness is believed, such belief being expressed by the trial judge and by the Court of Appeal. In these circumstances, error in the finding not being demonstrated,\u2014not being made manifest\u2014it is impossible for us to interfere.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ernest Lafontaine.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. J. Tribey.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 43 K.B. 251.\n"}

They afterwards sold the goods for $2,000, which proceeds were not ear-marked and were disposed of by them in the usual course of business. The questions at issue in this case were whether the bulk sale was fraudulent and utterly void under the Bulk Sales Act, and whether the trustee in bankruptcy could recover from the appellants the sum of $2,000, being an amount equal to the amount realized on the resale of the stock-in-trade. Both courts answered these questions adversely to the appellants, the court in banco as to the second question basing its judgment on sections 60 and 65 of The Bankruptcy Act. The appellants now seek leave to appeal to this court.\nHeld, that leave to appeal should be granted. Among other questions, the meaning of the word \u201csettlements\u201d in section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act appears to be involved in this appeal, the point being whether this word should receive the same construction as that given to it under the English Bankruptcy Act ([1914] 4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 59, s. 42).\nUnder the circumstances of the case, the granting of a stay of proceedings was made conditional upon the appellants giving security that they would pay the amount adjudged against them in the event of their appeal being dismissed.\nAPPLICATION for special leave to appeal under section 74 (3) of the Bankruptcy Act from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in banco.\nApplication granted.\nA. C. Hill K.C. for the application.\nE. F. Newcombe contra. Mignault J.\u2014The appellants applied to me, on the 27th of April, 1928, for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco of the 31st of March, 1928, dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Carroll on a case stated by the parties.\nThe appellants had purchased for $1,600, which they paid, the stock-in-trade of one Crouse at a bulk sale, the requirements of the Nova Scotia Bulk Sales Act (c. 202, R.S.N.S., 1923) not having been complied with. They afterwards sold the goods thus purchased for $2,000, which proceeds were not ear-marked and were disposed of by them in the usual course of business. The questions at issue are whether the bulk sale was fraudulent and utterly void under the Bulk Sales Act, and whether the trustee in bankruptcy could recover from these appellants the sum of $2,000, being an amount equal to the amount realized on the re-sale of the said stock-in-trade.\nBoth courts answered these questions adversely to the appellants, the court in banco, as to the second question, basing its judgment on sections 29, subs. 1, and 33 of the Bankruptcy Act. (These numbers are those of the office consolidation of the Act; the sections are now numbered 60 and 66 in chapter 11, R.S.C., 1927).\nAmong other questions, the meaning of the word \u201csettlements\u201d in section 29 (now section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act) appears to be here involved, the point being whether this word should receive the same construction as that given to it under the English Bankruptcy Act (4 & 5 Geo. 5, c. 59, s. 42, 1914). See In re Plummer[1], and other decisions noted in Duncan\u2019s treatise on Bankruptcy, p. 329, note 1.\nI think that the questions involved in this case are of sufficient importance to justify me in granting special leave to the appellants to appeal to this court. I therefore give them this leave. Whether there should be a stay of proceedings pending the appeal is however a matter left to my discretion, and, in view of all the circumstances of the case and of the fact that the sum involved, if it can be claimed by the trustee, represents by far the greater part of the assets of the bankrupt estate, I would make the stay of proceedings conditional upon the appellants giving, within fifteen days from this date, or such other time which a judge of this court may on proper cause being shown grant to the appellants, proper security to the satisfaction of the registrar that they will pay the amount which has been adjudged against them, in the event of the appeal to this court being dismissed. Otherwise, stay of proceedings shall be refused.\nAs to security for the costs of the appeal to this court, the provisions of subs. 4 of s. 174 of the Bankruptcy Act (R.S.G., 1927) shall govern.

The child was born in December, 1921, and her mother died in Toronto, where she had gone for medical treatment, on the 1st April, 1922. At the time of the death of the mother the child was with her, and the respondent, who was then residing in Montreal, went to Toronto and brought the child back. Together they lived with the appellant who is an uncle of the respondent, until the latter, in October, 1923, married a second time. At the time of his wife\u2019s death, and for some time thereafter, the respondent was in poor financial circumstances, and the appellant and his wife were anxious to take care of the child for him as they had become very much attached to her. Partly through the intervention of Rabbi Cohen, of Montreal, an agreement was ultimately drawn up regarding the child, and it is principally on the strength of this agreement that the appellant contests the present petition. In his return to the writ, the appellant asserts a right to the custody of the child on the ground that it was entrusted to him and his wife when the child was only twelve weeks\u2019 old; that the child was so entrusted to him by the mother and father of the child; and the last words of her mother before she died were to the effect that the child was to remain with the appellant and his wife who were to bring her up and keep her in their custody. He further alleges that in the year 1923, before Rabbi Cohen, the parties hereto agreed in writing that the child was to remain forever in the custody of the appellant under certain conditions, which the appellant has always fulfilled.\nIn his petition for a writ of habeas corpus the respondent alleges the relationship, and asserts his right to the possession and custody of his child. It is admitted that the respondent is the father of the child, and it is common ground that unless he has surrendered his rights or forfeited the same, he is entitled to the custody.\nThe Superior Court maintained the writ of habeas corpus, holding that the right of a father to the custody of his minor child was absolute and that, upon the evidence, this right had not been destroyed or obliterated by the father\u2019s conduct, character, mode of life, temperament or circumstances. That judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for the respondent, no counsel having appeared for the appellant, reserved judgment, and at a subsequent date, delivered an oral judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCohen & Gameroff for the appellant.\nM.

Afterwards the Southern Alberta Lumber Company, as charterer, engaged the respondent to do the stevedoring work. Owing to the bankruptcy of the charterer before the respondent was paid, the latter sued, not the charterer who engaged it but the appellants who owned the ships, alleging agency. Clause 15 and addendum C of the charter-party read as follows: \"15. (Printed) Cargo to be stowed under the master's supervision and direction, and the stevedore to be employed by the steamer for loading and discharging, to be nominated by the charterers or their agents, at current rates. \" C \" (typewritten) In connection with clause 15, charterers agree to load and stow cargo for one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per thousand board feet or its equivalent, ***.\" The court of appeal construed the charter-party as constituting agency in fact.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1928] 1 W.W.R. 308), that, although clause 15 without the addendum may support actual agency, the stipulation in the addendum \" charterers to load and stow the cargo, etc.,\" excludes any actual agency of the charterer to engage a stevedore on behalf of the owners of the vessels and thus to render them liable to such stevedore for the cost of the loading and stowing of cargo.\nHeld, also, that, upon the evidence, there was no ostensible agency of the charterer entailing the same result. When actual authority of an alleged agent has been negatived, a plaintiff seeking to hold the alleged principal liable on the basis of ostensible authority either must shew a holding out by the principal of the alleged agent as such or must give proof of some custom on which ostensible agency can be predicated.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of McDonald J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's actions.\nThe appellants are companies incorporated in the United States of America. The appellant Robin Line Steamship Company, Inc., is the owner of the steamships Robin Goodfellow and Robin Gray, and the appellant Seas Shipping Company, Inc., is the owner of the steamships Robin Adair and Robin Hood. These four ships, together with others, are known as the Isthmian Lines. The respondent is a stevedoring company carrying on business in Vancouver, B.C. This is an appeal by the two appellants from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing two consolidated appeals by the appellants from judgments against them in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for payment for stevedoring work performed by the respondent in British Columbia on three of the above ships, namely the Robin Goodfellow, the Robin Gray and the Robin Adair. The work was ordered by the charterer of the ships, the Southern Alberta Lumber Company, Limited, purporting to act on behalf of the appellants. The charter-party is the only document in writing. There was no communication oral or written between the parties to this action. The difficulty arose through the bankruptcy of the charterer before the respondent company was paid.\nA. R. Holden K.C. for the appellants.\nG. B. Duncan for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent), a stevedoring company, has recovered judgment against the appellants as owners of several steamships for the cost of loading and stowing cargo at Vancouver. The vessels were chartered to the Southern Alberta Lumber Company by what is known as a \"space charter.\" The provincial courts con- strued this charter as constituting the charterer agent for the appellants and authorizing it as such to bind the appellants by a contract, which, it is said, it purported to make on their behalf with the stevedoring company. The latter supports the judgment in its favour on this ground of actual agency, and, should that fail, maintains that under the circumstances there was an ostensible agency of the charterer entailing the same result.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal (Macdonald C.J.A., Galliher and McPhillips JJ.A.), affirming the trial judge, construed this charter as constituting agency in fact of the charterer. Martin and Macdonald JJ.A., dissenting, held that the charterer expressly excluded actual agency, and that ostensible agency of the charterer had not been established.\nMaterial clauses of the charter read as follows:\n13. Steamer to pay all port charges, harbour dues and other customary charges and expenses in loading and discharging cargo.\n15. Cargo to be stowed under the master's supervision and direction, and the stevedore to be employed by the steamer for loading and discharging, to be nominated by the charterers or their agents, at current rates.\nAddendum C. In connection with clause 15, charterers agree to load and stow cargo for one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per thousand board feet or its equivalent, and agree there will be no extra charges during customary working hours, unless detention is caused by break-down of machinery, winches, or other defects of the steamer. Charterers have the option of working overtime by paying all expenses in connection therewith, but if owners elect to have the steamer worked overtime, it is understood this will be subject to charterers' approval and all expenses in this case to be for owner's account.\n32. Steamer to be consigned at ports or places of loading to charterers' agents, steamer paying the customary agency fees, not to exceed $100 total for all loading ports, and at ports of discharge to owners or their agents, by whom steamer is to be reported and entered at Custom House.\nClauses 13, 15 and 32 are in the printed form of the charter party which is used. Addendum C is inserted in typewriting.\nIt was common ground at bar that clause 15 and addendum C must, if possible, be read together and effect given to both, but that, if they are in irreconcilable conflict, the terms of the addendum will prevail so far as may be necessary to give them full operation. Counsel also agreed that clause 15, unaffected by the addendum, would support the actual agency found below. While the principles of construction on which these conclusions rest are indubitable, with the utmost respect we are unable to agree in the view taken by the learned appellate judges who upheld the judgment of the trial judge as to the effect of clause 15 read with the addendum. That view ignores the positive and unqualified words of the addendum:\nCharterers agree to load and stow the cargo for one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per thousand board feet or its equivalent.\nEither this was a \" nomination\" of the charterer as stevedore for loading within the terms of clause 15, and a substitution (for that service) of the fixed loading price of $1.70 per 1,000 M for the current rates mentioned in clause 15, or, if that view should be untenable, would amount to a supersession of clause 15 so far as that clause standing alone might constitute the charterer agent of the owners to \"nominate\" a stevedore to load cargo at current prices. Any other construction of the addendum fails to give effect to the express provision: \" Charterers to load and stow the cargo.\" We agree with the view expressed by Macdonald J.A., that this stipulation excludes any actual agency of the charterer to engage a stevedore on behalf of the owners and thus to render them liable to such stevedore for the cost of the loading and stowing of cargo at $1.70 per 1,000 M.\nThere remains the question of the ostensible agency of the charterer to bind the appellant by a contract with the stevedore (respondent).\nCounsel for the respondent presented a double-barrelled argument on this part of the case:\nFirst, he contended, there was an actual general agency created by clause 32 and the limitation of that agency by the addendum C being unknown to the respondent it had the right to rely on such general agency. But to sustain a claim by virtue of such general agency the respondent must have known of clause 32. If he did, he also had knowledge of the limitation of any authority conferred by clause 32 contained in the same instrument. He, however, denies knowledge of both clause 32 and the addendum C. He cannot, therefore, rely upon clause 32 of which he had no knowledge.\nSecond, counsel for the respondent contended that at common law the duty of loading rests on the shipowner and that, in the absence of knowledge of any stipulation that that duty had been undertaken by the charterer, a third party, such as the stevedore, dealing with the charterer is entitled to assume that the common law duty remains unchanged and to rely upon the representation of the charterer, whom he finds in actual control of the ship for loading purposes, that he is the agent of the owner to make contracts for such loading. But the common law only imposes the duty of loading on the owner \"in the absence of custom or agreement to the contrary.\" Blakie et al v. Stembridge[3]. Here the stevedoring company knew that the ships were under charter and, as pointed out by Macdonald J.A.:\nparts of it (the charter) were read to its manager and he was at liberty to read it all.\nThe stevedoring company must be taken to have known that it was quite usual for charter parties to make special provisions in regard to stevedoring and liability therefor. If its manager did not take the trouble to inform himself in the present case of what these arrangements were, he cannot rely upon his neglect to do so to induce the court to hold that there was an ostensible authority in the charterer (which had itself undertaken the stevedoring work) to contract for the owner becoming liable directly to the stevedoring company, which was in reality the charterer's sub-contractor. As Lord Watson said in Baumwoll Manufacturer v. Furness[4]:\nI know of no principle or authority which requires that notice must be given when an owner parts, even temporarily, with the possession and control of his ship in order to prevent the servant of the charterer from pledging his credit.\nIt had been there argued that the\nrespondent (owner) remains liable for contracts made by the charterers' agent with shippers who had no notice of the terms of the charter.\nBut, Lord Watson answered:\nFor that proposition no authority whatever was produced. All the decisions cited at bar, so far as they had any bearing upon such circumstances, appear to me to point very distinctly to the opposite direction.\nTrue that was a case of a \"demise\" of a ship, or what was treated as tantamount thereto and the question was as to agency of the master for the owner; but the general principle on which the non-liability of the owner was decided seems to be equally applicable to the case at bar. Here the owner had contracted with the charterer that the latter would do the stevedoring work and had given him such control of the ship as was requisite to enable him to do so. When actual authority of an alleged agent has been negatived a plaintiff seeking to hold the alleged principal liable on the basis of ostensible authority either must shew a holding out by the principal of the alleged agent as such, of which there is here no evidence, or must give proof of some custom on which ostensible agency can be predicated, which is here entirely lacking. There is no rule of law under which an implication of agency of the charterer for the shipowner, such as here suggested, arises from the mere existence of that relation.\nFor these reasons we are of the opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and judgment entered for the appellants-defendants dismissing these actions with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

Afterwards the Southern Alberta Lumber Company, as charterer, engaged the respondent to do the stevedoring work. Owing to the bankruptcy of the charterer before the respondent was paid, the latter sued, not the charterer who engaged it but the appellants who owned the ships, alleging agency. Clause 15 and addendum C of the charter-party read as follows: \u201c15. (Printed) Cargo to be stowed under the master\u2019s supervision and direction, and the stevedore to be employed by the steamer for loading and discharging, to be nominated by the charterers or their agents, at current rates. \u201cC\u201d (typewritten) In connection with clause 15, charterers agree to load and stow cargo for one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per thousand board feet or its equivalent, * * *.\u201d The court of appeal construed the charter-party as constituting agency in fact.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1928] 1 W.W.R. 308), that, although clause 15 without the addendum may support actual agency, the stipulation in the addendum \u201ccharterers to load and stow the cargo, etc.,\u201d excludes any actual agency of the charterer to engage a stevedore on behalf of the owners of the vessels and thus to render them liable to such stevedore for the cost of the loading and stowing of cargo.\nHeld, also, that, upon the evidence, there was no ostensible agency of the charterer entailing the same result. When actual authority of an alleged agent has been negatived, a plaintiff seeking to hold the alleged principal liable on the basis of ostensible authority either must shew a holding out by the principal of the alleged agent as such or must give proof of some custom on which ostensible agency can be predicated.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of McDonald J.[2] and maintaining the respondent\u2019s actions.\nThe appellants are companies incorporated in the United States of America. The appellant Robin Line Steamship Company, Inc., is the owner of the steamships Robin Good-fellow and Robin Gray, and the appellant Seas Shipping Company, Inc., is the owner of the steamships Robin Adair and Robin Hood. These four ships, together with others, are known as the Isthmian Lines. The respondent is a stevedoring company carrying on business in Vancouver, B.C. This is an appeal by the two appellants from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing two consolidated appeals by the appellants from judgments against them in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for payment for stevedoring work performed by the respondent in British Columbia on three of the above ships, namely the Robin Goodfellow, the Robin Gray and the Robin Adair. The work was ordered by the charterer of the ships, the Southern Alberta Lumber Company, Limited, purporting to act on behalf of the appellants. The charter-party is the only document in writing. There was no communication oral or written between the parties to this action. The difficulty arose through the bankruptcy of the charterer before the respondent company was paid.\nA. R. Holden K.C. for the appellants.\nG. B. Duncan for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent), a stevedoring company, has recovered judgment against the appellants as owners of several steamships for the cost of loading and stowing cargo at Vancouver. The vessels were chartered to the Southern Alberta Lumber Company by what is known as a \u201cspace charter.\u201d The provincial courts construed this charter as constituting the charterer agent for the appellants and authorizing it as such to bind the appellants by a contract, which, it is said, it purported to make on their behalf with the stevedoring company. The latter supports the judgment in its favour on this ground of actual agency, and, should that fail, maintains that under the circumstances there was an ostensible agency of the charterer entailing the same result.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal (Macdonald C.J.A., Galliher and McPhillips JJ.A.), affirming the trial judge, construed this charter as constituting agency in fact of the charterer. Martin and Macdonald JJ.A., dissenting, held that the charterer expressly excluded actual agency, and that ostensible agency of the charterer had not been established.\nMaterial clauses of the charter read as follows:\n13. Steamer to pay all port charges, harbour dues and other customary charges and expenses in loading and discharging cargo.\n15. Cargo to be stowed under the master\u2019s supervision and direction, and the stevedore to be employed by the steamer for loading and discharging, to be nominated by the charterers or their agents, at current rates.\nAddendum C. In connection with clause 15, charterers agree to load and stow cargo for one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per thousand board feet or its equivalent, and agree there will be no extra charges during customary working hours, unless detention is caused by break-down of machinery, winches, or other defects of the steamer. Charterers have the option of working overtime by paying all expenses in connection therewith, but if owners elect to have the steamer worked overtime, it is understood this will be subject to charterers\u2019 approval and all expenses in this case to be for owner\u2019s account.\n32. Steamer to be consigned at ports or places of loading to charterers\u2019 agents, steamer paying the customary agency fees, not to exceed $100\u2019 total for all loading ports, and at ports of discharge to owners or their agents, by whom steamer is to be reported and entered at Custom House.\nClauses 13, 15 and 32 are in the printed form of the charter party which is used. Addendum C is inserted in typewriting.\nIt was common ground at bar that clause 15 and addendum C must, if possible, be read together and effect given to both, but that, if they are in irreconcilable conflict, the terms of the addendum will prevail so far as may be necessary to give them full operation. Counsel also agreed that clause 15, unaffected by the addendum, would support the actual agency found below. While the principles of construction on which these conclusions rest are indubitable, with the utmost respect we are unable to agree in the view taken by the learned appellate judges who upheld the judgment of the trial judge as to the effect of clause 15 read with the addendum. That view ignores the positive and unqualified words of the addendum:\nCharterers agree to load and stow the cargo for one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per thousand board feet or its equivalent.\nEither this was a \u201cnomination\u201d of the charterer as stevedore for loading within the terms of clause 15, and a substitution (for that service) of the fixed loading price of $1.70 per 1,000 M for the current rates mentioned in clause 15, or, if that view should be untenable, would amount to a supersession of clause 15 so far as that clause standing alone might constitute the charterer agent of the owners to \u201cnominate\u201d a stevedore to load cargo at current prices. Any other construction of the addendum fails to give effect to the express provision: \u201cCharterers to load and stow the cargo.\u201d We agree with the view expressed by Macdonald J.A., that this stipulation excludes any actual agency of the charterer to engage a stevedore on behalf of the owners and thus to render them liable to such stevedore for the cost of the loading and stowing of cargo at $1.70 per 1,000 M.\nThere remains the question of the ostensible agency of the charterer to bind the appellant by a contract with the stevedore (respondent).\nCounsel for the respondent presented a double-barrelled argument on this part of the case:\nFirst, he contended, there was an actual general agency created by clause 32 and the limitation of that agency by the addendum C being unknown to the respondent it had the right to rely on such general agency. But to sustain a claim by virtue of such general agency the respondent must have known of clause 32. If he did, he also had knowledge of the limitation of any authority conferred by clause 32 contained in the same instrument. He, however, denies knowledge of both clause 32 and the addendum C. He cannot, therefore, rely upon clause 32 of which he had no knowledge.\nSecond, counsel for the respondent contended that at common law the duty of loading rests on the shipowner and that, in the absence of knowledge of any stipulation that that duty had been undertaken by the charterer, a third party, such as the stevedore, dealing with the charterer is entitled to assume that the common law duty remains unchanged and to rely upon the representation of the charterer, whom he finds in actual control of the ship for loading purposes, that he is the agent of the owner to make contracts for such loading. But the common law only imposes the duty of loading on the owner \u201cin the absence of custom or agreement to the contrary.\u201d Blakie et al v. Stembridge[3]. Here the stevedoring company knew that the ships were under charter and, as pointed out by Macdonald J.A.:\nparts of it (the charter) were read to its manager and he was at liberty to read it all.\nThe stevedoring company must be taken to have known that it was quite usual for charter parties to make special provisions in regard to stevedoring and liability therefor. If its manager did not take the trouble to inform himself in the present case of what these arrangements were, he cannot rely upon his neglect to do so to induce the court to hold that there was an ostensible authority in the charterer (which had itself undertaken the stevedoring work) to contract for the owner becoming liable directly to the stevedoring company, which was in reality the charterer\u2019s sub-contractor. As Lord Watson said in Baumwoll Manufacturer v. Furness[4]:\nI know of no principle or authority which requires that notice must be given when an owner parts, even temporarily, with the possession and control of his ship in order to prevent the servant of the charterer from pledging his credit.\nIt had been there argued that the\nrespondent (owner) remains liable for contracts made by the charterers\u2019 agent with shippers who had no notice of the terms of the charter.\nBut, Lord Watson answered:\nFor that proposition no authority whatever was produced. All the decisions cited at bar, so far as they had any bearing upon such circumstances, appear to me to point very distinctly to the opposite direction.\nTrue that was a case of a \u201cdemise\u201d of a ship, or what was treated as tantamount thereto and the question was as to agency of the master for the owner; but the general principle on which the non-liability of the owner was decided seems to be equally applicable to the case at bar. Here the owner had contracted with the charterer that the latter would do the stevedoring work and had given him such control of the ship as was requisite to enable him to do so. When actual authority of an alleged agent has been negatived a plaintiff seeking to hold the alleged principal liable on the basis of ostensible authority either must shew a holding out by the principal of the alleged agent as such, of which there is here no evidence, or must give proof of some custom on which ostensible agency can be predicated, which is here entirely lacking. There is no rule of law under which an implication of agency of the charterer for the shipowner, such as here suggested, arises from the mere existence of that relation.\nFor these reasons we are of the opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and judgment entered for the appellants-defendants dismissing these actions with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

The assignment, was to secure the payment of a bond issue. A bank in Seattle was by deed nominated to keep a record of the bonds which might be registered there and to retire them out of the moneys which should be paid into it from time to time by the payee of the instalments, the Granby Company. Matters went on smoothly for a time until the bank at the request or instigation of the appellant, diverted some of the said moneys to a purpose not authorized by the deed. On discovering this act the respondent, a holder of more than one-fourth of the said bonds, made a demand upon the trustee that it should notify the Granby Company of the assignment and require payment of the instalments in future to itself.\nThe order granted by the trial judge was held by the Court of Appeal to have been within his discretion and, therefore, one which should not be interfered with, since it was not based on an error in principle or made in the absence of materials affording ground for the exercise of the discretion.\nOn conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014We think the appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Section 39 of the Supreme Court Act limits the right of appeal to cases in which the amount or value of the matter in controversy exceeds the sum of $2,000. The question of the jurisdiction to entertain this appeal came before us on a motion to quash, and for the purpose of enabling the parties to provide further material, and in order that the court might be more fully informed as to the precise facts, the disposition of the motion was deferred until the hearing of the appeal.\nIt is now suggested by Mr. Griffin that there should be an adjournment to enable him to file an affidavit. I think, in the circumstances, that this is an indulgence which cannot be allowed. On the facts before us there is really nothing to show what (if any) pecuniary value attaches to that control of which the appellants have been deprived by the order of which they now complain. It seems to be precisely one of those cases which the statute provides for by giving an appeal only upon condition that special leave shall be obtained.\nHowever we think it right to say\u2014after consultation with my colleagues\u2014that, having had an opportunity to consider the questions at issue since the close of Mr. Griffin's argument, we are all quite clearly of the opinion that the appeal could not succeed on the merits. We think it right to say that, in the circumstances. We think that the appeal should be dismissed on the point of jurisdiction, because we are quite clear, on the material before us, that there is no jurisdiction. We are equally clear, if we did not deal with the appeal on that ground, that we should be obliged to dismiss it on the merits.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nMartin Griffin for the appellant.\nW. D.

Application granted.\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the application.\nBoisvert contra.\nLamont J.\u2014One of the questions of public interest which, the appellant contends, is involved in this appeal is: Whether the law of the province of Quebec which declares (with certain exceptions not material here) that no transfer of shares in a company shall have any effect until it is registered in the transfer register of the company (art. 6003 of Companies Act) is applicable in bankruptcy proceedings so as to deprive a creditor, who, for valuable consideration, holds an unregistered transfer of shares, of the benefit of that security.\nIf this question is involved in the appeal, leave to appeal, in my opinion, should be granted. The court, however, from which leave to appeal is sought did not base its judgment upon that point. By a majority of three to two the court held that at the time the transfer in question was taken (six years before the debtor became a bankrupt) the debtor was in insolvent circumstances, and was so to the knowledge of the creditor Donohue, who held the unregistered transfer.\nThe debtor\u2019s insolvency, and Donohue\u2019s knowledge thereof are questions of fact, and if the finding of fact be upheld the question of law above mentioned would not come before this court for determination.\nThe trial judge held that the assignments appeared to have been made in good faith for adequate valuable consideration, and that they were not void under any of the sections of the Bankruptcy Act. He also held that Donohue had not abandoned his rights in the Russian bonds under the terms of the writing of December 29, 1920; that the assignment of the shares in the Montcalm Land Company was valid as between the parties without registration, and that even if it were true that Belleau (debtor) was not solvent when the assignments were made, his insolvency was not notorious nor known to Donohue and that the transactions between them appeared to be transactions in the ordinary course of business which created no assumption of guilty knowledge by Donohue.\nWith the trial judge\u2019s finding that Donohue had no knowledge of the debtor\u2019s insolvency, two judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench agreed. The other three were of opinion that the circumstances raised a presumption of such knowledge on the part of Donohue.\nWhere a trial judge who has seen and heard both the debtor and the creditor finds as a fact that the creditor at the time of the transfer had no knowledge of the debtor\u2019s insolvency, the circumstances, to justify a presumption of knowledge sufficient to overcome that finding, must, in my opinion, be strong and conclusive. Being in doubt as to the sufficiency of the circumstances in this case to overcome the finding, and believing the point first above mentioned may possibly come before the court for determination if the appellants are allowed to proceed with their appeal, leave to appeal will be granted.\nApplication granted.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St.-Laurent, Gagne, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Galipault, Lapoint\u00e9 & Boisvert.\n"}

The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nThe patent in question was for alleged improvements in a barking drum used for stripping logs in the making of pulp, the improvements consisting of devices for effecting the required tumbling action, constructed in such a way as to avoid the brooming or splintering of the ends of the logs which is liable to occur when tumbling devices of the usual character are employed. The judgment of the Court dismissing the appeal was delivered by Duff J. After referring to the appellants\u2019 claims in support of the patent, he said:\n\u201cThe sole question on the appeal concerns the validity of the appellant\u2019s patent; and that reduces itself to the question, which is a question, of fact: Have the respondents established the proposition on which their case in the court below was rested that the subject matter of the appellant\u2019s patent does not disclose invention?\u201d\nHe then discussed the subject of the patent, and the claims in regard to it, and discussed a number of earlier patents obtained by others, and concluded as follows:\n\u201c* * * It does not seem to be seriously doubtful that Alfsen, Ross, Hussey and Paulson had all conceived and disclosed the idea of a rigid drum composed, in its longitudinal elements, of iron bars so arranged as to lift the pieces of wood, tumble them over one another in such a way as to remove the bark without seriously injuring the wood; nor does it appear to be doubtful that both Ross and Hussey definitely conceived and disclosed the idea of inwardly projecting parts, or that Ross conceived the notion of rounding the projections in order to avoid the brooming and splintering of the logs. Furthermore, in both the Wertheim and the Ehrler patents, the use of the U bar is suggested and disclosed for purposes which, if not in all respects identical with the purposes sought to be obtained by the appellant, were so analogous as to make it impossible to ascribe to his adoption or adaptation of the idea, the character of patentable invention. Nor can it be disputed that Paulson effectively embodied his ideas in a barking machine, which has had a considerable degree of commercial success.\n\u201cMr. Anglin, in his elaborate argument, urged upon us, properly enough, the degree of commercial success which had been achieved by Guettler\u2019s drum. Commercial success may be due to many factors, and the learned trial judge was not satisfied that Guettler\u2019s drum is more efficient than Paulson\u2019s. The evidence of commercial success cannot afford a basis for refusing to give effect to the conclusion necessitated, I think, by the recital itself of the facts already mentioned, that Guettler\u2019s improvements were not of such a character as to imply invention in the pertinent sense.\n\u201cThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nA.

(R.S.M. 1913, c. 116), s. 24 (1)\u2014Application of s. 24 (1) in favour of person who joined with mortgagor in personal covenant\u2014Surety\u2014Mortgaged land situate outside of province.\nThe limitation of ten years imposed by s. 24 (1) of the Manitoba Real Property Limitation Act (R.S.M. 1913, c. 116) to an action to recover money secured by mortgage applies to the personal remedy on the covenant in the mortgage deed as well as to the remedy against the land (Sutton v. Sutton, 22 Ch. D. 511, followed); and it applies in favour of a person, not a surety, who has joined with the mortgagor in the personal covenant; (Quaere, whether or not it applies to the personal obligation entered into by a surety for the mortgagor. In the case in question it was held that, on construction of the mortgage agreement, the defendant had not entered into it as a surety but had assumed a personal obligation to the mortgagee to repay the loan); and it applies whether the land charged be within the province of Manitoba or elsewhere.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba (37 Man. R. 215) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[1] affirming the judgment Curran J.[2] dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action to recover from the defendant the amount alleged to be owing under a mortgage agreement. The material facts of the case and the questions for consideration by the Court are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nA. C. McMaster K.C. for the appellant.\nC. K. Guild for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, which affirmed (Trueman J.A., dissenting) the judgment at the trial of the late Mr. Justice Curran. The litigation arose out of the following circumstances:\nOn May 9, 1911, at Sedley, Saskatchewan, The Sedley Rink Company, Limited, and Harry Marsden Paine, John 0. Scott, John F. MacDonald and the respondent Martin entered into a mortgage agreement with the appellant in consideration of a loan by it to them of $1,000, payable by instalments, with interest at 8\u00bd per cent. per annum. This mortgage is, I take it, in the usual form under the Saskatchewan Land Titles Act, and one of the questions is whether Paine, Scott, MacDonald and the respondent became parties to the mortgage as sureties for the Rink Company, or as principals with the latter. They were interested in the Rink Company, and no doubt it was considered more prudent to have them join in the mortgage.\nThe respondent Martin, at that time, resided in Sedley, but a year or so afterwards he removed to Grenfell, Saskatchewan. He joined the Canadian expeditionary forces shortly after the outbreak of the late war and was on active service in France. He was demobilized in 1919 at Edmonton, Alberta, where his family then resided. He subsequently moved to Dauphin, Manitoba, and when this action was brought resided in Winnipeg.\nIt appears that after the mortgage agreement some payments were made on account of instalments of principal and interest. The appellant obtained a final order of foreclosure in 1917, and caused itself to be registered as owner of the lands. Proceedings to collect the mortgage debt were unsuccessfully taken in Saskatchewan in 1919, but although the respondent, as well as Paine, Scott and Mac-Donald, were made defendants, their names were struck out for the reason, it is stated, that they were then protected by the moratorium legislation of Saskatchewan. In August, 1918, the rink building was destroyed by a cyclone and the appellant caused the ruins to be sold at public auction, the highest price obtainable being some $215, out of which the expenses of the sale had to be paid.\nThe present action was brought in Manitoba on the 13th of December, 1924. The amount claimed is $2,244.04, alleged to be the balance due for principal and interest on the mortgage, and the action is directed solely against the respondent, who is alleged to have signed the mortgage as a surety. The appellant avers that the principal debtor (meaning the Rink Company) defaulted on the 15th of December, 1914; the trial judge found that the default was on the 15th of November of that year.\nThe principal defence\u2014in fact the one considered and given effect to in the courts below\u2014is that the appellant\u2019s remedy against Martin is now barred by reason of the limitation period, ten years, under s. 24 of the Manitoba Real Property Limitation Act (R.S.M., 1913, c. 116, which originated in R.S.M. 1892, c. 89, and was subsequently re-enacted several times), having expired before this action was brought.\nAt the trial the appellant attempted to prove a part payment within the limitation period, to wit a payment alleged to have been received by it on December 15, 1914. An unsigned letter, with addressed envelope, purporting to have been sent to the appellant by its local agent at Selden, one John Auchmuty, was tendered in evidence. This letter, dated December 11, 1914, stated that a draft was enclosed for $80.50, being payment of principal due November 15 on loan no. 1038 on the Sedley Rink, and interest to date.\nThe letter with the draft was received apparently by the appellant on December 15, but so far as it could be evidence of a part payment on account of the mortgage loan, it would show a payment made to the appellant\u2019s agent not later than the 11th of December, and therefore outside of the limitation period. John Auchmuty was not called at the trial, it was said that he had returned to Scotland, and there was no evidence showing from whom he received the money which he sent to his principals. The admissibility, to defeat the operation of the Statute of Limitations, of evidence of a part payment of that character, which emanates from the creditor or his agent, is very doubtful (Lightwood, Time Limit on Actions, p. 379). Here, however, it would not prove a payment within the limitation period and is therefore of no assistance to the appellant. Nor\u2014unless it were established by competent evidence that on the 11th of December, 1914, everything that had fallen due under the mortgage agreement had been paid by the debtor\u2014could it be said that the right to demand payment of money under the mortgage did not accrue to the appellant until the next instalment became due on the 15th of May, 1915, and that the limitation period started only then. The appellant makes no such contention here; it sought at the trial merely to prove a part payment within the limitation period, and in that it failed.\nThis brings me to consider the respondent\u2019s plea that the appellant\u2019s remedy against him under the personal covenant in the mortgage agreement is barred by reason of s. 24 of the Manitoba Real Property Limitation Act. This section\u2014and, if it applies, no other provision of the Statute of Limitations need be looked at\u2014is in the following terms:\n24. No action or suit or other proceeding shall be brought to recover any sum of money secured by any mortgage, judgment or lien, or otherwise charged upon or payable out of any land or rent, at law or in equity, or any legacy, but within ten years next after the present right to receive the same accrued to some person capable of giving a discharge for or release of the same, unless in the meantime some part of the principal money or some interest thereon has been paid, or some acknowledgment of the right thereon has been given in writing signed by the person by whom the same is payable or his agent, to the person entitled thereto or his agent; and in such case no action, suit or proceeding shall be brought, but within ten years after such payment or acknowledgment, or the last of such payments or acknowledgments if more than one, was made or given.\nSection 24 is taken from section 8 of the Imperial Real Property Limitation Act, 37-38 Vict. (1874) c. 57, (a re-enactment of section 40 of 3 & 4 Will. IV, c. 27 (1833), with a change of the prescriptive period), the language of which is in substance the same, except that the limitation period is twelve years under the Imperial statute and ten years under the Manitoba enactment.\nThe appellant meets the argument based on s. 24 by three contentions:\n1. The respondent signed the mortgage agreement as a surety for the Sedley Rink Company, and even if s. 24 applies to the personal covenant of the mortgagor, it cannot be extended to the personal obligation entered into by a surety for the mortgagor;\n2. Section 24, which enacts that no action or suit or other proceeding shall be brought to recover money secured by a mortgage charged upon or payable out of any land but within ten years after the present right to receive the same has accrued,\u2014applies only to claims for money secured by a mortgage charged upon or payable out of land in Manitoba, and therefore, inasmuch as land in Saskatchewan was here charged, s. 24 does not defeat the appellant\u2019s action;\n3. Even assuming that s. 24 could be applied to an action brought in Manitoba to recover money secured by a mortgage charged on land outside of Manitoba, it would not avail against an action brought against a person, other than the mortgagor, who in the mortgage agreement assumed liability for the payment of the mortgage debt, even although such person were not a surety for the mortgagor.\nThe first contention involves the construction of the mortgage agreement, and both courts have held that the respondent Martin did not enter into the agreement as a surety for the Sedley Rink Company, but assumed a primary and not an accessory obligation.\nThe appellant, in its statement of claim, treated the respondent as having been a surety for the Rink Company, and it now relies on the fact that the respondent (who had denied signing the agreement as surety or otherwise) in several paragraphs of his plea, containing, it is true, alternative contentions, expressly stated that if he had signed the agreement it was as a surety; This, however, inasmuch as it involves the construction of the instrument, is a question of law, and the courts below did not consider that the contention thus alternatively made in the respondent\u2019s plea precluded them from giving to the mortgage agreement its proper interpretation. This agreement is not as clear as it might have been made. It is on a printed form of the appellant, and it begins by this statement:\nWe, the Sedley Rink Company, Limited, whose office is at the Village of Sedley, in the Province of Saskatchewan (hereinafter called the mortgagor), being registered as owner of an estate in fee simple in possession ... in all that piece of land described as follows:\u2014[description of three lots in the Village of Sedley.]\nand\nHarry Marsden Paine, merchant; John O. Scott, merchant; John F. MacDonald, merchant; and Harry James Martin, agent, all of Sedley aforesaid,\nIn consideration of the sum of one thousand dollars lent to us by the Colonial Investment and Loan Company (who and whose successors and assigns are hereinafter included in the expression \u201cthe mortgagees\u201d), the receipt of which sum we do hereby acknowledge, covenant jointly and severally with the said mortgagees.\nFirstly: That we will pay to them, the said mortgagees, the said principal money and interest thereon at; 8\u00bd per cent. per annum, as follows:\u2014\nFifty dollars on the 15th day of November, 1911.\nFifty dollars on the 15th days of May and November in each of the years 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1915, and the balance of the said principal sum $550 shall become due and payable on the 15th day of May, A.D. 1916 * * *.\nThere is an acceleration clause providing that on default of payment of any portion of the moneys hereby secured, the whole of the moneys shall become due and payable.\nAt the end of the agreement there is the following clause:\nAnd for better securing to the said mortgagees the payment in manner aforesaid of the instalments hereinbefore provided for, and other charges and moneys hereby secured we hereby mortgage to the said mortgagees all our estate and interest in the lands above described.\nIn so far as the appellant is concerned\u2014whatever may have been the relations of the parties inter se\u2014it is impossible to construe the clauses which I have cited otherwise than as having created, on the part of the Sedley Rink Company, Limited, and of Messrs. Paine, Scott, MacDonald and the respondent, a personal obligation as principals to pay the money loaned, which is expressly stated to have been loaned to them. There is nothing to prevent several persons entering into a contract of loan as borrowers, one of whom gives a mortgage on his land to secure repayment of the loan. On the construction of the deed, I can discover naught that shows that it is anything else than what is expressly stated, i.e., a principal as well as a joint and several obligation assumed by the borrowers to repay the loan. The appellant\u2019s insistence that the respondent was merely a surety is prompted by its hope that it can thus exclude the application of s. 24. It relies on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in In re Powers; Lindsell v. Phillips[3], which, however, is an entirely different case. There a bond, separate from the mortgage agreement, had been given by third parties to secure in part the payment of the mortgage debt, and it was held that a claim on the bond did not come within section 8 of the English Real Property Limitation Act.\nFour years later the same court decided the case of In re Frisby; Allison v. Frisby[4]. In that case, the action was against a surety, who had joined with the mortgagor in covenanting to pay the mortgage debt, and the trial judge, Kay J., and Bowen L.J., in the Court of Appeal, were of the opinion that section 8 does not apply to an action on the covenant in a mortgage unless brought against the mortgagor or his representatives. Cotton L.J., expressed the contrary view, and Fry L.J., stated that he gave no opinion whether section 8 applies to an action against a surety. The ground of the decision was, however, that payment of interest by the mortgagor had prevented the statute from running in favour of the surety.\nI cannot think that the appellant gets much assistance from these two cases. In both of them Sutton v. Sutton[5], with which I will presently deal, is referred to, but distinguished as not being in point.\nHowever, the first contention of the appellant being predicated on the assumption that the respondent was a surety, whereas I find he was a principal, it is unnecessary to discuss further these two decisions, or to express any opinion on the question with which they deal.\nThe second and third contentions of the appellant may be taken together. They are that, in an action brought in Manitoba, s. 24 should be restricted to claims for money secured by a mortgage charged upon or payable out of land in Manitoba, and that, at all events, s. 24 cannot be applied to defeat an action brought, under the mortgage agreement, against a person other than the mortgagor. The appellant goes even further and asserts that an action against the mortgagor on the personal covenant does not come within s. 24.\nThe courts below decided this question against the appellant on the authority of the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in Sutton v. Sutton[6]. It was there held that the limitation of twelve years (in Manitoba ten years) imposed by the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874, s. 8, to actions and suits for the recovery of money charged on land, applies to the personal remedy on the covenant in a mortgage deed as well as to the remedy against the land. The question there arose on a demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea which had set up the statute to defeat an action by the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s covenant in the mortgage deed.\nSutton v. Sutton6 is cited in the two other cases which I have already referred to, and has always been considered in England as of binding authority. It was mentioned with approval in In re England; Steward v. England[7]; distinguished, but considered binding, in Barnes v. Glenton[8]; referred to in London and Midland Bank v. Mitchell[9]; followed in Kirkland v. Peatfield[10]; and applied in In re Turner; Klaftenberger v. Groombridge[11].\nIn Ontario, four years before Sutton v. Sutton[12] was decided, the Ontario Court of Appeal in Allan v. McTavish[13], had held that s. 11 of 38 Vict., c. 16 (Ontario), similar to s. 24 of the Manitoba statute, did not apply to an action on a covenant in a mortgage for the payment of the mortgage money. In his factum the respondent states, and I assume correctly, that Allan v. McTavish8, was consistently followed in Ontario down to 1894, when the period for recovery on specialty contracts was cut down to ten years. In Ontario, by c. 34 of the Statutes of 1910 (10 Edw. VII), s. 24, subs. 1, it is enacted that no action shall be brought to recover out of any land or rent any sum of money secured by any mortgage charged upon or payable out of such land but within ten years after the right to receive the same has accrued. However, inasmuch as by s. 49, subs. k, of the same statute, the limitation period is ten years in an action upon a covenant contained in an indenture of mortgage made after the 1st of July, 1894, the question with which we are concerned can no longer arise in Ontario, the prescription being the same in both cases.\nIn Manitoba, Sutton v. Sutton[14] appears to have been followed. See Lowery v. Lamont[15], and also Wilson v. Graham[16], where the decision of Dubuc C.J., based on Sutton v. Sutton14, was reversed, but on another point.\nI recognize the authority of Sutton v. Sutton14 with respect to the construction of an enactment such as the one here in question, which is derived from Imperial legislation. It certainly does no violence to the terms of the section.\nSutton v. Sutton14 was the case of an action against the mortgagor on his personal covenant. I think, however, the same rule can be applied to the liability of a person, not a surety, who joins with the mortgagor in the personal covenant. And if we must admit that an action against the Rink Company, the mortgagor, on this very covenant, would be barred after ten years, I can discover no reason why a claim against the respondent, who bound himself with the Rink Company in the same terms, and jointly and severally, should last and be enforceable for a longer period.\nBut the appellant contends that when s. 24 speaks of money secured by a mortgage charged upon or payable out of any land, it must be taken to refer to land in Manitoba. If this reading of the statute be correct, then an action in Manitoba, on a covenant in a mortgage, would be subject to a different and shorter term of prescription, if the mortgaged land is in the province than if it were elsewhere. No doubt, when the legislature of a province enacts a statute concerning land, it should be assumed, as a general rule, that land within the territorial limits of the province alone is affected by the legislation. It may nevertheless be observed that this statute deals principally with the limitation of suits and actions, and, being a rule of procedure, it applies to all suits and actions in the Manitoba courts, no matter where the right of action accrued. And the respondent relies here on an express decision of the late Chief Justice Dubuc (then Mr. Justice Dubuc), in 1892, which he states has never been questioned in Manitoba: McLenaghan v. Hetherington[17], where that learned judge held that s. 24 applies, whether the land charged be within the province or elsewhere. Section 24 has been re-enacted in the same terms in the different consolidations of Manitoba statutes (see R.S.M., 1902, c. 100, s. 24; R.S.M., 1913, c. 116, s. 24, subs. 1), and the construction placed on it in McLenaghan v. Hetherington17, the respondent contends with much plausibility, has been tacitly accepted by the Legislature.\nIn his dissenting judgment in the court below, Mr. Justice Trueman refers to the expression \u201cjudgment\u201d in s. 24, which is placed in collocation with, and between the words \u201cmortgage\u201d and \u201clien.\u201d The \u201cjudgment\u201d within s. 24, he argues, is a judgment recovered in Manitoba. It is unnecessary to express any opinion on this point, but I may perhaps be permitted to say, with respect, that the authorities cited by the learned judge in support of his proposition\u2014such as Hebblethwaite v. Peever[18]; Jay v. Johnstone[19]; and Blanchard v. Muir[20], which followed the first two cases,\u2014are rather to the effect that the word \u201cjudgment\u201d comprises judgments generally, and not merely those which operate as charges on land.\nThe learned judge also refers to what he terms the subsequent history of Sutton v. Sutton[21], as related by Chitty J., in In re Turner; Turner v. Spencer[22]. This, of course, as Chitty J., himself observed, does not affect the authority of the decision of the Court of Appeal.\nI cannot say that this case is free from difficulty, but on consideration of all the contentions\u2014and I have mentioned only those which in my opinion really matter\u2014I would not feel justified in disturbing the judgments of the experienced judges who have decided the case in the two courts below. If it is thought that their judgments misconstrue s. 24, it will be a matter for the consideration of the Legislature; but in my view that construction is a reasonable one. In its factum, among its reasons of appeal, the appellant takes the ground that in view of the moratorium legislation of Saskatchewan, and also of that of Manitoba, the limitation period under s. 24 was suspended. This point, however, was not pressed at the argument, nor is it mentioned in the judgments either of the majority or of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal. No moratorium legislation in Saskatchewan could operate as a stay of proceedings in an action brought in Manitoba, and no moratorium legislation of the province of Manitoba has been specially referred to. I do not therefore feel called upon to discuss the effect or operation in a proper case of legislation of this character.\nAt the hearing, the appellant made a motion for leave to introduce additional evidence which, it was argued, would show that the respondent obligated himself as a surety and not as a principal. The evidence tendered consists in: 1. An application for the loan by the Sedley Rink Company, Limited; 2. What purports to be a resolution of the Rink Company for the borrowing of $1,000; 3. A statement in the affidavit of the secretary-treasurer of the appellant that the appellant\u2019s inspector, Mr. Campbell, recommended the loan \u201cif guaranteed by the four individual guarantors.\u201d\nI am of opinion that evidence of that character could not prevail against the instrument signed by the parties, which must be construed according to its terms.\nThe motion therefore should be rejected with costs.\nOn the whole, I am of the opinion that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chapman & Thornton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Scarth, Guild & Thorson.\n[1] 37 Man.

Osborn (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1928: March 5, 6; 1928: April 24.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Construction\u2014Findings as to\u2014Estoppel\u2014Pledge of bonds\u2014Dispute as to purpose and conditions of pledge\u2014Effect on rights of present litigants of findings in other proceedings\u2014Parties.\nPlaintiffs sued for the return of certain bonds or their value, alleging that they had been pledged to defendant by plaintiff O. as collateral security for payment of moneys secured by a mortgage from I.T. Co. to defendant, and, by agreement, were to be returned on the mortgage debt being reduced to $31,000, and that the mortgage had been paid, or reduced to an amount less than $31,000. Defendant contended that the advance made when the bonds were pledged formed no part of the mortgage indebtedness but was an independent advance on pledge of the bonds, and that it was entitled to realize the amount of that advance by sale of the bonds. In certain mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings against I.T. Co. (the mortgagor), to which defendant was made a party, but to which O. was not a party, although as president of I.T. Co. he was cognizant of them, it had been held that the said advance was not made on the mortgage as part of the money secured thereby, but was an independent advance on the bonds.\nHeld, that the view taken in the courts below (25 Ont. W.N. 43; 29 Ont. W.N. 185) that the bonds were pledged by O. as collateral security upon an additional advance on the mortgage, and that O. was in respect thereof entitled to the rights of a surety, had not been successfully impugned; that the evidence disclosed that, with defendant\u2019s concurrence, the mortgaged land was subsequently sold for a sum more than sufficient to pay off the mortgage and all other claims entitled to priority over it; that defendant had agreed to return the bonds on the loan secured by the mortgage being reduced to $31,000, and it had been so reduced within the meaning of the agreement; that, as a result of above facts, as found, O. became entitled to return of the bonds, and defendant, who had since disposed of them, was accountable for their value. Held, further, that O. was not estopped by reason of said holding in the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings from asserting that the advance was secured by the mortgage; he was not a party to those proceedings, he was present at them only as a representative of I.T. Co. (In re Deeley\u2019s Patent, [1895] 1 Ch. 687, referred to); neither personally nor as president of I.T. Co. did he derive any benefit from the judgment therein (cases such as In re Lart [1896] 2 Ch. 788, held inapplicable; Leicester & Co. v. Cherryman [1907] 2 K.B. 101, at p. 103, referred to); on the facts established, defendant was not misled to its prejudice by any conduct of O.; if O. as a person entitled to redeem the mortgage had a status to intervene, it did not follow that he was obliged to do so; if defendant desired to hold him bound by anything determined in those proceedings it should have taken steps to have him made a party.\nHeld, further, that, although the plaintiffs other than O., who claimed as owners of the bonds, had no independent right of action against defendant, and could claim only through O., yet, as O. was consenting, the fact of the judgment having been entered for his co-plaintiffs afforded no ground for objection.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (29 Ont. W.N. 185), affirming Judgment of Mulock C.J. Ex. (25 Ont. W.N. 43), affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Mulock C.J. Ex.[2], in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action was to recover bearer bonds of the Dominion of Canada, of the par value of $10,000, and accumulated interest thereon, or the value thereof.\nThe plaintiff Frank E. Osborn was president of Independent Theatres of Ontario Ltd., which, for the purpose of raising money necessary for the building of a theatre, executed a mortgage on its land to the defendant. The building was being erected for the theatres company by Schultz Bros. Co. Ltd., contractors. During the progress of the work, as the theatres company required more money for payment to the contractors, Osborn on its behalf applied to the defendant for a further advance, which the defendant refused, claiming that the mortgagor was not entitled to any advances beyond those already made. Negotiations followed, which resulted in Osborn placing the $10,000 of bonds in question with the defendant and the defendant advancing the sum of $10,000. The defendant gave a receipt for the bonds in the following terms:\n\u201cReceived from Mr. F. Osborn, ten thousand Dominsion of Canada bonds [describing them] as collateral security for further advance of ten thousand dollars for Independent Theatres Loan No. I.4. Said bonds to be returnable to Mr. F. Osborn on the loan being reduced to $31,000.00.\u201d\nIn subsequent mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings against the theatres company, to which the present defendant was made a party defendant, but to which none of the present plaintiffs were parties (Osborn, however, as president of the theatres company, being present and knowing what was going on), it was held that the said advance of $10,000 was not made on the mortgage as part of the money secured thereby, but was in fact an advance on the bonds independent of the mortgage.\nIn the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings a sale was effected of the property, and Schultz Bros. Co. Ltd., became the purchasers; and arrangements took place under which the defendant made a new loan on the security of a new mortgage on the property, this mortgage being executed by the Lyric Theatre Co. Ltd., a company formed for the purpose of taking over and operating the theatre. Schultz Bros. Co. Ltd., was a party to the mortgage, and therein covenanted with the mortgagee (the defendant) for payment of the moneys secured. Out of the new loan was deducted the amount owing to the defendant under the old mortgage (not including the $10,000 advanced at the time of deposit of the bonds), and the old mortgage was discharged. Schultz Bros. Co. Ltd., gave to the defendant a covenant of indemnity against any claim made against the defendant\u2019s title to the bonds now in question or its right to sell the same. The defendant sold the bonds and out of the proceeds paid off the $10,000 and interest upon it.\nThe plaintiffs then brought this action, claiming that the bonds in question had been deposited as collateral security for payment of the mortgage moneys, that the contract under which they were deposited provided that they were to be returned whenever the mortgage debt was reduced to $31,000, that the mortgage had been paid, or reduced to an amount less than $31,000, and claiming from the defendant a return of the bonds or payment of their value. It was alleged that the plaintiffs Sarah Osborn and Cecil A. Osborn were in truth the owners of the bonds, which had been used by the plaintiff Frank E. Osborn as aforesaid with their consent.\nThe defendant contended that the payment of $10,000 was the outcome of a separate and distinct negotiation, and formed no part of the mortgage indebtedness; that in any case it had by a subsequent agreement become an independent debt; that its contentions were established by the evidence taken as a whole, and particularly by reason of certain correspondence; that the plaintiffs Sarah Osborn and Cecil A. Osborn had no rights whatever as against it, there being no evidence that it had any knowledge of any interest on their part; that the plaintiff Frank E. Osborn was estopped (as were also the other plaintiffs, whose rights, if any, could not be higher or other than his) by the finding in the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings from enforcing now any claim to the bonds or their proceeds.\nAt the trial Mulock C.J. Ex., gave judgment for the plaintiffs[3], which was affirmed by the Appellate Division[4]. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nR.S. Cassels K.C. and G.A.P. Brickenden for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, New-combe and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The defendant, The London Loan & Savings Company of Canada, appeals from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario4, affirming the judgment of Mulock C.J. Ex., in favour of the plaintiffs3. The material facts sufficiently appear in these judgments.\nOn evidence which certainly supports that view, and probably admits of no other, the learned Chief Justice, who tried the action, found that the bonds in question had been pledged to the appellant Loan Company by Frank Osborn, one of the plaintiffs, as collateral security upon an addi- tional advance of $10,000 being made by it on a $50,000 mortgage which it held on the property of the Independent Theatres Company, and which then stood as security for $37,000 and some interest, and held that in respect of such bonds Osborn was in the position of and was entitled to the rights of a surety. That view, confirmed in the Appellate Division, has not been successfully impugned; and, subject to the question of estoppel, below adverted to, must form the basis of the disposal of the present appeal.\nThe evidence discloses that, with the concurrence of the appellant, the mortgaged property of the Theatres Company was subsequently sold for a sum considerably more than sufficient to pay off in full the appellant\u2019s mortgage and all other claims upon the property entitled to priority over it. As a result the plaintiff Frank Osborn became entitled to the return of the bonds, to recover which he sues, and, as they have since been disposed of by the appellant, wrongfully and without assent by him, that Company is accountable to him for their value.\nBut it is urged that Osborn is estopped from asserting that the $10,000 advance made by the appellant company when the bonds were pledged to it was secured by its mortgage on the Theatres Company\u2019s property, because, in certain mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings, to which the Theatres Company was a party, it was held that the $10,000 was advanced as an independent loan made to the Theatres Company by the appellant directly on the security of the bonds in question. Osborn was not a party to the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings; but he was cognizant of them as president and general manager of the Theatres Company.\nThe immediate effect of the judgment holding that the $10,000 was not advanced on the $50,000 mortgage security was that, to the extent of that advance, and interest thereon, the amount of money available for the building contractors, The Schultz Brothers Company, as lien-holders subject to the appellant\u2019s mortgage, was augmented. The Theatres Company gained nothing thereby, since it remained liable to the appellant for the $10,000 advanced by it when the bonds were pledged. The sale of the mortgaged premises was made under the judgment in the me- chanics\u2019 lien proceedings, but the disposition of the proceeds became the subject of an extra-curial agreement between the appellant Loan Company and the contractors, The Schultz Brothers Company. Before, or as a term of, assenting to that transaction being put through, by which its $50,000 mortgage was extinguished, the appellant obtained from The Schultz Brothers Company a bond and agreement indemnifying it against loss in the event of its being held liable to account for the bonds in question to the plaintiff Osborn.\nNo estoppel can be established as against Osborn because he was not a party to the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings. He was present at them only as a representative of the Theatres Company. In re Deeley\u2019s Patent[5]. Neither personally, nor as president and general manager of the Theatres Company, did Osborn derive any benefit from the judgment in the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings. Cases such as In re Lart[6], relied on by counsel for the appellant, are, therefore, inapplicable. The case at bar falls rather within the principle of the decision in Leicester & Co. v. Cherryman[7]. Under the circumstances above disclosed estoppel in pais would seem to be out of the question. The appellant company was not misled to its prejudice by anything Osborn did or refrained from doing. The indemnity which it took from The Schultz Brothers Company is conclusive on this aspect of the matter. It is, however, suggested that, as a person entitled to redeem the appellant\u2019s mortgage, Osborn had a status to intervene. But it does not follow that he was under an obligation to do so. The appellant was fully apprised of all the material facts. If it desired to hold Osborn bound by anything determined in the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings, it should have taken steps to have him made a party. On the other hand, whether or not the finding of the local judge, in the mechanics\u2019 lien proceedings, that the appellant had advanced the $10,000 not on the mortgage but as an independent loan to the Theatres Company, should be regarded as binding on Osborn, it certainly is so on the appellant. The result would be, as Mr. Justice Smith pointed out in the Divisional Court, that the appellant would have no right to hold the pledged bonds, since the debt for which they were pledged as collateral, i.e., a loan on the mortgage security, never came into existence.\nWe agree with the view, which prevailed in the trial court and on appeal, that the receipt given by the appellant for the bonds when they were pledged to it evidenced the terms of the pledge and that, within the meaning of that receipt, the loan secured by the $50,000 mortgage was reduced below $31,000\u2014it was, in fact, wholly extinguished. The bonds were, therefore, returnable to Mr. Osborn, the receipt providing for their return \u201con the loan being reduced to $31,000.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs Sarah Osborn and Cecil A. Osborn have no independent right of action against the appellant. They can claim only through Frank Osborn, and their right can in no event be higher than his. But, as he was consenting and approving, the fact of the judgment having been entered for his co-plaintiffs, his wife and infant son, affords the appellant no ground for objecting to it.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. concurred in the result.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: G.A.P.

In the absence of any restricting consideration, the right to operate a fish cannery for commercial purposes is a civil right in the province where the operation is carried on, like the right to operate a fruit or vegetable cannery; and the exercise of that right is not restricted or regulated by force of any enumerated Dominion power to which the above sections may be justifiably attributed.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014Under the provisions of the Special Fishery Regulations for the province of British Columbia (made by the Governor in Council under the authority of s. 45 of the Fisheries Act, 1914), respecting licenses to fish, viz: subs. 3 of s. 14; par. (a) or (b) of subs. 1 of s. 15, or par (a) of subs. 7 of s. 24, any British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, who is not otherwise legally disqualified, has the right to receive a license to fish or to operate a fish or salmon cannery in that province, if he submit a proper application and tender the prescribed fee. As to any person resident in the province of British Columbia, who is not a British subject, he is not eligible for a license of the character described in subs. 3 of s. 14, it being expressly declared by that subsection that \u201cno other than a British subject shall be eligible for such license.\u201d And none of the other licenses in question shall, as provided by par. (b) of subs. 1 of s. 15, be granted to any person, unless he \u201cis a British subject resident in the province, or is a returned soldier who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Navy or Army Overseas.\u201d\nPer Duff, Mignault and Smith JJ.\u2014The above sections of the Special Fishery Regulations are subject to the provisions of section 7 of the Fisheries Act which enacts that \u201cthe Minister (of Marine and Fisheries) may * * * issue, or authorize to be issued, fishery leases and licenses * * *\u201d and therefore the Minister has a discretionary authority to grant, or refuse, such license to any person who is a British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, or is a returned soldier who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian navy or army overseas; in other words, the authority of the Minister is a permissive one and he is under no legal duty to grant licenses to those who may apply for them.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, under and pursuant to the Supreme Court Act, of certain questions for hearing and consideration, as to the constitutional validity of certain sections of the Fisheries Act, 1914, and of certain regulations passed thereunder.\nThe Order in Council providing for the reference was dated 19th October, 1927, (P.C. 2032) and is as follows:\n\u201cThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 18th October, 1927, from the Minister of Justice, submitting that by a judgment recently pronounced by the Honourable Mr. Justice Macdonald of the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon a case stated by H. O. Alexander, Esq., Stipendiary Magistrate in and for the county of Vancouver in the province of British Columbia, under the provisions of section 761 of the Criminal Code, in the case of The King v. The Somerville Cannery Company, Limited, the learned judge affirmed the determination of the Magistrate acquitting the defendant company of the charge that, on the 25th day of March, 1917, at Seal Cove, in the city of Prince Rupert, it did unlawfully operate a fish cannery, to wit, a clam cannery, contrary to and in violation of the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1914, without first obtaining an annual license therefor from the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. The judgment proceeds upon the ground that section 7A of the said Act which requires an annual license from the Minister to be obtained for the operation of a fish cannery for commercial purposes, is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. From this decision there is no appeal, and the Minister, therefore, considers it to be expedient that immediate steps should be taken to obtain an ultimate judicial determination of the important questions, which this decision raises, as to the constitutional validity of section 7A and of other like provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1914.\n\u201cThe Minister further submits that important questions have also been raised as to the constitutional validity of certain other provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1914, and as to whether, under certain provisions of the said Act and of the Special Fishery Regulations for the province of British Columbia made under the authority of the said Act, the Minister of Marine and Fisheries has a discretionary authority to grant or refuse licenses to fish or to operate a fish or salmon cannery in that province; and the Minister also considers it to be expedient to obtain a final judicial determination of these questions.\n\u201cThe Minister accordingly recommends that the following questions be referred by Your Excellency in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the provisions of section 60 of the Supreme Court Act: 1. Are sections 7A and 18 of the Fisheries Act, 1914, or either of them and in what particular or particulars or to what extent ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\n2. If the said provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1914, or either of them be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, has the Minister authority to issue a license for the operation of a floating cannery constructed on a float or ship, as contradistinguished from a stationary cannery constructed on land, and if so, is he entitled to make the license subject to any restrictions particularly as to the place of operation of any such cannery in British Columbia?\n3. Under the provisions of the Special Fishery Regulations for the province of British Columbia (made by the Governor in Council under the authority of section 45 of the Fisheries Act, 1914), respecting licenses to fish, viz., subsection 3 of section 14; paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 1 of section 15 or paragraph (a) of subsection 7 of section 24 of the said regulations, or under said section 7A or 18 of the said Act, (if these sections or either of them be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada), has\n(a) any British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, or\n(b) any person so resident who is not a British subject, upon application and tender of the prescribed fee, the right to receive a license to fish or to operate a fish or salmon cannery in that province, or has the Minister a discretionary authority to grant or refuse such license to any such person whether a British subject or not?\u201d\nPursuant to an order of the court, notification of the hearing of the reference was sent to the Attorneys General of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Alberta and Saskatchewan. The Attorneys General of the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia were represented by counsel at hearing; and the fishermen of Japanese origin in the province of British Columbia, as a class of persons interested, were represented by counsel as provided by subs. 4 of s. 60 of the Supreme Court Act.

Newcombe for the Japanese fishermen.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nDuff J.\u2014As to questions 1 and 2, I concur entirely with the view of my brother Newcombe.\nAs to question 3. The only express authority for the grant of licenses by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries is that given by section 7 of the Act, which is in these words:\nThe Minister may, wherever the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, issue, or authorize to be issued, fishery leases and licenses for fisheries and fishing wheresoever situate or carried on; but leases or licenses for any term exceeding nine years shall be issued only under authority of the Governor in Council.\nThis section was considered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the Fisheries Reference in 1898[1]. And it was there held that, in so far as it authorized the granting of the leases for fishing in places which were the property, not of the Dominion, but of a province, it was beyond the power of Parliament to enact; and, by section 3, the Act is to be read subject to this pronouncement. Section 3 leaves a considerable field for the operation of section 7 in relation to leases and exclusive licenses. When sect. 3 was passed, beds of the tidal waters within the British Columbia Railway Belt and on the coast of James Bay and the Arctic were the property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, and to these waters the provisions of the section would apply. It would also apply to fresh water lakes and rivers, the beds of which are in the Dominion. In British Columbia this would include the beds of such waters in the Railway Belt and in the Peace River tract. When section 7 was first enacted, it was no doubt assumed, according to the view then held by the advisers of the Dominion, that the property in the beds of tidal waters was in the Crown in the right of the Dominion, and probably the intention of the section was to vest in the Minister authority to grant leases, and licences, exclusive as well as non-exclusive apparently, for fishing in such waters.\nIn view of the history of the section, there is much to be said for the view that the authority vested in the Minister under it is a discretionary authority. That is to say, that in point of law the Minister is under no legal duty to grant leases or licenses, or to grant any particular lease or any particular license. It is sometimes not easy in construing the provisions of a modern statute, by which powers are vested in a Minister of the Crown, to determine whether or not the Minister, as the depository of such powers, is intended to be constituted an agent of the legislature (see the argument of Sir George Jessel in The Queen v. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury[2]), to exercise those powers, an instance of that being the statute considered in Re Massey[3]; or whether the legislature has named him as the donee of the power in his capacity of servant of the Crown. As the Minister here is authorized to grant leases of Crown property, it seems probable that he is intended in executing his powers under the section, to act for, and in the name of the Crown. In this view of the Minister\u2019s functions, a subject would possess no right capable of specific enforcement in a court of law to demand a lease or license, The Queen v. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury2, although it would not necessarily follow that the Minister is not under a duty, a legal duty owing to and enforceable by the Crown, to grant licenses to applicants as they demand them.\nIn considering the question whether or not the section has the effect of constituting rights, that is to say, legal rights, vested in His Majesty\u2019s subjects, or a legal duty binding the Minister, owing to the Crown, one must first notice that, in form, the clause is permissive only. There has been a good deal of discussion upon the subject of the indicia, to which one must give attention, in considering whether a grant of authority permissive in form is coupled with an obligation to exercise that authority. The word \u201cmay\u201d and similar expressions are always, in themselves, permissive in effect as well as in form, and a grant of authority in the form of section 7 does not itself imply any direction requiring the donee to act under the power. The subject was very fully discussed in the well-known case of Julius v. The Bishop of Oxford[4]. At p. 235, Lord Selborne observes upon the question whether an enforceable duty arose to exercise a power admittedly conferred by statute, that in general such a question must be solved from the context of the particular provision and from the general scope and objects of the enactment conferring the power.\nLooking first at the section itself, it is impossible to suppose that the authority vested in the Minister to grant leases was not a discretionary one, and, prima facie, at all events, the same must be said with regard to the authority to grant licenses. Is there anything, then, in the context\u2014that is to say, in the parts of the Act which are in pari materia with section 7\u2014or in the subject matter of the legislation, which requires us to imply the existence of a legal duty incident upon the Minister? Before turning to the particular regulations now before us, it should be noted that section 45, which empowers the Governor-in- Council to make regulations, expressly authorizes, in subsection (c), the prohibition of fishing except under the authority of leases or licenses. This enactment, in so far as it relates to leases or licenses by the Minister, seems to contemplate leases or licenses under section 7, and the particular regulations now in question (subsection (3) of section 14, paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 1 of section 14, and subsection (7) of section 24) were probably passed in execution of this specific authority. At all events, there seems to be no reason to doubt that a license under the authority of section 7 would constitute a sufficient warrant to exempt the holder of it from the prohibitions enacted by the regulations in question. There is nothing in the terms in which these provisions are expressed, nor, as far as I have been able to discover, in the terms of the regulations, pointing to a conclusion that the authority of the Minister is not a permissive one. Are there reasons, then, arising from the character of the subject matter, sufficiently potent to require us to hold that the Minister is under a duty to grant licenses to those who apply for them?\nSpeaking broadly, every subject of His Majesty is entitled to exercise the right of fishing in tidal waters in British Columbia, and a statutory enactment which in a reasonable view of it might expose such rights to oppressive or arbitrary or capricious restrictions, would receive a jealous scrutiny in any court called upon to enforce it. But, on the other hand, the authority to grant leases, given by section 7, necessarily involves some restriction of the public right, that is to say, the exclusion of the public as a whole, from the waters in which the exclusive right of the lessee prevails, and in the case of leases for nine years and less, the discretion to grant them is vested in the Minister; and so with regard to exclusive licenses. As to leases and exclusive licenses, the Minister\u2019s power is, of course, necessarily discretionary. You cannot, self-evidently, have two leases or exclusive licenses operating in the same locus at the same time and affecting the same kinds of fish, and, as no two localities are exactly the same, there is necessarily not only a limitation in respect of numbers, but discrimination as between parties to whom applications are granted. And, of course, in cases where a competition occurs, one applicant is unavoidably favoured to the disadvantage of all the rest. The natural inclination of Parliament against favouritism, to this extent at all events, yielded to considerations which must have appeared to be sufficient.\nAs to non-exclusive licenses, I can discover nothing in the subject matter which dictates an inference that, as regards these, the authority of the Minister is of a different order. There is a power of cancellation given to the Minister in the case of licensees who offend against the law. It seems difficult to suppose, if, in point of law, a discretion was not vested in the Minister to refuse an application for a license, that provision would not have been made, empowering him to refuse, in cases in which he was satisfied, for any reason, that the applicant was not a fit person to receive a license from the point of view of a government department concerned with the observance or enforcement of enactments or regulations governing fisheries.\nThe authority of the Minister to grant licenses would appear to embrace the right to determine the stipulations of the lease, including in his discretion clauses of re-entry and forfeiture. I see no reason why it should be supposed that the Minister would not be entitled to insist upon special stipulations as to the methods by which fish should be caught. The same with regard to exclusive licenses. As to non-exclusive licenses, I should suppose that the regulations contemplate at least the possibility of special provisions as to special areas, and as to the kinds of fishing permitted. Where a license is granted for fishing with nets or other apparatus, I should suppose that the license ought to define in some way the instruments permitted and the manner and conditions in which such instruments are to be employed, and there would appear to be some reason to think, although we have not been favoured with any explanations on the point, that, as regards such licenses, some sort of discretionary authority would almost be necessary, in order to secure, with any degree of confidence, the objects of the regulation.\nI do not see any reason for holding that the Minister might not refuse all licenses to fish for salmon, for example, with a particular kind of instrument, either generally or in a particular district. And it would, I think, be a singular thing if there were no discretion to refuse a license to employ a particular kind of instrument to a person who was known to have systematically abused his privilege by violating the Act or the regulations.\nOne consideration seems to be of importance. The donee of the power in this case is a Minister of the Crown, accountable, first of all to the Crown, that is to say, to the Government as a whole, and then to Parliament, for the execution of his powers. The subject is not susceptible of extended discussion; but such examination as I have made of the statute and such attention as I have given to the subject matter have not disclosed good reasons why the political sanctions, under which the Minister acts, should not, in the view of the legislature, have been regarded as quite adequate in themselves to insure an administration of the Act in good faith, with an eye to the public interest.\nMignault J.\u2014I fully accept the answers suggested by my brother Newcombe to questions 1 and 2 submitted under this reference.\nWith regard to question 3, however, I concur in the reasons stated in the judgment of my brother Duff, and I am of opinion that the authority delegated to the Minister is a discretionary one.\nNewcombe J.\u2014The questions referred for the hearing and consideration of the court, with the enactments or regulations to which they relate, are the following:\nQuestion 1.\nAre sections 7A and 18 of the Fisheries Act, 1914, or either of them, and in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nSection 7A of the Fisheries Act, 1914, of the Dominion, was enacted as an addition to the Act of 1914. It is to be found in c. 16 of 1917, and reads as follows:\n7A. No one shall operate a fish cannery for commercial purposes without first obtaining an annual license therefor from the Minister. Where no other fee is in this Act prescribed for a cannery license, the annual fee for each such license shall be one dollar.\nSection 18 appeared in the Consolidated Fisheries Act, c. 8 of 1914, as a section of four lines, but it was amended in 1919 by c. 52; in 1922 by c. 24, and again in 1924 by c. 24. These amendments have made important additions, and the section, as it stands within the purview of the question, as I interpret it, and as submitted at the hearing, reads as follows:\n18. No one shall operate a salmon cannery or salmon curing establishment in British Columbia for commercial purposes except under a license from the Minister (1914, c. 8, s. 18).\n(2) (a) The annual fee for a salmon cannery license shall be twenty dollars, and in addition, four cents for each case of forty-eight one-pound cans, or the equivalent thereto, of sockeye salmon, and three cents for each case of forty-eight one-pound cans, or the equivalent thereto, of any other species of salmon, including steelhead (salmo rivularis), packed in such cannery during the continuance in force of the license. The said twenty dollars shall be paid before the license is issued, and the remainder of the license fee shall be paid as the Minister may from time to time by regulation prescribe. (1924, c. 43). (b) The annual license fee for a salmon curing establishment shall be:\u2014\nFifty cents on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season does not exceed ten tons;\nSeventy-five cents on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season exceeds ten tons, but is not more than twenty tons;\nOne dollar on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season exceeds twenty tons, but is not more than fifty tons;\nOne dollar and twenty-five cents on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season exceeds fifty tons. (1922, c. 24, s. 1).\nQuestion 2.\n2. If the said provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1914, or either of them be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, has the Minister authority to issue a license for the operation of a floating cannery constructed on a float or ship, as contradistinguished from a stationery cannery constructed on land, and, if so, is he entitled to make the license subject to any restrictions, particularly as to the place of operation of any such cannery in British Columbia?\nQuestion 3.\n3. Under the provisions of the Special Fishery Regulations for the province of British Columbia (made by the Governor in Council under the authority of sec. 45 of the Fisheries Act, 1914), respecting licenses to fish, viz., subs. 3 of sec. 14; par. (a) or (b) of subs. 1 of sec. 15, or par. (a) of subs. 7 of sec. 24 of the said regulations, or under said sec. 7A or 18 of the said Act, (if these sections or either of them be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada) has\n(a) any British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, or\n(b) any person so resident who is not a British subject, upon application and tender of the prescribed fee, the right to receive a license to fish or to operate a fish or salmon cannery in that province, or has the Minister a discretionary authority to grant or refuse such license to any such person, whether a British subject or not?\nThe special fishery regulations for the province of British Columbia to which this question refers are to be found in a pamphlet printed for the Department of Marine and Fisheries, which was introduced by counsel for the Attorney General at the hearing. They read as follows:\nSubs. 3 of sec. 14: If the captain of a herring or pilchard drag-seine or purse-seine boat that is being used in operating a herring or pilchard drag-seine or purse-seine is not himself the licensee of the said drag-seine or purse-seine, he shall require a license from the Minister to authorize his operation of the said drag-seine or purse-seine; and no other than a British subject shall be eligible for such license. The fee for such license shall be one dollar.\nParagraphs (a) and (b) of subs. 1 of sec. 15:\n(a) Except as herein otherwise provided fishing with nets or other apparatus, and the taking of abalone or crabs, except under license from the Minister is prohibited; and in salmon fishing no one shall act as a boat puller or be otherwise employed in a boat used in salmon drifting, or as a helper, or in any other capacity in operating a purse-seine or drag-seine that is being used in salmon fishing, except under license from the Minister.\n(b) No license shall be granted to any person, company or firm, unless such person is a British subject resident in the province, or is a returned soldier, who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Navy or Army overseas, or to such company or firm, unless it is a Canadian company or firm or is authorized by the Provincial Government to do business in the province.\nParagraph (a) of subs. 7 of sec. 24:\n7. (a) No one shall fish for salmon for commercial purposes by means of trolling, except under license from the Minister. Each person in a boat that is being used in trolling for salmon shall be required to have a license.\nParagraph (b) of this section adds that \u201cthe fee for a salmon trolling license shall be one dollar.\u201d\nSection 45 of the Fisheries Act, 1914, under which these regulations were made, is in the following words:\n45. The Governor in Council may make regulations:\u2014\n(a) for the better management and regulation of the seacoast and inland fisheries;\n(b) to prevent or remedy the obstruction and pollution of streams;\n(c) to regulate and prevent fishing;\n(d) to prohibit the destruction of fish;\n(e) to forbid fishing except under authority of leases or licenses; U.S., s. 54.\n(f) prescribing the time and the manner in which fish may be fished for and caught;\n(g) to prohibit the export or sale of any fish or any portion of any fish from Canada, or the taking or carrying of fish or any portion of any fish from any one province of Canada to any other province thereof.\n2. Such regulations shall take effect from the date of the publication thereof in the Canada Gazette or from the date specified for such purpose in such regulations and such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if enacted herein, notwithstanding that such regulations extended (sic) vary or alter any of the provisions of this Act respecting the places or modes of fishing and shall be printed in the prefix in the next succeeding issue of the Dominion Statutes: Provided that any regulation made under the provisions of paragraph (g) shall not take effect until after six months after the date of its publication in the Canada Gazette.\n3. Every offence against any regulation made under this Act may be stated as in violation of this Act. At the hearing, the case was presented on behalf of the Attorney General, and counsel were also heard for the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, and on behalf of fishermen of Japanese origin in the latter province, as a class of persons interested, as provided by subs. 4 of sec. 60 of the Supreme Court Act, under which the questions were referred.\nTurning now to the first question, it will be observed that sec. 7a is grouped by Parliament along with sec. 7, under the subtitle \u201cFishery Leases and Licenses.\u201d Section 7 appeared, in identical terms, as sec. 4 of the Fisheries Act, c. 95 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1886, and it was impeached by the provinces in the argument of the Fisheries Case of 1898,[5], but it withstood that attack, subject to one observation which I shall mention. Lord Herschell had pointed out that sec. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, did not convey to the Dominion any proprietary rights in relation to fisheries; he had referred to the distinction which should be borne in mind between rights of property and legislative jurisdiction; it was only the latter, he said, which was conferred under the 12th enumeration, \u201cSeacoast and Inland Fisheries\u201d; he had held moreover that, in addition to the legislative power derived under the item \u201cSeacoast and Inland Fisheries,\u201d the third item of sec. 91, \u201cthe raising of money by any mode or system of taxation,\u201d conferred that power exclusively, and he said\ntheir Lordships think it is impossible to exclude as not within this power the provision imposing a tax by way of license as a condition of the right to fish. It is true that by virtue of sec. 92 the provincial legislature may impose the obligation to obtain a license in order to raise a revenue for provincial purposes; but this cannot in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, derogate from the taxing power of the Dominion Parliament to which they have already called attention.\nThen came the observation to which I have alluded. It followed, he said, that, in so far as sec. 4 of the Revised. Statutes of Canada, 1886, c. 95, \u201cempowers the grant of fishery leases\u201d (with which in the text of the section is coupled \u201clicenses\u201d)\nconferring an exclusive right to fish in property belonging not to the Dominion but to the provinces, it was not within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to pass it. The qualification expressed in the last sentence was subsequently introduced by Parliament, ipsissima verba, into the Fisheries Act, and appears in the Consolidated Act of 1914 as sec. 3, limiting the application of the whole Act. That limitation was legislatively declared so early as the Revised Statutes of 1906, the revision which followed the reference of 1898, and it seems therefore to be manifest that the licensing of fish canneries for which sec. 7a provides is not intended to affect rights in the soil. It is an annual license for the operation of a fish cannery which the section requires, and it is inaptly grouped with the licenses mentioned in the preceding section.\nAn annual fee of $1.00 is imposed, unless another fee be prescribed by the Act; I have not discovered any such other provision, and our attention was not directed to any. It appears difficult to realize that the purpose of this section could have been the raising of money by taxation; certainly that was not the only purpose. The tax viewed as such is merely nominal, and could not, I should think, have been expected to indemnify for the cost of raising it. I have no doubt that the section, if it can be sustained at all, must be referred to the power which Parliament exercises in the regulation of Seacoast and Inland Fisheries. Undoubtedly Parliament has the exclusive authority to regulate what falls within that description, and one sort of regulation might be a licensing requirement. But a fish cannery is not, according to any of the definitions, or in practice, embraced within a fishery, seacoast or inland. It is for the preservation and marketing of the fish when caught and landed that the cannery fulfils a commercial purpose.\nIt was argued on behalf of the Attorney General that, although the canning of fish may not be a fishing operation, it is nevertheless ancillary to the exercise of the powers of regulation which the Dominion possesses under the British North America Act, and the obligation which it assumed under the terms of Union with British Columbia; much reliance was founded upon the powers which are described as ancillary. The word does not occur either in the act or terms of Union; but\nit must be borne in mind in construing the two sections (91 and 92) that matters which in a special aspect and for a particular purpose may fall within one of them may in a different aspect and for a different purpose fall within the other, John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[6], and \u201cancillary\u201d has on occasions been used judicially as a convenient expression, by which to characterize some Dominion powers which have a provincial aspect, in relation to which the province may legislate, in the absence of a conflicting Dominion provision. An instance of this is to be found in the Assignments & Preferences Case[7]; but the explanation is not that the Parliament, in the execution of an ancillary power, legislates upon a subject not strictly comprised in the enumerations of sec. 91, but that, when the Dominion power, in the particular in question, overlaps provincial powers, it suspends them only to the extent of its exercise.\nSec. 19 expressly declares that \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act\u201d the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada shall extend to all matters coming within the enumerated classes; which plainly indicates that the legislation of that Parliament so long as it strictly relates to these matters is to be of paramount authority.\nTennant v. Union Bank of Canada[8].\nThe powers thus known as ancillary must belong to the Dominion enumerated powers, while the subject, in another aspect, and for another purpose, is embraced within the provincial powers. Usually the competition has arisen as between a specified Dominion power and the very comprehensive provincial power of property and civil rights within the province. These enumerations, as has been said, do not embody exact logical disjunctions. Precise definition of the area broadly embraced under an enumerated power is possible only to a limited extent. There is, not unfrequently, as has been pointed out, a margin within which either legislation may operate, the one in the aspect of the enumerated Dominion power, the other under the broad provincial powers, so long as the field be clear. But the Dominion authority when exercised is paramount.\nNow applying these principles, I think it is undoubted that, in the absence of any restricting consideration, the right to operate a fish cannery for commercial purposes is a civil right in the province where the operation is carried on, like the right to operate a fruit cannery or a vegetable cannery; and the question, as I see it, is whether the exercise of this right may be restricted or regulated by force of any enumerated Dominion power to which sec. 7A may be justifiably attributed.\nI have said that in my opinion the enactment is not upheld by virtue of the taxing power.\nIn Patterson on the Fishery Laws (1863) p. 1, the definition of a fishery is given as follows:\nA fishery is properly defined as the right of catching fish in the sea, or in a particular stream of water; and it is also frequently used to denote the locality where such right is exercised.\nIn Dr. Murray\u2019s New English Dictionary, the leading definition is:\nThe business, occupation or industry of catching fish or of taking other products of the sea or rivers from the water.\nNeither the business of canning fish, nor the operation of a fish canning factory, is, by either of these definitions, nor by any other which I have found, comprised in \u201cfisheries,\u201d as that word is used in sec. 91, or the terms of Union with British Columbia. Section 7A has no limited or special application to British Columbia, nor to anyone of the provinces as distinguished from another, and it should therefore receive a general and uniform interpretation. The colony was admitted into the Union on the terms and conditions expressed, subject to the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, and the stipulation with regard to the fisheries which is embodied in the terms of Union consists merely in an undertaking on the part of the Dominion to \u201cassume and defray the charges for the * * * protection and encouragement of fisheries,\u201d a provision which I am disposed to think does not extend the legislative powers of the Dominion to the licensing of fish canneries.\nTo prohibit, or to impose restrictive regulations upon, the sale or the storage of fish, or the manufacture and sale of fishing lines or nets, or of whalebone, etc., might operate to protect the fish and to reduce the catch. It might be a useful power to possess in connection with, or as auxiliary to, the regulation of the fisheries. Unlimited powers would be still more useful, but none of these powers can become effective in the hands of the Dominion unless, upon the true interpretation, included within the definition of seacoast and inland fisheries, as used in sec. 91. While the catching of fish for canning may, I suggest, be prohibited or regulated, there is no grant to the Dominion of the power, which s. 7a assumes, to control broadly the operation of the canneries.\nIt was urged by the factum of the Dominion, but was not pressed at the argument, that sec. 7a might be sanctioned under the power to regulate trade and commerce, but that contention may I think be regarded as disposed of by the considerations which were discussed by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in the Insurance Reference. Attorney General of Canada vs. Attorney General of Alberta[9].\nThere is no other enumeration of s. 91 which covers the case, and therefore I come to the conclusion that the power to enact s. 7a is not to be found in any of the enumerations, and is not possessed by the Dominion, seeing that the subject belongs to one of the provincial enumerations.\nSection 18 relates to salmon canneries and salmon curing establishments in British Columbia, and, viewed as a regulating provision, is governed by the considerations which determine the invalidity of sec. 7a. But there are, in the case of salmon canneries, a fixed annual license fee of $20.00, and additional payments to be made which are regulated according to the annual pack; it is moreover provided that, for a salmon curing establishment, the annual license fee shall be from fifty cents per ton to $1.25 per ton for the number of tons put up in the establishment during the season. These exactions give the enactment the appearance of a taxing provision, and it might perhaps, in other company, pass for that; but the Fishery Act is throughout a regulating Act, and it was as such that its predecessor, R.S.C., 1886, c. 95, was upheld in the Fishery Case of 1898[10]. In like manner in the present case, sections 7a and 18 were, on behalf of the Attorney General, maintained as deriving their sanction through the Dominion power to regulate sea-coast and inland fisheries. In the Special Fishery Regulations which were introduced into the case for purposes of the third question, it will be seen, by reference to s. 16, that the power to license canneries is, in fact, administered with a purpose to regulate their erection and operation. It provides as follows: Section 16: Before a cannery license shall be granted the applicant therefor shall make a statutory declaration setting forth, in the case of an existing cannery, if it is owned by a company or firm, the name of such company or firm, whether it is a Canadian company or firm, licensed to do business in the province, or if not owned by a company or firm, the name or names and nationality or nationalities of the actual owner or owners of such cannery, and in the case of a new cannery, if it will be owned by a company or firm, the name of such company or firm and whether it is a Canadian company or firm licensed to do business in the province, or if it will not be owned by a company or firm, the name or names and nationality or nationalities of the person or persons who will own such cannery, and that in either case the applicant or applicants have the necessary capital to erect and operate such cannery.\nThis regulation was passed under no other power than that which the Governor in Council has by sec. 45 of the Fisheries Act to regulate the sea-coast and inland fisheries. There is of course nothing conclusive about it, but it seems to put the governmental practice in accord with the contention which was advanced on behalf of the Attorney General that sections 7a and 18 were enacted in execution of the regulating power. If, then, the regulation of the fisheries by means of the local establishments be a real purpose, as it is an avowed purpose, of requiring the licenses in respect of which the fees are imposed, it must I think follow that if these two sections fail in that respect for lack of enacting authority, they cannot be saved by invoking the taxing power.\nWithin the spheres allotted to them by the (B.N.A.) Act the Dominion and the Provinces are rendered on general principle co-ordinate governments. As a consequence where one has legislative power the other has not, speaking broadly, the capacity to pass laws which will interfere with its exercise. What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly,\nper Lord Haldane in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[11]. And in the same case His Lordship, in approaching the consideration of the pertinent question, which had to do with the validity of provincial legislation affecting the powers of Dominion companies, put it this way at p. 114:\nCan the relevant provisions of all or any of the three sets of provincial statutes be justified as directed exclusively to the attainment of an object of legislation assigned by sec. 92 to the legislatures, such as is the collection of direct taxes for provincial purposes; or do these provisions interfere with such powers as are conferred on a Dominion company by the Parliament of Canada to carry on its business anywhere in the Dominion and so affect its status?\nI think a purpose of s. 18 was to authorize the Minister to regulate salmon canneries and salmon curing establishments by means of a system of licenses, and I think, for reasons which I have indicated, that the Dominion had no power to do this; and that, if so, the legislation is not exclusively attributable to the exercise of powers possessed by the Dominion, and cannot therefore be upheld as an exercise of the taxing power.\nQuestion 2, in view of the foregoing, requires no answer.\nAs to question 3, that part of it which relates to ss. 7A and 18, is disposed of by the answer to question 1.\nThere remain subs. 3 of sec. 14; pars. (a) and (b) of subs. 1 of sec. 15, and par. (a) of subs. 7 of sec. 24 of the Special Fishery Regulations for British Columbia. These regulations are made by the Governor in Council under the authority of s. 45 of the Fisheries Act, 1914. It is not necessary to determine whether this section contains any delegation of authority to levy taxes. The regulations specified are put forward as Special Fishery Regulations for British Columbia, and the question submitted appears to be intended to relate only to their interpretation.\nThese regulations are of the same character and subject to common considerations. They prohibit fishing of various kinds, except under license from the Minister. They affect the public right of fishing, and, in some cases, may be found to extend to private rights, or several fisheries.\nSubsection 3 of s. 14 is confined to fishing for herring or pilchard by drag-seine or purse-seine, and it is declared that no other than a British subject shall be eligible for the license provided for.\nParagraphs (a) and (b) of subs. 1 of s. 15 are introduced under the general heading of \u201cLeases or Licenses\u201d; paragraph (a) relates to the taking of abalone or crabs, and salmon fishing by means of drifting, or the operation of purse-seines or drag-seines; but paragraph (b) is of general application; it prescribes generally the conditions of disqualification for license in these words:\nNo license shall be granted to any person, company or firm unless such person is a British subject resident in the province, or is a returned soldier, who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Navy or Army Overseas, or to such company or firm, unless it is a Canadian company or firm, or is authorized by the Provincial Government to do business in the province. As to s. 24, subs. 7 (a), it applies only to the fishing for salmon for commercial purposes by means of trolling, and requires that every person in a boat that is being used in trolling for salmon shall have a license.\nThe regulations in question thus affect both public and private rights of fishing, and they should not be interpreted to derogate from those rights further than may be requisite to give the regulations their necessary and due effect. Those who are, according to the regulating provisions, declared to be ineligible, may not of course receive licenses; but where an applicant is eligible within the regulations, and not otherwise disqualified, there is no express provision for withholding a license, if he submit a proper application, and pay the prescribed fee, which, in each of the cases specified, appears to be no more than the sum of $1.\nIt is true that the licensing power is committed to the head of the Department, and no doubt will be administered with due care, but, if it were intended that he should exercise a discretion to refuse a license to a qualified applicant, there would, I should think, have been something expressive and definitive of that intention. The regulations which we are asked to construe derive their force not by direct legislative enactment, but through the exercise of powers delegated by the statute to the Governor in Council. The powers are very large, and the regulations to be made under them are declared to have the same force and effect as if enacted in the Fisheries Act. They are of the nature of statutory rules. Section 45 of the Fisheries Act, 1914, authorizing the regulations, is like the provision which was interpreted by the House of Lords in Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood[12], where the Lord Chancellor (Herschell) said in his speech:\nThe effect of an enactment is that it binds all subjects who are affected by it. They are bound to conform themselves to the provisions of the law so made. The effect of a statutory rule if validly made is precisely the same that every person must conform himself to its provisions, and if in each case a penalty be imposed, any person who does not comply with the provisions whether of the enactment or the rule becomes equally subject to the penalty. But there is this difference between a rule and an enactment, that whereas apart from some such provision as we are considering, you may canvass a rule and determine whether or not it was within the power of those who made it, you cannot canvass in that way the provisions of an Act of Parliament. Therefore, there is that difference between the rule and the statute. There is no difference if the rule is one within the statutory authority, but that very substantial difference, if it is open to consideration whether it be so or not.\nBut no legislative power is delegated to the Minister, even if the Governor in Council could delegate any of his statutory powers. No express power is conferred upon the Minister, except to issue licenses, and, in my view, it is improbable that it was intended to confer a reviewable discretion, or that, unless by plain legislative direction, discretionary licensing authority would have been granted which could be exercised in a manner which might sanction discrimination. There is no provision, beyond those contained in subs. 3 of s. 14, and subs. 1, pars. (a) and (b) of s. 15, of the regulations submitted, which prescribes disqualifications or prohibited classes, and I am not satisfied that the statutory rules, which go no further than to impose a general requirement for licenses, for which a fee is to be paid as a condition to the exercise of the right of fishing, should be interpreted by implication further to limit that right by making the issue of the license discretionary in the judgment of the licensing authority.\nThe answers may therefore be stated as follows:\nQuestion 1: The answer, as to both sections 7A and 18, is entirely in the affirmative.\nQuestion 2: In view of the preceding answer, this question requires no answer.\nQuestion 3: As to each of the specified regulations, viz., subs. 3 of sec. 14; pars. (a) and (b) of subs. 1 of sec. 15, and pars. (a) and (b) of subs. 1 of sec. 15, and par. (a) of subs. 7 of sec. 24, any British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, who is not otherwise legally disqualified, has, according to the true interpretation of these clauses, the right to receive a license, if he submit a proper application and tender the prescribed fee. As to any person resident in the province of British Columbia, who is not a British subject, he is not eligible for a license of the character described in subs. 3 of sec. 14, it being expressly declared by that subsection that \u201cno other than a British subject shall be eligible for such license.\u201d And none of the other licenses in question shall, as provided by par. (b) of subs. 1 of sec. 15, be granted to any person, unless he \u201cis a British subject resident in the province, or is a returned soldier who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Navy or Army Overseas.\u201d It is unnecessary to interpret the regulations with respect to the operation of fish or salmon canneries, inasmuch as sections 7A and 18 are held to be ultra vires.\nRinfret J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nLamont J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nSmith J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nThe judgment of the court is as follows:\nThe unanimous answers may be stated as follows:\nQuestion no. 1: The answer, as to both sections 7A and 18, is entirely in the affirmative.\nQuestion no. 2: In view of the preceding answer, this question requires no answer.\nAs to question no. 3, the answer found by Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ., is as follows:\nAs to each of the specified regulations, viz., subs. 3 of s. 14; paras. (a) and (b) of subs. 1 of s. 15, and para. (a) of subs. 7 of s. 24, any British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, who is not otherwise legally disqualified, has, according to the true interpretation of these clauses, the right to receive a license, if he submit a proper application and tender the prescribed fee. As to any person resident in the province of British Columbia, who is not a British subject, he is not eligible for a license of the character described in subsec. 3 of sec. 14, it being expressly declared by that subsection that \u201cno other than a British subject shall be eligible for such license.\u201d And none of the other licenses in question shall, as provided by para. (b) of subsec. 1 of sec. 15, be granted to any person, unless he \u201cis a British subject resident in the province, or is a returned soldier who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Navy or Army Overseas.\u201d It is unnecessary to interpret the regulations with respect to the operation of fish or salmon canneries, inasmuch as sections 7A and 18 are held to be ultra vires.\nBut this answer is varied by that of Duff, Mignault and Smith JJ., as follows:\nThe Minister has a discretionary authority to grant, or refuse, such license to any person who is a British subject resident in the province of British Columbia, or is a returned soldier who has served in His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Navy or Army overseas.\n[1] [1898] A.C. 700.\n[2] (1872) L.R. 7 Q.B. 387 at p. 389.\n[3] (1886) 13 Ont.

Bethune for the appellants.\nE. Hart Nichols K.C. for the respondents Howard Whiston and Marion B. Busch, executors of the last will and testament of Walter J. Busch, deceased.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014In order to grasp this case, it is necessary to read the following clauses of the testator\u2019s will:\nI direct that so soon after my decease as practicable my book debts and choses in action to be collected and my debts paid;\nI give, devise and bequeath:\n(1) To my wife all my household furniture;\n(2) To my son, WALTER JOHANNES, my business, office furniture, books, plans, papers, and instruments connected therewith or belonging thereto;\n(3) To my son, ERNEST and his Heirs, a lot of land owned by me on Clifton Street in the said City, 40 \u00d7 120 feet and purchased by me from representatives of Lahey;\n(4) I give, devise and bequeath my properties on Gottingen, North and Creighton Streets to my said Trustees or the survivor of them upon trust to sell said properties or either of them if they shall see fit, either at Public Auction or Private Sale. And in the event of such sale I direct them to invest the proceeds arising therefrom in Mortgages of real estate or other security approved by them and pay the interest of such investments to my wife for the proper maintenance of herself and the support and education of my youngest daughter until she shall reach the age of twenty one years;\nIt is my will that my Uncle, CHARLES WALTHER, shall have a home with my wife for his life but should any disagreement take place to prevent, then I direct my Trustees to deduct from the interest of said investments the sum of S100, One Hundred Dollars, annually and pay the sum in quarterly instalments during his life-time to my said Uncle. Should my said Trustees not sell said properties I hereby authorize them to let the same and apply the rentals towards the maintenance of my said wife, the support and education of my said daughter and to provide a home for my said Uncle, for the payment to him of said One Hundred Dollars as aforesaid;\nOn my daughter, AMELIA, reaching the age of twenty-one years, or dying before said property shall be sold, I direct that out of the proceeds to be realized therefrom, a sufficient sum shall be invested as aforesaid so as to produce Four Hundred Dollars ($400) annually, which shall be paid to my wife in quarterly instalments for the support of herself and a home of my said Uncle which sum shall include the One Hundred Dollars hereinbefore provided to be paid to him on disagreement. On his decease, the whole of the said sum shall be paid to my wife during her life for her sole use. Any money remaining after the payment of said Four Hundred Dollars shall be equally divided among my children free from the interference or control of any other person; the issue of any deceased child to take parent\u2019s share. On the death of my wife the whole of my property shall be divided between my children (the issue of any deceased child shall be entitled to parent\u2019s share) said division to be in equal shares and free from the interference or control of my daughters\u2019 husbands;\nThe above bequests are made to my wife upon the condition that she releases all other interests she may have in my property by right of dower or otherwise; On the marriage of my wife all payments to her as hereinbefore provided shall immediately cease and all my real estate then held shall be sold and the proceeds divided; One-third to my wife (in lieu of dower) and the balance together with the residue of my estate in equal shares among my children, and the share of my daughters to be free from the control of their respective husbands, the issue of a deceased child to take parent\u2019s share;\nThe testator, Henry F. Busch, who resided at Halifax, Nova Scotia, died on 28th January, 1902, leaving a will, without date, which was proved on 3rd February following. The probate was granted to executors named in the will, but subsequently, by order of the court of 7th August, 1925, the Eastern Trust Company (plaintiff) was appointed executor and trustee, to act jointly with the testator\u2019s widow and son, Henry C. Busch.\nThe proceeding was by originating summons, dated 22nd March, 1927, at the instance of the Trust Company, to determine certain questions which are thus set out in the summons:\n(a) Whether under the true construction of the Last Will and Testament of Henry F. Busch, late of Halifax in the County of Halifax, Architect, deceased, the Trustees under said will were required to invest the whole of the residue of the said Estate (after payment of debts, liabilities, expenses and specific legacies) or only so much thereof as would be reasonably necessary to produce the annuity of $400 per annum by the said Will directed to be paid to the widow of the Testator during her widowhood?\n(b) Whether under the true construction of the said Will any portion of the corpus of the said residue should be paid to the Testator\u2019s children or their issue prior to the death of the Testator\u2019s widow?\n(c) Whether under the true construction of the said Will the estates of any deceased children of the Testator who died in the lifetime of the Testator\u2019s widow, and left no issue them surviving respectively are entitled to share in the income from the said residue or to any share of the said residue when same is divided?\n(d) Whether under the true construction of the said Will when the said residue is divided the issue of any deceased child or children will share equally with the children of the Testator living at the date of the death of Testator\u2019s widow or whether on such division such issue of any deceased child or children shall respectively divide the share or shares their parent or parents would, if living, have respectively taken?\n(e) How the costs of this application are to be borne?\nThe only evidence introduced came by way of the admissions, which are stated as follows:\nFor the purpose of determining the questions raised by the Originating Summons issued herein, the following facts are agreed upon by Counsel representing all the parties herein, namely:\n1. Henry F. Busch, the Testator died on the 28th of January, A.D. 1902, leaving a Will, copy of which is hereto attached and marked \u201cA.\u201d\n2. Probate of the said Will was granted in the year 1902 to the Executors therein named.\n3. By an Order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia dated August 7, 1925, and made in a certain proceeding to be identified as 1924 C. No. 6329, The Eastern Trust Company, the above named Plaintiff, was appointed Trustee under the said Will and has since been carrying on the trusts imposed by the Will.\n4. The Testator\u2019s Uncle, Charles Walther, and the Testator\u2019s youngest daughter, Amelia, referred to in the said Will, both predeceased the Testator.\n5. At the time of his death the Testator left surviving him his widow, Mary Victoria Busch, who is a Defendant herein and three sons, namely, Henry C. Busch of Boston, Mass., Ernest A. Busch of Halifax, N.S., and Walter J. Busch of Halifax, N.S., now deceased, and two daughters, Marea R. C. Whiston of Halifax, N.S., and Wilhelmina Boutilier, now deceased. The said Henry C. Busch, Marea R. C. Whiston and Ernest A. Busch are Defendants herein.\n6. The Testator\u2019s son, Walter J. Busch died on or about the 14th day of July, 1924, leaving no issue him surviving but having first made a Will, the Executors of which are Howard Whiston and Marion B. Busch, who are Defendants herein.\n7. The Testator\u2019s daughter, Wilhelmina Boutilier died after the death of the Testator leaving her surviving the following children, namely, Marion V. M. Bray, Marea T. C. Boutilier and Herbert R. Boutilier of Soda Lake, in the Province of Alberta and Ruth Boutilier of Halifax, N.S., Lily M. Boutilier, Robert J. Boutilier and Arthur B. Boutilier. The said Marion V. M. Bray, Marea T. C. Boutilier, Herbert R. Boutilier and Ruth Boutilier are Defendants herein as is also Arthur M. Boutilier, the Guardian of the minor children of the said Wilhelmina Boutilier. deceased, namely Lily M. Boutilier, Robert J. Boutilier and Arthur B. Boutilier.\nThe case was tried by Graham J., who gave the following answers, as settled by the order of 21st October, 1927:\n(a) The Trustees were empowered to sell the whole or any part of the residue of the said Estate (after payment of debts, liabilities, expenses and specific legacies) and were required to invest the proceeds of all the residue so sold.\n(b) No portion of the corpus of the said estate was to be paid to the Testator\u2019s children or their issue prior to the death of the Testator\u2019s widow.\n(c) The estates of any deceased children of the Testator who died in the lifetime of the Testator\u2019s widow, and left no issue them surviving respectively are entitled to share both in the income from the said residue and in the said residue itself when same is divided.\n(d) On the division of the residue of the said estate the issue of any deceased child or children of the Testator shall respectively divide the share or shares their parent or parents would, if living, have respectively taken.\nThe parties accepted these answers, except the third, marked (c), as to which the testator\u2019s widow, and the other parties who had been summoned, except the executors of Walter J. Busch, appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, and the respondents were the Eastern Trust Company, and the last mentioned executors. Chisholm J., with whom the Chief Justice, Carroll and Jenks JJ. concurred, pronounced the judgment of the Court en banc, whereby the trial judge was upheld, and the appeal was dismissed. Mellish J. dissented. There is an appeal to this Court by the same appellants, and limited to the same question.\nOne must decide according to the intent appearing upon the will. I see nothing to suggest that this testator was inops consilii, and there is no defect of words for the law to supply; when a bequest is given, it is framed in apt terms, whether the gift is to take effect in future, or to continue for a limited time, or where the payment is to be postponed; when specific properties are given with the intent that the gift shall take immediate effect, the testator says: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath\u201d; and he repeats these words with respect to the Gottingen, North and Creighton St. properties, which are put in trust; and, the testator\u2019s directions to his trustees with respect to these properties are expressed in language which regard for simplicity makes sufficiently intelligible.\nThe trustees were empowered to sell the whole or any part of the lands so devised, which, in the findings, are apparently regarded as the whole of the residue of the estate, and they were required to invest the proceeds of the residue so sold, and to pay the interest of the investments to the testator\u2019s widow for the maintenance of herself and daughter Amelia, until the latter should reach the age of twenty-one years. If the trustees did not sell they were authorized to lease, and to apply the rents to the maintenance of the widow and her daughter, and to provide a home for the testator\u2019s uncle, but, in the events which happened, both the daughter and uncle having died before the testator, the direction was that, out of the proceeds to be realized, a sufficient sum should be invested to produce $400 annually, to be paid to the widow, in quarterly instalments, during her life, for her sole use. Then follows this sentence: \u201cAny money remaining after the payment of said $400 shall be equally divided among my children, free from the interference or control of any other person; the issue of any deceased child to take parent\u2019s share.\u201d It is here that the testator\u2019s children, and their issue, are first introduced. We have no copy of the inventory or accounts, but there is an affidavit of Marea R. C. Whiston, one of the testator\u2019s daughters, sworn on 27th February, 1928, which forms part of the case, with which is produced a statement of the Eastern Trust Company showing that the value of the investments held by it on behalf of the testator\u2019s estate amounts to $13,462.78, also that there is a balance to the credit of Income Account, amounting to $689.37, and she says therefore that she believes the present value of the estate to be $14,152.15. There was thus probably some income in excess of that required for the widow.\nIt is not suggested that, in the clause last quoted, \u201cany money remaining after the payment of said $400,\u201d includes capital of the estate, or that this clause refers to a distribution of capital antecedent to the death of the testator\u2019s widow; and, however reasonable it may be that the residue should be reserved for the testator\u2019s children and their issue upon the death of his widow, I cannot discover that he has revealed any intention to make it the subject of gift previous to that event.\nThe learned trial judge finds, and it is not questioned, that, as to the surplus income, the testator had in view a periodic division, so that annually, after the death of Amelia, the excess income, if any, of the fund which had been invested by the trustees to produce $400 annually for the widow, should be equally divided among the testator\u2019s children, \u201cthe issue of any deceased child to take parent\u2019s share.\u201d I am willing to acquiesce in that interpretation; it has become conclusive by the findings; but I deny that any implication or inference arises from it, either upon reason or authority, that, on the death of the widow, when the purpose of the investment is satisfied, the testator intended that the children, or their issue, should take the whole, and especially so, seeing that the testator expressed his intention in the next succeeding sentence, which provides for the disposition of the residue, and upon which the controversy turns.\nIt must be remembered that the residue had been given in trust, and that no provision whatever had been made for the children, except the gift of some interest already mentioned. The testator\u2019s words then are \u201cOn the death of my wife, the whole of my property shall be divided between my children (the issue of any deceased child shall be entitled to parent\u2019s share), said division to be in equal shares and free from the interference or control of my daughters\u2019 husbands.\u201d Upon the assumption that the widow satisfied the condition upon which the testamentary provisions for her benefit were expressly made, the clause which directs the division of the residue upon her death is the only expression of the will which gives the testator\u2019s children an interest in the residue, and it does not, according to my interpretation, in the grammatical and ordinary sense of the language used, operate before the time so specified. This interpretation produces no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, and, so far from coming into conflict with any recognized rule of construction, it is in conformity with the rules declared in the books. It is \u201cOn the death of my wife\u201d that \u201cthe whole of my property shall be divided,\u201d etc. It is then that \u201cthe issue of any deceased child shall be entitled.\u201d\nIt is said in Williams on Executors, 11th ed., p. 981,\nWhere there is no gift but by a direction to pay, or divide and pay, at a future time, or on a given event, or to transfer \u201cfrom and after\u201d a given event, the vesting will be postponed till after that time has arrived, or that event has happened, unless, from particular circumstances, a contrary intention is to be collected.\nAnd this rule is established by numerous authorities cited in the note. To the like effect is the text of Mr. Jarman\u2019s original edition, as incorporated in the sixth edition at p. 1399. And see Smell v. Dee[3], and the judgment of Kekewich J., in Re Eve[4]. It is unnecessary, however, to go beyond the golden rule, to which I have already referred. There are, for the children and their issue, no words of present gift to be found in the will, and no language to interpret which can, consistently with the will, be made effective to vest the residue at the testator\u2019s death.\nThe learned trial judge finds such a provision by implication, because the children, he says, immediately became beneficiaries. They may have done so with respect to uncertain amounts of surplus income, if any, by reason of the death of Amelia in the testator\u2019s life time, but I do not feel justified to infer or to imply from this accident a gift of the residue, or one which the testator has failed to express.\nReferring to the clause which provides for the residue, the Court en banc paraphrases the words in brackets thus:\n\u201cIn the case of the death of any of my children leaving issue, then to such issue.\u201d\nAnd it is said that a reasonable construction would be that the testator intended to make a vested gift to each of his children, subject to be divested in favour of the issue, in case of the death of a child leaving issue. I have already said that I see no evidence of beneficial vesting of the corpus before the death of the widow, and it is, I am sure, not permissible to introduce it by way of a paraphrase. It has been said not infrequently, and with great force, that it is mischievous to regard the testator as saying anything which he has not said, and especially must this be so when the paraphrase serves to eliminate a pregnant expression.\nI would allow the appeal and answer the question in the negative.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E.

The appellant's testator, residing at Philo, Illinois, was the registered owner of a half section of land, upon which he had been paying taxes for many years. On the 9th of May, 1919, he wrote the respondent Hinde, who was the secretary-treasurer of the respondent municipality, asking for the amount due for taxes. Notice of the assessment for 1919 and the taxation notice were subsequently sent to the deceased. In the admission of facts by the parties, it is stated that the father instructed his son \"to pay the taxes on said land and (the son) did pay same pursuant to the said instructions for the years 1919 and 1920, and intended to pay the taxes for the year 1921 but overlooked doing so.\" The taxes for 1919 were remitted by the son in his own name and an official receipt in the same name was sent to the son, whose post office address was the same as the father's. Assuming that the son had become the owner of the land, the respondent Hinde made up the 1920 assessment (which carried five years) in the name of the son, prepared and sent the assessment and taxation notices for that year in the name of and to the latter and received payment of those taxes from him. For the succeeding years, the requisite taxation notices in the name of the son were sent to him. No further taxes having been paid, the land was sold under the Tax Recovery Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 122. The appellant brought an action in damages for the loss of the land by reason of the alleged wrongful acts of the respondents.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that the respondents were not liable.\nPer Duff, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The respondent Hinde's delinquency in omitting the father's name from the assessment roll falls wholly within the intendment of the words \"error committed in or with regard to such roll\" comprised in section 290 of the Rural Municipality Act and this curative section applies and has the effect of validating the roll. Mignault and Newcombe JJ. contra.\nPer Duff and Smith JJ.\u2014The facts admitted afford sufficient evidence to establish, at least prima facie, that the act of the son in paying the taxes of 1920, as demanded from him, that is to say, as taxes payable by him as the person assessed as owner of the land, was the act of the father. That again appears, in the absence of explanation, to be sufficient evidence of the assent of the father to the assessment of the land in the name of his son. Either the father assured himself personally in the usual way, by inspection of the notices, of the accuracy of the assessor's calculation, and instructed the son specifically to pay \"pursuant to the notice,\" or he left that business to the son. The son in either case would know, while, in the first case, both would have actual knowledge that the son was the person assessed. The son's knowledge being knowledge acquired in the course of the execution of his duty in this particular transaction, and being material to the transaction, it must, for the purpose of considering the legal effect of the transaction itself, be imputed to the father (Story par. 140). Mignault and Lamont JJ. contra.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014The taxes for 1920 were paid upon the assessment of the son, and they were paid by the father as owner of the land, although assessed in the name of the son, because the latter was acting as his father's agent, and therefore it may be inferred, there being nothing to the contrary, with his father's knowledge of the facts relating to the assessment, which had come into the son's possession in the course of his agency; and if the owner intended to question the assessment or taxation, that was surely the time to raise the objection; but no exception was taken, and not unnaturally the municipality proceeded upon the assessment in the following years in the manner which it had adopted in 1920; and the facts which are admitted or in proof should be held to justify a finding of acquiescence, or of leave and license of the respondents to do the acts complained of. The act is not injurious, and the proof constitutes a defence according to the maxim volenti non fit injuria. Not only is it to be inferred that the owner paid the taxes of 1920 with the knowledge that the assessment, which was a continuing assessment, was against his agent, to whom the statutory notices had been sent, but it would appear from the admission that his instructions continued to extend also to subse- quent years covered by the assessment of 1920, or at least to 1921. Therefore the municipality was entitled to proceed on the faith of the owner's acquiescence and consent. Mignault and Lamont JJ. contra.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014The appellant is not estopped from objecting to the wrongful assessment. The father did nothing which could in any way lead the assessor to believe that the son had become the owner of the land. Any agency which may have existed between the father and the son did not go further than an instruction to pay the taxes, which presupposed an assessment of the father rendering him liable to municipal taxation. There was no such assessment, and moreover the respondent Hinde never dealt with the son as an agent of his father, but as the owner of the land, which the respondent Hinde gratuitously assumed him to be. No knowledge by the father of the assessment of his son has been established, nor can such knowledge be inferred, the more so as the respondents took no steps to secure the testimony of the son, the onus of proving knowledge, as a basis for estoppel, being on them.\nPer Lamont J.\u2014According to the admission of facts, the son received instructions to pay the taxes in 1919, and \"pursuant to said instructions\" he paid in 1919 and 1920. The construction to be placed upon the language of this admission is that prior to the time he paid the taxes in 1919, the son had received general instructions from his father to pay the taxes on the land, and that, pursuant thereto, he paid them for two years. The admission does not justify the inference that the father gave instructions each year to pay the taxes, or that he had any knowledge that the land was assessed to his son in 1920. If the parties had intended by this admission to state that the father had given fresh instructions to his son each year, the admission would have been couched in different language.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (23 Alta. L.R. 113) aff. Mignault J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] affirming the judgment of Walsh J. [2]and dismissing the appellant's action in damages.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. and H. G. Nolan for the appellant.\nC. S. Ford K.C. for the respondents.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. DUFF J.\u2014The basis of the appellant's claim is that the lands in question were never assessed, that the sale was consequently a wrongful sale, and he claims reparation by way of damages.\nThe cardinal point in controversy concerns the validity of the assessment. Has the appellant established that there was no assessment upon which, under the statutory law of Alberta, the taxation of the testator's land could validly proceed?\nThe facts pertinent to this dispute about the assessment are these. The lands were assessed in the name of John F. Krumm for the year 1919 and for many years preceding. The assessor, the respondent, William Hind, in that year, having in response to a tax notice, in the usual form, addressed to John F. Krumm, received payment of the sum demanded, from Herbert Krumm, who was in fact a son of John F. Krumm, assumed from the form in which the payment was made (the particulars of which are not before us), that there had been a change of ownership; and in the following year, 1920, in course of a five-year (so called) assessment made in that year, the assessor, without further inquiry, changed the entry in the assessment roll, striking out the name of John F. Krumm as owner, and substituting therefor the name of Herbert Krumm. The roll containing this entry was finally completed by the assessor, and certified by the secretary, pursuant to the requirements of section 290, and no appeal was taken in respect of this assessment.\nIn point of fact there had been no change of ownership. John F. Krumm was still the owner, and Herbert Krumm possessed no interest in the property.\nBy reason of this erroneous statement of the fact of ownership, and of the circumstances in which the entry of the name of Herbert Krumm was made, the purported assessment is alleged to be in point of law no assessment at all, within the provisions of the assessment law of Alberta. More precisely, the purported assessment is impeached in this way. John F. Krumm had, as already mentioned, for many years been assessed as owner, had received the assessment notices and the tax notices, and in response thereto, had duly paid his taxes. The owner, for the present purpose, within the meaning of the Rural Municipality Act, is a person possessing a registered interest or an interest under an agreement for purchase expressed in writing.\nThe law, it is argued, requires that land be assessed in the name of the person who is the owner in the statutory sense, and this, it is said, is an essential condition of a valid assessment. It follows, it is contended, that the entry of the name of Herbert Krumm as owner, is, in law, no entry at all, and that the purported assessment, lacking one of the essential ingredients of an assessment, is void.\nFurther, it is contended that, before striking the name of John F. Krumm from the roll, the assessor was bound, it was his duty as assessor, at least to take the usual measures for ascertaining whether or not he was no longer interested as owner in the statutory sense. Common prudence would have suggested, it is argued, a search in the land registry office or communication with John F. Krumm himself. Neither of these obvious steps was taken. The assessor, in effecting the change under an impression produced by the communication from Herbert Krumm, was palpably departing from his statutory duty, it is argued, to investigate the facts before doing so.\nThe court below have held that this contention in both branches of it is completely answered by the terms of Section 290, already alluded to, and I come at once to an examination of that Section, in its bearing upon the facts in evidence. It is in these words.\n290. When the roll is finally completed the secretary shall over his signature, enter at the foot of the last page of the roll the following certificate filling in the date of such entry: \"Roll finally completed this * * * day of * * * 19 * *, and the roll as thus finally completed and certified to shall be valid and bind all parties concerned subject to amendment on appeal to the court of revision and to further amendment on appeal to the District Court Judge notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll, or any defect, error or misstatement in any notice required by this Act or any omission to deliver or to transmit any such notice.\nThis section, of course, only takes effect where there is an assessment roll within the meaning of the section, and where the impeached assessment is something which can be described as an assessment recorded in the roll. As to the roll, it is not disputed that it was prepared by a legally competent assessor professing to act generally in compliance with the requirements of the law, and that ex facie it does conform to those requirements. In form, it was duly completed by the assessor, and it was certified by the secretary, pursuant to section 290. It is, therefore, the assessment roll, within the meaning of section 27.4, and within the contemplation of section 290. The impugned entries constitute, ex facie, the record of an assessment which is part of the roll.\nThese being the facts, what is the effect of section 290? \"The roll,\" as thus finally completed and certified, and including the impeached assessment,\nshall be valid and bind all parties concerned subject to amendment on appeal, notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to the roll.\nThere is, I think, little or no doubt as to the force of these words. As regards any such \"defect or error,\" the conditions prescribed being fulfilled, the roll, as well as the assessments recorded in the roll, are to be deemed to be valid, and, among all parties concerned, the roll is to be taken as the unimpeachable record of those assessments.\nWas the deviation from the statutory directions which this case presents, a\ndefect or error committed in or with regard to the roll?\nOr, was it, on the contrary, as is contended, a deflection of a kind to which the protection of this enactment does not extend? That it involved such an \"error,\" hardly admits of dispute. Error, for our present purpose, cannot be better defined than in the words of the Oxford Dictionary.\nSomething incorrectly done through ignorance or inadvertence; a mistake, in calculation, judgment, speech, writings, action, etc.\nThe assessor's act in substituting Herbert Krumm's name for that of John F. Krumm seems to fall, in this sense, within the description \"error committed in or with regard to such roll.\" Nor can I agree that the facts in evidence impart to the assessor's act such a character as to remove the assessment from the ambit of section 290.\nFirst, it is to be observed that, in order to place a particular assessment beyond the operation of the section, it is not sufficient to establish that the blemish is of a kind which, but for the section, would have vitiated it in point of law. That is decided in the City of Wetaskiwin v. C. & E. Townsites Ltd.[3]. Nor is it enough, for this purpose, to show that the names of the persons interested in the property assessed have been omitted from the roll, and that the person whose name has been placed there has no interest in the property. Obviously, since everybody possessing an interest under a written agreement for purchase falls within the category of owner, such a rule would be impracticable; and section 261, which in such cases provides for an appeal by the same procedure as that prescribed where the complaint is against the valuation, shows that the statute does not so treat such a misstatement of the facts of ownership. A misstatement concerning those facts, may, of course, be specially noxious, inasmuch as the owner interested may, by reason of it, be deprived of the benefit of notice. But section 290, by explicit terms, embraces cases in which no notice has been sent, and the grievance arising from absence of notice may be just as serious where the omission of the true owner's name is natural or almost inevitable, as when it is due to culpable neglect. The fact that omission to transmit notice is a result or a concomitant of the error complained of, cannot, therefore, be a ground for holding the municipality disentitled to the benefit of section 290.\nNor can I discern any reason, founded in legal principle, for holding that this result accrues from the fact that the assessor's error arises from a palpable mistake of judgment or from negligence\u2014gross negligence, if you will. We are told that the entry must be regarded as non-existent. I cannot agree. Both in intent and in deed, in making the entry, the assessor was officially engaged in preparing the assessment roll. His bona fides, the genuineness of his belief that it was his duty to make the change, is not assailed. Besides, as already observed, the assessment forms part of the roll, which, by the express enactment of section 274, is the assessment roll of the municipality. Beyond doubt an appeal would have been competent, under section 261.\nI cannot understand upon what principle we can affirm that this assessment is so destitute of substance that there is nothing upon which section 290 can take effect. The assessor's act, to borrow an expression from the law af agency, was done in the course of his employment, and it was one of the class of acts which it was his official duty to do; and if he had been the agent of the municipality, the munici- pality would be responsible for his negligence. On this point we may perhaps receive some enlightenment from the decision of the Privy Council in the Shannon Realties Case[4]. The assessment authorities of a municipality, who were required by statute to value land, for assessment purposes, at its real value, had, during a series of years, disregarded the statutory rule, and had, designedly, as the trial judge found, assessed the lands in the municipality upon a different principle, and according to a scale which had no relation to their real value. The statutory rule had been deliberately discarded by the municipality. On that ground the assessment rolls for the years in question were attacked, in an action claiming a declaration of nullity, and in the courts of Quebec the assessments were set aside. In this court, the judgment of the Quebec courts was reversed, on the ground that there was a statutory remedy by way of appeal for grievances in respect of valuation, and that, as this remedy was available, notwithstanding the intentional departure from the statutory principle, the assessments could not be treated as nullities. The Quebec legislation, which was there applied, contains no curative provision such as section 290, but the decision illustrates the distinction between nullity, resulting from incompetency, and mere illegality, in the sense of a culpable failure to observe a statutory direction in the performance of official duty. The decision of this court was confirmed by the Judicial Committee.\nI am not quite convinced that, in testing the appellant's contention, one can admit any real distinction between an error in the identification of the owner and an error consisting in a departure from the statutory rule governing valuation. Section 252 of the Alberta Act prescribes this rule,\nLand shall be assessed at its actual cash value as it would be appraised in payment of a just debt from a short debtor.\nThe right of appeal in respect of a misstatement in relation to ownership is given in the same section (Sec. 261), and uno flatu, with the right of appeal in respect of excessive or insufficient valuation; and the procedure in appeal is identical in the two classes of cases. If error springing from negligence, gross negligence, if you like, when it relates to the first matter, is a good ground for affirming non-existence of the assessment, and for holding that the rehabilitating operation of section 290 does not come into play, there is at least no patently necessary reason for affirming that, in the matter of valuation, violation of the statutory rule, originating in similar derelictions, is entirely without effect upon the legal validity of the assessor's proceedings. Absence of notice is not important here, because, as we have observed, in the scheme of section 290, absence of notice is immaterial.\nIt would not be suggested that an excessive valuation in deliberate disregard of the rule of sec 252, or due to the assessor's indifference to his duty, or to his rash acceptance of some erroneous and unjustifiable assumption of fact, would not be appealable under section 261 et seq. Neither would it be suggested that a person aggrieved by an assessment so effected, could, on that ground alone, permit the opportunity of appealing to pass, and then successfully attack the assessment as a nullity, in, for example, an action against him for taxes. The admission of a right of attack in such circumstances might\u2014it is self-evident\u2014reduce the system of municipal taxation and the municipal finances associated therewith to a state of disorder.\nNor do I observe any ground for holding that, superadded to the error committed by the assessor, there was any other element, the presence of which has the effect of removing the case from the operation of section 290. Fraud is not alleged or suggested. I am unable to escape the conclusion that the assessor's delinquency falls wholly within the intendment of the words \"error committed in or with regard to such roll.\"\nBut there is another answer to the appellant's claim, Herbert Krumm must have become aware of the change in the assessment, in consequence of the assessment notice and the tax notice which he received in 1920. Indeed the tax notice, itself, would inform him that the taxes were due by him as the person assessed (section 298). In the admissions of facts, it is stated that he\npaid the taxes on the said lands for the year 1920 pursuant to the said tax notice;\nthat is to say, he paid the taxes, as the person from whom they had been demanded, and by whom they were due. From paragraph 20 of the admissions, it appears that this payment was made \"pursuant to the instructions\" of John F. Krumm. This last statement may mean that the act of paying the taxes according to the notice was performed under the specific instructions of the father, or, and this seems the preferable reading, that the son had instructions to pay the taxes for the year 1920, and that his act in paying them, in the circumstances, was within the scope of the authority conveyed by those instructions. On either construction, the son was acting within the scope of his employment in doing the very thing it is admitted he did; that is to say paying the taxes for the year 1920 \"pursuant to the tax notice\" for that year. In either view, the conclusion necessarily results, that the very act of the son in paying the taxes for 1920, as the person liable to pay them, as the person assessed, was the act of the father.\nThere is another way of putting it. Either the father assured himself personally in the usual way, by inspection of the notices, of the accuracy of the assessor's calculation, and instructed the son specifically to pay \"pursuant to the notice,\" or, as paragraph 20 would seem to suggest, he left that business to the son. The son in either case would know, while, in the first case, both would have actual knowledge that the son was the person assessed. The son's knowledge being knowledge acquired in the course of the execution of his duty in this particular transaction, and being material to the transaction, it must, for the purpose of considering the legal effect of the transaction itself, be imputed to the father (Story par. 140).\nBefore passing to the effect of this on the present controversy, it should be noticed that, as between the appellant and the respondents, the appellant's opportunities of knowledge, in relation to these things, are peculiar, if not exclusive, and this circumstance must be considered in determining the sufficiency of the facts proved to establish a prima facie case (Stephen, Evidence Act. 96d). I think the rule by which courts govern themselves, in practice, is thus correctly stated by the editors of the last edition of Taylor on Evidence;\nWhere the facts lie peculiarly within the knowledge of one of the parties very slight evidence may be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof resting upon the other party (2 Taylor, on Evidence 285). My conclusion, then is, that the facts admitted afford sufficient evidence to establish, at least prima facie, that the act of Herbert Krumm in paying the taxes of 1920, as demanded from him, that is to say, as taxes payable by him as the person assessed as owner of the land, was the act of John F. Krumm.\nThat again appears, in the absence of explanation, to be sufficient evidence of the assent of John F. Krumm to the assessment of the land in the name of the son. Such conduct must be considered from the point of view, neither of the Krumms exclusively, nor of the assessor exclusively. It must be regarded from both points of view. The question is, what interpretation ought a reasonable man in the Krumms' situation, engaged in transacting such business, to have anticipated, as that likely to be ascribed by the assessment authorities to Herbert Krumm's act in paying the taxes, as he did, pursuant to the tax notice? The question seems to admit of only one answer. There can be no doubt there was here sufficient evidence of assent (See Rullell v. Toronto [5] and Ewing v. Dominion Bank[6].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action brought by the appellant as executor of the late John F. Krumm, claiming damages for the loss, through the negligence of the respondents, of a property belonging to the deceased, and which was sold at a municipal tax sale. The plaintiff apparently considered that he could not impeach the sale as against the purchaser, so his action, which is an action in damages for the loss of his land by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondents, is for the value of the property and his expenses.\nJohn F. Krumm, who died on July 19th, 1925, was the registered owner of a half section of unoccupied land in the municipal district of Shepard, no. 220. His address was Philo, Illinois, U.S.A. From 1907 until 1919, he was assessed, under his own name and with that address, by the respondent municipality, or its predecessor in interest, for this land, and tax notices were mailed to him, addressed to Philo, Illinois. Herbert Krumm, the son of John F. Krumm, paid the taxes on the land for 1919 and 1920, and the tax receipts were sent to him. In 1920, the respondent Hinde, secretary-treasurer and assessor of the municipality, assessed \"H. Krumm, Philo, Ill, U.S.A.\" as the owner of the land in question. Hinde made no inquiries at the land titles office to ascertain who was the registered owner of the half section, but assumed, when he received the money for the taxes of 1919 from Herbert Krumm, that the latter had become the owner of the land, either by succession or otherwise. From and including 1920, the assessment and tax notices were sent to Herbert Krumm.\nThe 1921 taxes were not paid. Tax sale proceedings with respect to this land were taken under the provisions of chapter 122 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1922, a caveat having been lodged by the municipality in the land titles office. On December 31, 1924, the certificate of title in the name of John F. Krumm was cancelled, and a new certificate of title in the name of the municipal district of Shepard, no. 220, was issued by the registrar. Finally the land was sold by the municipal district to one Chas. Horrill for $5,476.72, the sale agreement bearing date the 5th of May, 1925.\nTo complete the statement of pertinent facts, reference must be made to some correspondence which was placed in the record at the trial. There is first a letter by John F. Krumm to Hinde, dated May 9, 1919, asking that an account of taxes due on this land be sent to him, to which Hinde answered on May 17, 1919, that the assessment was not yet quite complete, but that notices would be sent out within the next week or so. Then Herbert Krumm having paid the 1919 taxes, a receipt was mailed to him on October 1, 1919, marked \"Received from Herbert Krumm (change initial to H\".) A similar receipt, save the entry \"change initial to H\", was sent to Herbert Krumm on December 1, 1920, for the 1920 taxes. Then we find a letter from Hinde to \"Mr. H. Krumm, Philo, Illinois, U.S.A.\", dated October 29, 1924, stating that the land was on the municipality's caveat list for arrears of taxes for the years 1921 to 1923, that the caveat had expired and that the council had passed a resolution to take title to the land unless the taxes, amounting to $590.47, were paid before December 15. Apparently this letter was not answered, and on February 10, 1925, Hinde wrote to H. Krumm that the land would be offered for sale on the 28th of that month, unless the arrears of taxes and costs to the amount of $796.52 were paid. The final letter from Hinde was sent on March 26, 1925, to \"Mrs. Effie Krumm, Philo, Illinois, U.S.A.\" (Hinde took her to be the widow of John F. Krumm), saying that an offer of $17 per acre for the land had been received, payable by instalments, and asking whether that offer, which would leave a substantial balance for the owner after payment of taxes, should be accepted. Herbert Krumm answered this letter, on March 31, 1925, saying that the offer would be accepted.\nAs above stated, John F. Krumm died on the 19th of July, 1925. The only witness called at the trial was Hinde, the secretary-treasurer and assessor. The parties, however, made some written admissions, the last of which is that John F. Krumm instructed Herbert Krumm to pay the taxes on the lands, and that the latter paid the same for 1919 and 1920,\nand intended to pay the taxes for the year 1921 but overlooked doing so.\nIt may be added that under section 251 of the Municipal District Act (chapter 3 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1911 and 1912, and amendments), the assessment made in 1920 stood for the five year period beginning in that year, subject to sending out tax notices each year to every person whose name appeared on the assessment roll (sect. 298).\nIt will not be necessary to deal in any detail with the provisions of the Municipal District Act (1) with respect to municipal assessment for taxes. The assessment is of the owner or occupant of land in the municipality (sect. 251), and \"owner\" means and includes any person who appears by the records of the land titles office to have any right, title or interest in the land, other than that of a mortgagee, lessee or encumbrancee (subsect. 8 of sect. 2). The name of the owner and his post office address, if known, are entered upon the assessment roll (sect. 251), and upon completion of the roll the assessor is directed to forthwith mail to each person whose name appears on the roll a notice of his assessment (sect. 257). If the name of the\n(1) The 1911-1912 enactment was called The Rural Municipality Act. The name is now The Municipal District Act, c. 110, R.S.A. The numbering of the sections here is that of the 1911-1912 statute under which the assessment was made. owner is not known and cannot after reasonable inquiry be ascertained, the land is deemed to be duly assessed if entered on the roll with a note stating that such owner is unknown (sect. 255). Assessment notices are issued only in the years in which an assessment is made (sect. 257), but tax notices are sent each year (sect. 298).\nWhen this assessment was made in 1920, there was no intention whatever to assess John F. Krumm, the registered owner of the land. Hinde, the assessor, quite frankly states that upon receiving the 1919 taxes from Herbert Krumm, he assumed that the latter was owner of the land and that John F. Krumm was dead. He never dealt with Herbert Krumm as agent for John F. Krumm, and it was Herbert Krumm alone whom he intended to assess and who in fact was assessed for the land belonging to his father. Hinde could easily have found out who was the real owner of the land by inspecting the records of the land titles office, but he neglected doing so until the land was sold and it was desired to give a title to the purchaser. This is all the more remarkable as for some twelve years John F. Krumm had been assessed as owner, and as late as May 9, 1919, had written to Hinde, asking for an account of taxes due on his land. The good faith of Hinde is not in question; the mistake he made, however, was in no way induced by John F. Krumm, and he was negligent in not having made an inquiry before assessing the land in the name of another.\nUnder these circumstances, the decisions and the enactments relied on by the respondents have no application. This is not the case of a mistake made in the name of the person intended to be assessed, or of the effect of the curative section of the statute (sect. 290) validating the roll, notwithstanding any defect, error or misstatement. The assessor did here what he intended to do, and negligently assessed a third person as the owner of John F. Krumm's land. As far as John F. Krumm was concerned, there was no assessment whatever.\nThe respondent relies on subsection 3 of section 12 of the Tax Recovery Act, 1922 (c. 25 of the Alberta statutes for 1922), which states that a duplicate certificate of title purporting to be issued under the authority of that Act, shall be conclusive evidence of the compliance with all conditions precedent to the issue of such certificate, and its validity shall not be questioned in any court of law or equity.\nBut this action is not based on the illegality of the certificate of title. The plaintiff does not seek to recover his land for which the certificate of title issued, and which was sold by the municipal district. He recognizes that he cannot get the land back, but he claims damages for the wrongful act of Hinde in negligently assessing a third person as owner of his land, by reason of which, and of the subsequent sale, his land was lost. No question arises as to the liability of the municipal district for these damages, for counsel for the municipality, at the hearing, assumed responsibility for what Hinde had done.\nI see no basis for the contention of the respondents founded on estoppel. John F. Krumm did nothing which could in any way lead the assessor to believe that Herbert Krumm had become the owner of the land. Any agency which may have existed between John F. Krumm and Herbert Krumm did not go further than an instruction to pay the taxes, which presupposed an assessment of John F. Krumm rendering him liable to municipal taxation. There was no such assessment, and moreover Hinde never dealt with Herbert Krumm as an agent of John F. Krumm, but as the owner of the land, which Hinde gratuitously assumed him to be. No knowledge by John F. Krumm of the assessment of Herbert Krumm has been established, nor can such knowledge be inferred, the more so as the respondents took no steps to secure the testimony of Herbert Krumm, the onus of proving knowledge, as a basis for estoppel, being on them. With great respect, I think the judgments of the courts below cannot be supported.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and remit the case to the trial court for the assessment of damages.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The deceased, who resided at Philo, Illinois, was the registered owner of unoccupied waste land in the province of Alberta, upon which he had been paying taxes for many years. On 9th May, 1919, he wrote the respondent Hinde, who was the secretary-treasurer of the respondent municipality, within the limits of which the land lies, asking for a statement of the amount due for taxes on the \"S. \u00bd Sec. 5, Lot 28, Block 23, Rge. 28, Mer. 4,\" the land in question. The answer was that the assessment was not then quite complete, but that the writer, the respondent, Hinde, hoped to send out notices within the next week or so. Subsequently notice of the assessment for 1919 was sent to the deceased, also the taxation notice, and he instructed his son Herbert Krumm, who also lived at Philo, Illinois, to pay the taxes. There is no evidence of any further communication, from or to, between the deceased, who died in 1925, and the municipality or its officers. It is admitted that none was sent by or for the municipality. The subsequent proceedings with regard to the lands are, in these circumstances, somewhat remarkable. Herbert Krumm paid the taxes in 1919 in due course, but the respondent, Hinde, who conducted the business of the municipality, and whose probity is not questioned, supposing, apparently because Herbert had paid the taxes, that he must therefore have become the owner of the property, but, without consulting the registry to ascertain the fact, made up the assessment of 1920 in the name of Herbert, prepared and sent the assessment and taxation notices for that year in the name of and to the latter, and received payment of those taxes from him. That assessment became by statute the governing assessment for five years. No further taxes were paid, although, for the succeeding years, the requisite taxation notices in the name of Herbert were sent to him. Tax recovery proceedings were consequently taken under the Tax Recovery Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 122, resulting, on 31st October, 1924, in the existing certificate of title of the deceased being cancelled and a new certificate issued in the name of the respondent municipality. Section 12 of the Act provides as follows:\n12. (1) If any parcel of land is not redeemed within one year from the filing of a caveat in respect thereof the treasurer shall issue a transfer to the municipality within whose area the parcel of land is situated and file a memorandum of such issue in the proper Land Titles Office, whereupon the Registrar shall cancel the certificate of title to such parcel and register the municipality as owner of such parcel and issue a new duplicate certificate of title to it.\n(2) A memorandum shall be entered upon the certificate of title and also upon any new duplicate certificate reserving the privilege of redemption in accordance with the terms of this Act.\n(3) A duplicate certificate of title purporting to be issued under the authority of this Act shall be conclusive evidence of the compliance with all conditions precedent to the issue of such certificate and its validity shall not be questioned in any court of law or equity. The municipality assumes responsibility for what was done, or neglected to be done, by its secretary-treasurer, the respondent, Hinde.\nIn these circumstances the appellant, the executor of the deceased John F. Krumm, claims to recover the value of the land, which was lost to the estate by reason of the alleged illegal and unauthorized proceedings of the municipality, and its secretary-treasurer, in subjecting the land to the provisions of the Tax Recovery Act, without any assessment of the owner or notice to him, and it would appear that the vesting of the land in the municipality was a direct and natural consequence of the proceedings which were taken.\nSo far as the case has been stated, it would seem that the municipality has adopted a course which deprived the owner of any notice or chance of notice which the law contemplates or requires for his protection. It is not a mere irregularity, oversight or omission in the matter of procedure or detail of which the appellant complains; it is the initial act of assessment, which, not only did not operate against the owner, but directed the course of the proceedings in a manner inevitably to escape all contact with the owner\u2014a deliberate ex parte proceeding, and I am not satisfied to accept an interpretation of the statute which holds him nevertheless bound.\nIt is extraordinary however that no explanation comes from Philo, Illinois, except as stated in the admissions, and the last of these is very significant. It reads:\nThat the said John F. Krumm instructed the said Herbert Krumm to pay the taxes on said lands and said Herbert Krumm did pay same pursuant to the said instructions for the years 1919 and 1920, and intended to pay the taxes for the year 1921 but overlooked doing so.\nNow the taxes for 1920 were paid upon the assessment of Herbert Krumm, and they were paid by John F. Krumm, as owner of the land, although assessed in the name of Herbert, because the latter was acting as his father's agent, and therefore I think it may be inferred, there being nothing to the contrary, with his father's knowledge of the facts relating to the assessment, which had come into Herbert's possession in the course of his agency; and if the owner intended to question the assessment or taxation, that was surely the time to raise the objection; but no exception was taken, and not unnaturally the municipality proceeded upon the assessment in the following years in the manner which it had adopted in 1920; and now, when the facts are presented which are admitted or in proof, I think they should be held to justify a finding of acquiescence, or of leave and license of the defendants to do the acts complained of. The fact is that the act is not injurious, and the proof constitutes a defence according to the maxim volenti non fit injuria. Not only is it to be inferred that the owner paid the taxes of 1920 with the knowledge that the assessment, which was a continuing assessment, was against his agent, to whom the statutory notices had been sent, but it would appear from the admission that his instructions continued to extend also to subsequent years covered by the assessment of 1920, or at least to 1921, because it is admitted that the agent\nintended to pay the taxes for the year 1921, but overlooked doing so.\nTherefore, in the circumstances I think the municipality was entitled to proceed on the faith of the owner's acquiescence and consent. It may aptly be said in the language of Willes J., in Davies v. Marshall[7], upon the evidence as it stands, that either the owner\nactually gave his consent to the doing of the acts complained of, or that he so conducted himself that a reasonable man might fairly conclude that he did give that consent. Conduct in a court of common law often does amount to an estoppel, and is evidence of leave and license which is incapable of being controverted.\nI would for this reason dismiss the appeal.\nLAMONT J.\u2014The facts in this case are not in dispute. With the exception of the evidence of the defendant, William Hinde, and certain documents, the case was tried on admissions of fact made by the parties. Briefly the facts are that at all times material John F. Krumm was the registered owner of the lands in question (322 acres); that from 1907 to 1919 inclusive, he was assessed as owner thereof by the defendant District and its predecessor, the Local Improvement District. On May 9, 1919, John F. Krumm wrote to the defendant Hinde, who was secretary-treasurer of the defendant District, asking for the amount of the taxes due on his land. On August 26, 1919, Hinde sent him the tax notice and on October 1 Herbert Krumm forwarded to Hinde $137.55, the amount of taxes claimed in the notice. A receipt for the money was sent to Herbert Krumm and on the stub of the receipt kept in his book Hinde made a note to \"change the initial to H.\" When making up the assessment roll for 1920, Hinde dropped the name John F. Krumm as assessed owner of the land in question and inserted that of Herbert Krumm, and thereafter all notices and communications were sent to Herbert Krumm.\nThe reason given by Hinde for making the change was that John F. Krumm had always been very punctual in the payment of his taxes and as he had written in 1919 for his tax notice and a few months later the taxes were forwarded by Herbert Krumm in his own name, he assumed that John F. Krumm was no longer living and that Herbert Krumm had become the owner. Herbert paid the taxes for 1920, but thereafter no taxes were paid in respect of the land. The taxes for 1921 not being paid the district, in October, 1922, commenced proceedings to have the land forfeited for taxes and, on December 1, 1924, the certificate of title of the said land in the name of John F. Krumm was cancelled and a new certificate was issued to the district. On July 5, 1925, the District sold the land for some $2,000 less than its assessed value. In July, 1925, John F. Krumm died, and in the following October his executor brought this action in which he claims damages for the illegal sale of the land.\nThe argument on behalf of the plaintiff is that the taxes for which the land was sold had not been legally imposed, in that the defendant Hinde, who was the assessor of the District as well as its secretary-treasurer, in making the assessment roll for the year 1920, assessed the land to Herbert Krumm; that he did this without any request to do so and without making inquiry as required by the statute to ascertain who was the real owner; that this breach of the statutory provision rendered the assessment not merely erroneous and defective, but prevented it being an assessment at all because an essential constituent of an assessment\u2014namely the name of the owner as ascertained by inquiry\u2014was entirely lacking. The argument on behalf of the defendants is twofold:\n1. That on the facts admitted, John F. Krumm knew that the land was assessed to Herbert Krumm in 1920, and, knowing that, he instructed Herbert to pay the taxes for that year, and is therefore estopped from objecting to the assessment in Herbert's name.\n2. That in any event the curative section of the Municipal District Act (s. 290) applies and has the effect of validating the assessment roll withstanding any error or defect therein.\nIf either of these contentions made by the defendants be upheld, the plaintiff's action must fail.\nThe first contention, in my opinion, cannot be upheld. The admission which is relied upon as establishing knowledge on the part of John F. Krumm that the land was assessed to his son Herbert in 1920, is as follows:\u2014\n20. That the said John F. Krumm instructed the said Herbert Krumm to pay the taxes on said lands and said Herbert Krumm did pay same pursuant to the said instructions for the years 1919 and 1920, and intended to pay the taxes for the year 1921 but overlooked doing so.\nAccording to this admission Herbert Krumm received instructions to pay the taxes in 1919, and \"pursuant to said instructions\" he paid in 1919 and 1920. The construction which, in my opinion, should be placed upon the language of this admission is that prior to the time he paid the taxes in 1919, Herbert Krumm had received general instructions from his father to pay the taxes on this land, and that, pursuant thereto, he paid them for two years. I cannot read the admission as justifying the inference that John F. Krumm gave instructions each year to pay the taxes, or that he had any knowledge that the land was assessed to his son in 1920. If the parties had intended by this admission to state that John F. Krumm had given fresh instructions to his son each year, I think the admission would have been couched in different language.\nIt was also suggested that in view of the fact that Herbert Krumm and his father lived in the same town and were members of the same family, and of the fact that Herbert who could have given definite evidence on the point, did not appear at the trial, very slight evidence would justify the inference of knowledge on the part of the father that the land had been assessed to Herbert. The short answer to this suggestion, in my opinion, is, that the onus of establishing knowledge on the part of John F. Krumm was on the defendants and that they chose to go to trial without the evidence of Herbert Krumm, and on admissions made on behalf of the plaintiff. If the admissions are not sufficient to establish a point material to the defence, the defendants have only themselves to blame for not having the point clearly covered by the admissions.\nThe next question is: Does s. 290 apply so as to validate the assessment of the land in the name of Herbert Krumm for the year 1920, without any inquiry by the assessor as to whether or not there had been any change in ownership. S. 290 reads as follows:\u2014\nWhen the roll is finally completed the Secretary shall over his signature enter at the foot of the last page of the roll the the following Certicate, filling in the date of such entry: Roll finally completed this * * day of * * *, 19 *, and the Roll as thus finally completed and certified to shall be valid and binding on all parties concerned, subject to amendment on appeal to the Court of Revision and to further Amendment on appeal to the District Court Judge, notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll, or any defect, error or misstatement in any notice required by this Act, or any omission to deliver or transmit any such notice.\nThe roll which by this section is made binding upon all parties concerned is the roll which the Act contemplated the assessor would make. If in that roll there appears an assessment which was beyond the jurisdiction of the assessor to make, s. 290 cannot be invoked to validate that assessment. City of Wetaskiwin v. C. & E. Townsites Limited[8]. To ascertain therefore, whether it was competent for the assessor to place the name of Herbert Krumm on the roll as owner of the land in question without inquiring if there had been a change of ownership, necessitates an examination of the statutory provisions authorizing the assessor to make the assessment.\nThe Act provides that all land not exempt shall be liable to assessment and taxation and that it shall be the duty of the assessor to make the assessment of such land in the manner hereinafter provided. The manner provided is set out in sections 251, 254 and 255 of the Act, which read as follows: 251. As soon as may be in each year but not later than the first day of July the assessor shall assess every person the owner or occupant of land in the municipality and shall prepare an assessment roll in which shall be set out as accurately as may be,\n(a) The name of the owner of every lot or parcel of land in the municipality which is liable to assessment * * *.\n(b) A brief description of each such lot or parcel of land, the number of acres which it contains and the assessed value thereof. * * *\n254. It shall be the duty of every person whose land is assessable to give to the assessor all information necessary to enable him to make up the roll; but no statement made by any such person shall bind the assessor or shall excuse him from making inquiry as to its correctness. * * *\n255. If the assessor does not know and cannot after reasonable inquiry ascertain the name of the owner of any unoccupied lot or parcel of land in the municipality the same shall be deemed to be duly assessed if entered on the roll with a note stating that such owner is unknown.\nTo be an assessment within the contemplation of the statute the property assessed must be taxable, otherwise there is no subject matter upon which s. 290 can operate. Toronto Railway v. City of Toronto[9].\nGiven taxable property an assessment to be valid, as was pointed out by the present Chief Justice of this court in the Wetaskiwin Case[10], must possess two essential constituents (1) Designation of owner, and (2) Description of property. With the former of these only are we concerned here. Under the above quoted sections the statutory duty of the assessor is to set down the name of the owner \"as accurately as may be.\" That implies diligent inquiry on his part as is shewn by sections 254 and 255. That such is the assessor's duty cannot, in my opinion, be doubted, but the question is: Does a failure to make reasonable inquiry go to the assessor's jurisdiction so as to make him incompetent to enter any name on the roll as owner until after inquiry, or would an entry without inquiry be simply a failure to observe a statutory procedure for performing a duty wholly within his jurisdiction? If the former the entry would be null ab initio; if the latter it would be an irregularity which s. 290 would cure. Upon this point my brother Duff, in La Ville St. Michel v. Shannon Realties Limited[11], expressed an opinion which is very apposite here. At page 435 he said:\u2014 Where you have authority to do a certain class of acts coupled with a rule prescribing the manner in which the act is to be done or prohibiting the doing of it in a given way, you may always have the question whether the rule imports a limitation of authority; and whether it does or does not import a limitation of authority is a question to be decided on the construction of the instrument creating the authority viewed in light of the circumstances and the object and purpose for which the authority is given.\nIn that case the statutory mandate which had not been observed was that taxable property \"shall be assessed according to its real value\"; and this court held that notwithstanding the failure of the assessor to observe this statutory direction in making the assessment, the roll had been made within the powers of the municipal corporation. That decision was affirmed by the Privy Council[12]. In the judgment given by their Lordships the rule was laid down that\nwhere alternative constructions are equally open, that alternative is to be chosen which will be consistent with the smooth working of the system which the statute purports to be regulating; and that alternative is to be rejected which will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the working of the system.\nTheir Lordships, at page 193, further said:\nIn this view it is of cardinal importance to consider what is the remedy provided for the situation in which a ratepayer or body of ratepayers has been put by a valuation roll which is said to be illegal and invalid by reason either of error in its particular items, or by reason of fundamental error in principle. Once such a roll appears, the statute steps in to provide a remedy to \"every person who, personally or as representing another person, deems himself aggrieved by the roll as drawn up,\" and the appeal is to state \"the grounds of his complaint.\" What the Act provides by way of prescription of appeal is to give by that means a remedy for a grievance which is complained of.\nIn the present case, we have a failure to observe the statutory direction for ascertaining the owner of the property assessed. Can such a failure affect the jurisdiction of the assessor to make the roll to any greater extent than a failure to follow the statutory direction in valuing the property? In my opinion it cannot. Yet the above mentioned cases shew that a failure to follow the statutory direction as to valuation does not deprive the assessor of jurisdiction where the statute provides a remedy by way of appeal for improper valuation.\nS. 258 of the Act provides that it shall be the duty of the assessor, within two weeks after the completion of the roll, to post up a notice that the roll is open for inspection and that any ratepayer desiring to object to the assessment of himself or any other person must lodge his complaint within twenty days. S. 261 provides that if any person thinks his name or the name of any other person has been wrongfully inserted in or omitted from the roll, he may, within the said twenty days, lodge a complaint with the secretary. Such a complaint constitutes an appeal to the Court of Revision, and from a decision of the Court of Revision the statute provides a further appeal to the District Court Judge. Although he might have appealed against the substitution of Herbert Krumm's name for his own, John F. Krumm did not do so. He would, therefore, appear to come within the principle of the above mentioned decisions.\nIt was argued on his behalf that his failure to appeal did not bring him within these decisions because in those cases the persons who failed to appeal had received notice of assessment, whereas in the present case it is admitted that no notice had been sent to John F. Krumm. The fact that no notice was sent to him does not, in my opinion, affect the validity of the assessment, for by s. 290 the roll is declared to be binding notwithstanding any omission to deliver or transmit any notice required by the Act.\nThe roll shews an assessable person, Herbert Krumm, designated as owner. It also shews the land properly described. The posting up of a notice by the assessor informing every ratepayer that the roll was open for inspection, and that he had a right of appeal if he was not satisfied with the assessment, gave John F. Krumm an efficient remedy for the grievance of which his executor now complains.\nIt was also urged upon us that if the assessor could validly enter the name of Herbert Krumm on the roll without making any inquiry as to his ownership of the land for which he was assessed, he could, with equal validity, do the same for every parcel of land on the roll. In my opinion that does not follow. If the assessor set down a series of names as owners, without inquiry and without a belief that they had any interest in the property of which he designated them owners, he would not be preparing the roll contemplated by the statute and his action in so doing might, it seems to me, be considered a fraudulent exercise of his powers. That question, however, does not arise here. It is not suggested that in assessing the land to Herbert Krumm, Assessor Hinde had any other motive than that of carrying out the duty which, under the statute, devolved upon him. His alteration of the assessment was an error which he made through drawing a wrong inference from certain facts before him, but in making that alteration he was endeavouring to compile the roll called for by the statute.\nThe object of the legislation was to make provision for the distribution of the burden of the municipality's financial obligations over the taxable lands of the municipality according to their respective values. To attain that object it was necessary to have a time fixed beyond which the legality of the assessment could not be questioned, so as to insure that each parcel of land would bear its proper share of the burden.\nIt was also necessary once an assessment was made, that no uncertainty should exist as to the right of the municipality to obtain the taxes levied (if unpaid) out of the land by forfeiture proceedings. That forfeiture proceedings are drastic and in some cases work hardship is beside the question. The Legislature in passing the Act no doubt foresaw the possibility of an owner being deprived of his land through non-payment of the taxes levied against it by reason of forgetfulness or inattention on his part, but it evidently concluded that a want of finality in reference to the assessment or a want of certainty as to the municipality's right to recover the taxes out of the land, with its consequent derangement of the municipal finances, would be a much greater evil.\nAn owner of taxable land in a municipality is supposed to know that his land is liable to such taxation as the municipality under the law may impose. If he does not receive notice of what has been assessed against him he is not, in my opinion, justified in concluding that no taxes have been levied against his land,. The language of sections 258, 260 and 261, would seem to indicate that the Legislature in passing the Act did not consider an owner free from all responsibility for the correct assessment of his land. Knowing that his land is subject to taxation he is presumed to know what may follow if the taxes are not paid.\nIn view of the object and purposes of the Act and the necessity of securing finality in the assessment to prevent confusion in the municipal finances, I am of opinion that the statutory mandate to set down the name of the owner \"as accurately as may be\" should be construed as a direction to the assessor relating to the procedure to be adopted and not as a limitation on his competence to make the assessment. The assessor's failure to observe this statutory procedure was no doubt an error on his part, but, in my opinion, it was error in regard to the roll, which s. 290 was intended to cure.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nSMITH J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1927) 23 Alta.

The actions were settled. The company disputed its liability for payment, in large part, of the solicitor\u2019s bill, on the ground that the litigation was merely a contest between opposing bodies of shareholders, in which the company, as such, had no interest, that the company should have adopted a neutral attitude and merely submitted its rights to the court, and that the retainers in the terms in which they were given were consequently ultra vires and of no effect, and that, even if the solicitor was justified in taking up for the company the burden of the litigation, the bills of costs showed that the services rendered in the negotiations leading to settlement were for the benefit of individual directors whose shares, as a result thereof, were sold or transferred, and not for the benefit of the company or under its instructions.\nHeld: The company was liable. As, in the litigation in which the costs were incurred, certain resolutions of the directors and issues of shares by the company, which must now, on the record, be taken as valid and regular, were impeached, the costs of defending the company and directors in respect thereof should be borne by the company. As corporate acts of the company were impeached, it could not be said that the solicitor should have held merely a watching brief for it. As to the services rendered in negotiations for settlement, the company had a vital interest in having the litigation speedily terminated, and, on the evidence, it was impossible to hold that they were rendered on behalf of any person other than the company; the test to be applied, in the circumstances, to determine on whose behalf the solicitor was acting, was not \u201ccould he have rendered the services without instructions from some one other than the company?\u201d, but rather \u201cwere the services reasonably necessary to procure a settlement of the litigation in which the company was involved?\u201d\nWhile it is a well established rule that directors may not use the company\u2019s funds in payment of their own costs, although such costs would not have been incurred if they had not been directors (5 Hals., p. 227), yet it is equally well established that directors acting as such within such of the company\u2019s powers as are confided to them, and without gross negligence, cannot be called upon to pay out of their own funds the costs of defending resolutions passed by them in the interests of the company, simply because a plaintiff has chosen to make them individually co-defendants (Breay v. Royal British Nurses\u2019 Assn., [1897] 2 Ch. 272).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Grant J.[2] which dismissed an appeal by the present appellant from the report of the Taxing Officer at Toronto made upon the taxation of certain bills of costs rendered by the respondents to the appellant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs. H.H. Davis and H.E. Manning for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Second Divisional Court (Ont.), dismissing an appeal from an order made by Mr. Justice Grant, confirming a report of the taxing officer in reference to the taxation of certain solicitor and client bills of costs. In his report the taxing officer says:\nThe bills are for services rendered by the Solicitors in connection with certain actions in which the Northern Life Assurance Company and its directors were joined as defendants and the evidence shows the Solicitors were retained in these actions to represent the company and certain of the directors, their retainers in each case being in accordance with a resolution passed at a Directors\u2019 meeting.\nThe contention is now advanced by those opposing the bill that the litigation in question was merely a contest between two opposing bodies of shareholders in which the Company as such had no interest, that in these circumstances the Company should have adopted a neutral attitude and contented itself with submitting its right to the Court and the retainers in the terms in which they were given were consequently ultra vires and of no effect. If this contention is correct it follows that practically all the solicitor and client charges made against the Company in the bills must be disallowed.\nAfter considering the matter from the point of view of the solicitor, the company, and the directors, the taxing officer rejected the contention of the company, holding that, as the validity of the allotments of certain shares of its stock was involved, the interest of the company in the litigation was a most substantial one. This ruling was approved by Mr. Justice Grant on appeal to him, and by the Divisional Court.\nBefore us the company urged the contention it had advanced before the taxing officer, and submitted the further argument that, even if the solicitor was justified in taking up for the company the burden of the litigation, the bills of costs rendered, particularly the general bill, shew that the services rendered by the solicitor in the negotiations which led up to the final settlement were rendered for the benefit of the individual directors whose shares, as a result thereof, were sold and transferred, and not for the benefit of the company or under its instructions.\nThere were four actions in all. They arose out of an attempt on part of certain shareholders to obtain control of the company. In two of these the company, and the directors individually, were defendants; in the third the company and one Roadhouse, while in the fourth the company was plaintiff. In each case by a resolution of the board of directors Mr. McMaster was retained on behalf of the company and also on behalf of the individual directors, in the actions in which they were co-defendants.\nIn the first action\u2014McKnight v. Purdom et al\u2014the plaintiff sought, inter alia, to set aside the confirmation to T.H. Purdom by the board of directors of an allotment of 2,219 shares in the company\u2019s capital stock, and to set aside an allotment and issue to S.C. Tweed of 830 shares of the company\u2019s treasury stock, on the following grounds:\n1. That the 2,219 shares standing in the name of T.H. Purdom in the books of the company, and on which he had voted for years, did not belong to him but were shares originally subscribed for by others, but which had been surrendered to the company and which, after being surrendered, Purdom caused to be entered in the books as shares belonging to himself, and\n2. That the allotment and issue of 830 shares to S.C. Tweed was simply a sham and was carried out as part of a previously arranged scheme to enable the Purdom interests to keep control of the company.\nIt is, no doubt, a well established rule that directors may not use the funds of the company in payment of their own costs, although such costs would not have been incurred if they had not been directors. Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 5, p. 227. It is, however, equally well established that directors acting as such within such of the powers of the company as are confided to them, and without gross negligence, cannot be called upon to pay out of their own private purses the costs of defending resolutions passed by them in the interests of the company, simply because a plaintiff has chosen to make the directors individually co\u2011defendants. Breay v. Royal British Nurses\u2019 Association[3].\nBy a final settlement it was agreed by all parties to the various actions that the allotment of these shares as and how they were allotted should be held to be valid and bind- ing; and that a consent judgment to that effect should be entered. It was also agreed that consent judgments should be entered in the other actions. The parties, therefore, by the settlement and judgments have made it impossible for the court to say that the resolutions of the directors of September 13 and September 20, 1923, which, in the first action, the plaintiff McKnight sought to set aside, were invalid or even irregular. We must take it, therefore, that these resolutions were properly passed by the directors, and the issue of the shares valid corporate acts of the company.\nThe costs incurred in defending the company against attacks in respect of valid corporate acts, and the directors in respect of resolutions regularly passed authorizing the same, should, in our opinion, be borne by the company. As the corporate acts of the company were impeached in the litigation, we cannot see any solid foundation for the contention that the solicitor should have held merely a watching brief for the company.\nThen can it fairly be said that the services rendered by the solicitor in carrying on negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a basis on which the litigation could be terminated, were services rendered for individual directors or shareholders and not for the company?\nThe evidence shews that, very shortly after being retained, Mr. McMaster clearly perceived that if the litigation was protracted it might, and probably would, have serious consequences to the business of the company through creating a widespread suspicion as to the validity of the company\u2019s acts and the integrity of its directors, as such. The success of a life insurance company depends, to a great extent, upon its ability to secure insurance. Anything which casts suspicion upon the regularity of the acts of the company or indicates that its directors are manipulating its shares for their individual benefit, rather than for the benefit of the company, is bound, in our opinion, to adversely affect the company\u2019s prestige. The company, therefore, had, as was frankly admitted by its counsel, a vital interest in having the litigation brought to a speedy termination. In its factum the company admits that it was being seriously affected by the litigation. No one has suggested any way other than that taken by Mr. McMaster by which a settlement could have been brought about. Neither has anyone questioned the advisability, in the company\u2019s interest, of having the settlement take place, rather than a continuation of the litigation. The position taken by the company is not that the settlement was not beneficial to it, but that it was primarily beneficial to the shareholders whose shares were sold and transferred as a result of the negotiations, namely, the shares of the Purdom family and the shares controlled by the Honourable Manning Doherty and Mr. Tweed.\nIn his evidence Mr. McMaster testified that anything he did for T.H. Purdom or on his behalf, including the sale of his shares to Doherty and Tweed, was paid for by Purdom. He further testified that he had no retainer to act for Doherty or Tweed and that he did not advise them. This evidence being in no way impeached, it seems to us impossible to hold that the services for which the solicitor has charged were rendered on behalf of any person other than the company.\nIn his argument Mr. Manning suggested that the following as a proper test to determine on whose behalf the solicitor was acting:\n\u201cCould Mr. McMaster have rendered the services set out in the general bill without instructions from some one other than the company?\u201d\nIn our opinion this is not the test to be applied. We think, in the circumstances of this case, the test should rather be this:\n\u201cWere the services rendered reasonably necessary to procure a settlement of the litigation in which the company was involved?\u201d\nWe are of opinion that they were.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Long & Daly.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Donald, Mason, White & Foulds.\n[1] (1927) 33 Ont.

If within said 40 days the purchaser shall make any valid objection to title in writing, which the vendor is unable or unwilling to remove and which the purchaser will not waive, this agreement shall be null and void.\u201d The purchaser made requisitions on title, as to some of which the vendor notified him that it was unable to comply. Some negotiations took place touching an offer by the vendor to substitute other lands for those affected, but without result; and on October 18 the vendor\u2019s solicitors wrote the purchaser\u2019s solicitors that the vendor was ready to close and unless the transaction was closed by October 25 it would cancel the agreement; and on October 26 orally informed them that the agreement was no longer in force. The purchaser contended (1) that the vendor by its conduct in answering the purchaser\u2019s requisitions and in endeavouring to remove his objections elected to abandon its rights under the above quoted clause; and (2) that, as the objections in question affected only an insignificant part of the lands, he was entitled to insist upon specific performance with compensation, and that he should be given adequate time to consider whether or not he should take that course, before the clause was put into operation.\nHeld: The vendor was within the protection of said clause, and the agreement had been rescinded. The purchaser\u2019s first contention failed in point of fact, as he was never misled into a belief that the vendor had assumed the obligation of meeting the demands in the requisitions in question. As to the purchaser\u2019s second contention, the right to rescind given by said clause was not subject to an over-riding right in the purchaser to insist upon specific performance with compensa- tion, even though, but for that clause, he might, on the facts, have been entitled to such relief; the right given by the clause was for the vendor\u2019s protection in just such situations, and to enable him in such circumstances to insist upon receiving the contract price without abatement or to withdraw from the contract (Ashburner v.

The purchaser is to be allowed forty days from the date hereof to investigate the title at purchaser\u2019s expense * * *. If within said forty days the purchaser shall make any valid objection to title in writing, which the vendor is unable or unwilling to remove and which the purchaser will not waive, this agreement shall be null and void and the deposit money shall be returned to the purchaser without interest * * *.\n9. (Containing, inter alia, a declaration that \u201ctime shall be of the essence of every term of this contract\u201d). 14. The vendor covenants, promises and agrees to assume and pay the existing registered charge or mortgage and to indemnify and keep indemnified the purchaser from all damages, costs and other charges arising from its failure so to do. It shall be a condition precedent to payments hereunder by the purchaser that the said mortgage account shall be in good standing and free from arrears at the time of the making payment by the purchaser.\nOn the 23rd of July the requisitions on title were delivered, and, by these and later requisitions, the appellant as purchaser,\n(a) required evidence that a certain mortgage was in \u201cgood standing\u201d and free from arrears of interest and principal, and\n(b) demanded that certain rights of way should be surrendered and that an agreement for sale affecting part of the land should be discharged.\nThe respondent company appears to have satisfied the appellant as to the first of these requirements. But as to those comprised under head (b), the appellant was notified in due course that the respondent company was unable to comply with them. Some negotiations took place touching an offer by the respondent company to substitute other lands for those affected by the agreement and rights of way, but without result; and on the 18th of October, the solicitors for the respondent company wrote to the solicitors for the appellant that \u201cour clients are ready to close and have instructed us to notify you on behalf of your client that unless this transaction is closed on or before the 25th inst., that they will cancel the agreement and withdraw therefrom\u201d The appellant having done nothing in consequence of this notice, the solicitors for the respondent company, on the 26th of October, orally informed the purchaser\u2019s solicitors, that the agreement was no longer in force. On the 3rd of November a caution was filed by the appellant in the Land Titles Office, and on the 9th of November the originating notice was served. The contention on the part of the respondent company was that the facts were such as to bring into play article 8 of the agreement, quoted above.\nMr. Justice Raney, after stating the facts substantially as I have stated them, and pointing out that since there were no material facts in controversy, the dispute fell within the scope of Consolidated Rule 605, proceeded:\nIt is conceded that the purchaser\u2019s objections to the title were made in writing and that they were valid objections. It appears also that the Vendor is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to remove the objections other than that in respect of the mortgage, and there is no suggestion of bad faith. The purchaser declines to waive these objections. The matter is thus brought, I think, squarely within the eighth clause of the agreement, and the agreement is, therefore, in my view, null and void. There will be a declaration to that effect and an order for the repayment of the deposit money, and on the return of the deposit money for the vacation of the caution. There will be no costs to either party.\nThere is before us no report of the reasons for the judgment of the Second Appellate Division.\nSeveral contentions were advanced in support of the appeal, of which it is only necessary to mention two.\nFirst, it is argued that the respondent company, by its conduct in answering the appellant\u2019s requisitions and in endeavouring to remove his objections, elected to abandon its rights under article 8. This contention fails in point of fact. The appellant was never misled into a belief that the respondent company had assumed the obligation of meeting the demands in the requisitions in respect of the agreement of sale and the rights of way. On the contrary, he was informed in due course that the respondent company was unable to comply with them. The proposal to substitute other lands was an act indicating, not a willingness to meet the requisitions in these respects, but the opposite.\nSecond, it is contended that, since the agreement of sale, to which exception was taken, and the rights of way mentioned, affected only an insignificant part of the lands in question, the appellant was entitled, if so advised, to insist upon specific performance with compensation in respect of the part so affected, notwithstanding the terms of article 8; and further, that he was entitled, before that article was put into operation, to be given adequate time to consider whether or not he should take that course. The answer to this contention is, that the right to rescind given by article 8 is not subject to an over-riding right vested in the appellant to insist upon specific performance with compensation, even though, but for the stipulations of that article, he might, on the facts, have been entitled to such relief. It is a right given to the vendor for his protection in just such situations as that we are now considering, and to enable him in such circumstances to insist upon receiving the contract price without abatement, or to withdraw from the contract. In the contract in question in Ashburner v. Sewell (1), there was a clause similar in all pertinent respects to clause 8, and another clause providing for compensation in case of the description proving erroneous. Mr. Justice Chitty, as reported on page 410, says:\nThe question whether errors which fall within clause 6 also fall within the protection given to the vendor under clause 8, is one of fact, to be decided in the particular circumstances of each case, and is one requiring great consideration. Take, for instance, the case where a piece of land is included in the description to which a title cannot be made out: regard must be had to the importance of that particular piece, and the amount of compensation which would have to be paid. I think it quite reasonable for the vendor to say, \u201cI will reserve to myself a mode of escape from all the trouble of these inquiries and investigations and expenses of arbitration. I desire to settle the price myself; and if the purchaser insists on his objections to my title, I will retain in my own hands the power to rescind.\u201d That, I think, is a reasonable view to take of a contract like the one under consideration. In the result, I am of opinion that the purchaser\u2019s construction of the contract is not well founded, and that the objection raised is one of title falling within clause 8, and that the vendor was right in giving the purchaser notice of rescission.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald & Louch.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wickett & McNish.\n[1] (1927) 33 Ont.

Plaintiffs claimed an injunction and damages against defendant city for polluting the waters flowing through a ravine which traversed or bounded their land. They recovered judgment at trial in respect of\n(1) [1891] 3 Ch. 405. various acts complained of, but this judgment was modified by the Appellate Division, Alta. (22 Alta. L.R. 457), which held that the city was not liable for alleged pollution caused by certain storm sewers. Against this holding the plaintiffs appealed. The city had constructed a large storm sewer having its outlet in an arm of the ravine above plaintiffs' land. Its purpose was primarily to carry off the surplus water from streets in the vicinity, but (as found on the evidence) through it discharged into the stream in the ravine, not only surface water, but all filth from the streets; also a mass of dirt was allowed to form and accumulate during the winter in the sewer, and in the spring the rush of water washed this into the stream.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Appellate Division, Smith J. dissenting), that the operation of the sewer as aforesaid violated plaintiffs' riparian rights; and they were entitled to an injunction (failing abatement of the nuisance within the delay allowed) and to damages.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.: The common law right of a riparian owner to drain his land into a natural stream affords no defence to an action for polluting the water in the stream; pollution is always unlawful and, in itself, constitutes a nuisance. Broughton v. Township of Grey (27 Can. S.C.R. 495) and In re Townships of Oxford and Howard (18 Ont. A.R. 496) distinguished.\nWhatever the consequences, and much as the result may cause inconvenience, the principle must be upheld that, unless Parliament otherwise decrees, \"public works must be so executed as not to interfere with private rights of individuals\" (Atty. Gen. v. Birmingham, 4 K. & J. 528, cited).\nThe Edmonton charter, which conferred the relevant powers on the city, did not authorize interference with the inherent right of a riparian owner to have a stream of water \"come to him in its natural state, in flow, quantity and quality\" (Chasemore v. Richards, 7 H.L.C. 349, at p. 382), except when necessary, and then upon payment of adequate compensation.\nStatutory powers should not be understood as authorizing the creation of a private nuisance, unless the statute expressly so states.\nPer Duff J.: The existence of a nuisance in fact was established; and the city failed to justify its acts as acts done under its charter powers; nor could they be justified as an exercise of the common law rights of a riparian owner.\nWhile the making of streets by macadamizing or paving, etc., is a natural use of the land owned by the city, and it is under no duty to intercept rain water which, having fallen from the clouds, is pursuing its way under the impulsion of gravity or other natural forces towards a watercourse, it is not at common law entitled, in its quality of riparian owner, to collect and discharge the filth of the streets through an artificial channel into a watercourse, where it is to settle and remain until the currents generated by the spring thaws carry the mass of it to the lands of lower riparian owners.\nPer Lamont J.: The city had the right to develop its lands in the way cities ordinarily do by constructing and paving streets and lanes, and if, as a result of such user, an increased quantity of street sweepings, horse droppings and other impurities accumulated on its land, and these were washed down by the rain through a natural watercourse to the stream, the plaintiffs, as lower riparian owners, had no ground of complaint; but, apart from statutory authority so to do, the city could not by flushing its streets collect these impurities and by means of a storm sewer pour them into a stream the waters of which the plaintiffs had a right to take for domestic or other purposes; under English law an upper riparian owner \"must not discharge his filth on his neighbour's land\" (principles laid down in Stollmeyer v. Trinidad Lake Petroleum Co. Ltd., [1918] A.C. 485; Ballard v. Tomlinson, 29 Ch. D. 115; John Young & Co. v. Bankier Distillery Co., [1893] A.C. 691, applied; In re Townships of Oxford and Howard, 18 Ont. A.R. 496, at p. 505; Gibbons v. Lenfestey, 84 L.J.P.C. 158, at p. 160, distinguished). The city's charter did not limit plaintiffs' right of action, as the city had taken no statutory proceedings to acquire a right to pour the polluted output of its sewer into the stream.\nSmith J. dissented, holding that the city had a right to drain the surface water from its streets into the storm sewer and through it to the natural watercourse; that there was no evidence of any pollution from this surface drainage other than what would occur in a state of nature; the only kind of pollution shown was such as would naturally be found in any similar stream draining an area where animals were kept.\nThe sewer, as originally constructed, had been cut to provide drainage facilities for a certain district, thus creating a diversion of drainage, causing, as plaintiffs complained, a substantial decrease in the quantity of water that would otherwise have gone into the ravine, and thus, by reason of less dilution of the dirt and filth, increasing the dangers of pollution. Dealing with this point, Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. held that the diversion gave plaintiffs no right of action; they had no right to the drainage water collected by the sewer; in complaining against the diversion they were really claiming a right to compel the city to drain into the ravine; diversion of drainage is quite a different thing from diversion of a stream; and, while riparian owners have rights on and to the water flowing in a natural stream, they can claim no right to water in undefined channels or percolating through the earth; and though riparian owners above them may be entitled to drain their lands into the stream, they are not obliged to do so.\nAs to certain smaller storm sewers discharging into the stream, it was held (sustaining, in this respect, the judgment of the Appellate Division) that, on the evidence as to their operation and the waters discharged thereby, the plaintiffs had no right of action.\nDuff and Lamont JJ. pointed out that they had not dealt with the provisions of the Irrigation Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 61), no question thereon having been raised in the argument.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] allowing in part an appeal by the defendant city from part of the judgment of Ives J. in favour of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claimed damages and an injunction against the defendant for polluting the waters flowing through a ravine, known as \"Groat's Ravine,\" in the City of Edmonton, which ravine, lower down than where the alleged acts causing pollution took place, traversed or bounded the plaintiffs' land.\nThe plaintiffs' land was south of 102nd Avenue. On 102nd Avenue a bridge, referred to as \"Athabasca Bridge,\" crossed the ravine. It was immediately south of this bridge, and just above the plaintiffs' land, that the smaller storm sewers in question discharged into the ravine. At a short distance north of 102nd Avenue two branches of the ravine, referred to as the \"northeast arm\" and the \"northwest arm\" came together. The large storm sewer in question, which was six feet in diameter, had its outlet in the northeast arm.\nThe action was tried before Ives J., who gave judgment for the plaintiffs in respect of various acts complained of by the plaintiffs as causing pollution of the water.\nThe formal judgment at trial declared that the pollution complained of in the stream in the ravine was caused by the city, and that the plaintiffs were riparian owners of lands abutting the stream south of 102nd Avenue, and were entitled to relief; that the pollution was a nuisance and was caused: (1) by the city's dump at the junction of the northwest arm of the ravine and 106th Avenue; (2) by the storm sewer and the sanitary sewer situate in the northeast arm of the ravine and discharging into the stream; (3) by the storm sewers discharging into the ravine immediately south of Athabasca Bridge on 102nd Avenue; and ordered that the city be restrained from continuing the nuisances, and that, in the event of the city failing to abate them and keep them abated within a period of two years, the plaintiffs, upon the expiration of two years from the date of the judgment, should be entitled to take out an order restraining the city from continuance thereof. The trial of the issue of damages was reserved for further inquiry, with terms as to costs of the issue depending on the amount established.\nThe city appealed from part of this judgment, its appeal being practically confined to the matters of the dump at 106th Avenue and of the storm sewer on the northeast arm of the ravine, and of the storm sewers discharging into the ravine south of Athabasca Bridge on 102nd Avenue.\nThe Appellate Division [2] allowed in part the city's appeal. It maintained the judgment below as to the dump at 106th Avenue (though with some doubt, on the evidence, as to its being a cause of pollution), but it allowed the appeal \"in respect to the surface drainage through the storm sewers,\" and, by its formal judgment, amended the judgment at trial by striking out therefrom any declaration: \"(a) That the pollution caused by or from the storm sewer situate on the northeast arm of the said ravine and discharging into the said stream is or constitutes a nuisance; (b) That the pollution caused by or from the storm sewer discharging into the said ravine immediately south of Athabasca Bridge on 102nd Avenue, is or constitutes a nuisance; (c) That the surface drainage through any of the storm sewers is or constitutes a nuisance\"; and by striking out therefrom \"any order that the defendant do abate the use of any of the said storm sewers for drainage purposes, or be restrained from continuing the use of the said storm sewers for such purposes, or that the plaintiffs shall be entitled to take out an order restraining the defendant from the continuance of the use of the said sewers for such drainage purposes.\"\nBy the judgment now reported, this Court (Smith J., dissenting) allowed the plaintiffs' appeal, with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and restored the judgment of the trial judge, except as to the smaller storm sewers discharging into the stream south of the bridge on 102nd Avenue.\nJames A. Ross K.C. for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the respondent.\nANGLIN C.J.C. concurred with Rinfret J.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the judgment for these reasons.\nThe existence of a state of affairs constituting a nuisance in fact, is found, and is, I think, established as resulting from the construction and use of the large sewer extending through the northeast arm; and this was in law a nuisance chargeable to the municipality, unless sufficient justification or excuse has also been established. Mr. Biggar's argument founded on the statute, fails, because justification under the statute was not proved at the trial. Indeed there was no attempt to prove it. That the municipality possesses authority under its charter to construct sewers and drains for carrying away water from its streets is beyond question. But it is only in respect of the authorized works and the necessary results of such works that the municipality is entitled to the protection of the statute; and that protection is not available where the nature of the specific work alleged to be authorized under the statute is not made to appear. In this case, no bylaw or other instrument evidencing authority or defining the work alleged to be authorized was adduced; and there is no finding, either by the trial judge or by the Appellate Division, that the nuisance complained of was authorized, or was the necessary result of works authorized pursuant to the charter.\nI agree that the making of streets by macadamizing or paving or otherwise, is a natural use of the land owned by the municipality; and, moreover, that the municipality is under no duty to intercept rain water which, having fallen from the clouds, is pursuing its way under the impulsion of gravity or other natural forces towards a water course. But the municipality is not at common law entitled, in its quality of riparian owner, to collect and discharge the filth of the streets through an artificial channel into a water course, where it is to settle and remain until the currents generated by the spring thaws carry the mass of it to the lands of lower riparian proprietors. I can perceive no warrant for this under the common law. I refrain from discussing the provisions of the Irrigation Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 61, because these were not mentioned in the argument.\nThe appeal, as I view it, turns exclusively upon points of fact. A nuisance in fact has been found, and is, I think, proved. The municipality has not exonerated itself from responsibility by justifying its acts as acts done under the powers conferred upon it by its charter; nor can they be justified as an exercise of the common law rights of a riparian proprietor.\nRINFRET J.\u2014This appeal involves a consideration of the rights of riparian owners in a natural water-course. The appellants hold, in the western portion of the city of Edmonton, a block of land bordering on the north bank of the Saskatchewan river. A deep ravine, known as Groat's Ravine, which extends northward from the river, traverses their property or bounds it to the west. It is formed of two branches: one coming from the northwest, and, as would appear from the plan, starting approximately at 109th Avenue; the other coming from the northeast, at the corner of 105th Avenue and 123rd Street. The two branches are joined at a comparatively short distance north of 102nd Avenue (also referred to in the case as Athabaska Avenue) in the Groat Ravine Park which belongs to the City of Edmonton. The ravine then proceeds under a bridge at 102nd Avenue and, shortly below, meets the appellants' land, along which it extends until it eventually reaches the river.\nIt forms a natural drainage basin for a large district and, prior to the settlement, the appellants and their predecessors had found there a continual flow of water, \"pure and healthy,\" according to the evidence, which was used for drinking purposes, or at least offered a sufficient supply for stock purposes.\nThe appellants complained that the City of Edmonton caused or permitted the northwest branch of the ravine, at 106th Avenue, to be used \"as a nuisance dumping ground for very large mounds of garbage and general city refuse\" and that the water passing through it was adulterated and rendered noxious by the fault of the city; that the city had also erected on the northeast branch, in the neighbourhood of 126th Street and 103rd Avenue, a pumping station designed to raise a sewage system outflow into another sewer at a higher level, but because this pump either failed to function or became overtaxed, or because stuff was actually taken out by the city employees and deposited at the side of the station, sewage matter accumulated on the bank of, or in the channel of, the ravine and was carried to the main stream, much to the appellants' injury.\nThen the city constructed a storm sewer, six feet in diameter, having its outlet in the northeast arm, at a short distance below the pumping station. Its purpose was primarily to carry off the surface waters from streets in the vicinity. The appellants, however, alleged that all street dirt and filth were washed into this sewer. Later, the pumping station was connected with it in order that any outflow of sewage from the station might be thrown into the sewer and through it discharged into the ravine. To this the appellants strongly objected, on the ground that the effect was to pollute the water in the stream.\nStill another complaint was as follows:\nBetween the outlet of the six foot storm sewer and the bridge at 102nd Avenue, the stream was left open; but, under the bridge and at the bottom of the ravine, a pipe was placed in order to confine the waters and protect the abutments of the bridge. This pipe extended into the appellants' property, and so, it was contended, constituted a trespass upon the appellants' land, while it increased the velocity of the water in the stream and undermined the banks, which had slipped into the ravine.\nFinally, the appellants said the city had laid two pipes, immediately below the 102nd Avenue bridge, respectively on the east and west banks of the ravine, to conduct the street drainage into the latter. They complained that the result was also to foul and pollute the water in the stream.\nThe appellants accordingly asked for an injunction and an inquiry as to damages.\nAt the trial, they were successful in all their contentions. Ives J. thought\nthe evidence clearly proves that the natural stream found in what is called Groat's Ravine * * * is grossly polluted, and the conclusion is irresistable that such pollution is caused, first, by the dump on 106th Avenue, which crosses the northwest branch of the stream; secondly, by the storm sewer and the sanitary sewer (sic) situate in the northeast branch of the stream and discharging into it; and thirdly, by the storm sewer discharging into the stream immediately south of the bridge (on) 102nd Avenue.\nHe declared that the dump and sewers \"in their operation cause a nuisance.\" He therefore granted the injunction, to become effective after two years, during which the city was ordered to abate the nuisance. The issue of damages was reserved for inquiry before himself, with the proviso that the costs thereof would be borne by the appellants, unless they succeeded in establishing damages in a sum greater than $100.\nAs will be noticed, there was no adjudication upon two points: 1. The complaint about the supposed injury to the banks of the water-course. 2. The alleged trespass upon the appellants' land by laying thereon, for a distance of thirty to thirty-five feet, the large pipe intended to confine the water of the stream under the bridge and protect the abutments thereof.\nThe absence of findings on these points is consistent with the assumption that they were not pressed before the trial judge. At all events, the appellants accepted his judgment. The city alone appealed therefrom to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Neither of those points was again raised before us; indeed, the city conceded the appellants' right in respect to \"the construction and maintenance of pipes on (their) property south of 102nd Avenue.\"\nIn the Appellate Division, the city admitted that in so far as the judgment declared it a nuisance to permit \"the house sewage to escape from the (pumping station) into the ravine it was unobjectionable,\" and submitted \"to the order requiring it to be abated.\" Moreover, the city was unsuccessful in its attack upon the order concerning the dump at 106th Avenue.\nThe appeal was allowed, however, with regard to \"the surface drainage through the storm sewers,\" and the judgment was amended by\nstriking out therefrom any declaration:\n(a) That the pollution caused by or from the storm sewer situate on the northeast arm of the said ravine and discharging into the said stream is or constitutes a nuisance;\n(b) That the pollution caused by or from the storm sewer discharging into the said ravine immediately south of Athabasca Bridge on 102nd Avenue, is or constitutes a nuisance.\n(c) That the surface drainage through any of the storm sewers is or constitutes a nuisance.\nAnd the said Judgment is further amended by striking out therefrom any order that the Defendant do abate the use of any of the said storm sewers for drainage purposes, or be restrained from continuing the use of the said storm sewers for such purposes, or that the Plaintiffs shall be entitled to take out an order restraining the Defendant from the continuance of the use of the said sewers for such drainage purposes.\nAnother modification was introduced allowing the appellants to elect to take judgment for $100 damages in lieu of the inquiry; but they have since given notice of their refusal to accept this sum and we need not further concern ourselves about it. The City of Edmonton is willing to abide by the decision of the Appellate Division, but the plaintiffs now ask us to restore the original judgment, and, in addition would like us to consider a further question which it will now be convenient to examine.\nThe six-foot storm sewer, as originally constructed, took care of the storm water drainage from the district west of 121st Street. It extended on its southerly course from 121st Avenue down to the northeast arm of Groat's Ravine. In 1924 and 1925, it was cut at 114th Avenue to provide drainage facilities for the town of Calder. The appellants argued that the natural flow of the stream had been thereby interfered with and a substantial proportion of the water subtracted from the ravine. It was said that the decrease in the quantity of water caused the dirt and filth carried by it to be less diluted and therefore the diversion at 114th Avenue correspondingly increased the dangers of pollution.\nIn our opinion, this argument cannot be entertained. No doubt a riparian owner may not divert the water of a natural stream to the injury of the lower riparian owners. He may, while the water flows through his land, put it to any lawful use for reasonable purposes, but he must return it to its regular course in the stream beyond the property. Diversion of drainage, however, is quite a different thing from the diversion of a stream. While riparian owners have rights on and to the water flowing in a natural stream, they can claim no right to water in undefined channels or percolating through the earth. Owners, though they may be entitled to drain their lands in a water-course, are evidently not under any obligation to do so. The appellants, when they complain against the diversion of the storm sewer at 114th street, are really claiming a right to compel the city to drain into Groat's Ravine. It may be granted that the object of the six-foot storm sewer is to collect the drainage water from the area already described; yet, the appellants hold no absolute right to such water, and no action lies for its diversion.\nThe remaining question on the appeal is solely whether the amendments made to the judgment by the Appellate Division \"in respect to the surface drainage through the storm sewers\" were justified under the circumstances. We have the holding of the trial judge that the natural stream across the appellants' lands was grossly polluted, and that such pollution was caused by the dump, the six-foot storm sewer, the \"sanitary sewer\" (which meant, no doubt, the connection through which the overflow of the pumping station was directed into the storm sewer), and the storm sewers discharging into the ravine immediately south of the 102nd Avenue bridge. Subject to what will be said with regard to the latter, there was no reversal of these findings by the Appellate Division. Its judgment proceeds on the assumption that these facts were established and then states, as a proposition of law, that the respondent as riparian owner had the right to act as it did. As authority for this proposition, the Court relied on a decision of this Court in Broughton v. Township of Grey[3], where Gwynne J., dealing with an alleged liability under an Ontario Drainage Act, referred to a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in In re Townships of Oxford and Howard et al[4], and expressed his concurrence with \"the reasons given by the learned judges who pronounced it.\" One of those judges, in the course of his remarks (p. 505), happened to have said that\nwhile the landowners exercise their rights [to drain into a natural watercourse] reasonably, whether they do so individually or collectively, they are not concerned with the effects produced lower down the stream.\nIn the above case, however, there was no suggestion of pollution; nor was there in the Broughton Case3. Pollution does not appear to have been discussed by any of the judges, and the remarks just quoted were not addressed to a situation such as is held to exist here.\nThe right of a riparian proprietor to drain his land into a natural stream is an undoubted common law right, but it may not be exercised to the injury and damage of the riparian proprietor below, and it can afford no defence to an action for polluting the water in the stream. Pollution is always unlawful and, in itself, constitutes a nuisance.\nIn cities and towns, drains and sewers are a necessity. Generally they are built under statutory powers. They may also be said to be constructed in the exercise of the collective rights which, in that respect, the local ratepayers have at common law and which are represented by the municipality. But these rights are necessarily restricted by correlative obligations. Although held by the municipalities for the benefit of all the inhabitants, they must not\u2014except upon the basis of due compensation\u2014be exercised by them to the prejudice of an individual ratepayer. So far as statutory powers are concerned, they should not be understood as authorizing the creation of a private nuisance\u2014unless indeed the statute expressly so states.\nWe have been referred to the sections of the Edmonton Charter whereby the relevant powers were conferred on the city by the Legislature of Alberta. As they include the power to interfere with the property of the citizen, they are to be construed favourably to the latter's rights.\nIn our opinion, they do not authorize interference with the inherent right of a riparian owner to have a stream of water \"come to him in its natural state, in flow, quantity and quality\" (Chasemore v. Richards[5]), except when necessary and then upon payment of adequate compensation.\nThrough the 6 foot storm sewer and into this natural stream (which up to that time afforded \"pure and healthy\" water used for drinking and stock purposes), the city discharges not only surface water, but all the street washings and filth, the horse droppings, the sweepings \"and anything else that happened to be there.\" This is not ordinary street drainage, but street sewage. In addition to that, a mass of dirt was allowed to form and to accumulate during the winter in that large storm sewer back of the pumping station. In the spring, the rush of water coming down washed this filthy stuff into the stream.\nWe think a distinction ought to be made between this condition and mere natural drainage through pipes arranged to take care of rain-water or melted snow. This difference indeed was at the basis of the decision in Durrant v. Branksome Urban District Council [6] to which reference was made by counsel for the respondent, in the course of his very able argument.\nFor that reason, we agree with the Appellate Division in respect to the small pipes by the Athabaska Avenue bridge. We do not think the evidence shows anything more than that \"they simply confine, control and conduct to the channel the waters which reach the top of the bank in a natural way and which but for the pipes would make their way down the bank, no doubt in many cases to its injury\nIn the case of the six foot storm sewer, however, there is ample evidence to justify the holding of the trial judge. The city engineer admitted that it would be possible to prevent the pollution. The city therefore has inflicted and still inflicts unnecessary injury upon the appellant.\nWhile the courts will naturally be slow to grant an injunction against a public body carrying out an important public work, they cannot lose sight of the fact that in this case there is an existing nuisance caused by the respondent. The appellants' established riparian rights have been and still are violated. They are entitled to an order forbidding the fouling of the water and abating the nuisance, as well as preventing the recurrence of the wrong and protecting them against the acquisition of prescriptive rights.\nIt has been suggested that this would necessitate very large expenditures and require considerable time. In fact, the judgment of the trial judge rather gave credit to that contention and, for that reason, prescribed that the order restraining the operation of the sewers should be taken out only at the expiration \"of two years, provided such nuisance is not abated in the meantime.\"\nAlthough it is no part of the court's duty to inquire how the respondent can best abate the nuisance, we entertain little doubt that within the delay thus granted the city respondent, either through the instrumentality of the Board of Public Health or through the exercise of its powers of expropriation, may avoid the removal of the sewer and the modification of its system. The city may acquire an easement through the appellant's land or the right to discharge upon it the stream water injured in quality. But, whatever the consequences, and much as the result may cause inconvenience, the principle must be upheld that, unless Parliament otherwise decrees, \"public works must be so executed as not to interfere with private rights of individuals\" (Atty. Gen. v. Birmingham[7]).\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored (with costs here and in the Court of Appeal), except in respect of \"the storm sewers discharging into the ravine immediately south of Athabaska Bridge on 102nd Avenue.\"\nBut although, after the judgment of the Appellate Division, the respondent elected to refuse the sum of $100 as damages, we see no harm in preserving his right of electing to take judgment for that sum or to take an inquiry as stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, with the modification that the delay of two weeks within which to make such election will run only from the day of the present judgment.\nLAMONT J.\u2014This action was brought to restrain the defendant city from trespassing upon and committing a nuisance on the plaintiffs' property and from polluting the water of a natural stream on which both plaintiffs and defendants were riparian owners. The learned trial judge found as follows:\u2014\nI think the evidence clearly proves that the natural stream found in what is called Groat's Ravine, in this city, is grossly polluted, and the conclusion is irresistible that such pollution is caused, first, by the dump on 106th Avenue, which crosses the northwest branch of the stream; secondly, by the storm sewer and the sanitary sewer situate on the northeast branch of the stream, and discharging into it; and thirdly, by the storm sewer discharging into the stream immediately south of the bridge crossing 102nd Avenue.\n* * * *\nThe owners are entitled to an order for the abatement of this nuisance, and that it be kept abated.\nFrom that part of the judgment which declared that the dump on 106th Avenue, the storm sewer on the northeast arm of the ravine, and the storm sewer discharging into the stream at 102nd Avenue, were sources from which the stream was polluted, the city appealed to the Alberta Appellate Division. That court affirmed the judgment of the trial judge as to the dump, but reversed it as to the storm sewers. From the judgment of the Appellate Division the plaintiffs appeal to this court.\nDealing first with the dump on 106th Avenue, I am of opinion that the judgment below was right. There was evidence which, in my opinion, justified the conclusion of the trial judge that it was one of the sources of the pollution of the stream. This leaves only the storm sewers to consider. As to the small storm sewer discharging into the stream south of the bridge crossing 102nd Avenue, there was evidence that a sample of water taken from the stream at a point opposite the out-flow of that sewer was polluted. That is practically all the evidence pointing to the pollution of the stream from this storm sewer.\nAs the place from which this sample was taken was south of the dump on 106th Avenue, it seems to me difficult to say that the pollution disclosed by this sample came from the storm sewer rather than the dump. I therefore agree with the Appellate Division in thinking that evidence of pollution from the small storm sewer sufficient to justify the issue of an injunction, has not been produced.\nAs to the large six foot sewer the city engineer says\nAt the mouth of the six foot outflow there is a septic sludge which, in my opinion, is street washing, that would be animal organic matter but not human organic matter.\nThe engineer also testified that in August or September in each year the city placed a screen or door in the sewer a short distance from the outflow. The primary object of the screen was to prevent currents of cold air going up the sewer. It had the effect, however, of impeding the flow of the water in the sewer, with the result that the solids settled to the bottom and formed a mass of putrefaction extending up the sewer for 170 feet, and having, at the screen, a depth of one and a half feet. In the spring when the screen was removed this mass of putrid solids was swept into the stream near the plaintiffs' land and so polluted the water that the plaintiffs' animals refused to drink it.\nIt was contended that this pollution could be accounted for by the overflow of the pump at the sanitary sewage station. The evidence, however, is that the overflow from the pump entered the storm sewer at a point only fifty feet back from the screen, while the sludge extends back 170 feet. As the flow from the pump entrance was towards the mouth of the sewer, the sludge above that entrance could not have come from the pump. The samples of water taken at the mouth of this sewer, on being analysed, were found to be grossly polluted. I am, therefore, of opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify the finding of the trial judge that the large six foot storm sewer was a source of pollution. The correctness of this finding was not questioned by the Appellate Division. The reversal by that court of the trial judge's finding that the storm sewers were creating a nuisance on the plaintiffs' property was based upon what it conceived to be the right of the city to use the natural water course of Groat's Ravine for draining any part of its natural drainage area, and to do so by the aid of the construction of works useful for that purpose, and that if, in so doing, without more, the water was polluted, the consequences must be borne by the owner affected. As authority for this proposition the judgment of Maclennan J.A. in In re Townships of Orford and Howard et al[8], was cited, where, at page 505, the learned judge said:\u2014\nI think that by the common law it is the right of every landowner to drain his land into any natural water-course accessible to him. Indeed, it is the principal function and purpose which a water-course serves, to carry off to great lakes or to the sea, the surplus precipitation from the atmosphere, whether rainfall or melted snow, beyond what is required to support vegetation, and to supply the needs of mankind; and I think that while the landowners exercise their rights reasonably, whether they do so individually or collectively, they are not concerned with the effects produced lower down the stream.\nThe principle there enunciated was expressed by Lord Dunedin in giving the judgment of the Privy Council in Gibbons v. Lenfestey et al[9], in the following words:\nWhere two contiguous fields, one of which stands upon higher ground than the other, belong to different proprietors, nature itself may be said to constitute a servitude on the inferior tenement, by which it is obliged to receive the water which falls from the superior. If the water, which would otherwise fall from the higher grounds insensibly, without hurting the inferior tenement, should be collected into one body by the owner of the superior in the natural use of his property for draining or otherwise improving it, the owner of the inferior is, without the positive constitution of any servitude, bound to receive that body of water on his property.\nIt will be observed that neither of these cases deals with the pollution of a stream the water of which a lower riparian owner is entitled to appropriate to himself. Has an upper riparian owner a right to drain on to the land of a lower owner water which has become polluted by impurities on the land of the upper owner? In Ballard v. Tomlinson[10], Lord Lindley said:\nThe right to foul water is not the same as the right to get it; and in my opinion does not depend on the same principles.\n* * * * Prima facie no man has a right to use his own land in such a way as to be a nuisance to his neighbour, and whether the nuisance is effected by sending filth on to his neighbour's land, or by putting poisonous matter on his own land and allowing it to escape on his neighbour's land, or whether the nuisance is effected by poisoning the air which his neighbour breathes, or the water which he drinks, appears to me wholly immaterial.\nIf a man chooses to put filth on his own land he must take care not to let it escape on to his neighbour's land.\nThen on page 127, after referring to Womersley v. Church[11]; Hodgkinson v. Ennor[12], and Wholey v. Laing[13], he said:\nThese decisions shew that prima facie one man has no right to foul water which another has a right to get.\nIn John Young & Co. v. Bankier Distillery Co.[14], Lord Macnaghten laid down the law in these words:\nEvery riparian proprietor is thus entitled to the water of his stream, in its natural flow, without sensible diminution or increase and without sensible alteration in its character or quality.\nIn that case the appellants, without any prescriptive right so to do, pumped from their mines and poured into the stream from which the respondents obtained their water for distilling purposes, a quantity of water which without being pumped up would never have reached the stream, and which so hardened the water of the stream that it was rendered unfit for the respondents' purposes. It was held that the appellants had no right to do this, on the ground that a lower riparian owner was under no obligation to receive foreign water brought to the surface of the upper owner's property by artificial means. In his judgment Lord Shand, at page 701, after pointing out that the appellants had a right to work their mines, said:\nIf in doing so in the ordinary course of working they should happen to tap springs or a water waste from which the water by gravitation rose to the surface and flowed down to a lower proprietor's land, this must be submitted to; but the mine owner is not entitled by pumping to increase this servitude or burden on one unwilling to submit to it by pumping up water which might never rise to the surface, or which might only do so more gradually and slowly and in much smaller volume.\nThe obligation of a lower riparian owner to receive surface water saturated with impurities from the land of an upper owner, was discussed by the Privy Council in Stollmeyer v. Trinidad Lake Petroleum Co., Ltd.[15]. In that case the appellant and respondents were riparian owners, the appellant being the lower. The business of the respondents was boring for and pumping oil. In carrying on their operations, which were performed properly and without negligence, some oil would escape from the pipes and spill on the surface so that during the rainy season the surface water which made its way in the ordinary course of drainage into the river Vessigny, came to be water polluted with oil. The appellant brought an action to restrain the respondents from polluting the water. The Privy Council held that he was entitled to succeed, as the pollution from oil was greater than in an ordinary region an upper riparian proprietor was entitled to inflict upon a lower one, except by prescription. Their Lordships, while recognizing the right of an upper owner to make any natural user of his land that he wished, held that such right was subject to the limitation that he must not use it in such a way as to be a nuisance to his neighbour. Two passages from their Lordships' judgment are instructive. The first, at page 496, reads:\nIf, again, the pollution, such as it is, arises simply because the rain water falls on an oily surface and, running over it until it reaches the defined channel or watercourse, collects there and flows away as oily water, the appellants would again fail. The respondents are not bound to abstain from a normal use of their own ground merely in order that it may remain as clean a catchment area for the rainfall as it was in its virgin state.\nThe other, at page 497, is as follows:\u2014\nIt would not be an application of English law to Trinidad, but an abandonment of it, to hold that an invasion of the appellants' rights must go without remedy, unless it is accompanied by present and substantial damage. Still less can it be called an application of the maxim sic utere tuo to Trinidad to say that while in England a landed proprietor must not discharge his own filth on to his neighbour's land at all he may do so in Trinidad, if only he is careful about it and does it for his own benefit.\nApplying the principles laid down in the above decisions to the case before us, it would appear to follow that the city has a right to develop its lands in the way cities ordinarily do by constructing and paving streets and lanes thereon, and that if, as a result of such user, an increased quantity of street sweepings, horse droppings, and other impurities accumulates on its land, and these are washed down by the rain through a natural water-course to the stream, the plaintiffs, as lower riparian owners, have no ground of complaint. But, apart from statutory authority so to do, the city cannot by flushing its streets collect these impurities and by means of a storm sewer pour them into a stream the waters of which the plaintiffs have a right to take for domestic or other purposes. Under English law an upper riparian owner \"must not discharge his filth on his neighbour's land.\"\nCounsel for the city quoted section 433 of the City Charter, which gives the Corporation power to construct, manage and conduct a system of storm sewers or sanitary sewers, or both, and section 463, which provides for compensating \"persons interested in the land, waters, rights or privileges entered upon, taken or used by the Corporation, or injuriously affected by the exercise of such powers,\" and he contended that the plaintiffs' remedy was compensation under this section.\nAs the city has taken no steps by the payment of compensation or by other statutory procedure to acquire a right to pour the polluted output of its storm sewer into the stream, the statute places no limitation on the plaintiffs' right of action.\nAs no question has been raised, either in the pleadings or on the argument before us, as to the effect, if any, of the provisions of the Irrigation Act (Dom.) on the rights of riparian owners, I have not considered that question.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge, except as to the storm sewer discharging into the stream immediately south of Athabasca Bridge on 102nd Avenue. As practically no attention was paid at the trial to this storm sewer the plaintiffs, in my opinion, are entitled to their costs throughout.\nSMITH J. (dissenting).\u2014I have carefully read all the evidence in this case, and am completely in accord with the judgment of the Appellate Division, for the reasons there stated.\nThe City of Edmonton, in my opinion, has a perfect right to drain the surface water from its streets into the storm sewer referred to in the pleadings and, through it, to the natural water course.\nThere is absolutely no evidence of any pollution from this surface drainage other than what would occur in a state of nature. It is the surface drainage of an area that forms rivulets such as that in question here, and the natural result of such surface drainage, whether in a city or in a country place, is the kind of pollution complained of in reference to the surface waters from the streets of Edmonton.\nPutting aside the pollution from the dump and the pump-house well, for which a remedy is given in the judgment appealed from, the only pollution proved is that caused by the mixture of soil, such as mould, clay, sand, grit and animal droppings carried into the stream by the flow of surface waters. This kind of pollution, it is admitted by plaintiff's own expert witness, will naturally be found in any similar stream draining an area where animals are kept within that area.\nThe evidence discloses that the plaintiff himself had on his own premises a dozen cattle and some forty horses having access to this stream. In addition to this, several sleughs and an area extending for several miles were drained by this rivulet. Coli baccilli found in the waters of this rivulet are just what would be found in any similar rivulet running through an area where animals were pastured, as is admitted by Dr. Shaw, the plaintiffs' expert. Some of this coli baccilli, no doubt, would be contributed from the surface drainage of the City of Edmonton streets and other lands in the city, but not, I think, in greater proportion than by plaintiff's own land, with its barnyard, piles of manure and toilet on the bank, and his large stock of cattle and horses that had access to the rivulet.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\n[1] 22 Alta.

The agreement further provided (inter alia) that the defendant should \u201cwithin one month after receipt of written demand by [plaintiff] institute and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to prevent any infringement of the said letters patent * * * and said trade-mark\u201d within Canada, and that if a certain mop patent should, in any action for infringement, be declared invalid, all royalties payable in respect thereof should forthwith cease to be payable. Plaintiff, alleging that defendant had not complied with its demand to take proceedings to enjoin the manufacture and sale of certain mops alleged to infringe the letters patent, and that, as the result of an unsuccessful action by plaintiff and defendant to restrain the use of a certain trade-mark as infringing defendant\u2019s trade-mark, the latter had been declared invalid, and that defendant had failed to furnish advertising copy as agreed, sued for damages for breach of contract and for a declaration that royalties under the agreement were not payable. Defendant disputed plaintiff\u2019s allegations and claims and counterclaimed for an accounting of O\u2019Cedar products sold and payment of royalties.\nHeld, affirming in this respect (Newcombe J. dissenting) judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (60 Ont. L.R. 525), that plaintiff\u2019s action failed; defendant was obligated to prosecute actions against actual infringers only, and plaintiff had not established that the mops alleged to infringe the patent actually did so; further, on giving to the agreement its proper construction and effect, the clause obliging defendant to take action to prevent infringement was rendered inoperative by plaintiff\u2019s failure to continue operating \u201cunder the letters patent,\u201d as, since 1921, the mops manufactured and sold by plaintiff had not been made under the patent; moreover, if plaintiff did not sell mops made under the patent, it could hardly suffer actual loss by reason of its infringement, and without establishing actual loss it was not entitled to damages; moreover, although the patent had not been declared invalid, as plaintiff was not selling mops made under it there were no royalties payable \u201cin respect of the patent,\u201d and therefore nothing upon which the relevant relieving clause could operate; plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages for defendant\u2019s failure to protect it from infringement of the trade-mark failed, because no demand for action was made pursuant to the agreement, and because of lack of evidence of infringement, or loss suffered thereby; also its claim for breach of covenant to furnish copies of advertising failed upon the evidence. (Newcombe J., dissenting, held that the contract did not require that there should be an infringement of the mop patent before the authorized demand could have its contractual effect; defendant had contracted an absolute obligation, in a reasonable case, upon the specified demand, to take the necessary proceedings; the trial judge had decided in effect that proceedings were necessary to prevent infringements, and there was adequate evidence to uphold this finding.)\nHeld, further, reversing in this respect the judgment of the Appellate Division, that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim failed, as, on construction of the agreement and on the evidence, the articles in question in respect of which royalties were claimed were not \u201cO\u2019Cedar products\u201d and therefore not liable to royalties.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which (reversing judgment of Kelly J.1) held that the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim allowed.\nThe defendant was a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois, with its head office in the city of Chicago. It manufactured and sold in the United States products consisting of (inter alia) polishing mops, labelled and marked \u201cO\u2019Cedar.\u201d The plaintiff was a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, with head office in the city of Toronto. By an agreement dated May 1, 1915, which recited (inter alia) that the defendant was entitled to certain letters patent for the Dominion of Canada, and was the owner of the trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar\u201d duly registered in Canada, and that all articles manufactured under the patents should be labelled or marked with said trade mark, the defendant granted to the plaintiff the exclusive license to make, use, exercise and vend in Canada the inventions which were the subject matter of the letters patent; the plaintiff to pay a royalty of 10% of the net amount of O\u2019Cedar products shipped and billed in Canada. The plaintiff was not, during the subsistence of the license, to raise any objection to the validity of the let- ters patent or inventions, and was to do all in its power to detect infringements and threatened infringements of the letters patent and trade-mark within Canada, and, if required by defendant, but at the cost of defendant, to assist it in instituting and prosecuting legal proceedings for the prevention of such infringements. The defendant granted to the plaintiff the right to the exclusive use of the trademark \u201cO\u2019Cedar.\u201d The plaintiff agreed \u201cto operate in the Dominion of Canada under the letters patent * * * and to use the said trade-mark.\u201d By clause 10 of the agreement the defendant agreed that it would \u201cwithin one month after receipt of written demand by the [plaintiff] institute and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to prevent any infringement of the said letters patent * * * and said trade-mark within the Dominion of Canada,\u201d and, by clause 11, it was agreed that if a certain mop patent should in any action for infringement or proceedings for revocation be declared to be invalid all royalties payable in respect thereof under the agreement should forthwith cease to be payable, but if the decision of the court making such declaration should be reversed on appeal, the said royalties should forthwith again become payable together with all royalties which would have been payable but for the adverse decision. By clause 18 the defendant agreed to furnish from time to time to the plaintiff copies of all advertising which it might use.\nIn its statement of claim the plaintiff, among other things, alleged that it had demanded that defendant should take proceedings to enjoin the manufacture and sale in Canada of certain mops which, plaintiff alleged, infringed the letters patent, and that defendant failed or omitted to comply; that in or about the year 1922 the plaintiff and defendant brought an action in the province of British Columbia to restrain certain persons from manufacturing or selling mops and polishes under the trade-mark of \u201cCedar-Brite\u201d or similar word infringing the defendant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar,\u201d but that the action failed, and in the result the defendant\u2019s trade-mark was declared to be invalid[2]; that, by reason of defendant\u2019s failure or omission to protect the plaintiff from infringements of the mop patents and trade-mark, it was relieved from liability to pay royalties; that the defendant had failed to furnish it with advertising copy in accordance with the agreement; and the plaintiff claimed (inter alia) a declaration that the royalties were not payable, and damages.\nThe defendant disputed the plaintiff\u2019s said allegations and claims, denied any default on its part under the agreement, and, alleging that the plaintiff had failed to account for O\u2019Cedar products sold, counterclaimed for an accounting and payment of the amount of royalties found due.\nKelly J. gave judgment for the plaintiff on its claim, and dismissed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim[3]. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division, which held that the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim allowed3. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nBy the judgment of this Court, now reported, as to plaintiff\u2019s claim the appeal was dismissed with costs, Newcombe J. dissenting; as to defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the appeal was allowed with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nG.W. Mason K.C. and F.W. Torrance for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and J.W. Pickup for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and, Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.) was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014In this action the plaintiff seeks to recover from the defendant damages for the defendant\u2019s failure to observe the terms of the agreement entered into on May 1, 1915, and for a declaration that the royalties payable by the plaintiff under said agreement should not become payable until the defendant remedies its default.\nThe parties to the agreement were the defendant as licensor, the plaintiff as licensee, C.A. Channell, president of the defendant corporation, and A.T. Channell, president of the plaintiff company.\nThe agreement recited that the licensor had been granted letters patent no. 150,322 in the Dominion of Canada for inventions relating to improvements in polishing mops, dusters, and polishing and cleaning materials and processes, and that it had applied for letters patent for improvements in respect of the said inventions. It also recited that the licensor was \u201cthe owner of the trade-mark O\u2019Cedar, duly registered in the Dominion of Canada,\u201d and that \u201call articles manufactured under said patents, granted, applied for or to be applied for hereafter, shall be labelled or marked with such trade-mark.\u201d By the agreement the licensor granted to the licensee the exclusive license to make, use and vend in Canada the inventions which were the subject matter of the letters patent, and also the exclusive use in Canada of the trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar.\u201d The licensee on its part agreed to operate in Canada under the letters patent and to use the trade-mark, and to pay to the licensor monthly a royalty of 10% of the net amount of O\u2019Cedar products shipped and billed in Canada. Then there are the following provisions:\u2014\n10. THE LICENSOR shall within one month after receipt of written demand by the Licensee institute and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to prevent any infringement of the said letters patent, granted, applied for or to be applied for, and said trade-mark within the Dominion of Canada.\n11. If the Letters Patent Numbered 1 in the First Part of Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto shall in any action for infringement or proceedings for revocation be declared to be invalid on any ground whatsoever all royalties payable in respect of such patent hereunder shall forthwith cease to be payable, but if the decision of the Court making such declaration shall be reversed on appeal, the said royalties shall forthwith again become payable together with all royalties which would have been payable but for the adverse decision * * *.\nClause 13 provides that during the continuance of the license the licensor will not make or vend within Canada any O\u2019Cedar product; and clause 18 provides that the licensor shall furnish free of charge to the licensee \u201ccopies of any and all advertising which it may use or cause to be used.\u201d\nIn 1922 the plaintiff and the defendant joined in bringing an action in the courts of British Columbia to restrain one Rombough and the Dust Control Company from selling in that province mops and polishes under the name of \u201cCedar\u201d or \u201cCedarbrite\u201d on the ground that these names were an infringement of the trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar.\u201d The action failed and it was held that the registration of the word \u201cO\u2019Cedar\u201d as a trade-mark did not prevent the use by another person of the word \u201cCedar\u201d as applied to goods manufactured for a similar purpose. (Channell Limited v. Rombough[4]). The plaintiff then complained that it had lost the exclusive use of the trade-mark which the defendant covenanted it should have and requested the defendant to make a reduction in the royalties payable under the agreement. The defendant would not agree. The plaintiff then wrote to the defendant complaining that two mops\u2014the Universal Polish Mop and the Big Wonder Oil Mop\u2014were being sold in large numbers in Canada in competition with the plaintiff\u2019s mops; that these mops were an infringement of the defendant\u2019s patent, and requesting the defendant to take legal proceedings to restrain the sale of these mops. As no proceedings were taken the plaintiff made a demand upon the defendant, in accordance with clause 10 of the agreement, that it should institute and prosecute actions against the Robert Simpson Company, Limited, and the T. Eaton Company, Limited, both of Toronto, for selling the above mentioned mops. The defendant did not comply with this demand and the plaintiff thereupon brought this action.\nIn its pleadings the defendant denied that it had made any default in the observance or performance of the terms of the contract by it to be performed, and, by way of counterclaim, asked an accounting by the plaintiff of the O\u2019Cedar products sold, and of the royalties payable thereon. The trial judge gave judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favour[5], holding that the defendant was, by reason of clause 10, under obligation to take legal proceedings against alleged infringers upon demand being made therefor, and he directed a reference to ascertain the damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the non-performance by the defendant of its obligation. He also relieved the plaintiff from paying royalties so long as the defendant neglected to take proceedings. The defendant\u2019s counterclaim he dismissed with costs. On appeal the First Divisional Court5 reversed this judgment and dismissed the action. On the counterclaim the defendant was held entitled to succeed, with a reference as to the amount of the royalties due. From that judgment the plaintiff now appeals. To the plaintiff\u2019s claim that it is entitled to be relieved from liability to pay royalties in respect of the mops manufactured under the mop patent or sold under the trademark, or to damages for breach of contract by reason of the failure of the defendant to protect it against infringements of the patent, there are two answers: The first answer is that given by the First Divisional Court that clause 10 obligated the defendant to prosecute actions against actual infringers only, and that the plaintiff failed to establish that the mops which were alleged to infringe the patent, actually did so.\nThe second answer is, that the obligation imposed on the defendant by clause 10 is dependent upon the performance by the plaintiff of its covenant \u201cto operate in the Dominion of Canada under the letters patent,\u201d and that covenant the plaintiff has not performed. It is admitted by the plaintiff that since 1921, when it commenced to rivet the fabric to the mop head, the mops which it has been manufacturing and selling were not made under the patent. Now it is, in our opinion, quite clear that both clause 10 and clause 11 contemplate the continued manufacture and sale of mops in accordance with the patent. A failure, therefore, on the part of the plaintiff to continue operating under the patent would, we think, render inoperative that part of clause 10 which refers to proceedings to protect the patent from being infringed. In any event, it is difficult to see how the plaintiff, who does not sell mops made under the patent, can suffer any actual loss by reason of its infringement. Without establishing actual loss, in a case such as this, the plaintiff is not entitled to damages, for, as pointed out by Ferguson J.A. in the court below, \u201cdamages must be something awarded to compensate for an actual loss rather than a theoretical loss.\u201d Under the contract the only royalties the payment of which are to cease in case the patent is declared invalid are those \u201cpayable in respect of such patent.\u201d The patent has not been declared invalid nor is its validity in issue in this action. The plaintiff covenanted that it would not question its validity during the continuance of the agreement and the defendant cannot derogate from its own grant. Both parties admit its validity. We cannot, therefore, pass upon it. But even if the patent had been declared invalid, the plaintiff, under clause 11, could only be relieved from the payment of those royalties which are \u201cpayable in respect of the patent,\u201d that is, those payable on mops manufactured in accordance with the patent and sold in Canada. As the plaintiff was not selling mops manufactured under the patent there were no royalties payable \u201cin respect of the patent\u201d and therefore nothing upon which clause 11 could operate. The plaintiff, it is true, was paying royalties to the defendant, but it was in respect of mops manufactured outside of the patent which were shipped and billed in Canada as \u201cO\u2019Cedar products.\u201d We are, therefore, of opinion that the plaintiff had not established any right to be relieved of its liability for the payment of royalties or for damages for failure by the defendant to protect it from infringements of the patent.\nAs to the trade-mark: The plaintiff performed its covenant \u201cto use the trade-mark,\u201d and claims damages for the failure of the defendant to protect it from the infringement thereof. Under clause 10 the defendant is under obligation to institute an action to prevent infringement of the trade-mark, only after the receipt of a written demand therefor. No demand was made. Further, there was no evidence that any infringement existed, or that the plaintiff had suffered loss thereby. This may be accounted for by the fact that this court in the Rombough case[6], if it did not expressly declare the trade-mark to be invalid, in effect did so. The agreement, however, makes no provision as to the plaintiff\u2019s right in such event. It could doubtless allege a partial failure of consideration and claim damages therefor. But to succeed on that ground the plaintiff would have to submit evidence of infringement and loss suffered thereby. No such evidence is before us. So far as the evidence discloses, the plaintiff may have been the only person in Canada using the trade-mark when this action was commenced.\nThe plaintiff also claims damages for breach of the covenant contained in clause 18. Upon this claim it is not entitled to succeed. The evidence shews that the defendant reasonably and substantially complied with the covenant. It also shews that the gist of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was not that it was not supplied with copies of the adver- tising matter used by the defendant, but that it did not get in advance a synopsis of the ideas which the defendant intended embodying in its future advertisements. The agreement did not require the defendant to furnish such a synopsis. So far, therefore, as the plaintiff\u2019s claim is concerned, we agree with the Appellate Division that it should be dismissed.\nIn reference to the counterclaim, the real question involved is whether Char Mops, Victor Mops, and a polish called Chan Wax, manufactured and sold by the plaintiff, were O\u2019Cedar products, and therefore liable to royalties.\nThe term \u201cO\u2019Cedar products\u201d was not defined in the agreement, nor was there a word of evidence given at the trial as to what the parties understood it to include. We must, therefore, construe it in the light of the language of the agreement and the conduct of the parties.\nIn view of\n(1) the fact that the plaintiff obtained the exclusive use in Canada of the trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar\u201d, and agreed to operate in Canada under the letters patent and to use the trade\u2011mark;\n(2) the recital that all articles manufactured under the letters patent should be labelled or marked with the trademark, and\n(3) the fact that the only part of the plaintiff\u2019s business affected by the agreement was manufacturing under the letters patent and selling under the trade-mark,\nwe are of opinion that the term \u201cO\u2019Cedar products\u201d was intended by the parties to mean and include all articles manufactured by the plaintiff under the letters patent, and all articles advertised or sold by it under the trade-mark.\nThe Char Mop was designed by one Peters of the plaintiff company. Admittedly it does not come within the defendant\u2019s Canadian patent, and it was not advertised or sold under the trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar.\u201d It was devised for the purpose of meeting a demand for a cheaper mop than the O\u2019Cedar mops, and was sold at cost so as to hold the trade and increase the volume of factory production. Being sold as one of the plaintiff\u2019s products, no doubt it derived some benefit from the advertising of the O\u2019Cedar products, but it is not claimed that the agreement prohibits the plaintiff from manufacturing and selling outside of the agree- ment. The Victor Mop is in a similar position. At the time of the trial it had been on the market only two months. Like the Char Mop it does not come within the patent, and was not advertised or sold under the trade-mark. In our opinion neither of these mops can be said to be O\u2019Cedar products.\nThe polish known as Chan Wax was put up by the plaintiff from a formula arrived at by means of experiments made by one of its employees without any information or assistance from the defendant. In putting it on the market the plaintiff had printed on the box in which the wax was sold the statement that it was manufactured by the makers of O\u2019Cedar products, and in one of its circulars it advertised O\u2019Cedar products and Chan Wax together. These acts, in our opinion, do not justify the inference that the wax was being sold as an O\u2019Cedar product.\nFurthermore, in his testimony A.T. Channell stated that within three months after the wax was put on the market he had a conversation with the president of the defendant company in reference to it. His evidence as to what was said is as follows:\u2014\nQ. What did you say to him?\nA. I told him we were changing the name from \u201cO\u2019Cedar\u201d to \u201cChan.\u201d We were not using O\u2019Cedar but Chan.\nThere was no contradiction of this. As the defendant was well aware that the plaintiff was selling the wax under the name of \u201cChan\u201d and not under \u201cO\u2019Cedar\u201d, and made no claim for royalties thereon, the proper inference to be drawn, in our opinion, is that the defendant recognized the right of the plaintiff to manufacture and sell the wax, without paying a royalty thereon, so long as it was not advertised or sold under the trade-mark \u201cO\u2019Cedar\u201d.\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that the defendant is not entitled to royalties in respect of these three articles, and, as it was admitted that all other royalties on O\u2019Cedar products had been paid, the counterclaim, in our opinion, should have been dismissed.\nThe appeal as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim should, therefore, be dismissed with costs. The appeal as to the counterclaim should be allowed with costs.\nNEWCOMBE J. (dissenting in part).\u2014My difficulty is that the contract does not require that there shall be an in- fringement of the mop-patent before the written demand authorized by paragraph 10 of the agreement can have its contractual effect. What the clause says is that:\n10. THE LICENSOR shall within one month after receipt of written demand by the licensee institute and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to prevent any infringement of the said letters patent, granted, applied for or to be applied for, and said trade-mark within the Dominion of Canada.\nThis I interpret to mean that the licensor has contracted an absolute obligation, in a reasonable case, upon the specified demand, to institute and prosecute the necessary actions and proceedings. The learned trial judge has decided in effect that proceedings were necessary to prevent infringements, and there is adequate evidence to uphold this finding. The purpose of the covenant, as I read it, was to assure the licensee, who was to use the patent and pay royalties to the licensor for this privilege, that he would be protected in the market to the extent that threatened infringements would be prevented, and that, if, in any action for that purpose, or in any proceedings for revocation, the patent were declared invalid, payment of royalties would be suspended or cease. Thus, in a way, the licensor, in order to earn his royalties, undertook to uphold his title. Obviously the licensor cannot escape liability by refusing to concern himself in alleged infringements which might upon trial result in a declaration of invalidity, and, subject to the provisions of clause 11, terminate the royalties. It would be unjust that the licensor should be allowed to prevent or obstruct the working of clauses 10 and 11, which were designed for the security of the licensee in the conditions for which those two clauses provide.\nAs to the registered trade-mark, in the circumstances disclosed by the case, it appears, as such, to have become frustrate.\nIn my opinion, there is a breach of the agreement as expressed, and I would allow the appeal, but I agree in the conclusion as to the counterclaim.\nAs to plaintiff\u2019s claim, appeal dismissed with costs; as to defendant\u2019s counterclaim, appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McWhinney & Brown.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\n[1] 60 Ont.

Code, a. 1014 (2)).\nThe accused was convicted on a charge of receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen. At his trial, evidence was admitted of statements made in his presence by the supposed thieves to a constable. In charging the jury, the judge referred to these statements as evidence that might be regarded, but warned them of the danger of accepting evidence of accomplices without corroboration. On objection by accused\u2019s counsel to the charge, he recalled the jury and said: \u201cI have already warned you in this case it would be most dangerous for you to rely on (the thieves\u2019) evidence as against the prisoner without feeling it was corroborated in other respects because (of) what they said (when) the prisoner was there. He did not express any particular assent to it and you should reasonably be bound by what he did assent to and I think on the whole it is almost worthless evidence for you.\u201d\nHeld: The conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered, on the ground of misdirection. It is only when the accused, by \u201cword or conduct, action or demeanour,\u201d has accepted what they contain, and to the extent that he does so, that statements made by other persons in his presence have any evidentiary value; and there was no evidence from which a jury might infer anything in the nature of an admission by accused of the accuracy of what was incriminating in the statements in question. The jury should have been told that, in the absence of any assent by the accused either by word or conduct to the correctness of the statements, they had no evidentiary value whatever as against him and should be entirely disregarded. It was impossible to say that there had been no miscarriage of justice, and apply s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code; it may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the view that in all human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury\u2019s mind, and, on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict (Kelly v. R. 54 Can. S.C.R. 220); but here, in a most vital matter, the judge had not only failed to warn the jury to disregard the statements, but had actually stressed them, in that he in effect told the jury that they were \u201cevidence\u201d upon which, if corroborated, they might act.\nCanadian Encyclopedic Digest, Ont. Ed., vol. 4, pp. 405, 406-7; Makin v. Att. Gen. for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, at p. 70; Ibrahim v. R., [1914] A.C. 599, at p. 616; Allen v. R., 44 Can. S.C.R. 331; Gouin v. R., [1926] S.C.R. 539; R. v. Christie, [1914] A.C. 545, referred to. Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (37 Man. R. 367) reversed.\nAPPEAL on behalf of the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming (Fullerton J.A. dissenting) his conviction at trial before Galt J. with a jury, for the offences of unlawfully receiving and of unlawfully retaining stolen goods, knowing same to have been stolen.\nThe grounds of appeal were: insufficiency of evidence on which a jury could convict, wrongful admission of evidence, and misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nAt the trial the Crown called as a witness one Alexander, a detective, who, in the course of his evidence, deposed that, after the accused was arrested, he confronted him with the two men (one after the other) who had been charged with the theft of the goods in question, that (after giving the usual caution to these men and to the accused) he had questioned these men in the accused\u2019s presence; and what was said on that occasion (of which Alexander took notes at the time) was given by Alexander in evidence, counsel for the accused objecting to its admissibility. On the appeal it was contended (inter alia) on behalf of the accused that that evidence should not have been admitted, and that the statements made by the said two men on the occasion in question, to which the accused had not assented, were, in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, wrongfully assumed to be evidence against the accused.\nOn the ground of misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, this Court allowed the accused\u2019s appeal, set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial. Portions of the judge\u2019s charge to which this Court made special reference are set out in the judgment now reported.\nJ. M. Isaacs for the appellant.\nJ. Allen K.C. for the respondent.\nArgument by counsel for the appellant on the ground of misdirection was stopped by the Court, but he was directed to proceed, if so advised, on the other ground of his appeal, namely: that there were not sufficient evidence of identification of the goods alleged to have been stolen. Counsel representing the Attorney General was informed that he might confine his answer to the questions of misdirection and whether substantial wrong or miscarriage had resulted therefrom.\nOn the conclusion of the argument, the judgment of the court was rendered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We are all of opinion that the conviction cannot stand. There was clearly misdirection by the learned trial judge on a very important and most material matter.\nCertain statements made in the presence of the accused by the supposed thieves to a constable (Alexander) were deposed to by the latter. In reference to these statements, and after reading at length to the jury the evidence pertinent thereto given by Alexander, the learned trial judge said:\nThat\u2019s the interview that was mentioned to you by Alexander, and as I said before you must accept that evidence. Bear in mind it is very dangerous to accept the evidence of accomplices like these fellows unless you feel satisfied it corresponds with the truth as told by other witnesses;\nand again\nIn the 9th volume of Halsbury it states: To prove that the goods were stolen, a confession by the thief is admissible; if it was made in the prisoner\u2019s presence, but not otherwise. * * * The thief is an admissible witness but the alleged receiver should not be convicted on his evidence alone without corroboration.\nBut for the introductory allusion to the Alexander interview, all this might be taken to have reference to the testimony given orally by Paulin and Webster at the trial, which, however, was markedly less incriminating for the accused than were their answers to Alexander in the interview related by him\u2014and the learned judge may have so intended these observations. Moreover, on objection being taken by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, citing R. v. Christie[2], counsel for the Crown replied:\nRex v. Christie lays down this, that where a statement is made in the presence of the accused it is admissible in evidence, but in instructing the jury on the Statute (sic), your Lordship must point out that what is contained in the statement is not evidence unless it is admitted.\nThe learned judge thereupon recalled the jury and said to them:\nObjections are being raised by Mr. Isaacs (to) the evidence that has been put in by these two thieves, who did steal coats from Eatons. I have already warned you in this case it would be most dangerous for you to rely on their evidence as against the prisoner without feeling it was corroborated in other respects because (of) what they said (when) the prisoner was there. He did not express any particular assent to it and you should reasonably be bound by what he did assent to and I think on the whole it is almost worthless evidence for you.\nThis is very far indeed from telling the jury, as the learned judge should have done, that, in the absence of any assent by the accused either by word or conduct to the correctness of the statements made in his presence, they had no evidentiary value whatever as against him and should be entirely disregarded.\nCounsel representing the Attorney General at bar admitted that in his original direction the trial judge had failed to appreciate the rule laid down in Christie\u2019s Case[3], but argued that he had corrected this error when the jury was recalled. We think he rather accentuated it, however, by again referring to the statements as \u201cevidence\u201d susceptible of corroboration.\nIt has been urged that this misdirection did not cause a miscarriage of justice and that s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code, therefore, applies. That subject has been ably dealt with in a recent article on \u201cEvidence\u201d by Dr. D. A. MacRae, a professor in the Law School at Osgoode Hall, published in the Fourth Volume of the Canadian Encyclopaedic Digest, Ontario Edition, which reviews all the leading decisions. In section 17, at p. 405, referring to the Makin Case[4], the writer points out (notes \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d) that Lord Herschell, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\nThe evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly influenced the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury. * * * Their Lordships do not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. Dr. MacRae also quotes from the judgment of the Privy\nCouncil, delivered by Lord Sumner, in Ibrahim v. R.[5]:\nWhere the trial judge has warned the jury not to act upon the objectionable evidence, the Court of Criminal Appeal * * * may refuse to interfere, if it thinks that the jury, giving heed to that warning, would have returned the same verdict * * * or where evidence has been admitted inadvertently or erroneously, which is inadmissible but of small importance * * * or most unlikely to have affected the verdict. * * * Where the objectionable evidence has been left for the consideration of the jury without any warning to disregard it, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashes the conviction, if it thinks that the jury may have been influenced by it, even though without it there was evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction.\nThe present provision of the Criminal Code of Canada (s. 1014 (2)) is substantially the same as that dealt with in the Makin Case[6], and in Ibrahim v. R[7]. This Court had, in the Allen Case[8], already taken the same view of the effect of the former section 1019 of the Criminal Code and, since the substitution for it in 1923 of s. 1014 (2) in its present form, the statement of the law made in the earlier case (Allen v. The King8) was reaffirmed in Gouin v. The King[9].\nIt is impossible to say that in the case now before us there has been no miscarriage of justice. It may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the view that in all human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury\u2019s mind, and, on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict. (Kelly v. R.[10]. But it is impossible so to regard this case, where, in a most vital matter, the learned judge did not merely fail to warn the jury to disregard the objectionable matter contained in the statements which had been admitted in evidence, but actually stressed it. It is only when the accused by \u201cword or conduct, action or demeanour\u201d has accepted what they contain, and to the extent that he does so, that statements made by other persons in his presence have any evidentiary value. In the present case there is no evidence in the record from which a jury might infer anything in the nature of an admission by the accused of the accuracy of what was incriminating in the statements of the thieves given in evidence by Alexander. When the jury was recalled, the learned trial judge, far from telling them, as Crown Counsel had suggested was the course indicated in Christie\u2019s Case[11], that the statements in question had no evidentiary value in the absence of some such admission by the accused, in effect told them that they were \u201cevidence\u201d upon which they might act, if corroborated, inasmuch as he said to them that it would be dangerous for them to rely upon such evidence as against the prisoner \u201cwithout feeling that it was corroborated.\u201d\nOn this ground we are of opinion that the appeal must succeed.\nAs to the other ground taken by Mr. Isaacs, we are clearly of the view that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury and that, if there had been a proper direction as to the statements so much discussed, the attack upon the conviction must have failed.\nAs in the recent cases of Brooks v. The King[12], and Hubin v. The King[13], \u201cthe circumstances do not seem to call for an unqualified order quashing the conviction and directing the discharge of the appellant.\u201d On the contrary, we think it clear that our discretion \u201cshould be exercised in such a manner as to afford the Crown an opportunity of once more putting the law in motion.\u201d R. v. Burr[14].\nThe conviction will, accordingly, be set aside and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal allowed, conviction set aside and new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Isaacs & Isaacs.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Allen.\n[1] 37 Man.

He applied to a judge of this Court for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that on and prior to December 10, 1917, the Canada Temperance Act was in force in said county, that on that date an Order in Council, passed pursuant to c. 30 of the Statutes of Canada, 1917, became effective, suspending the operation of the Canada Temperance Act in said county; that, at the time of the passing of said Order in Council, there was in force the New Brunswick Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916, referred to in said Order in Council as being as restrictive as the Canada Temperance Act; that in 1927 the New Brunswick Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, (c. 3) came into force, which repealed the 1916 Act, and was less restrictive than the Canada Temperance Act; and he contended that, as a result, the said suspension of the operation of the Canada Temperance Act automatically ceased, and that Act came into force in said county, and that the offences for which he was convicted and committed to gaol were offences against that Act and not against the provincial Act.\nHeld (by Mignault J., and, on appeal, by the Court), without pronouncing on the merits of said contention, that a judge of this Court had no jurisdiction to issue the writ applied for, as the commitment was not \u201cin any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d within the meaning of s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act (In re Roberts [1923] S.C.R. 152; In re Dean, 48 Can.

The material facts, and the grounds of the petition, are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Mignault J. now reported. The appeal from his judgment was dismissed.\nThe petition was heard by Mignault J. on October 15, 1928, and on October 16, 1928, he gave judgment as follows: Migkault J.\u2014This is an application to me for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the petitioner Doherty. The respondents are John B. Hawthorne, keeper of the common gaol of the county of York, N.B., and Walter Limerick, Esq., police magistrate for the city of Fredericton.\nThe petitioner alleges that he is confined in the common gaol of the county of York in the province of New Brunswick under a warrant of commitment which he sets out in full. This commitment is signed by Walter Limerick, police magistrate, and commits the petitioner to the common gaol of the county of York under a conviction before the said police magistrate on October 1, 1928, and another conviction before the same magistrate on July 24, 1928. The conviction of October 1, 1928, was on a charge that Doherty \u201cdid sell intoxicating liquor, contrary to section 56 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act\u201d (a New Brunswick statute), and the conviction of July 24, 1928, was on a charge that Doherty did \u201chave liquor in his possession in an unauthorized place, contrary to the Intoxicating Liquor Act (also a New Brunswick statute), section 69.\u201d\nThe petition further alleges that on and prior to December 10, 1917, the Canada Temperance Act was in force in the county of York; and that by chapter 30 of the statutes of Canada of 1917, it was provided that on receipt of a petition in accordance with sections 111, 112 and 113 of the Canada Temperance Act, praying for the revocation of any Order in Council passed for bringing Part II of that Act into force in any city or county, if the Governor in Council should be of opinion that the laws of the province in which such city or county is situated, relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquor, were as restrictive as the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, the Governor in Council might, without the polling of any vote, by order published in the Canada Gazette, suspend the operation of the Canada Temperance Act in such city or county, such suspension to commence ten days after the date of the publication of such order and to continue as long as the provincial laws should continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\nThe petitioner states that, pursuant to the last mentioned statute, an Order in Council was passed on November 23, 1917, by the Governor in Council, and published in the Canada Gazette on December 1, 1917, suspending the operation of the Canada Temperance Act in the county of York in terms of the last mentioned statute. He says that at the time of the passing of the Order in Council there was in force in the province of New Brunswick the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916, and an Act in amendment thereof, whereby the sale of intoxicating liquor in the province for beverage purposes was prohibited, and was prohibited for all purposes except mechanical, religious, scientific and medicinal purposes, which statute is that referred to in the Order in Council of November 23, 1917, as being equally restrictive as the Canada Temperance Act.\nThe petitioner alleges that on September 6, 1927, the Act of Assembly of the Province of New Brunswick, assented to on April 20, 1927 (c. 3 of the Acts of 1927), came into force, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916, with amendments thereto, was repealed. Chapter 3 of 1927, he says, permits the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes, as well as for mechanical, religious, scientific and medicinal purposes, and is less restrictive in respect of provisions for the sale of intoxicating liquor than the Canada Temperance Act.\nIt is further alleged that upon repeal of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916, and amendments, and the coming into force of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, the Canada Temperance Act came into force in the county of York; and that the offence of which the petitioner was convicted, and for which he was committed to the common gaol of the county of York, is an offence against the Canada Temperance Act and not against the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927.\nOn these grounds, the petitioner prays for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, with a writ of certiorari to the police magistrate to produce all proceedings on record.\nAt the hearing, Mr. J. J. F. Winslow, K.C., appeared for the petitioner, and Mr. J. B. M. Baxter, K.C., Attorney General of New Brunswick, for the respondents. Mr. Baxter immediately took exception to my jurisdiction to issue the writ, on the ground that the petitioner had not been committed to gaol under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, citing section 57 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), subsection one of which is as follows:\n57. Every judge of the Court shall, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nI thought it preferable to restrict the hearing to the discussion of Mr. Baxter\u2019s objection to my jurisdiction, for if the objection be well taken, it disposes of the application.\nMr. Winslow\u2019s contention is sufficiently shewn by the averments of the petition which, for that reason, I have deemed it proper to set out in full detail. It is that, on the enactment by the New Brunswick Legislature of the 1927 statute, and the repeal of the statute of 1916, the suspension of the Canada Temperance Act by the Order in Council of 1917, automatically came to an end, and the latter Act is now in force in New Brunswick, and the offences committed by the petitioner were offences against it, the new provincial statute being alleged to be less restrictive than the Canada Temperance Act. A similar contention, I may say, was rejected by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Sheehan v. Shaw[1], which considered that the suspension could cease only if the Governor in Council revoked the suspending Order in Council.\nI have not, however, to pronounce on the merits of the point raised by Mr. Winslow, that the suspension of the Canada Temperance Act automatically came to an end on the enactment of the new provincial statute, for I am of opinion that Mr. Baxter\u2019s objection to my jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus is well taken.\nAll the pertinent authorities are cited in the recent decision of Mr. Justice Anglin (now Chief Justice of Canada) in In re J. H. Roberts[2], by which it was held that the limitation imposed by the concluding words of section 57, subsection 1, (then section 62) of the Supreme Court Act is absolute. Here, on its face, the commitment shews that the petitioner was committed under a conviction for an offence against a provincial statute, the New Brunswick Intoxicating Liquor Act. The second charge against Doherty, which I have seen, is that he did \u201csell intoxicating liquor contrary to section 56 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927,\u201d and the penalty imposed, counsel states, is that provided by the provincial law. It follows that the criminal case in which the petitioner was convicted and committed to gaol was not a criminal case under the Canada Temperance Act, and I cannot say that the commitment was \u201cin any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\u201d\nMr. Winslow strongly relied on the decision of Mr. Justice Duff in In re Dean[3]. In my opinion, however, it fully supports the conclusion to which I have come. There the offence charged was the crime of house-breaking, which was a criminal offence under the law of British Columbia, so that, as in the present case, the commitment was not in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nI can feel no doubt whatever that I am without jurisdiction to grant the writ, so I do not think I should accede to Mr. Winslow\u2019s request to refer this application to the court.\nThe petition is dismissed. I make no order as to costs.\nThe appeal from the above judgment was heard by the Court on November 13, 1928.\nJ. J. F. Winslow K.C. for the appellant (petitioner).\nJ. B. M. Baxter K.C. for the respondents.\nOn conclusion of the argument by counsel for the appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the judgment of the Court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We are all of the opinion that the appeal fails; the judgment appealed from seems entirely right; it is clear that a judge of this Court has no jurisdiction, there being no commitment in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada. Section 57 of the Supreme Court Act is explicit. The appeal is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant (petitioner): Winslow & McNair.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J. B. M.

The same business or industry might include many different occupations. The Board, in its order, had regard rather to the general nature of the industries in the carrying on of which the employees covered by it were engaged, than to the particular occupations therein of such employees. What the Act contemplated was that the Board, in fixing minimum wages, would take account of the nature of the employee's work rather than the general character of the industry or business in the carrying on of which the work would be done. The ascertainment of an employee's connection with a particular industry would not suffice to determine what would be for him a proper minimum wage.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia ([1928] 2 W.W.R.\n1) allowing plaintiff's claim for wages as a \" dish washer \" and waiter in defendant's logging camp, based on said order, reversed.\nRex v. Robertson & Hackett Sawmills Ltd. (38 B.C. Rep. 222) and Compton v. Allen Thrasher Lumber Co. (39 B.C. Rep. 70), so far as they are inconsistent herewith, overruled.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, by special leave, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] which (reversing the judgment of Cayley C.C.J.) held in favour of the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff had been em- ployed as a \" dish-washer\" and, later, as a waiter or \" flunkey \" in the defendant's logging camp, and had been paid by defendant at certain contract wages per day for his work, but he claimed that he was entitled to payment at the rate of 40 cents per hour, as being the minimum wage fixed by order of the Board of Adjustment dated September 29, 1926, and made under the Male Minimum Wage Act (Statutes of British Columbia, 1925, c. 32), and on the basis of having worked 13 hours per day.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, on the ground of invalidity of the said order of the Board of Adjustment.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nA. C. Boyce K.C. and Alexis Martin for the respondent (and also for the Attorney General of British Columbia).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) was engaged by the defendant company in its logging camp at Campbell River, British Columbia, for two periods during the year, 1927,\u2014first as a \" dish-washer \" at $3.20 per day and afterwards as a waiter, or \" flunkey,\" at first at the same wage and later at $3.45 a day. He appears to have been treated by his employers as liable to contribute to the Workmen's Compensation Fund a percentage of these wages. R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 278, s. 33.\nBy an Order of the Board of Adjustment (constituted under the Hours of Work Act, 1923) dated the 29th of September, 1926, and made under the Male Minimum Wage Act (B.C. Statutes, 1925, c. 32) the \" minimum wage for all employees in the lumbering industry\" was fixed at \" forty cents per hour.\" \"Lumbering industry\" was by the Order defined to include\nall operations in or incidental to the carrying on of logging camps, shingle mills, saw-mills, planning-mills, lath-mills, sash and door factories, box factories, barrel factories, veneer factories, and pulp and paper mills, and all operations in or incidental to the driving, rafting and booming of logs.\nAlleging that he was an employee in the \"lumbering industry\" of the defendants, the plaintiff sued in the County Court to recover the difference between the amounts paid him at the contract prices above stated and 40 cents per hour on the basis of having worked 13 hours per day.\n\"Employee\" is defined by the Act to mean\nEvery adult male person to whom this Act applies who is in receipt of or entitled to any compensation for labour or services performed for another.\nbut, by section 13, the Act is declared inapplicable to the occupations of \"farm labourers, fruit-pickers, fruit-packers, fruit and vegetable canners, and domestic servants.\"\nThe County Court Judge found that the working time of the plaintiff amounted in all to only 10 hours per day and that from that time must be deducted 11\/2 hours to cover meal times, leaving only 81\/2 hours as the actual working day to which the 40 cent rate per hour could apply. He also held, however, that the plaintiff was a \"domestic servant\" within section 13 and, accordingly, dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversed this judgment, holding that the plaintiff's working time was 13 hours per day and that he was not a \"domestic servant\" within section 13. Judgment was, accordingly, directed to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $187.30 with costs throughout.\nSubsequently special leave to appeal to this Court was obtained by the defendant company on the terms of its paying the costs of the Attorney General and of the plaintiff of the proposed appeal in any event thereof.\nAs the foundation of his action the plaintiff prefers the Order of the Board of Adjustment and it is obvious that validity of that Order is essential to his success.\nWe are, with respect, of the opinion that it is apparent on the face of the Order of the 29th of September, 1926, that, in making it, the Board misconceived the nature and scope of its functions under the Male Minimum Wage Act and that the Order, as made, is ultra vires and invalid.\nThe following portions of the statute indicate the powers and duties of the Board, so far as presently material:\n3. It shall be the duty of the Board to ascertain the wages paid to employees in the various occupations to which this Act applies, and to fix a minimum wage for such employees in the manner provided in this Act.\n5. (1) After inquiry the Board may by order establish a minimum wage for employees, and may establish a different minimum wage for different conditions and times of employment.\n**** 13. This Act shall apply to all occupations other than those of farmlabourers, fruit-pickers, fruit-packers, fruit and vegetable canners, and domestic servants.\nIt is apparent that the Act deals not with the industries or businesses of employers as such, but with the occupations of employees. The same business or industry may include many different occupations: thus, a bread-making establishment may employ bread-makers, drivers of distributing wagons, book-keepers, shop assistants, etc.; and of such employees each of the classes mentioned would have a different occupation. A fruit rancher may employ fruit-cultivators, fruit-pickers, fruit-packers, fruit-canners, book-keepers, drivers, etc.; yet, while the fruit-cultivator and the driver and the book keeper have occupations which may bring them within the Act, the occupations of the fruit-picker, fruit-packer and fruit-canner exclude them from its operation. These illustrations suffice to make it apparent that, the occupation of the employee being what the Act is concerned with, the ascertainment of his connection with a particular industry or business does not suffice to determine what will be for him a proper minimum wage.\nThe enumeration in the Board's Order of the activities included by it in the \"lumbering industry\" makes it abundantly clear that in making its Order, it had regard rather to the general nature of the industries in the carrying on of which the employees covered by it were engaged than to the particular occupations therein of such employees. The carpenter or painter is not the less engaged each in a different occupation because both happen to be employed in connection with erecting a factory, the one to build it and the other to paint it. The occupation of the driver of a team of horses and that of the river driver are not the less distinct because both may happen to be engaged in handling logs. The pursuits of the stationary engineer and the mill-hand do not cease to be separate and distinct occupations because each is employed in the same sash and door factory. Moreover, for men the nature of whose employment requires them to be continuously \" on call\" during long hours, though not actually at work (e.g., messengers and watchmen), the same minimum wage per hour of employment is scarcely appropriate as that which would be fixed for men whose employment consists of continual physical work during stated, but comparatively shorter hours (e.g., woodsmen, or factory hands). That the Provincial Legislature was alive to the difference in regard to the nature and hours of employment between men engaged in actual industrial work and persons employed in incidental work connected with industries, such as office clerks, boarding-house and bunk-house assistants, is manifest from s. 2 of the Labour Regulation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 126.\nIn a word, what, in our opinion, the Male Minimum Wage Act contemplates is that the Board in fixing minimum wages will take account of the nature of the employee's work, will consider how exacting it may be, what mental and physical effort it may entail and the conditions under which it is performed, such as the inconvenience, hardship and risk incidental to it, rather than the general character of the industry or business in the carrying on of which the work will be done or services rendered.\nJust as s. 3 requires the Board to deal separately with each kind of occupation, i.e., taking an illustration from the concrete case before us, to distinguish between such entirely different occupations as that of the woodsman and of the dining room waiter, so s. 5 contemplates that it will classify and establish different rates of minimum wages for men pursuing the same trade or calling under different conditions and hours of employment, some entailing greater hardships and inconveniences than others\u2014as, for instance, again using the concrete case before us by way of illustration, between the waiter in the town restaurant and the waiter, or \" flunkey,\" in the distant lumber camp.\nThat such considerations did not influence the Board in making its Order of the 29th of September, 1926, but that, on the contrary, it grouped indiscriminately in that Order all employees engaged in the manufacture or handling of wood products and fixed for all the same minimum wage without regard to the particular occupation of each class of employee, seems to us so clear on the face of the Order that its invalidity is beyond doubt. A contrary view was taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Rex v. Robertson & Hackett Sawmills, Ltd.[2]. That decision has been carefully considered. In so far as it is inconsist- ent with this judgment it must be overruled, as must also Compton v. Allen Thrasher Lumber Co. (1).\nThe appeal will, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed. Pursuant to the undertaking given, the appellant will pay the costs in this court of the Attorney General and of the respondent. There will be no costs to either party in the provincial courts.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pattullo & Tobin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Mark Cosgrove.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of British Columbia: Alexis Martin.\n[1] [1928] 2 W.W.R. 1.\n[2] (1926) 38 B.C.

C. Robertson K.C. for the appellant.\nF. J. Laverty K.C., and Jos. Blain for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench affirming (Greenshields and Cannon JJ. dissenting) the judgment of Lane J., dismissing its action.\nThe action is based on two policies of insurance, issued by the defendant company, on a building owned by the plaintiff and therein described as\nthe three and four storey brick building with metal and composition roof situate, etc.\nBoth policies were in force at the time of the fire which destroyed the building.\nThe material facts as found by the learned trial judge, and as the evidence establishes them, were as follows:\u2014\nThe insured premises had been occupied until the 1st day of March, 1920, by the A. A. Cooper Wagon and Buggy Company, which, as its name implies, manufactured wagons and buggies, and also awnings, and which appears to have done business as well under other names which it sometimes assumed. On the above date it ceased manufacturing or doing business * * *. It has apparently gone into voluntary liquidation, and we are told that the witness Austin A. Cooper, who is treasurer of the plaintiff company, and his brother W. F. Cooper, who Austin A. Cooper says were the shareholders in the extinct wagon and buggy company, had for five years been trying to dispose and had in part disposed of the remaining assets of the last-named company, among which was the old machinery. In March, 1926, they sold the old machinery to a firm of Lewis and Kulp, wreckers and junk dealers, and for about a month before the fire in question the latter had been removing from time to time, this scrap machinery they had purchased. Among that machinery so purchased to be removed was a large fly wheel which they needed to break up for the purposes of transportation, and, in the process of breaking it up they applied an acetylene torch, which igniting the old grease on and about the wheel, started the conflagration, which totally destroyed the premises. Austin A. Cooper says that previous to the fire, Lewis had asked permission to use such a torch, and that he had refused to grant it, and the witness Rafferty said he asked permission from him and he referred him to Austin A. Cooper. The latter claims to have been previously watching the men of Lewis and Kulp removing the machinery, but at the time of the fire, although Lewis and Kulp were strangers to him, and had had in their minds the use of an acetylene torch, the insured premises, where the old machinery was, was (sic) deserted by every representative of plaintiff, and the men of Lewis and Kulp were entirely alone in the premises.\nOf the several defences raised by the insurance company only one, in the view we take of it, requires consideration.\nAttached to each of the policies was a rider containing a clause in these words:\u2014\nWarranted that the building is used solely for warehouse purposes.\nSome question arose as to whether this clause formed part of each of the policies. The finding of the learned trial judge that the riders included these clauses to the knowledge and with the concurrence of the assured and that it was bound by them is fully supported by the evidence. Two questions arise as to them: what is their import? and, were they false?\nWhether these clauses should be regarded as warranties in the strict sense of the term or as representations as to the character and description of the premises insured is probably of no importance, since, in either view, their untruth, in our opinion, if established, prevents recovery under the policies. Viewed as representations, their materiality, we think, admits of no doubt. They determined the acceptability of the risk and the rate of the premium charged for the insurance.\nAlthough the clauses in question were pleaded as warranties that the building had been \u201cerected as\u201d a warehouse, the real defence based upon them and put forward at the trial, and to which the evidence was directed, was that the use made of the building at the time the policies were effected and up to the time of the fire which destroyed it was not \u201csolely for warehouse purposes\u201d\u2014that at no material time was the building in use solely as a \u201cwarehouse\u201d within any meaning which could reasonably be given to that term. We think this appeal should be determined upon the real issue presented by the alleged warranties as found in the policies and as fought out at the trial, rather than upon any erroneous conception of their purport indicated in the defendant\u2019s plea. On the issues actually tried\u2014whether the clauses under consideration be regarded as meaning only that the insured building was at the time of effecting the insurance in use solely for warehousing purposes, or that it was then, and during the currency of the insurance would continue to be, so used (the latter, we think, was what the parties intended and understood)\u2014the evidence, in our opinion, established conclusively that the warranties or representations were in fact false and were so to the knowledge of the insured. We agree with the view expressed by the trial judge as to the connotation of the word \u201cwarehouse\u201d in these policies. Neither when the policies were issued, nor at any time during their currency was any substantial part of the insured building used as a \u201cwarehouse\u201d or for \u201cwarehouse purposes\u201d; most of it, indeed, was always used for other purposes. As put by the trial judge \u201cthe building in question was a defunct or extinct wagon and buggy factory.\u201d\nAs put by Mr. Justice Howard in the Court of King\u2019s Bench:\nIt was submitted on behalf of the appellant that \u201cwarehouse\u201d and \u201cstorage\u201d are synonymous and so \u201cfor warehouse purposes\u201d means \u201cfor the purposes of storage,\u201d and it was argued that the warranty in question was strictly fulfilled, inasmuch as the plant, tools, etc., and materials of the defunct buggy and wagon company had been left in storage in the building and that a certain part of it had been set apart, arranged and used for the storage of other effects. That submission is right so far as it goes, but to my mind it does not go far enough, for the word \u201cwarehouse,\u201d whether used as a noun or an adjective, implies a place prepared and used for the storage of goods and effects, whether belonging to the proprietor of the building or to others, and further implies that the building will be properly equipped and managed so as safely to keep goods stored in it. And the expression \u201cis used solely for warehouse purposes\u201d includes what I have just stated and also that the premises will be put to no other use than the storing and safeguarding of such goods and effects. I consider that the learned judge of the trial court has given a fair and reasonable definition of the expression and what is necessarily implied in it, and I agree with him that the insured premises and the use to which they were put fell far short of complying with the warranty.\nIf used at all \u201cfor warehouse purposes\u201d within the meaning of the clause in question, the building was never at any time while insured by the respondent company solely used for such purposes.\nWe are, for these reasons, of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. C. Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blain & Simard.\n[1] (1928) Q.R. 45 K.B. 335.\n"}

Canada Products Ltd., [1928] S.C.R. 573\nDate: 1928-04-30\nRobert H. Bourk (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nCanada Products Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1928: April 30.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nPleadings\u2014Refusal of amendment at trial\u2014New trial ordered\u2014Costs\u2014Claim for breach of logging contract.\nOn the question, whether plaintiff or defendant was responsible for termination of a logging contract between them, the trial judge, on his construction of defendant\u2019s counterclaim, held that defendant was not entitled to rely on what took place prior to November 14, 1924, and refused to allow amendment. The Court of Appeal, Sask. (27 Sask. L.R. 29, allowing plaintiff\u2019s appeal, and dismissing defendant\u2019s cross-appeal, from the judgment at trial) took the same view on the pleadings, and also refused amendment. On defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court, a new trial was directed, as the Court, while not holding that the construction given below to the pleading was erroneous (though such construction seemed to this Court rather narrow), or that the trial judge had wrongly exercised his discretion as to amendment, was of opinion that, under the circumstances, the trial was unsatisfactory, and that justice could only be done by a new trial. Costs down to the asking of amendment at trial were to be borne by defendant, costs subsequent thereto to be in the discretion of the judge presiding at the new trial.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and dismissing the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal from the judgment of Maclean J. at the trial.\nThe parties entered into a contract whereby the defendant was to cut, log and deliver timber at the plaintiff\u2019s mill. The contract came to an end, the responsibility for which was a matter in dispute. The plaintiff sued for moneys alleged to have been paid by it, after the termination of the contract, to release liens placed upon their logs for wages due to the defendant\u2019s workmen. The defendant disputed the claim, and, alleging that the plaintiff had wrongfully repudiated and terminated the logging contract, counter-claimed for damages.\nMaclean J. held that the plaintiff was responsible for the termination of the contract, and that, as its claim arose under the contract, it could not recover, and dismissed the action; but he also held that, under the circumstances to be considered in fixing the basis and quantum of damages, and taking into account, for the purpose of estimating the damages, the moneys paid by the plaintiff to discharge the workmen\u2019s liens, the defendant had suffered no actual damage, and he dismissed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed, and the defendant cross-appealed, to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. That Court[2] held that the defendant must be held responsible for the termination of the contract; that the plaintiff\u2019s claim should have been allowed, and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim dismissed; and, accordingly, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and dismissed the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal.\nOn the question of the responsibility for the termination of the contract, the judgments at trial and in the Court of Appeal proceeded upon what took place between the parties on and after November 14, 1924. Late in the course of the trial the judge interrupted defendant\u2019s counsel, while examining a witness, to remind him that the defendant was not complaining in his pleadings of having been delayed by the plaintiff before November 14. Counsel for defendant asked that, if necessary, he be allowed to amend, but this was refused. The Court of Appeal[3] took the same view as the trial judge as to the limited interpretation and effect of the defendant\u2019s pleading in charging the plaintiff for breach of contract, and also refused to allow an amendment. In the course of his argument before the Supreme Court of Canada, counsel for the defendant contended that a too narrow and strict interpretation had been taken of the defendant\u2019s pleadings in his counterclaim, and that, on such pleadings, he was entitled to rely on events prior to November 14, 1924.\nAfter hearing argument by counsel for both parties, the members of the Court retired, and on their returning to the Bench, the judgment of the Court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014While we are not prepared to hold that the view taken by the trial judge and affirmed by the Court of Appeal as to the proper construction of the pleading is erroneous, we think it rather narrow. We also think that justice was much more likely to be done if the amendment asked for had been granted. Without reviewing the judgments below, and while not saying that the learned trial judge wrongly exercised his discretion, we are all of the opinion that the trial was unsatisfactory, and that justice between the parties can only be done by a new trial. A new trial is accordingly directed. The costs down to the time when Mr. Gregory asked for the amendment at the trial (Case, p. 111), will be borne (and are to be paid forthwith) by the defendant. The costs subsequent to that time are to be in the discretion of the judge who presides at the new trial, including the costs of this appeal.\nNew trial ordered.\nC. E.

The plaintiff claimed damages to be paid by the defendants jointly, $16,000, and in the alternative, $8,000 to be paid by each defendant. The defendants each delivered a separate statement of defence.\nThe action was tried before Taylor J. with a jury. The jury gave their verdict as follows: \u201cWe find for the plaintiff against the defendants and assess the damages as against Smith, $1,500, and against Campbell, $1,500\u201d; and the judgment was \u201cthat the plaintiff do recover from the defendant Campbell the sum of $1,500; and that the plaintiff do recover from the defendant Smith the sum of $1,500\u201d; and \u201cthat the defendants do pay to the plaintiff his costs of this action * * *.\u201d\nThe defendants each appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, and by the judgment of that court[2] the judgment below was set aside and a new trial ordered.

The security approved and allowed to be given by the plaintiff in respect of the appeal consisted of two separate bonds of the plaintiff and a surety company, namely: a bond in favour of the defendant Campbell for $2,526.06, and a bond in favour of the defendant Smith for $1,053.53. As stated by affidavit on defendants\u2019 behalf on the present motions, the said sum of $2,526.06 covered $500 as security for the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and $2,026.06, being the costs, as taxed, of appeal to the Court of Appeal awarded to the defendant Campbell; and the said sum of $1,053.53 covered $500 as security for the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and $553.53, being the costs, as taxed, of appeal to the Court of Appeal awarded to the defendant Smith.\nThe defendants moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nC.

(the original defendant, since deceased) made three applications to plaintiff for life insurance, on each of which a policy was issued. Plaintiff sued for a declaration that the policies were null and void, on the ground that B. knew, when he made the application in each case, that he was not in good health, but fraudulently represented that he was, for the purpose of inducing issuance of the policies. At the trial, the jury found that B., at the time of the applications, was in ill health, but was unaware of that fact when he signed the first two applications, but knew it when he signed the last one. On these findings Jenks J. (60 N.S. Rep. 116) dismissed the action as to the first two policies, but directed cancellation of the last one. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (60 N.S. Rep. 116) held that the jury\u2019s findings that B. did not know he was in ill health when he signed the first two policies were perverse, and it directed that the first two policies be also cancelled, upon payment back of all premiums paid. The defendant appealed.\nHeld, that, upon the evidence, the jury\u2019s findings that B. did not know he was in ill health when he signed the first two applications were perverse; that the Court en banc had jurisdiction to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury and give judgment for the plaintiff; and that its judgment should be affirmed.\nOn said question of jurisdiction, the Court discussed Order 38, Rule 10, and Order 57, Rule 5, of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and Order 40, Rule 10, and Order 58, Rule 4, of the English Rules, and referred to Miller v. Toulmin, 17 Q.B.D. 603, and R.M. of Victory v. Sask. Guar. & Fidelity Co. Ltd. [1928] S.C.R. 264.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc[1], allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, and dismissing the defendant\u2019s cross- appeal, from the judgment of Jenks J.[2], given on the findings of the jury at the trial, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action as to the first two policies of life insurance in question, but directing cancellation of the third one. The plaintiff\u2019s action was for a declaration that three contracts of life insurance were null and void, on grounds hereinafter mentioned.\nThe formal judgment of the Court en banc ordered \u201cthat the motion for a new trial asserted by the plaintiff herein be and the same is hereby allowed\u201d; that \u201cthe cross-motion asserted by the defendant herein be and the same is hereby dismissed\u201d; and that \u201cupon the plaintiff paying or tendering to the defendant the amount of all premiums paid to the plaintiff in respect of [the three policies in question in the action], less any balance of costs that may be taxed in favour of the plaintiff * * * the said [three policies in question] be and the same are hereby cancelled and rescinded and shall forthwith be delivered to the plaintiff for cancellation.\u201d\nThe following statement of the case and of the proceedings below is taken from the judgment of Lamont J., who delivered the reasons for the judgment of this Court.\n\u201cThe question to be decided in this appeal is: Was there evidence before the jury on which it could reasonably find that Hyman Brody believed he was in good health when he made certain applications for insurance on his own life with the respondent company?\n\u201cThe applications were made on the following dates, namely, December 9th, 1925; February 15th, 1926, and March 10th, 1926. In each application Brody made the following representation:\u2014\nI hereby declare that to the best of my knowledge, information and belief my health is good.\n\u201cPursuant to each of these applications a policy was issued to Brody. After issuing the last of these policies, the company received information which led it to believe that Brody had not been in good health when he applied for insurance, and, on December 17th, 1926, it brought this action and asked for a declaration that the three contracts of insurance entered into with Brody were null and void on the ground that when he made application in each case he knew that he was not in good health, but fraudulently represented that he was, for the purpose of inducing the company to issue to him the policies which in fact it did issue. The matter came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Jenks, sitting with a jury. The jury found that at the time Brody made the applications above referred to he was in fact in ill health, but that he was unaware of that fact when he signed the applications of December 9th, 1925, and February 15th, 1926. As to the application of March 10th, 1926, the jury found that on that date Brody was in ill health to his knowledge.\n\u201cOn the answers of the jury the trial judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action in so far as the first two contracts of insurance were concerned, but directed that the last contract be \u2018cancelled and rescinded\u2019. The plaintiff company appealed from that judgment to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc, and the defendant cross-appealed in respect of the last policy.\n\u201cHyman Brody having died, Hannah Brody, his wife and the beneficiary named in the three policies, was substituted as defendant.\n\u201cThe court en banc held that the answers of the jury to the effect that Brody did not know that he was ill when he signed the applications of December 9th, 1925, and February 15th, 1926, were perverse. It also found as a fact that as early as October, 1925, Brody knew that he was in ill health. It therefore directed that the policies founded on the first two applications be also cancelled upon the plaintiff\u2019s paying back or tendering the premiums paid. The cross-appeal was dismissed. From the judgment en banc the defendant now appeals to this Court.\u201d\nC. J. Burchell K.C. for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. and G. McL. Daley for the respondent.\nAfter hearing argument by counsel for the parties, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs. Written reasons were delivered by Lamont J., with whom the other members of the Court concurred.\nThe written judgment, after stating the case and the proceedings below, as above set out, discusses the evidence at length, and holds that the answers of the jury that Brody believed himself to be in good health at the times of his applications for policies on December 9, 1925, and February 15, 1926, must be held perverse.\nThe judgment then proceeds as follows:\n\u201cThe only other point to be considered is: Had the court en banc jurisdiction to substitute their own findings of fact for those of the jury and give judgment for the plaintiff?\n\u201cIn the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia there are two rules dealing with the power of the court to draw inferences of fact where the action has been tried with a jury. The first, Order 38, Rule 10, provides that upon a motion for judgment or upon an application for a new trial the court may draw all inferences of fact not inconsistent with the finding of the jury. The other, Order 57, Rule 5, under the heading of \u201cAppeals\u201d, contains this provision:\nThe court shall have power to draw inferences of fact, and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made, and to make such further or other order as the case requires.\n\u201cBoth these rules have their counterpart in the English Rules in Order 40, Rule 10 and Order 58, Rule 4, but the latter rule refers expressly to the Court of Appeal.\n\u201cThe scope of the English Rule is dealt with in Millar v. Toulmin[3],\n\u201cIn Nova Scotia there is but one court, and it has both original and appellate jurisdiction and hag, with certain exceptions not material here, the same powers as were, on the first day of October, 1884, exercisable in England by the Court of Appeal and the High Court of Justice. Order 58, Rule 4, was in force on that date. In my opinion, therefore, Order 38, Rule 10, cannot have the effect of limiting the power of the court in appeal given by Order 57, Rule 5.\n\u201cIn the recent case of Rural Municipality of Victory v. Saskatchewan Guarantee and Fidelity Company Ltd.[4], this Court, following the decision of the House of Lords in Calmenson v. Merchants\u2019 Warehousing Co. Ltd.[5], held that the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, under a similar rule, had jurisdiction to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury where the findings of the jury were perverse and the members of the court were of opinion (1) That they had all the facts before them, and (2) That if a new trial were granted no further evidence could be given, which would alter the result.\n\u201cIn the present case Brody is dead. Further evidence from him cannot, therefore, be had. It was contended on his behalf that the testimony of the doctors who examined him when he applied for the policies of insurance should be placed before the jury. I am unable to see how any evidence that these doctors might give could throw any light upon the question of Brody\u2019s knowledge of the state of his health at the time he signed the applications. They could only testify as to what they found, which could not assist in determining the question before the jury. Such evidence, in my opinion, would not alter the result.\n\u201cI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G. A. R.

It acquired, for $500, about 31\u00bd acres of land at Marshall Falls, on East River, Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia. In 1919 (c. 5) the Nova Scotia legislature passed the Nova Scotia Water Act which, among other things, declared that every watercourse and the sole and exclusive right to use, divert and appropriate any and all water in any watercourse was vested forever in the Crown in the right of the Province. There was provision for the Governor in Council authorizing persons to use any watercourse and any water therein on such terms and conditions as the Governor in Council might deem proper. The legislature also passed the Power Commission Act (1919, c. 6; subsequently, with amendments, consolidated as c. 130, R.S.N.S., 1923) by which defendant was incorporated. Under its powers given by that Act, the defendant proceeded to develop East River, Sheet Harbour, for power purposes; it contracted to supply electrical power to the Pictou County Power Board (incorporated by c. 165 of 1920); constructed storage dams above Marshall-Falls; and expropriated land, including plaintiff\u2019s said land. Plaintiff filed its claim for compensation, and (as authorized under the Power Commission Act, defendant not having instituted action within the time prescribed) sued in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for a declaration that it was entitled to $80,000 as compensation. At the trial a special jury found the compensation to be $32,000. On appeal by defendant, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (59 N.S. Rep. 524) set aside the finding and directed a new trial. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld, that the direction for a new trial should be affirmed; there was no evidence that the land\u2019s agricultural value had increased, or that it had any special suitability except in relation to the development of power at Marshall Falls; and the jury had not been sufficiently directed so as clearly to apprehend the effect of the Nova Scotia Water Act and the Power Commission Act, and of what had been done pursuant thereto, and of the resultant situation which prevailed, as affecting the plaintiff\u2019s rights and prospects, at the time its land was expropriated.\nIt was pointed out that unless the owner of the land constituting the damsite had a right or privilege to use or divert the watercourse or the water, the dam-site was of no utility or value for the manufacture of power, and that subs. 2 of s. 4 of the Nova Scotia Water Act, as enacted by c. 75 of 1920, whereby the Governor in Council is empowered to authorize any person to use any watercourse or any water therein for such purposes and on such terms and conditions as are deemed proper or advisable, is not expressed in a manner which points to the grant of a heritable or assignable right; that the use which may be authorized is not a use which goes with the land, and that it was upon the exercise of this power by the Governor in Council that the plaintiff\u2019s claim to a value for special adaptability must depend.\nThe Nova Scotia Water Act discussed and construed, in its bearing on the matters in question.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] setting aside the verdict of the jury at the trial and ordering a new trial. The defendant, in the exercise of its powers under the Power Commission Act (Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1919, c. 6; subsequently, with amendments, consolidated as c. 130, R.S.N.S. 1923) acquired by expropriation, in June, 1925, 31.48 acres of land belonging to the plaintiff (a company incorporated by c. 181 of the Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1914, with comprehensive powers for its purposes of developing water-power and producing and selling electric power) at Marshall Falls, on East River, Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia. The plaintiff filed a claim for compensation and sued in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (as authorized under the Power Commission Act, the defendant not having instituted action within the prescribed time) for a declaration that it was entitled to receive the sum of $80,000 as compensation. At the trial, before Carroll J. with a special jury, the jury found the compensation payable to the plaintiff to be $32,500. On appeal by the defendant, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[2] ordered that the verdict of the jury be set aside and that there be a new trial. From that judgment the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nThe material facts of the case, and the legislation, the construction and effect of which was involved in the consideration of the case, are sufficiently set out in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nF. R. Taylor K.C. and R. M. Fielding for the appellant.\nC. J. Burchell K.C. and G. McL. Daley for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The appellant company seeks, in this appeal, to have restored the finding of a special jury assessing the compensation for land taken by the respondent Commission on East River, Sheet Harbour, in Nova Scotia, the finding having been set aside and a new trial ordered by the Supreme Court of that province.\nIn 1913 Roderick McColl, the appellant\u2019s leading witness, who had been for many years provincial engineer of Nova Scotia, in charge of all the public works, resigned his office to go into hydro electric development. He had been interested, as he says, in the fact that Nova Scotia was paying so high for its power, and was making so little progress. He looked around for the best market, and it seemed to him that Halifax and Pictou Counties were the natural markets, and those that were suffering most. He was familiar with the East River, Sheet Harbour, in the County of Halifax. He obtained the provincial Act, c. 181 of 1914, incorporating the appellant company, the objects and powers of which are very comprehensive; in the words of the witness, \u201cBriefly speaking, the Act empowered the company to develop a water-power on Sheet Harbour and electric development on that river for supplying mainly Pictou County towns.\u201d Paragraphs (c) and (d) of the objects and powers are in these terms:\n(c) to set, erect, operate and maintain in and through the counties of Pictou, Colchester, Antigonish and Guysboro, and in that portion of the County of Halifax east of the Musquodoboit River, the usual poles with wires thereon for the purpose of conveying said electrical or galvanic currents, or for the purpose of hanging or stringing thereon telegraph or telephone wires for any of the company\u2019s purposes, from the point or points where the same is generated to the point or points of sale, which shall be and become when erected the property of the Company;\n(d) to enter into a contract with any electric light, power, tram or other company or municipality to supply the electric current and electricity they may require in their business, or for the purposes of lighting or power, and for the use of their poles and wires and apparatus for distribution and other purposes;\nBy s. 19, subs. 1, it is provided that\nIn order to secure, have, develop, maintain or increase the power to be derived from the waters of the East River, Sheet Harbour, or any river, stream or lake tributary to, flowing into or connected with the same, and all branches thereof, the Company shall have full right, power and authority to dam, pen back and hold said waters of said East River, Sheet Harbour, and of any such river, stream or lake and all branches thereof by dams or reservoirs, and to withdraw the waters from the channel of such East River, Sheet Harbour, and of any such river, stream or lake, and all branches thereof, and to convey the water so dammed, penned back, and held, by sluice way, canal, flume, conduit or other means, over, across, under or through any lands whatever, to any penstock, sluiceway, pipes or reservoirs, as may be most expedient or efficient for delivering the water for the purpose of operating the water wheels of the said Company; the use of the water of said river to be subject to any provisions or regulations that may be made by commissioners appointed under Chapter 95, Acts of 1895, for conveying lumber and timber on rivers, or any amendments thereto.\nThe other subsections of section 19 provide for the ascertainment and recovery of compensation for damages or injurious affection caused by the exercise of the powers so conferred. By section 20, the Company is empowered, when it considers it necessary to acquire lands upon which to construct its works, or for other purposes, and, when no agreement can be made for the purchase of the land, to present a petition to the Governor in Council praying for decision of the question as to whether the property or easement sought to be acquired is necessary for any of the company\u2019s purposes, and it is provided that the Governor in Council shall thereupon determine that question according to a procedure which is outlined, and, if he decide that the property or easement sought to be acquired is necessary for any of the purposes of the company, \u201cand by Order in Council declare that the same may be expropriated under the provisions of this section,\u201d the value of the property shall be ascertained in the manner thereby provided. There is special provision, by s. 23, for the company\u2019s acquisition of rights of way for its transmission lines through uncultivated or wilderness lands, and, by s. 24, it is provided that\nThe Company shall have the right:\n(\u0430) to enter upon and occupy any Crown Lands for a right of way for its tranmission line, or for the construction of dams, or building canals or flumes or power plant or other works of the Company;\n(b) to cause any Crown Lands to be overflowed and to keep the same overflowed.\nThe compensation to be paid the Crown for any act or thing done under the provisions of this section shall be settled by an arbitrator * * *.\nThere were three waterfalls on East River where power could be developed; first, going up stream, at Ruth Falls, near the mouth of the stream; secondly, at Malay Falls, a short distance above, and thirdly, at Marshall Falls, about half a mile above Malay. The appellant company acquired some land for power sites at each of these situations, but nothing was done in the way of construction or development.\nIn 1919 the Legislature of Nova Scotia enacted the Nova Scotia Water Act, c. 5, of 1919. Its provisions have an important bearing upon the case. By section 2, par. (b), \u201cwatercourse\u201d is defined to include\nevery watercourse and the bed thereof and every source of water supply, whether the same usually contains water or not, and every stream, river, lake, pond, creek, spring, ravine, and gulch; but shall not include small rivulets or brooks unsuitable for milling, mechanical or power purposes.\nThe principal enactment is section 3, which provides that\nNotwithstanding any law of Nova Scotia, whether statutory or otherwise, or any grant, deed or transfer heretofore made, whether by the Crown or otherwise, or any possession, occupation, use, or obstruction of any watercourse, or any use of any water by any person for any time whatever, every watercourse and the sole and exclusive right to use, divert and appropriate any and all water at any time in any watercourse, is declared to be vested forever in the Crown in the right of the province of Nova Scotia.\nBy section 4, subsections 1 and 2 (the latter as enacted in substitution by c. 75 of 1920), it is enacted that\n(1) Where any person within two years from the passing of this Act establishes to the satisfaction of the Minister that any watercourse or any water therein was at the time of the passing of this Act being lawfully used by him or that he was entitled to use the same, such person shall be entitled to be authorized by the Governor in Council to use such watercourse and water therein, subject to such terms and conditions as the Governor in Council deems just.\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the next preceding subsection, the Governor in Council may from time to time authorize any person to use any watercourse and any water therein for such purposes and on such terms and conditions as are deemed proper or advisable, including, in the discretion of the Governor in Council, the payment of compensation to any person whose rights may be injuriously affected, the amount of such compensation to be fixed and determined by the Governor in Council or fixed and determined by a Judge of the Supreme Court whom the Governor in Council may appoint, and, except as aforesaid, no action, process or proceeding whatsoever shall be commenced or issued in any court or before any tribunal by or against any person authorized by the Governor in Council to use such watercourse or any water therein conditionally or otherwise.\nThis Act, as consolidated and revised, now appears as c. 26 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923.\nThe Nova Scotia Water Act was enacted on 17th May, 1919, and at the same time the legislature enacted c. 6 of 1919, \u201cAn Act respecting the Development of Electrical Energy from Water-Power and other Sources\u201d cited as the Power Commission Act, which, with its amendments, was subsequently consolidated as c. 130 of the Revised Statutes of 1923. By this Act the respondent Commission, consisting of three persons, appointed by the Governor in Council, \u201ctwo of whom may be members, and one of whom shall be a member, of the Executive Council,\u201d was incorporated and constituted as an agency of the government, under the name of The Nova Scotia Power Commission, with authority to\ngenerate, accumulate, transmit, distribute, supply and utilize electric energy and power in any part of the province of Nova Scotia, and do everything incidental thereto, or deemed by the Commission necessary or expedient therefor. The Commission is given comprehensive powers to acquire, expropriate and use property of various descriptions, including land, watercourses, water privileges, works, machinery and plant developed, operated, used or adapted for its purposes, and to enter upon, take and use, without the consent of the owner, any land upon which any water, watercourse or privilege is situate, or any watercourse which, in the opinion of the Commission, is capable of improvement or development for the purpose of providing water-power, and to construct such dams, sluices, canals, race-ways and other works, and to do all such acts, as may be deemed proper or expedient for such purposes, and to flood and overflow any land for the purpose of providing storage of water, or for any other purpose in connection with such works, and to acquire by purchase or otherwise, or, without the consent of the owner, to enter upon, take possession of and use any land or watercourse, and any dams, buildings or structures or improvements thereon, and any easements, rights or other privileges which, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary, requisite or useful for the storage of water, back flowage, erection of any building or other structure, or for the doing of any work thereon, or for the full, partial or better development, extension, utilization, improvement or exercise of any water-right, water-privilege, water-power or other improvement, or work undertaken or proposed to be undertaken by the Commission, or by any municipality, corporation or individual, on such terms and conditions as the Commission may deem expedient; and to expropriate, or acquire by purchase or otherwise, real and personal property of every description deemed useful for the purpose of generating, accumulating, transmitting, distributing, supplying and utilizing electrical power or energy in a municipality, the council of which has entered into an agreement with the Commission for the supply of electrical power or energy. It is provided by s. 15, subs. 9, of the Act that\nNotwithstanding any of the provisions of the Nova Scotia Water Act, or of any authorization by the Governor in Council to any person to use any watercourse or the water therein, or to exercise any rights in respect thereof, the Governor in Council may and is hereby empowered to authorize the Commission to use exclusively or to such extent as the Governor in Council may specify, any watercourse and any water therein for the purposes of the Commission; and no damages or compensation shall be given or claimed in respect thereto except such amount, if any, as may be fixed and determined by the Governor in Council. It is also provided by section 15, paragraph D, that\nIn any action for compensation, whether commenced by the Commission or by any person interested, the Court shall not allow compensation for the taking or injuriously affecting by the Commission of any watercourse, but the compensation for same, if any, shall be fixed and determined by the Governor in Council.\nIt is enacted by s. 18 of the original Act, s. 19 as revised, that\nExpropriation powers conferred by this Chapter shall extend to land, works, rights, powers, privileges, and property, notwithstanding that the same are or may be deemed to be devoted to a public use, or that the owner thereof possesses the power of taking land compulsorily.\nThere is a provision that, if the Commission does not commence an action for compensation (sic) within three months after particulars of a claim are filed with it, any person so filing particulars may commence an action in the Supreme Court of the Province claiming compensation, in which action, however, no relief shall be claimed, except a declaration as to the amount of compensation payable, and as to the parties entitled thereto.\nIn this case the appellant claimed for compensation $80,000, but the Commission did not itself institute any action, and the appellant, as authorized by the statute, commenced its action in the Supreme Court of the province, and obtained a special jury for the trial of the cause.\nUpon obtaining the legislation of 1919, the Government proceeded to organize the Commission, and announced its intention to develop the East River for power purposes. The Act to Incorporate the Pictou County Power Board, c. 165 of 1920, was enacted as a public Act of Nova Scotia on 22nd May, 1920. It recites that the incorporated towns of Pictou, Trenton, New Glasgow, Stellarton and Westville, and the Municipality of the County of Pictou, respectively, had made, or were about to make, application to the Nova Scotia Power Commission for a supply of electrical energy under the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Acts of 1919, the Power Commission Act, and that it was considered advisable, for the purpose of reducing overhead expenses and delays, and to facilitate the purchase, distribution and sale of electrical energy, that a Board should be appointed representing these municipalities. It provides that a Board of not more than eight, nor less than five, persons shall be appointed; that the Board shall be a body corporate; that, for the purposes of the purchase, distribution and sale of electrical energy and of the Power Commission Act, the Board shall be deemed to be a municipality, and that the provisions of the last mentioned Act relating to a municipality shall mutatis mutandis apply in the case of the Board. The Board is empowered to appoint a Chief Engineer, Accountant, Secretary and such other officers, servants and workmen as may be deemed requisite; to regulate their salaries and expenses, which shall be chargeable to and payable from the revenues coming to the Board from the sale of electrical power and energy, and that the Board shall be subject to the provisions of the Public Utilities Act, c. 1 of 1913, and the amendments thereto.\nUpon the survey and exploration of the river, the Power Commission found that it was capable of a considerable development of power, which could be made available for the supply of the Pictou Municipalities by the construction and use of storage dams. Mr. Johnston, the Chief Engineer of the Power Commission, said in his evidence:\nQ. You constructed storage dams above Marshall Falls prior to the expropriation of the lands in question?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You might explain why you put up storage dams.\u2014A. Before the storage dams were put in, the flow of the river in summer time, in dry months, got down until there was practically nothing. It was equivalent to 25 cubic feet of water per second, that is 250 gallons per second flowing in the river at that time.\nQ. How much did you need?\u2014A. The maximum flow of the river reached 7,500 feet, that is 150 times that quantity, which is of course no use for power purposes; you must have a steady supply of water all the year, so you have to level up by the creation of these storage bases, so as to draw from the storage bases during the drought period in summer time to create the necessary quantity of water to produce power. It was calculated we would be able to have a uniform flow of 305 feet.\nQ. At Marshall Falls in the summer time it was practically dry?\u2014A. Normally, it would be practically dry. In the words of the inhabitants, one was able to walk across the river dry shod in summer time.\nQ. It was therefore necessary to have a system of these storage dams?\u2014A. Yes. Some of these storage dams were twenty miles away from the head of Marshall Falls.\nQ. Prior to the time of this expropriation of lands in question how much had the storage dams cost?\u2014A. Approximately, $250,000. That includes the lands flooded and lands round the dams themselves.\nQ. How much did you pay for those lands?\u2014A. $18,000 is shown in 1925.\nQ. Subsequently, since that date?\u2014A. Last summer two additional dams were put in, Union and Marshall Falls dams, which are to be used for storage dams initially. These two cost approximately $200,000.\nQ. Your total expense up to date is $550,000 for storage dams. You keep men employed to look after the storage dams?\u2014A. We keep one man constantly looking after the dams and one man part of the year. I should have said, if there had been only Malay Falls on the river, it would be necessary for Malay Falls alone the same way it would have been necessary for the development of Marshall Falls.\nQ. It is sufficient for all your present needs?\u2014A. Yes.\nIt is, as I understood the testimony, admitted that the appellant\u2019s project for development and manufacture of power at Marshall Falls depended upon the use of the water held by the Commission\u2019s storage dams. Mr. McColl says:\nQ. You were figuring on making use of the storage base. You would, necessarily, have to\u2014the storage base is further up the river?\u2014A. Yes. They put us to a disadvantage by taking our lower lands and they give us that additional advantage by supplying storage. The action had two effects; one was to improve our storage and the other was to take away the lower development, which also increased a little the cost of this development; so we were about even.\nQ. You expect to get that for nothing?\u2014A. Tit for tat; if they injure us in one way, I suppose they make it up in another. I never got much for nothing from them.\nQ. You have to have that storage?\u2014A. Yes.\nOn 7th September, 1922, the Pictou County Board entered into a contract with the Commission for the purchase of electrical energy for a period of 30 years for the use of the Municipality of the County of Pictou and the incorporated towns of Pictou, Trenton, New Glasgow, Stellarton and Westville, and the inhabitants thereof, for lighting, heating and power purposes. It is recited by the contract that the development at Malay Falls on East River, Sheet Harbour, is the most economical and best suited for the present needs of the county; that it is estimated that it will deliver eight million kilowatt hours annually in Pictou County, which may be supplemented by a second development, and that Malay Falls will utilize eight possible storage basins out of a total of 13 (large and small) available. The Commission contracts to proceed promptly with this initial development, and to complete the same within 18 months from the date of the approval of the contract by the Governor in Council, and to reserve, deliver and supply to the Board electrical power and energy specified in the contract as follows:\n1. Electrical power and energy up to a total of five million six hundred thousand (5,600,000) kilowatt hours per year, at a rate not exceeding twenty-four hundred (2,400) kilowatts and not exceeding three thousand (3,000) kilowatts amperes and at the option of the Board on eighteen months previous notice being given, eight million (8,000,000) kilowatts hours per year at a rate not exceeding thirty-six hundred (3,600) kilowatts and not exceeding forty-five hundred (4,500) kilowatt amperes, and 2. Such further quantities of electrical power and energy as the Commission may from time to time consider may be available for delivery and supply to the Board, and rateably to the then existing or future requirements of other users.\nAnd the Board contracts to purchase from the Commission all the electrical power and energy which the Commission contracts to deliver and supply, and to pay the Commission the cost, which is to be adjusted, appropriated and fixed annually by the Commission in the manner stipulated by the contract.\nThe appellant company or its promoters had been endeavouring from the beginning, unsuccessfully, to obtain capital. Its act of incorporation was conditioned to cease and determine if actual work were not \u201ccommenced and continued within two years from the date of its passing.\u201d Several statutory enlargements of this period had been obtained, the latest by c. 164 of 1919, whereby it was provided in effect that the Act was still in force, but should cease and determine if actual work were not commenced and continued within seven years from the date of its passing. That period would expire on 10th June, 1921. The situation with regard to capital and work done by the company at the expiry of that date is shown by Mr. McColl, who says,\nQ. Apart from surveys, the only actual construction work was done in June, 1921?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That consisted in sending one man down to cut some brush down?\u2014A. Clear the land; cut some trees for camp and get ready.\nQ. The total bill you paid him was $48, something like that?\u2014A. I think altogether it cost a couple of hundred dollars.\nQ. He started work; do you remember when?\u2014A. He started about the 8th June.\nQ. The seven years would expire about the 10th June, 1921?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. This was about two days before the time expired you sent the man down?\u2014A. Yes, to technically comply with anything that might be raised. We were advised it did not affect our charter. To technically comply with it, we did that. We knew railways sometimes do that.\nQ. You also stated in your evidence before (you were asked to bring all the books of the company) that this company never had any real money in its treasury?\u2014A. No.\nQ. That is right?\u2014A. No; I would say no real money; they may have had a little.\nUpon this statement of the facts a serious question is suggested as to compliance with the statutory condition for commencement and continuance of actual work; but that question was not very fully discussed before us, and was not considered in the courts below; moreover, the facts were not fully investigated. The defendant will therefore be at liberty to raise this objection upon the new trial, and the evidence is quoted, and becomes material now, only as affecting the value of the interest which the appellant claims to possess, assuming the action to be maintainable.\nThe land which had been acquired by the Company at Marshall Falls in 1914 consisted of 31\u00b748 acres, described as\nAll that part or portion of a certain lot of land containing one hundred acres and granted on the 11th day of August, 1899, and recorded in grant Book No. 7, page 167, being Grant No. 19377 and being all that portion of the said lot of land lying west of the centre line or thread of East River, Sheet Harbour. Reserving to the party of the first part the right to enter and cut hardwood for fuel and remove the same.\nOn 10th June, 1925, the Commission, pursuant to its powers of expropriation, filed its plan and description of land at East River, which included the lands so described. The land acquired by the Company at Malay Falls had already been expropriated by the Commission by a plan filed on 6th December, 1922, and proceedings were pending for ascertainment and recovery of compensation for that parcel. The appeal book in that case, which is in evidence here, shews that the case was tried by Carroll J., without a jury; that the plaintiff\u2019s claim amounted to $96,500 for compensation or damages, and that the learned judge awarded $5,500 for compensation and costs. We were informed at the hearing that that litigation was terminated, and it is necessary to mention it only for the purpose of excluding its subject matter as a factor in ascertaining the compensation or damages now sought to be recovered with relation to the upper site.\nBy the present action, which was commenced 26th January, 1927, the Company seeks a declaration of the value of the land. The jury rendered its finding of $32,500 on 27th May, 1927, and the Commission gave notice of motion for an order that the verdict given, and the judgment or order directed on the trial, should be set aside, and that the Supreme Court en banc should declare the amount of compensation payable to the plaintiff, or alternatively, that a new trial should be had upon grounds which are stated, including weight of evidence, excess of compensation, misdirection and non-direction in certain particulars. The Court, consisting of five judges, unanimously allowed the motion, set aside the finding, and granted a new trial with costs; the judgment proceeding mainly upon errors found in the charge\nNow it seems clear enough upon the facts which have been narrated that the jury, in considering its finding, should have realized that, before the lands in question here were taken or expropriated, the appreciable probability of a market for any power which could be developed or made available at Marshall Falls, otherwise than by the Government, had been materially reduced, if not entirely dissipated, by the legislation which was enacted during or subsequently to the Session of 1919, and the contract which had gone into effect with the Pictou County Board. The Government had adopted the policy of supplying power to the municipalities at cost, and had provided for the extension of this privilege to industrial enterprises. The project recited by the contract contemplated a junction, opposite the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company\u2019s plant, of the respondent\u2019s transmission line from Stellarton to the town of Pictou, \u201cso that a circuit may be run to that plant if and when desired.\u201d Mr: McColl stated at the trial, in his answer to the question as to what the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company was then paying for its power, that \u201cthey are getting power for one cent from the Nova Scotia Power but they cannot get it forever. Under their contract, whenever the Nova Scotia Power Commission wants to give to anyone else they can take it from them. They are getting it below what other people are paying.\u201d\nIt was a question for the jury, under proper direction, whether there was any special value in the market which, in the circumstances as they existed when the Commission took or expropriated the lands, could have been substantiated or figured for the Company. The cost of the 31.48 acres, when they were acquired for the Company in 1914, was $500, and there is no evidence that their agricultural value is any greater, or that the land has any special suitability, except in relation to the development of power at Marshall Falls, where it is naturally adapted to the foundation of one end of a dam, which would serve for storage, and to enable the water to be used for the production of power.\nThen, of course, in considering the special value, if any, which the riparian land possessed as a dam-site for waterpower, the jury should know the nature and extent of the existing riparian rights, and it is, in this connection, impossible to overlook the modifications which were introduced in 1919 and 1920 by the Nova Scotia Water Act. By section 3 \u201cevery watercourse and the sole and exclusive right to use, divert and appropriate any and all water at any time in any watercourse is declared to be vested forever in the Crown in the right of the province of Nova Scotia.\u201d It is true that, under subs. 1 of par. 4, any person making the requisite proof might have been authorized by the Governor in Council, subject to terms and conditions, but I think the jury should have been told that the Company was not entitled under that subsection, because it did not, within two years from the passing of that Act, make any proof to the satisfaction of the Minister. The Act was passed on 17th May, 1919, and, on the same day in 1921, the Minister received a letter written by Mr. McColl, as manager of the appellant company, stating that the company, since the acquisition of its charter, had purchased property on East River, and \u201cmade surveys and other work in connection with this development, and in accordance with their charter,\u201d and he continued:\nThe company therefore begs to submit their application to you in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Acts of 1919. This application is however made without prejudice to any right which the company have under their Charter and its amendments or under any charter.\nThere is, however, nothing further upon the subject, and therefore nothing to entitle the Company to the use of the water under subs. 1 of s. 4. It was certainly contemplated by that clause that a mere notice without prejudice would not suffice, and that the Governor in Council should have a reasonable opportunity, within two years, to ascertain the essential facts and to consider the requirements of the case, and the terms and conditions, if any, which ought to be imposed. Mellish J., who gave the judgment of the Court on the appeal, interjected a doubt upon this point; but, looking at the words of the statute and the facts, I do not see room for any doubt.\nNevertheless there is a power in the Governor in Council, conferred by subs. 2 of s. 4, as enacted by c. 75 of 1920, whereby he may, from time to time, subject to the provisions of s. 15, subs. 9, of the Power Commission Act, authorize any person to use any watercourse, and any water therein, for such purposes, and on such terms and conditions, including compensation, as are deemed proper or advisable in the discretion of the Governor in Council.\nUnless the owner of the land constituting the dam-site have a right or privilege to use or divert the watercourse or the water, the dam-site is of no utility or value to him for the manufacture of power, but the Governor in Council may authorize the use, as provided by subs. 2 of s. 4 of the Nova Scotia Water Act, if it be conceivable in the circumstances that he would do so, and it is, I think, upon the exercise of the power to authorize that the plaintiff\u2019s claim to a value for special adaptability must depend. It will be perceived that the clause is not expressed in a manner which points to the grant of a heritable or assignable right, and that the use which may be authorized is not a use which goes with the land. \u201cThe Governor in Council may from time to time authorize any person.\u201d Therefore the question seems to be if, and to what extent, the existence of this power in the Governor in Council adds an appreciable value to the land\u2014and that, as I see it, must be considered as the strict and sole foundation of the claim to recover for special adaptability. See Cedar Rapids Manufacturing & Power Co. v. Lacoste[3]; Corrie v. McDermott[4]; Pastoral Finance Association Ltd. v. The Minister[5]. Lord Moulton makes a very apt remark when he says on the last mentioned page:\nProbably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that they (the owners) were entitled to that which a prudent man, in their position, would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nThe legislative declaration, embodied in section 3 of the Nova Scotia Water Act, that the sole and exclusive right to use, divert and appropriate any and all water at any time in any watercourse is vested forever in the Crown in the right of the province, may be regarded as strong legislation; but the legislature had authority to give effect to it. I am not unmindful of the observation of Lord Blackburn in Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[6], that \u201cthe burthen lies on those who seek to establish that the legislature intended to take away the private rights of individuals, to show that by express words or by necessary implication, such an intention appears;\u201d but I see no way of escape from the conclusion that this condition is satisfied by the words of the statute, and at the hearing no suggestion was made to the contrary. While no person is authorized to use the watercourse or the water therein, the exclusive use of the Crown remains unimpaired, and there is, in any case, nothing in the nature of a right of use which may be sold, but the right of use might nevertheless be considered to have a value to the owner of the land if he could obtain that right, and it therefore becomes a question whether a person willing to compete for the land would consider the possibility of obtaining such a right of use as a circumstance which in fact would enhance the price that he would give for the land.\nThen, furthermore, it must be obvious that, since the river, according to its natural flow, is inadequate for the supply of the water required for a continuous generation of power, and that resort must be had to storage; and, since it is admitted that it would be necessary, for the profitable use of any dam which might be constructed upon the land in question, that use must be made from time to time of the water stored, the jury should know whether or not the company had the right to avail itself of this source of supply as impounded by the Commission; and, if so, whether or not the exercise of the right was subject to terms or conditions, including compensation, and, unfortunately, there is in the charge no reference whatever to this subject.\nThe learned trial judge was careful to explain to the jury that the measure of compensation was the value to the company of the property taken, not the value to the Commission. He told the jury that:\nSomething has been said regarding water powers and water rights on this river and rights the Company have under their charter. You have nothing at all to do with awarding the Company damages for any water rights they have or may have had on this river. They are asking compensation for land, not water, and, if they did, they could not get it. There is another method of receiving compensation for water taken from them. The legislature saw fit to put in the Crown all title to water and water that runs through water courses. Furthermore, regarding this matter of water power at Marshall Falls, I want to say that, purely as water, you ought to award no damages. You are to award damages only and solely for the value of land taken over from the Company by the Power Commission of Nova Scotia.\nHe told the jury also that the land was confined to the 31\u00b748 acres at Marshall Falls, excluding the lands taken at Malay Falls, and at Ruth Falls. He explained that the plaintiff was not claiming any damage or injury to its corporate rights; that it was claiming merely compensation for the land. In these circumstances, seeing that the value found by the jury was 65 times that of the purchase price, one is apt to look for the reason in the value of the access to the stream which the land affords, and to consider the possibility of some failure on the part of the jury to apprehend the effect of the legislation to which the learned judge referred in the following passages:\nIt has been suggested to you that the action of the Nova Scotia Legislature regarding water rights of the province may have something to do with decreasing the value of the land to private companies or private owners on account of not having the absolute right of using the water. That is entirely a question for you. The Government of Nova Scotia representing the Crown owns every gallon of water that flows in the rivers of Nova Scotia. They have sole control over them at the present time. They did not at the time the company was incorporated but they have it to-day. Every lumberman who goes out to a river and uses that river for the purpose of rolling his logs down, must have some sort of a permit for rolling these logs down. Do you think the Government would refuse to give a permit to a person under these conditions. I think the matter was fairly well presented to you. When the Government takes these powers and gives the people the right to apply for the use of these waters, it is to be presumed the Government, or the person the Government appoints to hear application for permits and that sort of thing, will act in a reasonable manner. Under the provisions of the Water Course Act, where any person, within two years of the passing of the Act, establishes to the satisfaction of the Minister that any watercourse or water therein was at the time of the passing of the Act being lawfully used by him, such person shall be authorized to use such watercourse and water therein subject to terms and conditions of the Act of 1919. In my opinion, when this Act was passed the plaintiff had the use of the waters and lands at Marshall Falls. By the Act of 1919 the plaintiff company now and all other persons who want to use the waters of Nova Scotia must apply to the Government of Nova Scotia for a permit to use the water. The Government might place onerous terms on applicants that would make it impossible for applicants to comply with them. You know as much about governments as I do and it is for you to say if the Government would act in an unreasonable manner and withhold from this company or any other person the use of water in the streams of Nova Scotia without strong, legitimate and proper cause. I think it has been proven that this company never got that right. It is an element in this case and I think you should take it into consideration. Perhaps it is an element for you to take into consideration in awarding damages. You use your judgment as to whether or not the fact that the Government of Nova Scotia has absolute control over the waters at Marshall Falls shall determine or lessen the value of the property. In all the circumstances of the case, I am assuming the Government of Nova Scotia would act in a reasonable, proper manner in dealing with any application of this kind if made. It is absolute speculation what terms they might impose on the applicant. If they say: Yes, you pay me fifty or a hundred thousand dollars for that water, I would have to have a mighty paying proposition. Do you think a Government would do that? It strikes me the Government would act reasonably in the matter.\nI have read this part of the charge many times, and I am afraid that it may have produced some confusion in the minds of the jury. It admits of different readings, and is difficult to interpret, but it is, I have no doubt, not inapt to create the impression that the jury may, in ascertaining the compensation, find the value of the property as a power-site to the company undiminished, notwithstanding the provisions of the Nova Scotia Water Act.\nThe learned judge went on to say:\nRegarding all this matter about Pictou and Springhill possibilities, I don\u2019t know exactly where it gets into this case except of course in regard to Marshall Falls having special adaptability for developing power. It would not make any difference how great the adaptability might be unless you had a market. I am not asking you to disregard one item of evidence that was given. Make use of it as best you may. I don\u2019t know that you should lay a great deal of stress on what the plaintiffs could make out of this. You heard a gentleman here, a very estimable man as far as I know; he was a good witness; he said if anyone came to him with the proposition that at the cost of $100,000 to develop the falls he could make an income of fifty thousand a year, he would be satisfied it was a good business proposition\u2014any of you would come to the same conclusion. The trouble here is we don\u2019t know what would have occurred if the plaintiff company undertook to develop it. The land was taken in 1925 and you have to direct your attention to the conditions in 1925. They are entitled to absolutely what those lands were worth in 1925. You may have to give some consideration to Pictou County; you may have to give consideration to a new competitor in the field furnishing power at cost\u2014that is if you take it into consideration at all. If you are satisfied this site had a special adaptability for generating power\u2014I don\u2019t think there is an evidence of adaptability for anything else in 1925, it is an element you must consider. You must take all surrounding circumstances into consideration in arriving at a conclusion\u2014first, as to adaptability; secondly, how much that adaptability enhances the value of the property.\nAt the conclusion of the charge, counsel for the Commission submitted several suggestions. He asked that:\n1. the jury be instructed concerning the value on the basis of the value to the plaintiff. The jury should be instructed that the plain tiff at the time of this expropriation did not have the right to use the water in the river or the storage basins of the Commission at that time. 2. the jury be directed that they cannot take into account in assessing the value of property the possibility of the plaintiff obtaining this authorization from the Governor in Council.\n3. the jury be directed that the proper compensation would be what a prudent man in the position of the owner would be willing to pay for the property.\n4. the jury be instructed that the plaintiffs only owned one side of the river.\n5. with reference to special adaptability that the jury be instructed that this is merely one kind of special value which is likely in the market to attract the class of purchasers who would come into competition.\nCounsel for the company replied that the Court had covered very fully and accurately all the facts of the case. The Court refused to entertain any of the respondent\u2019s suggestions, except the fourth, and as to that, the jury was recalled, and the learned judge addressed them as follows:\nIt was drawn to my attention that perhaps I did not bring to the attention of the jury that fact that in 1925, at the time this land was expropriated, the plaintiffs owned property only on one side of East River. This was proven in the case. I am not suggesting you make any conclusions from this except what your intelligence will suggest to yourselves. I want to point out that, if they did not own the land, they had a right to acquire it by expropriation or otherwise for crown lot. They had expropriation powers as wide, or almost as wide, as had the defendant Commission, and they could have acquired them if they so desired.\nThis statement, however, fails to recognize the control by the Governor in Council, and the dominant rights of the Power Commission, provided for by the legislation to which I have referred, and seems, if I do not misapprehend its meaning, to invite the jury to consider that the powers of expropriation possessed by the company might apply to lands within the scope of the respondent\u2019s undertaking, or that these powers might be brought into competition with those possessed and subject to be exercised by the Commission under the special legislation of 1919, a result which I am sure the legislature could not have intended.\nA considerable part of the learned judge\u2019s charge was devoted to evidence which the company introduced with regard to the cost incurred by the Commission for land and power development at St. Margaret\u2019s Bay, about 18 miles beyond the city of Halifax, to which the power is transmitted for the service of that city, which is situated 70 miles down the coast from Sheet Harbour. The jury was told that St. Margaret\u2019s Bay should be considered as perhaps in the vicinity of East River, Sheet Harbour, and having the same source, and that the amount paid by the Commission for the land and works in course of development and construction at St. Margaret\u2019s Bay was material for consideration in relation to the value of the land in question at Marshall Falls. The Supreme Court en banc was of the opinion that this portion of the charge was calculated to mislead the jury, and I am disposed to agree, but I would not have held that a new trial was justified for that upon this motion, because that direction was not made a ground of exception at the conclusion of the charge, even although, when the jury was recalled, the foreman specially asked to be told the amount paid for the property and work done at St. Margaret\u2019s Bay.\nIn my opinion, the Government, at the time of the expropriation, had control of the watercourse, and the use of the water, whether as diverted or in its natural flow, and this was a dispensation of the law which should have been made clear to the jury.\nIn the result the appeal fails, and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Bernard W.

This was in accordance with the City\u2019s policy, to be satisfied, before laying a main on any street, that there should be a sufficient revenue from the persons taking water therefrom, to defray interest on the cost of the extension, and to require from any person requesting an extension where the number of consumers was insufficient to produce at the usual rates such revenue, an agreement to pay a rate equal to such revenue, such rate to be proportionately reduced as other consumers became connected with the new main. From the year 1920 the City supplied meters for all water services, and all charges were meter rates. In 1922, when the said main was serving four houses, the plaintiff built a house on the street and applied for water supply. The City required an agreement from plaintiff to pay a special rate of $53.89, being one-fifth of the said sum of $269.45. Its council passed a resolution, and, later, a by-law, requiring that rate from each house on the street, to be proportionately reduced as additional houses were built. Plaintiff refused to make the agreement, and claimed the right to a water supply at the rate in general application throughout the city.\nHeld, that the special rate imposed was valid, and plaintiff was not entitled to water supply without entering into an agreement to pay it. The Halifax City Charter, 1914, especially ss. 671, 525 (1), 676 (1), 499 (1), 492, and c. 54 of 1922 (N.S.), s. 9, considered.\nAtt. Gen. of Canada v. City of Toronto, 23 Can. S.C.R. 514, and City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co., 38 Can. S.C.R. 239, discussed and explained. The references to \u201cuniform\u201d rates in the Toronto case had regard to the essential of uniformity, not in the sense of precise arithmetical equality, but as excluding arbitrary or unjust discrimination; and were not meant to extend the requirements of the common law, by which a by-law must be intra vires, certain, consistent with the statutes and the general law, and reasonable. It cannot be said, as a principle of law, that a municipal ordinance, which complies with these essentials, must operate uniformly in every part of the municipal area notwithstanding that the diversity of circumstances requires different considerations for special localities.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (59 N.S. Rep. 377) reversed.\nLamont J. held, differing in this respect from the majority of the Court, that the plaintiff should be required to pay, not a flat house rate, but only her proportionate share, as determined by the meters in the houses on the extension, of the said sum of $269.45.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, by leave granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, from the judgment of that Court[1] whereby, upon a case stated for the opinion of the Court, under Order XXXIII of the Rules of Court, and referred, by consent, direct to the Court en banc for decision, it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to the supply of water to her dwelling house, no. 53 Oakland Road, in the City of Halifax, without entering into an agreement to pay a rate of $53.89 per year, and that the rate imposed by resolution of Council of July 19, 1922, and the by-law of September 14, 1922, was invalid; and that the plaintiff was entitled to the supply of water subject to the ordinary water rates. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs, Lamont J. dissenting in part.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. E. Read K.C. and R. M. Fielding for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe j.\u2014The defendant, the City of Halifax, appeals from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, pronounced in a stated case, wherein two questions concerning water rates were submitted for the opinion of the court, and adjudicated in favour of the respondent.\nIn 1922 the plaintiff built a dwelling-house at no. 53 Oakland Road in the City of Halifax; the building was commenced in June and completed by 1st September; the plaintiff applied to the City for water supply, which the City was willing to furnish, stipulating, however, that the plaintiff should pay an annual rate of $53.89, for which a bond or agreement was required. The plaintiff would not agree. It is said in the stated case that\nupon the completion of the house the defendant refused to turn the water on, but undertakings were arranged between the parties on September 7, and the water was turned on in accordance therewith. All claims for damages were abandoned by the plaintiff, and the action was limited to a claim for a declaration.\nThe questions submitted are these:\n1. Whether the plaintiff was entitled to the supply of water to the dwelling-house number 53 Oakland Road without entering into an agreement to pay a rate of $53.89 per year.\n2. Whether the rate imposed by the resolution of Council of 19th July, 1922, and the By-law of September 14th, 1922, was valid.\nThe facts which led to the dispute are set forth in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the case, as follows:\n6. The water system of the Defendant is not in any way connected with or dependent upon the rates and taxes of the City, but is a separate system under the control of the Council of the City, acting by the Committee on Works, and in particular the streets in which main water pipes shall be laid are entirely in the discretion of the said Committee and Council as aforesaid. For many years it has been the policy of the Defendant to be satisfied before laying a main on any Street that there will be a sufficient revenue from the persons taking a supply of water there-71538\u20143\u00bd from to defray the interest on the cost of such extension, and to require of any person requesting an extension on a street upon which the number of consumers was insufficient to produce at the usual rates such revenue, a bond or agreement to pay a rate equal to such revenue, such rate to be proportionately reduced as other consumers become connected with the new main.\n7. Previous to May, 1919, no water main had been laid on Oakland Road. On that date Mr. T. J. Walsh applied for a main to be laid to houses which he proposed building on that street. The Engineer reported that the cost of laying the main would be $3,325 and the interest $305.16, and recommended that the main should be laid on, Mr. Walsh entering into an agreement to pay that amount yearly as a special rate. This was approved by the Board of Control. Mr. Walsh executed a bond for the said agreement, and the main was laid, but the Plaintiff does not admit that the rate therein was a special rate. Subsequently it was found that the actual cost of the extension was less than had been estimated and the yearly interest charge was $269.45, which rate was paid by Mr. Walsh in respect to the houses constructed by him.\nIn July, 1922, at the date of Plaintiff\u2019s application there were on Oakland Road four houses in addition to the one proposed to be built by Plaintiff and the Engineer on 19th July recommended the fixing of a special rate of $53.89 for each house. This report was adopted by Council. 19th July, 1922.\nThe learned Chief Justice, who gave the judgment of the Court, prefaced his judgment with these words:\nThe water system of the city is under the control of the City Council acting by a committee known as the Committee on Works and it is admitted that the Council is not obliged to lay down water pipes on any street of the city. Whether or not water pipes should be so laid down on any particular street was entirely in the discretion of the Council and for many years it had been the policy of the city not to extend its water system to a new street unless satisfied that there would be a sufficient revenue from residents taking water to defray the interest on the cost of laying down the water pipes.\nThis statement is, of course, consistent with paragraph 6 above quoted, and, together with the admissions, is out of question. The Committee on Works has taken the place of the Board of Control.\nIt is enacted by s. 671 of the Halifax City Charter, 1914, that:\n671. (1) The owner of any dwelling-house situated on any portion of a street through which a main pipe is laid, shall be entitled, on application to the Board of Control, to a service pipe one-half inch in diameter to such house.\n(2) Such service pipe shall be laid at the expense of the City from the main pipe to the line of the street through the wall of the house, if the wall is on the line of the street.\n(3) The cost of laying such service pipe beyond the line of the street shall be borne by the applicant.\nThis section regulates the mode and capacity of the connection with the source of supply, and the incidence of the cost, where the dwelling-house is situated \u201con any portion of a street through which a main pipe is laid.\u201d Whether a main pipe is laid through Oakland Road does not appear, although it is shown by par. 7 of the case that, subsequent to May, 1919, pursuant to argreement with Mr. Walsh, an extension of the city water mains was laid to the houses which he constructed, or to the sites where these houses were to be built, and presumably they were between Cartaret Street and Studley Street, which is the next crossing to the westward of Cartaret, because it is provided by the City by-law of 14th September, 1922, entitled \u201cA By-law of the City of Halifax to make a special rate for water on a portion of Oakland Road,\u201d that:\nEach property fronting on Oakland Road on which a house is erected between Cartaret street and Studley street shall be charged a water rate for water supplied it of $53.89 per annum the same being the amount required at present to produce six per cent, on the cost of the extension of the water service in that district, the same to be proportionately reduced as additional houses are erected on the said portion of the said street.\nThis by-law applies the practice, of long standing, which is alluded to in par. 6 of the case; but that practice is not shown to have been previously sanctioned by by-law, except in so far as the facts narrated in par. 6 may be considered as evidence of a by-law.\nThe power of the City to make such a by-law is in question. It depends upon the inherent powers of the corporation, and upon subs. 1 of s. 525, and subs. 1 of s. 676, by which it is enacted that:\n525. (1) The Board of Control, from time to time by By-law to be approved by the Council, may:\n(a) Prescribe rates payable in respect to water other than the rates controlled by the statute;\n(b) make regulations in respect to the mode of imposing, collecting, or enforcing payment of water rates;\n* * * * *\n676. (1) The Council, on the recommendation of the Board of Control, may make ordinances, rules and regulations regulating the construction, location, maintenance, operation, renewal and removal of any main pipe or service pipe, conduit or tube, for any purpose, or belonging to any person, firm or corporation or association, upon, or along any street, park or public place of the City.\nAccording to one reading, s. 525, subs. 1(a), means that the Council may prescribe rates in substitution for those enacted by statute. But, if the meaning be that the Council may prescribe rates for such services only as have not been rated by statute, and that is in effect the plaintiff\u2019s contention, it is argued, upon that interpretation, that the rate in question is \u201ccontrolled by the statute,\u201d because of subs. (1) of s. 499, which provides that:\n499. (1) Every owner of property supplied with water through a water meter, in lieu of the rates for domestic purposes or special or extra rates specified in respect to such water in the preceding sections, shall in respect to such water passing through such meter, pay such rates and such annual rental upon the meter, as are from time to time fixed by the Board of Control, and approved by the Council.\nAnd it is said in the case that:\nAt a meeting of the Council held on the 29th January, 1920, the Council by resolution directed the Engineer to place a meter on every unmetered water service in the City, which resolution the Engineer proceeded to carry out. Since that date no new service pipe has been installed without a meter being placed upon it and meters were placed as rapidly as possible upon all existing services which work was completed in about one year from date of resolution. Since that time there has been no water service in the City not supplied with a meter and all charges for water have been meter rates fixed by the Council and no charges for water have been made on a rate mentioned in Section 486.\nNow the intention of the by-law of 14th September, I would say, obviously, was that the Oakland Road houses were to pay the by-law rate, not in lieu of rates \u201cfor domestic purposes\u201d, because these houses never became subject to those rates, the compensation having been specially regulated otherwise; and not in lieu of the \u201cspecial or extra rates specified in respect of such water in the preceding sections\u201d, because these \u201cpreceding sections\u201d never had any application to the case. The by-law rate was imposed in virtue of the powers which the City had to regulate the supply of water in cases outside the pipe lines, where the introduction of the water, was in the discretion of the Council. And, with the greatest respect for the contrary view, I am persuaded that the Council had adequate power. Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius, 13th Ed., pp. 1129, et seq.\nIt is not disputed that the construction of a main into Oakland Road, in the circumstances disclosed by the case, was within the powers of the City. The Walsh agreement is not printed, nor is it introduced as an exhibit, but it was subject to the terms of that agreement that the main was laid. What we know about the agreement has already been stated. It seems to have been contemplated that incoming house owners should, as a temporary condition, by agreement, contribute the interest charges upon the cost of construction, until these could be produced by the application of the general rates in force within the pipe lines. So long as the latter rates would yield less than the interest, it was necessary, and good faith required, if the policy which the City had the right to dictate was to be maintained, that the conventional rate as stipulated with Mr. Walsh should be levied, and I see nothing in sec. 671, or in any other provision of the Act, which must be construed to the contrary.\nThe argument is, and the plaintiff\u2019s case seems to depend upon the view, that, since a main pipe exists on the street, the plaintiff is entitled to a connection, and therefore, upon demand, to a supply of water at the usual meter rates, irrespective of the effect which this might have upon the agreement, or its special purpose, or whether or not compatible with the conditions in pursuance of which the main was laid. But I should have thought that the house owners who are permitted to use the main by reason of the agreement may be required to do so cum onere; indeed, the burden must accompany the privilege, if the terms upon which the City was induced to build the main be enforceable. Section 671, which provides for a one-half inch service pipe, does not otherwise regulate the use or supply of the water. There are conditions under which the water may be turned on or off, and these may be regulated by the by-laws under ss. 525 and 676. The language of the statute would, in my view, have to be intractable to convince one that the person who built upon the street next after Mr. Walsh, could demand a supply of water at meter rate, and so escape the terms which the City had, in its discretion, stipulated and sanctioned.\nBy s. 9 of c. 54, 1922, it is enacted that,\nIn the case of any property in respect to which the Council fixes a special rate for the supply of water, the Engineer may require the owner to enter into an agreement to pay such special rate before turning on the water to such property, and, if such property is sold, a supply of water thereto may be refused and the water turned off until the new owner has entered into such agreement.\nIf, therefore, as I think, the rate in question be a special rate for the supply of water, within the meaning of this section, there is express legislative recognition and sanction for requiring the owner to enter into an agreement to pay such special rate before the turning on of the water; and, as to the validity of the Walsh agreement, and the power of the City to apply it, the general subject was one with regard to which, admittedly, the City was authorized to exercise its discretion, and it cannot be doubtful that, if the plaintiff desired to avail herself of a service which the City was empowered, but not bound, to render, she could not insist upon the performance for a consideration less than that which the City had reasonably stipulated.\nIt is also argued for the respondent that the water rates must be uniform throughout the city, and that a special rate could not be authorized, or sanctioned by by-law, and two decisions of this Court were cited to support these contentions: the cases are Attorney-General of Canada v. City of Toronto[2] and City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co.[3]. There are some references to uniformity by Sir Henry Strong, the learned Chief Justice who gave the judgment of the court in the former case; but I have no doubt that these were not meant to extend the requirements of the common law, by which a by-law must be intra vires, certain, consistent with the statutes and the general law, and reasonable. I find no authority or principle of law for the proposition that an ordinance of a municipal corporation, which complies with these essentials, must operate uniformly in every part of the municipal area, notwithstanding that the diversity of circumstances requires different considerations for special localities. I am satisfied that, when the learned Chief Justice introduced the word \u201cuniform,\u201d he meant to include nothing new as essential to the validity of a by-law, and a careful examination of his judgment makes this evident. What he regarded as a requisite or an essential was uniformity, not in the sense of precise arithmetical equality, but as excluding arbitrary or unjust discrimination. The by-law now in question is of the class which, as has been said, should be benevolently interpreted; nevertheless there may be cases, which it is not necessary for present purposes to define or to illustrate, where, in the words of the cases, a by-law is found to be capricious and oppressive; partial and unequal in its operation as between different classes; manifestly unjust; disclosing bad faith; involving such oppressive or gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to it as can find no justification in the minds of reasonable men; and in such cases, as was said by Russell C.J., in Kruse v. Johnson[4] \u201cthe question of unreasonableness can properly be regarded.\u201d See also Slattery v. Naylor[5]. It is, I think, plainly to be inferred from the language of Strong C.J., that it was for vice of this kind that he condemned the by-law in the Toronto case[6]. That seems to be manifest by the context, and by the statement of the ground upon which the decision is put. The learned Chief Justice adopted a passage from Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 4th Ed., sec. 319 (see the 5th Ed., Vol. II, sees. 598 et seq.) wherein it is said in effect that every by-law must be reasonable, and not inconsistent with any statute or the general principles of the common law, and that, in the United States, the courts have often affirmed that, while municipal corporations have a general incidental power to make ordinances, these \u201cmust be reasonable, consonant with the general powers and purposes of the corporation, and not inconsistent with the laws or policy of the State.\u201d This, the learned Chief Justice very truly says, is not new law, and he refers to Norris v. Staps[7], a case of a municipality under letters patent. He finds that the Toronto by-law discriminates against the Crown, and says that he can conceive no stronger, case of a by-law conflicting with the policy of the law; that \u201cit is unreasonable and unfair\u201d, in making an unwarranted discrimination against the particular consumer of water. Therefore I conclude that the by-law was condemned for inequality or discrimination, and perhaps also as conflicting with the legislation in the particular case, and the decision was, I am convinced, intended and serves as an authority for nothing more. And this is consistent with the decision of the majority in the Hamilton case[8], in which Attorney General of Canada v. City of Toronto[9] was cited as the governing decision. It is perhaps worth while to quote the following observations of Idington J. in the later case, at pp. 253 and 254. The learned judge says, referring to the Toronto case[10].\nThere may be cases wherein the cost of supplying the water may render an even rate per gallon most inequitable. I can conceive of cases, where the uniform charge of a flat rate per gallon might be in itself a grave discrimination against some of those supplied, in possession of properties having great natural advantages, and in favour of those whose properties had corresponding natural disadvantages, to supply whom might cost double that of the former. I will not go further than to say that I have not overlooked possible modifications of rates that might exist and yet not be improperly discriminating in character. If the \u201cuniformity of rates\u201d spoken of by Sir Henry Strong in his judgment in the Toronto case[11], excludes the possibility of giving due consideration to such possible conditions, then I cannot in that regard agree with it. I do not, however, so read it. The general principles it enunciates, and at some length elucidates I heartily agree in. I would regret to see them impaired.\nOf course each case depends upon its own legislation, but I find nothing in the Halifax City Charter to prohibit such an arrangement as was made with Mr. Walsh and incidentally proposed for those who desired to build houses on Oakland Road in advance of the development of the street, and before the consumption of water there would become adequate to yield, by the general system of rates, the interest upon the cost of the necessary works to introduce the water into the street. It seems not only fair and just, but also very equitable in the common interest, that, when a new street is laid out in an outlying district, before the demand is sufficient to justify the introduction of expensive waterworks, persons attracted to it for residential purposes, or perhaps having building lots to utilize in the locality, should be subjected to reasonable terms or stipulations for defraying temporarily the cost of water, if specially introduced for their accommodation while the street is in course of settlement, and unable to pay its way. Moreover, the practice seems to have proved its worth and convenience through a long course of experience.\nThe City was required by s. 492 to impose and levy certain extra and special rates for specified structures, and for buildings supplied by pipes exceeding one-half inch in diameter; but these provisions do not curtail the general powers of the City to make reasonable provision for special cases not otherwise provided for. And it does not follow that, because the Statute insists upon provision for certain specified cases, therefore other special cases, not provided for, may not be accommodated upon reasonable principles.\nBut now it is suggested, although the point was not made either in the court below or in this court, and although it is not supported by any admission or evidence, that the amount of the special rate for which the respondent was required to sign was ascertained upon a wrong principle; that the respondent\u2019s liability should have been limited to her proportionate share of the interest charges, having regard to the precise quantity of water which she used, as shewn by meter; and that, inasmuch as the $53.89, or one-fifth of the total interest chargeable, represents an equal amount against each of the five householders, including the respondent, which might or might not have been the result if meter rates were applied, the respondent was therefore justified in refusing to sign. This comes to saying in effect that the by-law is unreasonable, and may therefore be declared void, because each of the five is declared liable for one-fifth. But I do not think that this proposition is any more established than it is alleged as a cause of complaint. Here is an area within the city, outside the water service, and destitute of water, to which, however, water may, if desired, be introduced by and at the discretion of the city authorities, who may, in the special circumstances, look to those who enjoy the service to pay the interest upon the cost incurred by the City of introducing the water to their houses. There are five houses within the area, evidently ordinary dwelling-houses of comparable dimensions. There are several ways\u2014perhaps many ways\u2014by which a division of the charge among those participating might not unfairly be reached; but there is no obligation by law or agreement, so far as I have been able to discover, to resort to meters to measure exactly the quarts or gallons which each householder consumes; and I am by no means satisfied that the City has done anything unreasonable in distributing the burden of the taxation in equal shares among those whom, at their request, it has brought into contact with the system. The difference, if any, in cost or expenditure for the service as between any one proprietor and each of the others is practically negligible. The whole expense is for service equally essential for each of the five. One may, perhaps, use a little less or a little more water than another, but it would seem to be unfair, rather than otherwise, that the proprietors should therefore contribute in different measure for the cost of the installation which made the common service possible, and for which the City insisted upon receiving indemnity in the manner and to the extent stipulated or intended by the agreement, and sanctioned by the by-law. I would allow the appeal and reverse the findings, with costs throughout.\nLamont J. (dissenting in part)-\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc, upon a special case stated under Order XXXIII of the Rules of Court, and referred by consent directly to the Court en banc for decision. The amount involved in the appeal is small, but as the action is in the nature of a test case, and as the owners of a considerable number of other houses are in the same position as the respondent, leave to appeal to this Court was granted. The sole point involved in the appeal is the rate at which the respondent is entitled to have a water supply for domestic purposes from the appellant for her dwelling house on Oakland Road, Halifax.\nThe stated case sets out the material facts. Paragraph 6 reads as follows:\u2014\n6. The water system of the Defendant (Appellant) is not in any way connected with or dependent upon the rates and taxes of the City, but is a separate system under the control of the Council of the City, acting by the Committee on Works, and in particular the streets in which main water pipes shall be laid are entirely in the discretion of the said Committee and Council as aforesaid. For many years it has been the policy of the Defendant to be satisfied before laying a main on any Street that there will be a sufficient revenue from the persons taking a supply of water therefrom to defray the interest on the cost of such extension and to require of any person requesting an extension on a street upon which the number of consumers was insufficient to produce at the usual rates such revenue, a bond or agreement to pay a rate equal to such revenue, such rate to be proportionately reduced as other consumers become connected with the new main.\nPrior to 1919 there was no water main on Oakland Road. In the month of May of that year Mr. T. J. Walsh requested the appellant to construct a water main along that street and connect the same with three houses he proposed building on property abutting thereon, and he agreed to pay yearly as a special rate for his water supply the sum of $269.45, being the interest at 6% on the cost of the construction of the main. The main was constructed and Mr. Walsh paid that sum in respect of the houses built by him.\nIn June, 1922, the respondent commenced the erection of a dwelling house on property fronting on that portion of Oakland Road served by the main. On July 14 she wrote to the appellant demanding a water supply for her house under the provisions of section 671 of the City Charter. At that time the main was serving four houses on Oakland Road. On July 19 the respondent was informed that before her house could be connected with the main she must sign a bond conditioned for the payment of \u201ca special rate.\u201d This bond she refused to give and, on July 22, gave notice of action. The appellant thereupon furnished the pipe connection but refused to turn on the water unless she would agree to pay a special rate of $53.89 (1\/?\/ of the $269.45). To this she would not consent. By an arrangement between the parties, the water was turned on, the respondent\u2019s claim for damages was withdrawn and the action was limited to a claim for a declaration that the respondent was (entitled to a water supply without entering into an agreement to pay a special rate.\nThe respondent\u2019s contention is that she was entitled to a water supply at the water rate in general application throughout the city. The contention of the appellant is that she is entitled to a water supply only at the \u201cspecial rate\u201d fixed for dwelling houses in the locality in which her house is situated. This special rate had been recommended by the engineer whose recommendation was adopted by the Council by resolution on July 19, 1922. After the commencement of the action but before the date for filing a statement of defence had expired, the Council passed the following by-law:\u2014\nA By-law of the City of Halifax to make a special rate for water on a portion of Oakland Road.\nBe it enacted by the Mayor and Council of the City of Halifax as follows:\u2014\n\u201cEach property fronting on Oakland Road on which a house is erected between Cartaret Street and Studley Street shall be charged a water rate for water supplied it of $53.89 per annum the same being the amount required at present to produce six per cent, on the cost of the extension of the water service in that district, the same to be proportionately reduced as additional houses are erected on the said portion of the said street.\u201d\nThis by-law was passed September 14, 1922. The position taken by the respondent in respect thereto was that the Council had no power to fix a special rate for Oakland Road.\nThe questions raised by the stated case are:\u2014\n1. Whether the plaintiff was entitled to the supply of water to the dwelling house number 53 Oakland Road without entering into an agreement to pay a rate of $53.89 per year. 2. Whether the rate imposed by the resolution of Council of 19th July, 1922, and the by-law of September 14, 1922, was valid.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc answered the first of these questions in the affirmative, and the second in the negative, being of opinion that the City Council had no authority to pass either the resolution of July 19 or the by-law of September 14. On these answers judgment was entered for the plaintiff and from that judgment this appeal is brought.\nThe right of an owner of a dwelling house in the City of Halifax to receive a supply of water from the City is provided for by section 671 of the City Charter which reads as follows:\u2014\n671. (1) The owner of any dwelling-house situated on any portion of a street through which a main pipe is laid, shall be entitled, on application to the Board of Control, to a service pipe one-half-inch in diameter to such house.\nFor the respondent it was contended that the right to a service pipe, given by this section, carries with it a right to a supply if water running through the pipe. As a matter of construction I agree that such would ordinarily be the case. But an owner\u2019s right to a supply of water is dependent upon his willingness to pay a proper rate for that supply. In Dominion of Canada v. City of Levis[12], the question was as to the right of the Dominion to a supply of water for one of its buildings in the City of Levis and the amount to be paid therefor. The City offered to furnish the supply for $300 a year, while the Dominion offered only $35. In giving judgment their Lordships of the Privy Council, at page 511, say:\u2014\nWater supplied at the cost of the municipality from artificially constructed waterworks is in the nature of a merchantable commodity, and their Lordships are of opinion, that unless some statutory right is established, the Government of Canada cannot claim to have a supply of water for the Government building, unless it is prepared to pay and to continue to pay in respect thereof a fair and reasonable price.\nAlthough such water was in the nature of a merchantable commodity and the supplying of the same would ordinarily be subject to an agreement express or implied as to price, their Lordships point out that the City of Levis, as a dealer in water on whom there has been conferred by statute a position of great and special advantage, might well be held to be under an implied obligation to give a water supply to owners of houses within the area of supply, provided that such owner was willing to make fair and reasonable payment therefor. Apart therefore from statutory provisions determining the rate, the respondent was entitled j to have a supply of water for her dwelling house upon payment of a reasonable rate for the same.\nThe City Charter of 1914 makes provision for two separate systems by which the rates to be paid may be determined. The first, contained in sections 486 to 498, is designated the \u201cgeneral rate.\u201d The other, contained in section 499, is called the \u201cmeter rate.\u201d The general rate is based upon the values of property within the water pipe lines and is divided into two classes. First, a fire protection rate upon all lands, and secondly, a rate upon every dwelling house and the land occupied thereby. In addition to this general rate, section 492 provides that \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cextra\u201d rates shall be levied on certain properties. These are buildings owned and occupied by or for the Imperial, Dominion or Provincial Governments, Breweries, Distilleries, Hotels, Founderies, etc. The special rates to be levied in these cases are such as the Board of Control may deem right. Then in respect of a number of other properties such as livery stables, bar-rooms, closets, fountains, and buildings under construction where water is required for building purposes, the statute itself fixes the special rates to be charged.\nAs an alternative to this system of rating, the Board of Control with the approval of the Council is authorized, by section 499, to adopt a system under which the rates would be based upon the actual consumption of water as shown by the meters. This section is as follows:\n499. (1) Every owner of property supplied with water through a water meter, in lieu of the rates for domestic purposes or special or extra rates specified in respect to such water in the preceding sections, shall in respect to such water passing through such meter, pay such rates and such annual rental upon the meter, as are from time to time fixed by the Board of Control, and approved by the Council.\n(2) Nothing in this section shall exempt any one from paying fire protection rates.\nThe powers of the Board of Control have since been transferred to the Committee on Works. With reference to the system of rating in actual operation when this action was commenced, the stated case contains the following:\u2014\nAt a meeting of the Council held on the 29th January, 1920, the Council by resolution directed the Engineer to place a meter on every unmetered water service in the City which resolution the Engineer proceeded to carry out. Since that date no new service pipe has been installed without a meter being placed upon it and meters were placed as rapidly as possible upon all existing services which work was completed in about one year from date of resolution. Since that time there has been no water service in the City not supplied with a meter and all charges for water have been meter rates fixed by the Council and no charges for water have been made on the rate mentioned in Section 486.\nSince the early part of 1921, therefore, the system of determining the rates to be paid as set out in section 486, including the \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cextra\u201d rates, provided for in section 492, has not been in operation. Only the alternative system authorized by section 499 has been in actual use.\nFrom the judgment appealed against it would appear that in the court below the appellant relied upon section 9 of Chapter 54 of 1922 as the statutory authority for fixing the special rate of $53.89 for the respondent\u2019s house. That section is as follows:\u2014\n9. In the case of any property in respect to which the Council fixes a special rate for the supply of water, the Engineer may require the owner to enter into an agreement to pay such special rate before turning on the water to such property and if such property is sold, a supply of water thereto may be refused and the water turned off until the new owner has entered into such agreement.\nBefore us counsel for the appellant disclaimed any intention of relying upon section 9, as authorizing the special rate. The authority to fix that rate, he contended, was contained in sections 499 and 525.\nSection 525, in part, reads as follows:\u2014\n(1) The Board of Control, from time to time by by-law to be approved by the Council, may\u2014\n(a) prescribe rates payable in respect to water other than the rates controlled by the statute;\nOn behalf of the respondent it was contended that section 499 authorized a meter rate only, and that this implied a quantity charge which must be uniform; and he cited as authority therefor the judgments of this court in Attorney-General of Canada v. The City of Toronto[13], and City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Company[14] In the former of these eases, Strong C.J., after pointing out that the City of Toronto was under a statutory obligation to furnish water to all who might apply for it, and inferring therefrom a legislative intention that the water should be supplied upon some fixed and uniform schedule of rates, at page 520 said:\u2014\nIn other words, the city, like its predecessors in title the waterworks commissioners, is in a sense a trustee of the waterworks, not for the body of ratepayers exclusively but for the benefit of the general public, or at least of that portion of it resident in the city; and they are to dispense the water for the benefit of all, charging only such rates as are uniform, fair and reasonable.\nOn the argument stress was laid upon the word \u201cuniform\u201d which, it was contended, meant an equal rate per gallon to all householders.\nI do not read the judgment of Strong C.J., as laying down the principle that the rate charged per gallon for water passing through the meters must be the same, regardless of the circumstances under which the water was supplied. The rates must be fair and reasonable. A fixed rate per gallon which would be fair and reasonable for one householder would be fair and reasonable for another if the circumstances under which the water was supplied to each were the same. But, where the circumstances are not similar, the imposition of a uniform rate per gallon might be neither just nor reasonable. In the Toronto case[15], Gwynne J. limited the application of the principle of the uniform rate to customers supplied \u201cunder like circumstances.\u201d At page 526 he said:\u2014\nIn my opinion the corporation has no power to impose a greater rate or charge for water supplied to a consumer who is not liable for or subject to the assessable rate upon real property than under like circumstances they do impose upon consumers of water who are subjected to such assessable rate.\nThe question in that case was as to the validity of a bylaw which allowed a discount of 50 per cent, from the water rates if paid within the first two months of the half year for which they were due, but which excepted from the benefit of the discount Government buildings which were exempt from city taxes. The by-law was held to be invalid. In the Hamilton case[16], the question was whether the City could lawfully charge one class of manufacturer a higher price for water supplied than another, both classes being supplied by meter, and the only difference between them being the nature of their business. It was held that under a general power to fix the rates, the City of Hamilton could not, as to prices charged, discriminate as between different members of the same class of customers.\nThe authority to fix the rates for water supplied through meters given to the appellant by section 499 does not, in my opinion, necessarily compel it to impose a uniform gallon rate for water consumed upon all householders supplied. Where, as in the present case, a main water pipe has been extended into a locality into which it would not otherwise have been laid by reason of an agreement on part of a householder or householders to pay the interest on the cost of its construction and on the understanding that as other houses are built and served by the main the owners thereof will pay their proportionate share of such interest, the appellant, in my opinion, has authority to impose a special rate on those served by the main sufficient at least to cover such interest charges. Section 9, above quoted, recognizes the existence of such authority and provides certain means of enforcing the special rate. The language of the section is \u201cIn the case of any property in respect to which the council fixes a special rate for the supply of water,\u201d etc. This language clearly presupposes power in the council to fix a special rate, and I do not find anything in section 499 which could be construed as being inconsistent with its exercise. The obligation imposed on owners by that section is to pay such rates as are fixed by the Board of Control and approved of by the Council. As I read the City Charter and amendments thereto, the intention of the Legislature was to leave it to the discretion of the committee of the council to fix rates which would be fair and reasonable, excepting always those cases in which the statute itself fixes the rates. This does not imply that the council is authorized to exercise an arbitrary discretion, for a by-law imposing rates may be subject to judicial scrutiny to determine whether it is fair and reasonable under the circumstances or whether it amounts to an unwarranted discrimination as between the appellant\u2019s different customers. In determining the question of reasonableness, the court, where its opinion is sought, will have regard to all the circumstances of the particular city or corporation whose by-law is under review, the object sought to be attained thereby and the necessity therefor, always bearing in mind that the power to declare a by-law void because it is unreasonable is one which must be exercised with great care.\nNow unless section 9 can be read as implying a power in the council to impose a special rate, I can find for it no field of operation, for I cannot accept the construction placed upon it by the court below, namely, that the \u201cspecial rate\u201d there referred to means the special rate for which provision was made in section 492, I think it clear that the special rate mentioned in section 9 is the entire sum to be paid by the property owner for his supply of water, for the meter rate adopted by the council in 1920 was in lieu of all other rates covered by sections 486 and 492. Under section 492 the special rate therein referred to is merely a rate additional or supplemental to the general rate provided for in s. 486. To hold that the words \u201cspecial rate\u201d had the same meaning in s. 9 as they had in s. 492 would be to attribute to the appellant, when it obtained the amendment of 1922 (s. 9), an intention to obtain legislation enabling it to require an agreement from an owner to pay the supplemental rate under s. 492 without including in the agreement the general rate payable under s. 486. It would also attribute to the appellant an intention, in 1922, of protecting a supplemental special rate the use of which it had previously discontinued. The meaning to be attributed to the word \u201cspecial\u201d in s. 9, in my opinion, is, \u201cdifferent from the ordinary\u201d, \u201csomething additional to the usual or ordinary\u201d, and the \u201cfixing of a special rate\u201d means the fixing of a rate which is different from the rate generally applicable.\nThe appellant having, as I hold, authority to levy a special rate on the owners of houses on Oakland Road, had it authority to fix, as against each house, the sum mentioned in the by-law? The by-law, which simply confirmed the resolution of July 19, fixed a flat rate of $53.89 for each of the five houses. This was arrived at by dividing by five the $269.45 which Mr. Walsh had agreed to pay. That is, each householder was charged a special flat rate of one-fifth of the interest on the cost of constructing the main. On this point the question is: Had the council authority to call upon each of the five householders to pay the same sum regardless of the amount of water consumed by him, or only his proportionate share of the $269.45 on a meter basis?\nThe stated case contains the following: \u201cSince that time\u201d (early in 1921) \u201cthere has been no water service in the city not supplied with a meter and all charges for water have been meter rates fixed by the council.\u201d Taken literally this statement means that even on Oakland Road the charges made were meter rates. As this is inconsistent with the by-law I take it that the parties intended the statement to mean that all charges for water other than those on Oakland Road were meter rates. A meter rate, I understand to be, a charge based upon the quantity of water passing through the meter. The council having, by its resolution of January 29th, 1920, adopted the meter system, the respondent would have a right to complain of inequitable treatment if she established that her meter rate was higher than that of her neighbours on Oakland Road. Once that was established, the onus, in my opinion, would be on the appellant to shew that as between the respondent and her neighbours it was fair and reasonable that she should pay a higher meter rate than they. The imposition of a flat house rate means that the owner of a small house occupying, say, 25 feet of ground, and using but little water, must pay for that water the same sum as the owner of a large house occupying 100 feet of ground and using four times as much water. The water supplied to the householders on Oakland Road was supplied by the appellant from artificially constructed water-works and was, therefore, in the nature of a merchantable commodity. Being a merchantable commodity, supplied to the householders under exactly similar circumstances, the price to each, as pointed out in the above mentioned cases, should be the same; otherwise there would be discrimination. Prima facie, therefore, if the respondent paid a higher price per gallon for the water consumed by her than was paid. by her neighbours on Oakland Road, she was being discriminated against. But here we have to face this difficulty: The case does not disclose the relative consumption of the five householders on Oakland Road. There is no material from which we can determine whether the respondent\u2019s proportionate share of the $269.45, as determined by the meter, would be more than, equal to, or less than, $53.89. It would, in my opinion, be an unwarranted assumption to hold that each householder consumed the same quantity of water. We know that the water consumed in each house passed through a meter and, to my mind, the adoption of a meter rate carries with it the idea that the charges to be made in respect thereof will be based upon the amount of water consumed. Once it was shewn that the appellant had adopted the meter system for the city, and that the charges fixed for Oakland Road were computed on a basis inconsistent therewith, the respondent was entitled to call upon the appellant to justify the adoption of a system for Oakland Road based upon the number of houses owned rather than upon the amount of water consumed. No such justification has been made or attempted. It has not been shewn that it was necessary in the appellant\u2019s interests, or even desirable, that the ordinary method of ascertaining the amount payable by a householder for water should be changed from a meter to a flat house rate. It cannot, as far as I can see, make any difference to the appellant whether the householders on Oakland Road make up the $269.45 by an equal contribution from each or by a contribution based upon the quantity of water passing through their respective meters.\nAs I read the above authorities, the principles to be applied to this case are: The appellant in supplying its citizens with water supplies them with a merchantable commodity. Those supplied from the Oakland Road main are supplied under exactly similar circumstances. The price which the City can charge for its commodity when sold to different customers under similar circumstances must be the same to each. That is, such price must not only be fair and reasonable but it must be uniform.\nOn the material before us we cannot say that the appellant charged the householders on Oakland Road the same price for water supplied in like circumstances and, therefore, cannot say that the $53.89 charged the respondent was a fair and reasonable sum for the water supplied to her. She was, therefore, justified in refusing to sign an agreement to pay that sum.\nThis, however, in my opinion, does not conclude the appeal. The last two paragraphs of the stated case read as follows:\u2014\nIf the Court is of the opinion in the affirmative of the first question or in the negative of the second question, then judgment shall be entered for a declaration that the plaintiff was entitled to the supply of water for the dwelling house, number 53 Oakland Road, subject to the ordinary rates and for costs.\nIf the Court shall be of opinion in the negative of the said first question or in the affirmative of the second question, then judgment shall be entered for the defendant with costs.\nThe formal judgment below contains the following:\u2014\nIt is ordered, adjudged, decreed and declared that the plaintiff was and is entitled to a supply of water for her dwelling house number 53 Oakland Road, Halifax, N.S., subject to the ordinary water meter rates.\nFor the reasons I have given above, the respondent was not and is not entitled to a water supply at the ordinary water meter rates. She is entitled to it only upon payment of her proportionate share of the $269.45 fixed by the council based on the water consumed, and the appellant is entitled to require her to sign an agreement to pay that share before turning on the water. Notwithstanding the agreement of the parties in the stated case as to the form the judgment should take, it is the duty of the court to give the judgment which will carry into effect the rights of the parties.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be allowed, the judgment below set aside, and judgment entered declaring the plaintiff to be entitled to a supply of water only upon entering into an agreement to pay her proportionate share, as determined by the meter, of the $269.45.\nAs both parties agreed to submit the case to us in the form in which it appears, I think justice will be done by directing that the parties pay their own costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

At the time of the issuance of the policies and of their renewals, the respondent, through its secretary, declared, in answer to written questions put by the appellant, that these employees were not then in default, that all moneys or property in their control or custody had been accounted for, and that the means of ascertaining the correctness of their accounts would be, in the case of the cashier, their checking by auditors every month and, in the case of the assistant cashier, a daily accounting by him to the cashier. It was agreed that \u201cthe above answers (were) to be taken as conditions precedent and as the basis of the bond applied for or any renewal or continuation of the same.\u201d But these statements were not mentioned or set out in the policies or in the renewal certificates. At the time of the application for the policies and of their renewals, the assistant cashier was already a defaulter, but not to the knowledge of the respondent.\nHeld, that, in cases under the law of Quebec, where the insurance company denies its responsibility on the ground that some answer or statement was untrue or that some term or condition was not respected or observed by the insured, the first inquiry is whether such term, condition, answer or statement is set out in full on the face or back of the policy, and if it is, it must of course be given effect to; but if it is not, the term, condition, answer or statement cannot be regarded as a warranty or a condition precedent.\nHeld also, that the answers and statements of the respondent were not warranties or conditions precedent, but merely representations which fairly and reasonably interpreted according to the evidence, were substantially true and involved no material concealment. Moreover, these answers and statements, not being mentioned or even referred to in the policies, did not legally form part of the contract and could not affect or control the terms and conditions of the policies.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 45 K.B. 311) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Boyer J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and O. S. Tyndale K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The action is based on two policies or fidelity guarantee bonds by each of which the appellant undertook to indemnify the respondent up to the sum of $10,000.00, by one: for any loss which the latter might sustain as a result of any act of fraud or dishonesty by Thomas James Cambridge, employed by the respondent as bookkeeper and cashier; and by the other: for any such loss sustained through the fraud or dishonesty of J. A. L. Cadieux, employed by it as assistant-cashier.\nThe two policies were issued on or about the 19th June, 1922 but, by their terms, they applied to the period of one year beginning on the 12th June, 1922 and, in May, 1923, both were renewed for another year from the 12th June, 1923.\nThe policy relating to Cadieux was lost, but it was admitted that it contained the same terms and conditions as the other. The policy relating to Cambridge, after reciting his name, description and employment, reads as follows:\nWhereas, said employee has been required to furnish this bond.\nNow, therefore, in consideration of a premium paid for the period from June 12, 1922, to June 12, 1923, at 12 o\u2019clock noon, it is hereby agreed, that, subject to the conditions set forth in this bond, the UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTEE COMPANY, a body corporate, hereinafter called the \u201csurety,\u201d shall, within three months next after proof of loss as hereinafter set forth, reimburse the employed to the extent of ten thousand 00\/100 dollars, and no further for all pecuniary loss sustained by the employer of money, securities or other personal property in the possession of the employee, or for the possession of which he is responsible, by any act or acts of fraud or dishonesty committed by the employee in the performance of the duties of the office or position in the service of said employer as aforementioned, and occurring during the continuance of this bond and discovered and notified to the surety within six (6) months after the expiration or cancellation of this bond, within six (6) months after the death, resignation or removal of the employee prior to the expiration or cancellation of this bond.\nThis bond is issued subject to the following conditions:\n1. The employer shall give notice by registered letter addressed to the president of the surety at its home office, Baltimore, Maryland, promptly after becoming aware of any act which may be made the basis of a claim hereunder.\n2. The employer shall, within ninety (90) days after date of said notice, file with the surety an itemized claim hereunder, duly sworn to, and if required the employer shall produce for investigation by the surety at the office of the employer, all books, vouchers and evidence which may be required by the surety.\n3. There shall be no liability on this bond for any act or acts of fraud or dishonesty committed by the employee after the employer has knowledge of any act which may be made the basis of a claim hereunder.\n4. This bond may be cancelled at any time if the surety shall so elect, by giving thirty (30) days\u2019 notice in writing to the employer and refunding the unearned premium upon the surrender of the bond, the cancellation to take effect at the expiration of said thirty days.\n5. If any act of the employee causing a loss to the surety shall constitute a crime, the employer shall, at the expense of the surety, lend every assistance to bring the employee to justice.\n6. No action of any kind or description shall be brought to recover any claim on this bond unless the same shall be commenced within a period of twelve (12) months next after the employer shall have filed the notice as provided in the first condition.\n7. If the employer be a corporation, the knowledge of an officer or director thereof shall be the knowledge of the employer capable of giving rise to a claim under this bond.\n8. On application this suretyship may be increased or decreased by the surety, provided the surety\u2019s aggregate liability under all its suretyship on said employee shall not exceed the largest bond or engagement on the employee. 9. This bond may be continued from year to year by the payment of the annual premium to the surety and issuance by the surety of its continuation certificate, provided that the liability of the surety shall not exceed the amount above written, whether the loss shall occur during the term above named, or during any continuation thereof, or partly during said term and partly during said continuation.\n10. It is agreed, that none of the foregoing conditions shall be deemed to have been waived by the surety unless the waiver be in writing over the signature of an officer of the surety as its home office, and notice to any agent of the surety shall not be binding upon the surety nor affect a waiver or change in this contract or any part of it.\nIn witness whereof, the said employee has hereunto set his hand and seal, and the said surety has caused this bond to be sealed with its corporate seal, signed by its president and duly attested by its assistant secretary this 19t.h day of June, 1922.\nSigned, sealed and delivered by the said employee in the presence of\nR. G. Walker, T. J. Cambridge, (Seal)\nEmployee.\nAttest:\nUnited States Fidelity and Guarantee Company,\nJohn R. Bland,\nPresident.\nF. D. Knowles, Attorney in Fact.\n(Seal of surety)\nThe above policy and the similar one concerning Cadieux were issued upon an application made in each case by the employee, whereupon The United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, the appellant, wrote to The Fruit Auction of Montreal Limited, the respondent:\nAn application has been made to this company to issue a bond of security for Mr.\u2014\u2014\u2014 as (stating the employment) in your service, at Montreal, to the amount of $10,000. The company desires to have answers to the following questions, and the answers will be taken as the basis of the bond if issued.\nThe respondent answered the questions in writing and signed them together with the following declaration:\nIt is agreed that the above answers are to be taken as conditions precedent and as the basis of the said bond applied for, or any renewal or continuation of the same, or any other bond substituted in place thereof, except as specifically changed, that may be issued by the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company to the undersigned, upon the person above named\nIn May, 1923, when the policies were renewed and continued for another year beginning the 12th June, 1923, the appellant had written to both Cambridge and Cadieux the following letter:\nWe hereby notify you that the current premium of $50 on the above numbered bond, issued by this company on your behalf, for $10,000 to The Fruit Auction of Montreal Ltd., will be due on the 12th day of June next.\nThe premium must be paid on or before the date of expiration and a continuation certificate secured, otherwise the bond will lapse.\nKindly have the certificate below filled in and signed by your employer and forward with the premium to Mr. F. O. Knowles, Montreal, Que., when the renewal receipt will be sent you.\nThe certificate therein referred to was as follows:\nTo the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company:\nThis is to certify, that the books and accounts of (here the name and employment of Cambridge or Cadieux) were examined by us from time to time in the regular course of business and we found them correct in every respect, all moneys or property in his control or custody being accounted for, with proper securities and funds on hand to balance his accounts, and he is not now in default.\nHe has performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner, and no change has occurred in the terms or conditions of his employment as specified by us when the bond was executed.\nExceptions: None.\nDated at Montreal, this 15th day of May, 1923.\nThe Fruit Auction of Montreal Limited\nEmployer\nCorporate\nBody\nBy Jas. R. Caldwell,\nSecretary (Official capacity.)\n(Seal)\nIf a corporation, affix corporate seal.\nThis notice must not be delivered as a continuation certificate.\nThis certificate was signed and returned by the respondent and the renewal receipts or continuation certificates were then issued by the company.\nOn the 16th January, 1924, certain entries in the respondent\u2019s bank books aroused the suspicions of the directors. The next day Cambridge and Cadieux admitted irregularities. A complete audit of the books was immediately started and, after many days of investigation, the loss sustained by the respondent was reported as $1,386.48 through the acts of Cambridge and $5,918.81 through the acts of Cadieux. The appellant would not admit its responsibility and consequently action was brought for the sum of $7,305.29, the total of the two amounts above mentioned.\nThe appellant was regularly notified in accordance with the policies. The respondent has proven a pecuniary loss of $7,305.29 through the acts of fraud or dishonesty committed by Cambridge and Cadieux in the performance of their duties during the currency of the policies. It is, therefore, entitled to recover that sum from the appellant (save $892.87 abandoned at the trial), unless the appellant be right in its contentions now presently to be stated.\nAmong the questions asked from and answered by the respondent when the policies were issued were the following:\nIn the case of Cambridge:\n11. To whom and how frequently will he account for his handling of funds and securities? To auditors monthly.\n12. (a) What means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct? Checking of all accounts by above.\n(b) How frequently will they be examined? Monthly.\n(c) If applicant is a salesman or collector, are statements rendered to customers in arrears, and at what periods?\n(d) If applicant is an insurance agent, state period when reported settlements are required.\n13. When were his accounts last examined? Month of May.\n14. Were they at that time in every respect correct and proper securities and funds on hand to balance? Yes.\n15. Is there now or has there been any shortage due you by applicant? No.\n16. (a) Is he now in debt to you? No.\nIn the case of Cadieux:\n11. To whom and how frequently will be account for his handling of funds and securities? Daily to cashier.\n12. (a) What means will you use to ascertain whether his accounts are correct? Checking by cashier.\n(b) How frequently will they be examined? Daily.\n(c) If applicant is a salesman or collector, are statements rendered to customers in arrears, and at what periods?\n(d) If applicant is an insurance agent, state period when reports and settlements are required.\n13. When were his accounts last examined? June 10\/22.\n14. Were they at that time in every respect correct and proper securities and funds on hand to balance? Yes.\n15. Is there now or has there been any shortage due you by applicant? No.\nStatements to the same effect, it will be remembered, were also made in the certificates signed by the respondent when the policies were renewed.\nThe appellant now contends that these answers and statements were warranties and that in so far as they were affirmative as to facts they were untrue and misleading, in so far as they were promissory, they were not respected, observed or complied with by the respondent.\nThe Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench refused to regard these answers and statements as warranties or conditions precedent. In their view, they were only representations. As they were held to have been made in good faith, as the facts were found to be substantially as represented and there was no material concealment, the action was accordingly maintained by both courts.\nWhat we have now to consider is whether both courts have erred as to the nature and effect of the respondent\u2019s statements and certificates.\nAt the outset we think a clear distinction ought to be made\u2014although not indicated in the judgments below\u2014 between the case of Cambridge and that of Cadieux.\nThe proofs of loss filed with the appellant in accordance with the policies were the result of the investigation made by the auditors immediately following the discovery of irregularities in the books of the two employees. These proofs contain itemized statements and form the basis of the claim against the appellant. The evidence at the trial was strictly confined to them and no evidence was offered of any other moneys misappropriated, stolen or embezzled. Their accuracy was conceded. They must, therefore, be taken to shew exactly the situation of Cambridge\u2019s and Cadieux\u2019 accounts as they stood when the respondent made its answers on the 12th day of June, 1922 or signed the certificates on the 15th day of May, 1923.\nIf we look at the proofs of loss in the case of Cambridge, we find that not only had he no shortage when the policy was issued in June, 1922, but he actually had an overage of $10.57. No cash was proven to have been received by Cambridge and not entered in the books, no moneys illegally withdrawn before the 15th June, 1923. A statement of I.O.U\u2019s of his for $526.30 is dated the 17th November, 1923. True it contains an enumeration of several I.O.U\u2019s, but for these no other date was proven. The date of the 17th November, 1923 was sufficient for the respondent\u2019s purpose to shew that the misappropriation occured during the continuance of the policy. If the appellant wished to connect the I.O.U\u2019s with the dates of the answers before the issue of the policy or of the certificate before the renewal, it was incumbent upon it to establish this connection. Not even an attempt was made to do so and the appellant was apparently content to accept the dates appearing in the proofs of loss and the exhibits thereto attached as accurate. Upon the evidence, Cambridge\u2019s accounts were correct both on the 12th of June, 1922 and on the 15th of May, 1923. There was then no shortage due by him and he was not indebted to the respondent on either of those dates. The result is that the appellant has utterly failed to make out a case against respondent, as regards Cambridge, on the ground of untruthfulness in the answers or in the statements of the certificate for renewal.\nThis does not however entirely dispose of Cambridge\u2019s case, because of the complaint that the so-called promissory warranties were not complied with. But it will be more convenient to discuss the nature and effect of these alleged warranties together with those invoked in Cadieux\u2019 case.\nFor that purpose, a few facts must be adverted to. In that respect, we adopt the findings of the trial judge, concurred in by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and fully justified by the record.\nAt the time of the application for the policies as well as at the time of their renewal, Cadieux was already a defaulter. Before the application he had embezzled the sum of $892.87, and it was for that reason that at the trial the respondent agreed to reduce its claim by that amount. When the policy was renewed, Cadieux\u2019 shortage was considerably larger. The respondent, on the other hand, had no knowledge of this and only became aware of Cadieux\u2019 infidelity the day before the appellant was notified, while it realized the extent of such infidelity only after the investigation was completed.\nNow the appellant points out that, in answer to its questions, the respondent, in June, 1922, had stated that, at that time, Cadieux\u2019 accounts were \u201cin every respect correct and proper securities and funds on hand to balance,\u201d that there was not then nor had there been any shortage due by Cadieux and that he was not in debt to the respondent.\nLikewise, in the certificates for renewal, it was stated that Cadieux\u2019 books were examined by the respondent in the regular course of business and were\nfound correct in every respect, all moneys or property in his control or custody being accounted for, with proper securities and funds on hand to balance his accounts and he is not now in default. He has performed his duties in an acceptable and satisfactory manner * * *. The respondent further invoked the agreement\nthat the above answers (were) to be taken as conditions precedent and as the basis of the said bond applied for, or any renewal or continuation of the same,\nand urged that notwithstanding the respondent\u2019s good faith, the falsity of its declarations had the effect of avoiding the contract.\nAccording to the Civil Code of Quebec, the respondent was the insured under the policies now in question. Article 2468 CC reads as follows:\n2468. Insurance is a contract whereby one party, called the insurer or underwriter, undertakes, for a valuable consideration, to indemnify the other, called the insured, or his representatives, against loss or liability from certain risks or perils to which the object of the insurance may be exposed, or from the happening of a certain event.\nThe employees, Cambridge and Cadieux, were the applicants. They are so referred to throughout the questions sent by the appellant to the respondent before the issue of the policies.\nThe respondent was\nobliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shews the nature and extent of the risk, and which may prevent the undertaking of it, or affect the rate of a premium (Art. 2485 C.C.).\nMisrepresentation or concealment either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed (art. 2487 C.C.).\nBut\nthe obligation of the Insured with respect to representation is satisfied when the fact is substantially as represented and there is no material concealment (Art. 2489 C.C.).\nTwo more articles of the Quebec Civil Code should be cited:\n2490. Warranties and conditions are a part of the contract and must be true if affirmative, and if promissory must be complied with; otherwise the contract may be annulled notwithstanding the good faith of the insured.\nThey are either express or implied.\n2491. An express warranty is a stipulation or condition expressed in the policy, or so referred to in it as to make part of the policy.\nImplied warranties will be designated in the following chapters relating to different kinds of insurance.\nThe \u201cdifferent kinds of insurance * * * designated in the following chapters\u201d are marine insurance, fire insurance and life insurance, bottomry and respondentia. There are under the Code, no implied warranties in fidelity bonds or policies such as we have here. These articles of the Code should be read together with the following \u201cgeneral provisions applicable to all companies or associations\u201d in, the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, in force when the appellant issued the policies:\n7027. When the subject matter of any insurance contract is property or an insurable interest within the limits of the province, or is in connection with a person domiciled or resident therein, any policy, certificate, interim receipt, or writing evidencing the contract shall, if signed, countersigned, issued or delivered in the province, or committed to the post office or to any carrier, messenger or agent, to be delivered or handed over to the assured, his representative or agent in the province, be deemed to evidence a contract made in the province, and the contract shall be construed according to the law of the province, and all moneys payable under the contract shall be paid at the office of the chief officer or agent of the company or association affecting the insurance in the province. This article shall have effect notwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary.\n7028. 1. Where an insurance contract made by any company or association, is evidenced by a written instrument, the company or association shall set out all the terms or conditions of the contract in full on the face or back of the instrument forming or evidencing the contract, and, unless so set out, no term or condition, stipulation or proviso modifying or impairing the effect of any such contract made or renewed after the tenth day of February, 1909, shall be good and valid or admissible in evidence to the prejudice of the assured or beneficiary.\n2. Nothing contained in this article shall exclude the proposal or application of the assured from being considered with the contract, and the court shall determine how far the insurer was induced to enter into the contract by any misrepresentation contained in the said application or proposal.\nWith Mr. Justice Greenshields in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, we apprehend that the solution of the present case must be found in the law above stated, however valuable and interesting may be the references made by counsel for both parties to the decided cases and the authorities in England or United States.\nThe policies now before us are contracts in favour and for the benefit of the Fruit Auction Company, although not signed by the latter.\nUnder the statute of Quebec, all terms and conditions had to be set out\nin full on the face or back of the instrument forming or evidencing the contract, and, unless so set out, no term or condition * * * (was) good or valid or admissible in evidence to the prejudice of the assured or beneficiary.\n(See Kiernan v. Metropolitan Life[2]. The \u201cinstrument\u201d evidencing the contract referred to in sect. 7028 of the statute is undoubtly the policy and the renewal receipt. This is made still clearer by the provision in subsection 2 of 7028 that the proposal or application may be \u201cconsidered with the contract.\u201d\nWarranties, by force of arts. 2490 and 2491 C.C., in order to be \u201ca part of the contract\u201d must be \u201cexpressed in the policy, or so referred to in it as to make part of the policy.\u201d\nIn this case, we find set out in the policies or the renewal receipts neither the documents of the 12th June, 1922 containing the questions and answers with the declaration at the foot signed by the respondent, nor the certificates for renewal sent by the respondent on the 15th May, 1923. These answers and statements, these declarations and certificates of the respondent are nowhere mentioned or even referred to in the policies or renewals, nor is it therein anywhere expressed that they are to be taken as conditions precedent or warranties. They do not therefore legally form part of the contract and they do not affect or control the terms and conditions of the policy. In fact, \u201cnot having been set out in the policies,\u201d they are expressly declared by the statute not to be \u201cgood and valid\u201d terms and conditions of the contracts and they were not even \u201cadmissible in evidence\u201d against the respondent beneficiary.\nThe policy is above recited in full. In terms, it is declared subject to ten enumerated conditions, none of which is alleged to have been infringed. On the other hand, condition no. 3 specifically stipulates that\nthere shall be no liability on this bond for any act or acts of fraud or dishonesty committed by the employee after the employer had knowledge of any act which may be made the basis of a claim hereunder.\nThe implication is that until knowledge is brought home to the employer, the liability of the insurance company remains unaffected.\nAs a result, the statements made by the respondent in its answers and certificates were neither warranties nor conditions precedent and they were no part of the terms and conditions of the contracts.\nThat is the fundamental distinction between this case and other cases where the answers and statements of the insured were incorporated in the policies or bonds, such as The Harbour Commissioners of Montreal v. The Guarantee Company of North America[3]. In that case, the circumstances were so vastly different as to render the decision quite inapplicable to the present one. There was however this main distinction that the promises and conditions there held to have been disregarded by the insured, and for the non-fulfilment of which he was declared not entitled to recover, were stipulated in the policies themselves as express conditions upon which they were granted.\nIt is hardly necessary to point out that the judgment of this court in The Dominion of Canada Guarantee and Accident Company, Limited v. The Housing Commission of the City of Halifax[4], can have no bearing upon the present decision, based entirely upon the special statute and the Civil Code of Quebec. Perhaps it should be noted, however, that, in that case,\nit was recited in the policy that the Commission had made certain statements in writing to the company in (its) application\nand these statements were expressed to be \u201cmaterial\u201d and conditions precedent to the right of the employer to recover under the policy.\nIn cases under the law of Quebec, where the insurance company denies its responsibility on the ground that some answer or statement was untrue or that some term or condition was not respected or observed by the insured, the first inquiry is whether such term, condition, answer or statement is set out in full on the face or back of the policy and if it is, it must of course be given effect to; but if it is not, the term, condition, answer or statement cannot be regarded as a warranty or a condition precedent. All that remains for the Court, if such term, condition, answer or statement is contained in the proposal or application of the assured, is to determine how far it constituted a misrepresentation which induced the insurer to enter into the contract. The difference is that while the warranty of the existence of a fact must be literally true and it is no answer to say that (the) declaration was made in good faith and in ignorance of its untruth, while promissory warranties must be strictly complied with (C.C. 2490); with respect to representation, it is sufficient if the fact represented be substantially true and there be no material concealment.\nThese are matters for the court to determine, as the statute expressly states, and in each case therefore it becomes largely a question of ascertaining the true meaning and intent of the answers and statements made by the assured, in the light of the special circumstances and context.\nWe should now consider some judgments of this court such as: Arnprior v. United States Fidelity[5]; Railway Passengers Assurance Company v. Standard Lij e[6], London Guarantee & Accident Company v. City of Halifax[7] and Rural Municipality of Victory v. Saskatchewan Guarantee & Fidelity Company[8] to which we have been referred by counsel. Each of these cases turned mainly upon the determination of the scope of the answers or statements of the assured and of their materiality in the assumption of the risks by the assurers.\nThe Corporation of the Town of Arnprior v. The United States Fidelity and Guaranty5 was from the province of Ontario. This court had under consideration section 144 of the Ontario Insurance Act (R.S.O. 1897, c. 203) which was almost verbatim the same as s. 7028 R.S.Q. 1909. The principal point involved appears to have been whether the rule of law contained in the statute was inoperative unless it was itself \u201cembodied by an express stipulation in the insurance policy.\u201d It was held that the Act did not\nrequire the policy to state that any particular representation was material to the contract, its effect being only that no misrepresentation shall avoid the policy unless it is material.\nThere, by the terms of the bond itself, reference was made to the fact of the insured having delivered to the insurance company\na statement in writing setting forth the nature and character of the office or position to which the employee has been elected or appointed, the nature and character of his duties and responsibilities and the safeguards and checks to be used upon the employee in the discharge of the duties of said office or position, and other matters, which statement is made a part thereof. The assured was asked what means were used and would be used to ascertain whether the accounts of a tax collector were correct, the answer was: the \u201cauditors examine the rolls and his vouchers from treasurer yearly.\u201d The auditors never had in fact examined a single collector\u2019s roll and never, in any succeeding year, was such examination made. Upon the evidence and the context of the questions, the majority of the court held that this was a material misrepresentation avoiding the policy.\nSo, in Railway Passengers Assurance v. Standard Life[9], the assured\u2019s answers were held to have been evasive, misleading and so framed as to give the impression that the employee\u2019s accounts were audited monthly, which they were not, and thus they did not \u201crepresent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shows the nature and extent of the risk\u201d within the terms of art. 2485 C.C. The policy itself contained an agreement by the insured whereby the truth of its answers to the questions of the insurer was made the basis of the contract.\nLondon Guarantee & Accident Co. v. City of Halifax[10] was another case of a tax collector. Several points were raised for consideration by the court, but one of them was the complaint of the insurance company respecting certain answers by the city to questions submitted with regard to the proposed guaranty, which answers, along with others, were to be taken as the basis of the contract. Newcombe J., writing for the majority of the court, reviewed the evidence at considerable length and with the greatest care, as a result of which he came to the conclusion that under all the circumstances, the answers complained of, when given a reasonable interpretation, could not be relied on to prevent recovery under the bond.\nIn Municipality of Victory v. Saskatchewan Guarantee Fidelity Company,[11] there was a jury trial. The jury found that the representations made by the assured were true. And, of course, the main inquiry was whether there was evidence on which the jury were entitled to find as they did. The conclusion, unanimously arrived at by the court, was that the verdict on that ground was justified, but this conclusion was reached after full consideration of all the particular circumstances and after viewing the questions and answers as a whole, in the light of their fair and reasonable interpretation.\nIt should be added that, of the four judgments just referred to, only one, Railway Passengers v. Standard Life[12] came under the Quebec Code. When comparing them with the present case, due allowance must be made for the fact that the relevant law was different and that considerations which must bear upon our judgment here could not be made to apply there. In fact these previous decisions are now discussed only because counsel laid stress on their possible bearing in the present case.\nThe Arnprior Case[13] and the Railway Passengers Case12 were decided against the assured. The City of Halifax Case[14] and the Municipality of Victory Case[15], on the contrary, were decided against the insurance company. This seems to indicate that, strictly speaking, no precedent can be found in any of them for the propositions propounded by the appellant. The question whether there was material misrepresentation is obviously one of fact, which the court must determine according to the peculiar features of each case.\nLet us therefore examine the facts and circumstances with which we are confronted. The answers and statements which are made the basis of the appellant\u2019s complaint have already been recited. They are not in the application and the respondent was not the applicant. In the Arnprior Case13, this fact was observed and two at least of the learned judges of this court held that this would preclude the case from being \u201cbrought within the literal terms\u201d of the Ontario statute (which was the same as section 7028 R.S.Q.). We shall assume nevertheless that the document signed by the present respondent could properly be described as part of the \u201cproposal\u201d of the assured within the meaning of the statute.\nThe proof shews that the respondent had retained the services of a chartered accountant of many years\u2019 experience. The books of Cambridge and Cadieux were audited by him monthly. His monthly reports were sent to the board of directors of the respondent in the following form:\nI have audited the books and accounts of your company including the cash vouchers for the operations of the month of * * * and I have found the whole correct. I herewith enclose you the following statements:\n1. Trial balance.\n2. Accounts receivable.\n3. Accounts payable.\nRespectfully submitted,\nYours truly,\n(Signed).\nThen followed the monthly trial balance subscribed with the words: \u201cAudited and verified\u201d and signed by the accountant; and then the list of accounts receivable and payable initialed by him. By every one of these monthly reports the accounts were stated to be correct in every respect, except in a few minor points, which were immediately taken up by the directors and for which satisfactory explanations were promptly given. Not one of the reports gave the slightest indication of any ground for suspicion. In fact, the auditor himself suspected nothing until the discovery made by the directors at their meeting of the 16th January, 1924. As appeared at the trial, the auditing was not all it should have been. In fact, the auditor counted the cash on hand only about once a year. The appellant strongly relies on this and claims that accordingly the undertaking of the company to have Cambridge account monthly for the funds and securities he had on hand was not fulfilled.\nBut, what was the representation made by the respondent? What could the appellant fairly and reasonably understand by the answers the respondent made to its questions, if not that the respondent had engaged the services of a reputable accountant, that this accountant would audit the books of Cambridge and Cadieux monthly, and that, in the course of doing so, he would check the accounts and would be expected to perform all the ordinary duties of an auditor? The appellant was thus informed that the respondent would trust to its auditor for these purposes, and its answers implied nothing more. The appellant did not expect that the directors or the officers of the respondent would check the work of their auditor and would review it to find out whether it had been properly carried out. They had the right to believe that it would be, and to assume that it was. Moreover, as stated by one of the expert accountants heard in this case, a review of the auditor\u2019s work was quite out of the question. It would not be apparent to anybody who looked at the books that they were not correct. This\nwould not appear unless one actually set himself down for an absolute investigation.\nThe insurance company never expected that such investigation would be made. It knew that the respondent, by its answer, meant nothing more than that it undertook to have an auditor, reputed to be competent, and to see that this auditor should make a monthly audit. This representation was fulfilled, and the respondent did its whole duty under its undertaking. The evidence of the experts is that the monthly reports which the directors got from the auditor\nwould imply that the cash had been examined and counted and (that) the cash stated to be found (was) on hand.\nThe words \u201caudited and verified\u201d would be understood to mean that the auditor had checked the cash and\nit would be reasonable, on receiving this report, to think the cash had been checked.\nThe respondent did not undertake to go beyond that; its answers did not mean that it would; nor could the appellant reasonably interpret them as so meaning.\nLikewise, when the respondent represented that Cadieux would account \u201cdaily to the cashier\u201d and that \u201cchecking by the cashier\u201d would be the means of ascertaining whether his accounts were correct, the fair meaning of this representation was that they would have a cashier under whom Cadieux would work and whose duty it would be to check up Cadieux. And so they had. Cambridge, the cashier, had been in their employ and they had known him for quite a while. He was a trusted employee. They had absolute confidence in him and up to that time had had no reason to doubt his fidelity. It would be the ordinary duty of any cashier to check the cash daily. The directors would naturally assume that he was doing his duty and they were entitled to rely upon that. The appellant could not reasonably understand that the answer now being considered meant anything else. The respondent did not guarantee the competency of the auditor nor the fidelity of the cashier. If the insurance company wished to secure such a warranty, under the law of Quebec it was incumbent upon it to have it expressed in the policy. But it may be that, in such a case, it would have found it difficult to get the risks.\nThese considerations apply to the other answers of the respondent and to the certificates for renewals. They do not go further than the information and honest belief of the officer who signed them. It had been indicated to the insurance company that the means to be adopted by the respondent to ascertain whether the accounts were correct would be the examination by the auditor and the checking by the cashier. The auditor was there and never reported anything incorrect; the cashier was there and never reported any irregularity. It was intended that, in its answers and in its statements in the certificates, the respondent should give to the appellant the information which it had from its auditor and from its cashier. Condition no. 7 of the policies stipulated that \u201cthe knowledge of the employer\u201d was that of a director or an officer. The auditor, in this case, did not know any more than what he reported. If Cambridge knew more, he never disclosed it to an officer or a director of the respondent. He was not himself such an officer or director.\nThe insurance company knew that the answers and statements must be based on the information obtained from the auditor and the cashier. They were the only persons who could properly give such information and who were competent to give it. Information from any other employee or officer would not, under ordinary circumstances, be so dependable. In fact, the insurance company really agreed that the information should be obtained from these two men, and it might have had a ground of complaint if the information on which the answers and statements were based had been procured from any other source less likely to be reliable.\nOn the whole, the answers and statements of the respondent, under the relevant law and statute, were not warranties or conditions precedent, but merely representations. These representations, in the light of their fair and reasonable meaning, were substantially true and involved no concealment. The source from which the information conveyed, and which served as a basis for the documents signed by the respondent, would be procured was, or should have been, fully understood by the appellant company, and it must be held to have entered into the contracts and renewals with a complete appreciation of the scope and purport of the answers given and of the statements made by the respondent.\nWe would confirm the judgment of the trial judge unanimously upheld by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foster, Place, Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett and Foster.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery and McMichael.\n[1] (1928) Q.R. 45 K.B. 311.\n[2] [1925] S.C.R. 600.\n[3] (1893) 22 Can.

The warrant of commitment did not show that the value of the goods was under $200, and was, on that ground, attacked as bad on its face, as not showing jurisdiction in the convicting court.\nHeld (Mignault J. dubitante): In not showing such value to be under $200 the warrant of commitment did not fail to show jurisdiction.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., Newcombe and Smith JJ.: Subs. 3 of said s. 217, introduced by amendment in 1925 (c. 39), does not impliedly limit the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than $200. The special jurisdiction conferred by subs. 3 to proceed, alternatively, by indictment, for a more rigorous penalty, where the value is $200 or over, does not, so long as the procedure by indictment is not invoked, detract from the power exerciseable by magistrates under subs. 2, interpreted independently.\nPer Rinfret J.: The warrant recited a conviction of an offence described in terms strictly following those of subs. 1 of s. 217; then subs. 2 enacts that \u201cevery such person\u201d guilty of the offence so described is \u201cliable on summary conviction,\u201d etc. Therefore it could not be said that, on its face, the warrant did not show jurisdiction. It may be that subs. 3 makes the offence indictable when the goods are of the value of $200 or over; but there was nothing in the proceedings before the court or on the face of the commitment to show they had that value; moreover, the presumption is that the jurisdiction was rightly asserted.\nMOTION by way of appeal from the judgment of Lamont J., dismissing an application by the present appellant for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe appellant was convicted before a stipendiary magistrate \u201cfor that he * * * did, in the city of Halifax, on * * * unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit, rum unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid, contrary to the provisions of section 217\u201d of the Customs Act, c. 42, R.S.C. 1927. The conviction was affirmed, on appeal, by the County Court Judge.\nThe warrant of commitment, which recited the conviction in the above terms, was attacked on the ground that it did not show that the value of the goods alleged to have been harboured was under $200, and, therefore, that it was bad on its face, as not showing jurisdiction in the convicting court. It was contended, on appellant\u2019s behalf, that the effect of the enactment, in 1925 (c. 39), of what is now subs. 3 of s. 217, was to make the offence an indictable one where the goods are of the value of $200 or over, and impliedly to limit the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than $200. Rex v. Thompson[1] was cited in support of the motion.\nDuncan MacTavish for the motion.\nJohn F. MacNeill for the Attorney-General of Canada, contra.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. Newcombe and Smith JJ., was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014This motion comes by way of appeal from the judgment of my brother, Lamont, of 23rd November, 1928, dismissing an application by the prisoner for a writ of habeas corpus. The papers shew that the prisoner was convicted before Mr. Cluney, Stipendiary Magistrate of the city of Halifax, on 4th July, 1928, for the offence which will be literally described; and that the conviction was, on 14th November, affirmed on appeal by the County Court Judge for the district. A verified copy of the warrant of commitment dated 27th November, 1928, is produced, and, in it, the conviction is recited as follows:\u2014\nWhereas John Manuel, late of Halifax, in the county of Halifax, was on this day convicted before the undersigned, Judge of the County Court for District No. 1 (acting on appeal by the said John Manuel from a conviction made on the 4th day of July, 1928, before A. Cluney, Stipendiary Magistrate in and for the city of Halifax), for that he, the said John Manuel did, in the city of Halifax, on the 24th day of April, A.D. 1928, unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit, rum unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid, contrary to the provisions of Section 217 of the Customs Act, chapter 42, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and it was thereby adjudged that the said John Manuel for his said offence should forfeit and pay the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars, to be paid and applied according to law, and should pay to the prosecutor the sum of five dollars and fifty cents for his costs in that behalf; and it was thereby further adjudged that if the said several sums were not paid forthwith the said John Manuel should be imprisoned in the city prison of the said city of Halifax in the said city of Halifax, for the term of three months, unless the said several sums and the costs and charges of the commitment and of the conveying of the said John Manuel to the said city prison were sooner paid.\nThe ground of the application is that the commitment is bad upon its face, because it does\u2019 not shew \u201cthat the value of the said goods alleged to have been harboured is under $200.\u201d\nThe most recent revision of the Public Statutes of Canada came into force on 1st February, 1928, although declared by the proclamation to operate by the designation of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. Section 217 of the Customs Act, c. 42, as contained in that revision, is immediately derived from c. 39, s. 2, of 1925, and c. 50. ss. 25 and 26, of 1927.\nThe question arises under subs. 2 of the Act as it appears in the revision designated 1927. That subsection originally formed part of s. 197 of the Customs Act, as enacted by c. 14, s. 38, of 1888, and it was re-enacted in a subsection, as it now stands, by the Revised Statutes of 1906, c. 48, s. 219. In 1925, s. 219 was repealed and at the same time re-enacted with some amendments, including the addition of subs. 3; but there was nothing in any of the earlier Acts corresponding in anywise with subs. 3. Subsection 1 of section 219, as enacted in 1925, in conformity with the repealed section, had made it an offence, knowingly to harbour or conceal goods unlawfully imported into Canada, and had provided that, if such goods were found, they should be seized and forfeited; and that, if not found, the person offending should forfeit the value thereof; and by subss. 2 and 3 it was enacted that\n(2) Every such person shall, in addition to any other penalty, forfeit a sum equal to the value of such goods, which may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and shall further be liable, on summary conviction before two justices of the peace, to a penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and not less than one month, or to both fine and imprisonment.\n(3) Where the goods so harboured, kept, concealed, purchased, sold or exchanged are of the value of two hundred dollars, or over, such person shall be guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years and not less than one year for a first offence, and to a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years and not less than three years for a second and each subsequent offence. These two subsections were not in themselves altered by the amendments of 1927, and are introduced into the revision, in the terms in which they were enacted, by c. 39 of 1925. Subsection 2 has in effect thus been in force for forty years, and, as a separate subsection, since 1906. The amendments by c. 50 of 1927 are immaterial to the question now at issue. It is the interpretation of subsections 2 and 3 of c. 39 of 1925 which is really involved, and the question is, whether the commitment is bad because it is not stated therein that the value of the rum unlawfully imported and harboured by the prisoner was less than $200.\nIt will be perceived that, by subsection 2, the person harbouring the goods is liable, in addition to the penalties previously provided, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding $200, and not less than $50, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and not less than one month, or to both fine and imprisonment. There is, in this subsection itself, no limitation of the magistrates\u2019 jurisdiction to proceed summarily, depending upon the value of the goods. It is, however, provided by the following subsection that, where the value of the goods is $200 or over, the offender shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and liable to the imprisonment therein prescribed; and it is argued that that provision impliedly limits the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than $200.\nI would reject that contention. It is not uncommon practice, in Dominion legislation, to provide that a statutory offence may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment; s. 499 of the Criminal Code is an example; and ss. 127 and 128 of the Excise Act are other examples; there is no inherent objection to such alternative methods of procedure, and another specimen is introduced by the enactments now in question. Subsection 2, in express terms, applies to \u201cevery such person\u201d; that is, to any person who, without lawful excuse, harbours any goods unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid. He is to forfeit a sum equal to the value of the goods, recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction, and is further liable, on summary conviction, to the additional penalties prescribed. I think the intention of Parliament is sufficiently obvious; and that the special jurisdiction conferred by subsection 3 to proceed, alternatively, by indictment, for more rigorous penalties, where the value of the goods is $200 or over, or, in such a case, for first, second or subsequent offences, at the option of the prosecuting authority, does not, so long as the procedure by indictment is not invoked, detract from the power exerciseable by the magistrates under subsection 2, interpreted independently.\nIt is not said, and cannot, I think, be said with any justification, that subsection 3 affects the liability of an offender under subsection 2 to forfeit a sum equal to the value of the goods, if that value be $200 or more; and, if not, why should it affect the offender\u2019s liability to the penalties enforceable by summary proceedings, also imposed by subsection 2? The two subsections appear to be independent and self-contained, and subsection 3 does not, in my opinion, imply or suggest any intention to abridge or affect the operation of subsection 2 as it theretofore existed, and continues to exist. I cannot help thinking that, when, in 1925, Parliament amended the original section, if it were the intention to reduce the well established jurisdiction of the magistrates, apt words would have been used, and that it was not meant to change the law in such an important particular by a far-fetched inference.\nI am fortified in my conclusion by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, pronounced in the case of Rex v. Boutillier[2].\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nMignault J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother Newcombe dismissing the appeal of the prisoner Manuel from the refusal by my brother Lament of a writ of habeas corpus to enquire into the cause of his commitment, which commitment purports to have been made under section 217 (formerly 219) of the Customs Act, chapter 42, R.S.C., 1927.\nI understand that a majority of my learned colleagues concur with my brother Newcombe in rejecting the appeal. I have not been able, however, to free myself from considerable doubt as to the correctness of his decision. Subsection 2 of section 217 (formerly 219), as originally drafted, undoubtedly conferred upon two justices of the peace jurisdiction to try the offence created by subsection 1, without regard to the value of the goods. When, however, Parliament repealed the whole section in 1925 and re-enacted it, a very important provision was inserted in the new section as subsection 3, declaring that when the goods so harboured, etc., are of the value of $200 or over, such person (the person harbouring the goods) shall be guilty of an indictable offence and subject to a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, and not less than one year, for a first offence.\nIt seems clear that in proceedings by indictment, it would be essential to the validity of the indictment that it should set out that the goods are of the value of $200 or over. When this value exists, the statute creates an offence which, as it appears to me, is triable only by indictment. The words \u201cwhere the goods so harboured * * * are of the value of two hundred dollars or over, such person shall be guilty of an indictable offence,\u201d seem to me to exclude any proceedings other than by indictment. I cannot, therefore, in a case coming within the condition of subsection 3, conceive that it should be tried under the summary conviction provisions referred to by subsection 2.\nI do not think that there is any parity between this case and the case contemplated by section 499 of the Criminal Code. Parliament, no doubt, by express enactment, can provide that an offence shall be punishable either on conviction on an indictment, or on summary conviction. Under section 499 the offence and the punishment are the same, whether the one or the other mode of trial is selected. Here, however, where the value of the goods is under $200, the offence is not the same as that contemplated by subsection 3, nor is the punishment the same.\nI am not in favour of dissents in criminal cases coming before this Court by way of appeal, so I merely give expression to the doubt I feel with respect to the decision of the majority of my colleagues.\nRinfret J.\u2014The ground of the application by John Manuel for a writ of habeas corpus was: That the warrant of commitment is bad on its face because it does not shew jurisdiction in the convicting court, inasmuch as the goods unlawfully imported into Canada are not therein alleged to have been valued under $200.\nI think the application was rightly refused by my brother Lamont and the appeal from his judgment ought to be dismissed.\nThe warrant of commitment recites that John Manuel was convicted, first, before a stipendiary magistrate; and then, on appeal, by a judge of the County Court, for that he did\nunlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit: rum unlawfully imported into Canada whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid, contrary to the provisions of section 217 of the Customs Act.\nSubsections 1 and 2 of section 217 of the Customs Act read in part:\u2014\n1. If any person * * * without lawful excuse, * * * harbours * * * any goods unlawfully imported into Canada * * * whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid * * *\n2. Every such person shall * * * be liable, on summary conviction before two justices of the peace, to a penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and not less than one month, or to both fine and imprisonment.\nThe warrant, therefore, recites that Manuel was convicted of an offence which is described in terms strictly following those of subs. 1 of s. 217 of the Act. Then subs. 2 enacts that \u201cevery such person\u201d guilty of the offence so described is \u201cliable on summary conviction, before two justices of the peace,\u201d etc.\nI fail to see how, under those circumstances, it can be said that, on its face, the warrant of commitment does not show jurisdiction in the stipendiary magistrate.\nIt may be that subs. 3 of s. 217 makes the offence indictable when the goods so harboured \u201care of the value of two hundred dollars or over,\u201d but there is nothing in the proceedings before us or on the face of the commitment to shew that the spirits harboured by Manuel had that value. Moreover, the presumption is that the jurisdiction was rightly asserted.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James H. Power.\nSolicitor for the Crown: Rainard H. Scriven.\n[1] (1928) 50 Can. Cr. Cas. 183.\n[2] (1928) 49 Can. Cr. Cas. 312, at p. 314.\n"}

(62 Ont. L.R. 83) which (reversing judgment of Meredith C.J.C.P., 60 Ont. L.R. 476) held that the deceased\u2019s death was not from suicide, but was an accident within the meaning of the insurance policies in question, and that plaintiffs were entitled to recover on the policies. Held: On the facts and circumstances in evidence, and the question being one of probabilities and inferences, as to which an appellate court was in as good position to decide as the trial judge, and having regard to the presumption against suicide, the finding of the Appellate Division that the death was an accident within the meaning of the policies was affirmed; and the appeals were dismissed.\nPer Anglin C.J.C, Mignault and Rinfret JJ.: Under the criminal law of Canada suicide is a crime (Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., vol. 1, p. 618; Blackstone, Commentaries, Lewis\u2019s ed., vol. 4, marg. p. 189; discussion of the point by Riddell J.A., in this case, 62 Ont. L.R. 83; Cr. Code, ss.10, 269, 270, referred to). Moreover, in this case, the contention of suicide was coupled with the suggestion that deceased planned to give his death an appearance of death by accident, to enable recovery of insurance moneys, thus committing a fraud, and such fraud would be a crime. Before crime can be held to be established, there is required proof of a more cogent character than in ordinary cases where crime is not imputed; and it is a rule, although it may not be so strict in civil cases as in criminal, that when a right or defence rests upon the suggestion that conduct is criminal or quasi-criminal, the court should be satisfied not only that the circumstances proved are consistent with the commission of the suggested act, but that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the evil act was in fact committed (Rule as stated by Middleton J.A. in this case, 62 Ont. L.R. 83, at p. 93, adopted).\nThe regard to be paid to evidence of existence of motive to commit suicide discussed; reference to Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Ins. Co., [1919] A.C., 254, at p. 259. (That case distinguished on the facts.) It was held that here the evidence did not establish such an impelling motive as would warrant the assumption that deceased contemplated taking his life, if, indeed, proof of motive, however potent, can, without more, ever justify such an inference.\nS. 179 of the Ontario Insurance Act, 1924, c. 50, notwithstanding its collocation, is applicable to every contract of accident insurance, including contracts, such as were here in question, where there is insurance in the event of death generally, irrespective of its cause, and also further insurance made payable only when the death results from an accident; this second species of insurance is a \u201ccontract of accident insurance\u201d to which s. 179 applies.\nHeld, further, that the deceased\u2019s death, which was caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, through his having started his motor engine in his garage, happened \u201cwithout the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act\u201d within the reasonable intendment of those words in said s. 179; further, that his death was the result of \u201cbodily injury effected solely through external, violent and accidental means\u201d within the terms of policies in question; also, that an autopsy had revealed \u201cinternal injuries,\u201d within the terms of a policy in question, when the internal tissues, and the blood, were found to have the cherry red colour characteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning. APPEALS by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1].\nThe actions were to recover upon certain insurance policies upon the life of one Moore. They were tried together (along with another action not now in question) and were dismised by Meredith, C.J.C.P.[2], whose judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division1, which held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover.\nThe appeals were argued at the same time, and are dealt with together, the main question of fact being the same in each, namely, did Moore die by his own act, or was his death a death by accident within the meaning of the policies? The material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Mignault J. now reported. The appeals were dismissed with costs.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and S.E. Weir for the appellant The London Life Insurance Company.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and G.W. Mason K.C. for the appellant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.\nG.W. Mason K.C. for the appellant Aetna Life Insurance Company.\nW. Lawr for the respondent the Trustee of the property of the Lang Shirt Co. Ltd.\nG. Grant K.C. and V.H. Hattin for the respondent Moore.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C., Mignault and Rinfret JJ., was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014These three cases were tried together. In each of them the action is based on an insurance policy on the life of William Raymond Moore, the husband of Margaret Elizabeth Moore, who, in two of these cases, is the plaintiff; and is here a respondent. The other action is on behalf of the trustee in bankruptcy of the property of the Lang Shirt Company, Limited, of which William Raymond Moore was president and managing director. By the judgments of the Second Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario[3], reversing (Latchford C.J., dissenting) the judgments at the trial of Meredith C.J.C.P.[4], the trustee of the Lang Shirt Company, Limited, recovered $26,311.64 against The London Life Insurance Company, and Mrs. Moore recovered $5,294.52 against the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and $10,924.54 against the Aetna Life Insurance Company. The three insurance companies appeal from these judgments. There was also an action by Mrs. Moore against the London Life Insurance Company, tried at the same time and dismissed by the learned trial judge. Mrs. Moore appealed from this judgment but she subsequently abandoned her appeal. This fourth action is therefore not in question in these proceedings, and need not be further mentioned.\nThe three appeals were argued at the same time, and will be dealt with together, the main question of fact being the same in each, to wit: did William Raymond Moore die by his own act, or was his death a death by accident within the meaning of the insurance policies? It will be convenient to state at once the nature of the contract of insurance in each case.\nThe policy of the London Insurance Company, dated the 2nd of February, 1924, on the life of W.R. Moore, issued by that company in favour of the Lang Shirt Company, Limited, as beneficiary, was for $25,000, payable if the insured died before the expiration of seven years from \u201cthe policy year date,\u201d defined to be the 2nd of February, 1924. Its seventh condition was as follows:\u2014\n7. Suicide. In case the insured shall die within two years from the date when this policy is signed and sealed, by his own act, whether sane or insane, this policy shall be void and the company shall not be liable thereunder.\nThe policy of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, dated the 9th of August, 1920, was issued by that company on the life of Moore, in favour of his wife, the respondent, as beneficiary, for $5,000, payable on the death of the insured. By a clause of the policy, in consideration of an additional premium of $6.25, the company promised to pay the beneficiary, on the receipt of due proof of the death of the insured \u201cas the result of bodily injury effected solely as described below,\u201d a further sum equal to the amount of assurance, on the following conditions:\u2014\nConditions: The indemnity provided for herein shall be payable only if the death of the insured result in consequence of bodily injury effected solely through external, violent and accidental means, within sixty days after such injury, independently and exclusively of all other causes. This indemnity shall not be payable if the death of the insured results directly or indirectly from disease or from bodily or mental infirmity, or from self-destruction whether sane or insane, or from bodily injury received while the insured is engaged in military or naval service in time of war, or in aeronautic or submarine operations, nor if such death occur in time of war as a direct or indirect result of travel on the high seas or residence or travel in any war zone outside the continental limits of the United States or the Dominion of Canada, or while engaged in Red Cross or other Relief Service in the territory last described.\nThe company paid the $5,000 of insurance on the life of Moore, but disputes its liability to pay an equal amount under the clause just quoted, its contention being that Moore\u2019s death was not accidental within the meaning of this clause, but was a death by suicide.\nThe policy of the Aetna Life Insurance Company, dated the 6th of November, 1920, was for $5,000, payable on the death of Moore to Mrs. Moore as beneficiary. The policy contained a clause whereby the company undertook to pay a further amount of $5,000 on the death of the insured if\nsuch death results directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries effected solely through external, violent and accidental means within ninety days from the occurrence of such accident, and if such accident is evidenced by a visible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body (except in case of drowning and internal injuries revealed by an autopsy), and if such death does not result from suicide, while sane or insane, nor from military or naval service in time of war, nor from an aeronautic flight or submarine descent, nor directly or indirectly from disease in any form.\nAll these policies are governed by the law of Ontario.\nMoore was found dead in his garage at Kitchener, at about 8.40 p.m., on the 17th of December, 1925. It is not disputed that his death was the result of carbon monoxide poisoning. It will be necessary, however, to state in some detail the surrounding circumstances, in order to make clear whether his death should be held to have been accidental, or, as the appellants contend, a death by suicide.\nMoore had arrived in Kitchener that day at about noon, returning from a business trip to Ottawa. One of his friends, Isaac Hertel, met him on the street shortly after his arrival, and arranged to have a game of bridge with him that evening. Moore walked to his house and had dinner with his wife and children. After dinner, Moore and his wife went into the living room and busied themselves tying up several parcels, Christmas presents, to be sent to the United States. At about 2 p.m. he telephoned to his fac- tory enquiring whether a certain person had called for him, and stating that he would be there about three o\u2019clock. Moore then told his wife that he would take the car, because he was going uptown first, uptown being in the opposite direction from the factory. During the previous week Moore had been out in the car with his wife, and had stopped to try to repair the chain on the right rear tire, some part of which was loose and striking the mudguard. He did not succeed in fixing it at that time, and remarked to his wife that if he had a hammer he could repair it because it was nothing serious.\nAt about 2.20 p.m., Moore went to the kitchen door to go to the garage, but came back and told his wife that he was going to fix the chain. He then had on his overcoat. He went to the cellar door where the hammer was kept. His wife did not see him after that, and assumed that he had gone to the garage.\nThis garage is a wooden structure to the right hand side of the house, but further back, and on the opposite side to the kitchen. A roadway from the street leads up to it. It measures 201\/2 feet in length by 141\/2 feet in width, these being outside measurements. There are four windows, two on the left side, and two in the rear wall. In front are two large doors opening to the outside, and in the left wall a smaller door near the large doors.\nAfter Moore left his house saying he was going to fix the chain, no one saw him alive. The day was windy, but there is no evidence that it was also cold, and about three o\u2019clock, one Albert Steffer, a driver for a bakery, came to the house and delivered bread there. He says that he saw the side door of the garage open about a foot and swinging in the wind. From where he was he could not see the large front doors. He also heard the car (the engine) going, and says he could hear a knock inside which sounded like a tool in use. The learned Chief Justice of the Second Appellate Division discredited this testimony, but nothing appears to show that the learned trial judge rejected it.\nAt 7.15 p.m. Hertel, who had arranged to have a game of bridge that evening with Moore, called at the house. Moore was not there, and Hertel came back, he says, about 8.35 p.m. At that time Mrs. Moore was anxious about her husband, and had telephoned to the factory to find out if he was there. As a result of what she told Hertel, the latter went out to the garage and entered by the side door; he cannot say whether it was closed or not, but remembers that it was not locked or hooked. He found the motor car running fairly slowly, and the first thing he did was to turn on the headlights of the car and then to stop the engine. The car was facing inwards. After turning on the lights, Hertel looked for Moore, called his name, and receiving no answer, walked round to the back of the car, and in so doing he struck Moore\u2019s feet. Moore was lying on the floor of the garage cross-wise, at the rear of the car, and between it and the front doors of the garage, his head on a cushion near the rear right wheel, which cushion was used in the car. There was a hammer near him, and towards the side wall of the garage there was an iron spade. Moore\u2019s hat lay in a child\u2019s express wagon near the back wheel. Hertel felt Moore\u2019s heart and found the body warm. He pushed open the front doors of the garage, dragged Moore\u2019s body out, and with Mrs. Moore\u2019s assistance carried it into the house.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Appellate Court, in his dissenting judgment, says:\u2014\nIt is certain that the large doors of the garage were closed and that they remained closed until opened by Hertel about 8.40 in the evening. The small side door, it is equally certain, was also closed when Hertel entered by it.\nWith respect, there is no certainty on the point whether the front doors were closed when, or immediately after, Moore went into the garage. Moore may have opened them before attempting to work on the broken chain, as the respondents suggest, and they may have been later closed by the wind. The only testimony on this point is that of Hertel, who merely says that he \u201cpushed open\u201d these doors, which apparently were not fastened. And, with regard to the side door, there is certainly nothing to show that it was closed when Hertel went into the garage.\nMoore was undoubtedly dead when he was brought into the house; but, as the body was still warm, the doctors and other people who were called in worked over it and tried in vain to induce artificial respiration. According to the medical testimony, Moore\u2019s body was cherry red, an indication of carbon monoxide poisoning. The way carbon monoxide operates, when inhaled, is thus described. It is absorbed by the haemoglobin of the blood, and the oxygen of the air is excluded, thus bringing about what Dr. Crowley calls a chemical change in the blood, and causing asphyxiation or suffocation. An autopsy was subsequently performed on Moore, and the tissues inside the body were likewise found to have this characteristic cherry red colour diffusely distributed all over the body, the blood being also cherry red. The first and practically immediate effect of the carbon monoxide gas, when inhaled, is to produce a semiconscious condition. The person who has inhaled it is unable to make an effort to escape, the muscles lose their power to act, and death ensues sooner or later.\nNone of the physicians who were called could say even approximately how long Moore had been dead when his body was discovered. The warmth of the body is not a dependable indication, for sometimes it persists for hours after death. In this case the fumes may have produced almost immediately a state of unconsciousness, yet death may not have supervened for some time. Dr. Powell, one of the physicians called, speaks of a case which came under his personal observation where his man went into the garage and started the engine, and this man, within three minutes, was rendered unconscious, although one of the doors of the garage was open.\nIn all these circumstances, I have been unable to discover anything which is inconsistent with the conclusion of the appellate court that Moore\u2019s death was accidental. It is said that Moore was aware of the danger of inhaling carbon monoxide gas. Most men are in a general way, but, nevertheless, it is common knowledge that accidental deaths are not infrequently caused by exposure to this gas. The appellants ask why Moore started his engine. But this was the obvious thing to do, unless he jacked up the car, if he wished to move the wheel so as to get at the broken part of the chain. The appellants also claim that unless the large front doors were opened, there would not be sufficient light to work in the right hand corner of the garage, but one of the photographs seems to show enough light with the front doors closed and the side door open; and, as already pointed out, there is nothing to show that the front doors were not open when Moore lay down to work at the broken chain, as the plaintiffs suggest he did. That these doors were then closed is a mere conjecture. Then stress is laid on Moore\u2019s position in the rear of the car, with his head on the cushion, but it is well known that that is a convenient position for a workman to take to repair a part of car which is not otherwise readily accessible. It may be objected that these are mere surmises, but they are less conjectural than is the supposition that Moore deliberately planned to commit suicide by inhaling the fumes of the engine.\nIt will now be convenient to consider the rules of evidence applicable to a case such as that at bar.\nWith all deference, I think that there can be no doubt that, according to our criminal law, suicide is a crime, although the learned trial judge thought otherwise. It is obvious, of course, that there can be no punishment under modern law when suicide is successful, except with regard to abettors of the crime, and it is clearly not \u201chomicide\u201d within the Criminal Code (s. 250). But it is an indictable offence to aid or abet a person in committing suicide (s. 269. Crim. Code); it is also an indictable offence to attempt to commit suicide (s. 270 Crim. Code), and I am unable to follow the contention urged upon us by the appellants that where the criminal attempt is successful there is no crime. At common law it seems clear that self-murder, felo de se, is a crime (Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., vol. 1, p. 618). Speaking of suicide, Blackstone, Commentaries, says:\u2014\nThe law has therefore ranked this among the highest crimes, making it a peculiar species of felony, a felony committed on one\u2019s self (Lewis\u2019s Edition, vol. 4, marginal page 189).\nI do not think the point requires elaboration, but, if I may, I would like to refer to the discussion of it by Riddell J.A., in the court below. See also s. 10 of the Criminal Code.\nMoreover, the contention that Moore committed suicide is coupled with the suggestion that not only did he do so, but that he deliberately planned to give to his alleged self-inflicted death the appearance of a death by accident, in order that his wife and family, and not only these persons so closely connected with him, but also the Lang Shirt Company, might recover his insurance, thus committing a fraud against the appellants that could be described by no other term than that of crime.\nThat there is, in the law of evidence, a legal presumption against the imputation of crime, requiring, before crime can be held to be established, proof of a more cogent character than in ordinary cases where no such imputation is made, does not appear to admit of doubt. In criminal cases this rule is often expressed by saying that the crime imputed must be proved to the exclusion of reasonable doubt. There is authority for the proposition that the same presumption of innocence from crime should be applied with equal strictness in civil as well as in criminal cases (Taylor, Evidence, 11th ed., vol. 1, par. 112, and cases referred to). Whether or not, however, the cogency of the presumption is as great in civil matters as in criminal law (a point not necessarily involved here), I would like to adopt the statement of the rule by Middleton J.A., in the court below, which appears entirely sound:\u2014\n* * * While the rule is not so strict in civil cases as in criminal, I think that when a right or defence rests upon the suggestion that conduct is criminal or quasi-criminal, the Court should be satisfied not only that the circumstances proved are consistent with the commission of the suggested act, but that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the evil act was in fact committed. See Alderson, B., in Rex v. Hodge[5].\nI would also refer to the authorities cited by Riddell J.A., in the court below, dealing with the presumption against suicide.\nI am, clearly, of the opinion that, taking into consideration all the circumstances of Moore\u2019s death, it cannot be said that the facts proved are inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that he committed suicide. They are, as has been already said, entirely consistent with the conclusion that Moore\u2019s death was accidental, and, on the evidence relating to the attendant circumstances, giving due weight to the presumption against criminal intent, it must be held to have been accidental.\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the finding of the learned trial judge to the contrary is based upon inferences drawn by him from the facts in evidence. We are therefore at liberty, as was the Judicial Committee in Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Insurance Co.[6], to substitute our findings of fact for those of the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, the more so since the appellate court has set aside the latter findings. There remains to be considered the argument addressed to us on the question of motive, the contention of the appellant being that if the facts in evidence are consistent either with an accidental or a self-inflicted death, the existence of an impelling motive for self-destruction would justify the court in coming to the conclusion that Moore\u2019s death was a death by suicide.\nBut it must be observed that, as stated by Lord Dunedin, in rendering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Dominion Trust Company v. New York Life Insurance Co.[7]\nMotive, however, can never be of itself sufficient. The utmost that it can do is to destroy or attenuate the inference drawn from the experience of mankind that self-destruction, being contrary to human instincts, is unlikely to have occurred. The proof of suicide must be sought in the circumstances of the death.\nThis rule was laid down in that case, although Lord Dunedin was there of the opinion that \u201cif ever there can be said to be motive for self-destruction, such motive was present in this case.\u201d The Judicial Committee, it is true, found on the facts that suicide had been proved in the Dominion Trust Company\u2019s case6, but it was vastly different from the case now under consideration.\nI have very carefully read the evidence on which the appellants rely as establishing a motive for self-destruction. It may be granted that Moore\u2019s financial position, when he returned to Kitchener after his trip to Ottawa, was quite precarious. When he became president and manager of the Lang Shirt Company, Moore had purchased the stock, or a large portion of the stock, of Lang, the founder and practically the owner of the company. In order to pay for this stock he had drawn on the company\u2019s funds by cheques signed by himself as manager, counter-signed by one Oliver Moyer, the accountant and book-keeper of the company, and cashed by the bankers of the concern, the amount outstanding on such cheques being about $19,000. These cheques or drawings were entered in what was termed a \u201csuspense account\u201d and also, as Moore himself told the auditor, Walter Berner, in the sales or accounts receivable ledger. The company\u2019s financial position was not at the time good and, about the time of Moore\u2019s Ottawa trip, the directors, with Moore\u2019s full consent, had arranged to have an audit made of its affairs, and Berner, the auditor, was engaged on this audit when Moore returned from Ottawa.\nA short time before, an inventory of the company\u2019s stock-in-trade had been taken, and the sheets containing the inventory went to the company\u2019s office in the usual course. Summaries or extensions of these sheets were made out in the office and on them Moore or Moyer inserted the prices. Moyer says that after this was done, some alterations were made in the quantities marked on the extensions, by inserting a figure before or after the amount carried into the extension sheets, the effect being to indicate a larger stock-in-trade than really existed, to a value, the auditor says, of $11,800 in material and manufacturing cost. No witness says that Moore himself made these alterations, but the appellants rely on the circumstance that when on his return from Ottawa Moore telephoned to his office, as above stated, Moyer says he told him that the auditors had discovered that some figures had been changed in the inventory sheets, and Moore replied that \u201che guessed they would have it in for him.\u201d\nMoore\u2019s house in Kitchener, which had cost originally $4,900, was mortgaged for $8,000. Outside of his interest in the Lang Shirt Company, he had no property, and the balance of his private bank account at his death was $12.42. The motor car was the property of his wife.\nReverting again to the financial position, the Lang Shirt Company is now established to have been insolvent, its assets, outside of the insurance policy sued on, having yielded only 25 cents on the dollar to its creditors. Moore was endeavouring at the time to raise money by disposing of some of his shares, and he had taken up the matter with Mr. A.A. Fournier, the proprietor of a departmental store in Ottawa. Fournier had invented a reversible shirt cuff, and had granted to the Lang Shirt Company a license for its manufacture. It was to him that Moore had applied, trying to get him to take shares held by him (Moore) in the Lang Company, and the object of his trip to Ottawa, in December, 1925, was to discuss that matter with Fournier. The trip was not immediately successful from this point of view, and Moore so told Hertel on his arrival, but Moore stated to Hertel that he hoped that Fournier would take an interest in the company in January. From Fournier\u2019s testimony it does appear that he had given Moore some sort of hope that after the Christmas season he would do this, although he says that if Moore had been able to read between the lines, he would have seen that such financial assistance from him was unlikely. But Moore was apparently hopeful that Fournier would take some of his shares, and in this connection we are told that Moore was of an optimistic, energetic and even enthusiastic disposition. He was still a comparatively young man, forty-one years of age, and in perfect health. Mr. George B. McKay, called by the appellants, and manager of the Bank of Toronto at Kitchener, where both Moore and the Lang Company had their bank accounts, was well acquainted with Moore and his business affairs, and he says in cross-examination:\u2014\nQ. Moore was energetic, always working, and on the job? A. Yes.\nQ. He realized it was an uphill road? A. Yes, he did.\nQ. But he was determined to see it through? A. Yes.\nQ. And you had confidence he would do that? A. Yes.\nThere is still another matter that should be mentioned here bearing on this question of motive. At the time of Moore\u2019s return from Ottawa, two representatives of creditors of the Lang Company for large amounts were anxious to see Moore. They were Mr. Rose of the Wabasso Company and Mr. Lilley, who represented an English company. Much stress is laid by the appellants on the assumed fact that Moore, expecting to be dunned by Rose and Lilley in connection with the indebtedness of the Lang Shirt Company, had endeavoured to avoid meeting them. But both these gentlemen were called in rebuttal, and each said that the object of his visit was not to demand payment, but to try to sell more goods to Moore. The learned Chief Justice of the appellate court states that Moore, who had been asked, on the 17th of December, to telephone to Lilley and make an appointment with him, did not do so, as \u201cthere was perhaps no person whom he wished less to talk to or see.\u201d But Lilley says that Moore did telephone to him and made an appointment with him to see him the next day, the 18th. And Lilley adds: \u201cWe had every confidence in him (Moore) and so did our office in Manchester.\u201d\nThere was, further, a question at the trial of a small draft drawn by Lilley on the Lang Company, payment of which, on the instructions of Mr. Clement, the vice-president, had been refused. But Mr. Lilley states that it was not on account of the return of this draft that he desired to see Moore in Kitchener. He adds: \u201cThat didn\u2019t worry us.\u201d\nThere are other matters referred to in the evidence, among them that Moore telephoned from Ottawa to Moyer asking how the auditors were getting on, which I mention merely to show that I have not overlooked it, since, in my opinion, it has no significance.\nI think I have stated everything in any way material which has been relied on as showing that Moore had a motive to commit suicide, but I am unable to come to the conclusion that there was here such an impelling motive as would warrant the assumption that Moore ever contemplated taking his life, if, indeed, proof of motive, however potent, can, without more, ever justify such an inference. I cannot help thinking that there has been some exaggeration in this part of the appellants\u2019 case.\nThere remains the contention of the appellants, that Moore\u2019s death, assuming it not to have been suicidal, was not a death by accident within the terms of the policies sued on. This contention is not open to the London Life Insurance Company in the suit brought against it by the trustee of the Lang Shirt Company, because the policy issued by the London Company was an insurance on the life of Moore for a period of seven years irrespective of the cause of death, but with an exclusion of liability in case of suicide within two years. On the other hand, the policies of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and of the Aetna Life Insurance Company contain contracts of insurance on the life of Moore in the event of his death by accident as therein described. It is therefore open to these two latter companies to raise this point, and the question is whether Moore died as a result of \u201cbodily injury effected solely through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d\nThe material clauses of each policy need not be repeated. The governing statute is The Ontario Insurance Act, 1924, 14 Geo. V, c. 50.\nThe clause relied on by the learned judges of the appellate court as applicable to these policies is section 179, which is as follows:\u2014\n179. In every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act, and no term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso of the contract, varying the obligation or liability of the insurer shall, as against the insured, have any force or validity, but the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy.\nMr. Hellmuth, on behalf of the appellants, contended that this section, being found in Part VII of The Insurance Act, which is a group of sections under the title of \u201cAccident and Sickness Insurance,\u201d does not apply to contracts like those under consideration. He also referred to section 180, his argument being that if this were really accident insurance, the conditions therein mentioned would, in each case, govern the contract, and these conditions, he argued, are inconsistent with a life insurance contract.\nSection 179 must be read with section 2, paragraph 1, which defines \u201caccident insurance\u201d as insurance against loss from \u201caccident\u201d to the person of the insured; and section 179 should itself be regarded as a definition of \u201cthe event insured against,\u201d namely, injury occasioned by \u201caccident.\u201d I can see no reason why, in a life insurance policy, there may not be, on the one hand, insurance in the event of death generally, and irrespective of the cause of death, and, on the other hand, further insurance made payable only when the death results from an accident. Under both clauses, death is the event insured against, but, under the second clause, the death must be accidental.\nThis second species of insurance is certainly a \u201ccontract of accident insurance,\u201d for it is an insurance against death by accident, although it may differ from the usual accident insurance, some of the benefits of which are payable although the person insured does not die from the effects of the accident.\nI think we may look on section 179, notwithstanding its collocation, as a provision applicable to every contract of accident insurance, for there can be no doubt that \u201caccident insurance,\u201d properly so called, may be restricted to the case of an accident causing death. The object of the Legislature was unquestionably to put an end to the controversies that had arisen with regard to the meaning of the word \u201caccident,\u201d and it is noticeable that most statutes dealing with accidents, such as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, contain definitions of this term. But on the assumption that section 179 applies, Mr. Hellmuth argued that Moore\u2019s death cannot be said to have happened \u201cwithout the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act.\u201d Everyone, he contended, must be held to have intended the natural result of his acts, and, consequently, when Moore started his engine, knowing of the danger of inhaling carbon monoxide gas, he must be deemed to have intended the natural result, namely, his death by what has been called, perhaps loosely, poisoning by carbon monoxide gas.\nI think, however, that the case now under consideration comes within the reasonable intendment of the words \u201cwithout the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act.\u201d If Moore\u2019s death was caused by \u201cthe direct intent of the person injured,\u201d it would be a case of suicide. I cannot look on it as being other than \u201cthe indirect result\u201d of an intentional act of Moore\u2019s in starting his engine before attempting to repair the broken chain. His death resulted from what I may call a concurrence of circumstances entirely fortuitous as far as the evidence indicates; and I know of no word that can better describe it than the word \u201caccident.\u201d Indeed to give effect to the contention submitted would render recovery impossible in most cases of accident insurance.\nMr. Hellmuth cited the case of In re Scarr and General Accident Assurance Corpn[8]. I have carefully considered it but it appears to me to be an entirely different case.\nAssuming however, that, as contended by Mr. Hellmuth, the scope of section 179 is so restricted by the introductory section (177) of Part VII of The Insurance Act that it cannot be applied to these policies, I think the circumstances of Moore\u2019s death come well within the conditions of the contracts of insurance. The descriptive words common to each policy are \u201cexternal, violent, and accidental means.\u201d We have seen that Moore\u2019s death was \u201caccidental.\u201d The means that caused death were both \u201cexternal\u201d as opposed to \u201cinternal,\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d since the inhalation of the carbon monoxide gas produced suffocation or asphyxiation. The learned trial judge said, although he would himself have thought otherwise, that the decided cases seemed to require him to hold that the taking in of the poisonous gas was an external means, and that the disturbances by it of the respiratory functions, internally, of the man, were violent means, within the meaning of the words \u201cexternal, violent and accidental means\u201d employed by the parties to the contracts in question.\nSpecial reference at the argument was made to the additional condition of the policy of the Aetna Company \u201cand if such accident is evidenced by a visible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body (except in case of drowning and internal injuries revealed by autopsy).\u201d There was an autopsy here and it certainly revealed internal injuries, to wit, the condition of the internal tissues and of the blood to which I have already referred.\nI think the respondents have shewn that Moore\u2019s death was accidental within the meaning of the policies in suit. I would, accordingly, dismiss the three appeals with costs.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014This case depends upon the circumstantial evidence of the manner in which the assured met his death, and my difficulty is to find a reasonable inference which points to a cause other than his own act. The plaintiff\u2019s theory, as the case is put, is, to my mind, scarcely consistent with accident; but, in fact, the man may not have attempted to repair the chain, nor deliberately have put himself in the fatal position. He may have been stricken very suddenly in the course of his preparations, and guilty of nothing worse than negligence in starting his engine before opening the doors of the garage; or the cushion may have been left on the ground by the children, who were accustomed to play with it. Strange things are apt to happen. The question is one of probabilities and inferences, and the Appellate Division was as well qualified to weigh and determine these as the learned trial judge. There is a presumption of law against suicide; and, after most careful and anxious consideration of the whole case, I am not satisfied to reverse the standing judgment.\nSMITH J.\u2014Viewing all the circumstances in connection with the death of the assured in this case, I have found myself in considerable doubt as to the correct finding of fact. Viewing these circumstances independently of motive, the act of the deceased in proceeding to make repairs to one of the chains of the rear wheel of his automobile with the engine running and the doors closed, so as not only to shut out light from the place where the repair was to be made, but to confine the poisonous gases escaping from the exhaust within the small garage, points strongly towards a design to commit suicide, assuming that the deceased was quite aware of the deadly effect of these gases.\nThe inference, however, to be drawn from these circumstances has been considerably weakened by the close analysis of the evidence made by my brother Mignault. The evidence does not disclose anything beyond a general knowledge by the deceased that these gases were poisonous. The side door, by which the deceased is supposed to have entered the garage, was apparently flapping in the wind, and therefore admitting a draught of air which of itself might be expected to dilute the gases, and which deceased might be expected to close, if he had a design to commit suicide, in order to make the fumes more effective. The larger double doors were not shown to have been fastened, and, according to the witness, he simply pushed them open; and it is argued that therefore these doors may in fact have been open, and have been closed by the wind.\nThe evidence further shows that one of the windows threw light upon the particular place at which the repairs were to be made, although that light would necessarily be very much dimmer than the light that the open door would have supplied.\nWhile, as stated, I find it difficult to remove doubts from my mind, in view of the fact that the burden is upon those who allege suicide to establish it, I am not prepared to dissent, on the mere question of balance of probability, from the judgment of the Appellate Division and the conclusion of the other members of this Court.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant The London Life Insurance Company: Jeffery, Weir, McElheran & Moorhouse.\nSolicitors for the appellants Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Aetna Life Insurance Company: Donald, Mason, White & Foulds.\nSolicitors for the respondent trustee: Aylesworth, Wright, Thompson & Lawr.\nSolicitors for the respondent Moore: Clement, Hattin & Company.\n[1] (1928) 62 Ont.

The appellant company had also a license to prospect for phosphate on the same lands and employed two brothers, John and Robert Ewan, as members of one of their prospecting parties. Prior to May, 1926, the Ewan brothers were each receiving a wage of five dollars for an eight hour day and were paying the appellant one dollar per day for their meals. In May, 1926, they became dissatisfied with the boarding arrangements at the appellant's camp and at their request they were permitted to \" board themselves.\" On June 4, they were directed to work at a certain place about three miles distant from the camp; and, on arriving there, they pitched their tent and built a small fire-place, in which, each morning and evening, they kindled a fire to cook their food. On June 7, an engineer of the company directed the Ewan brothers to commence work the next morning at a trench two thousand feet further on. On the morning of June 8, about 6.15 a.m., John Ewan kindled a fire to boil the breakfast coffee; and then he and his brother, after pouring water over the fire, left the place. Some time between ten o'clock and noon, smoke was observed in the vicinity of the place where the Ewan's tent had stood; and, before any one could reach the spot, fire overran the lands on which the respondents had the licence to cut timber and burned not only the standing timber but also a quantity of posts and poles. The respondents brought this action to recover damages.\nHeld that the appellant cannot be held liable on the ground that the Ewan brothers were acting in the course of their employment when they lighted the fire which escaped and did damage to the respondent's property, it having been shown that the lighting of that fire was an act which they were under no contractual obligation to perform as a duty to their employer, or which their employer had ordered them to do. Although their contract with the appellant called upon them to board themselves, this did not constitute a contractual obligation on their part as a duty to the appellant to cook their meals. In cooking their food, these employees were doing something for themselves rather than discharging a duty towards the appellant. Held, also, that the appellant was not liable (under the rule laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher (L.R. 3 H.L. 330) ), because, although it was by virtue of its licence an occupier of the land from which the fire escaped, that escape was due not to any act or negligence of the appellant or anyone under its control, but was due to the negligence of the Ewan brothers at a time when their negligence must be deemed the negligence of a stranger.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1928] W.W.R. 578) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison J., and maintaining the respondents' action in damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and A. G. Cameron for the appellant.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. and A. I. Fisher K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014The first question in this appeal is: Were the appellant's workmen, John and Robert Ewan, acting in the course of their employment when, on the morning of June 8, 1926, they kindled a fire which escaped and destroyed the respondents' property.\nThe material facts are: The respondents had a license to cut timber on certain lands in British Columbia covered by timber license 141, and the appellant had a license to prospect for phosphate on the same lands. John and Robert Ewan were employed by the appellant and were members of one of their prospecting parties. Prior to May, 1926, according to the terms of their employment, the Ewan brothers were each receiving a wage of five dollars for an eight hour day, and were paying the appellant one dollar per day for their meals. In May, 1926, they became dissatisfied with the camp arrangements and asked Burgess, one of the engineers in charge, if they might work by themselves. As the Ewans were good men and the appellant desired to keep them in its employ, Burgess agreed to their request. It was arranged that instead of taking their meals in the appellant's dining tent, they would thereafter board themselves. To assist them the appellant loaned them a tent, a pot and a frying pan. Although they had a right to obtain their food from any person from whom they could buy it, these workmen made an arrangement with the appellant, which purchased its supplies wholesale, to supply them with the provisions they required for 50 cents a day each. By cooking their own meals the Ewans were thus saving 50 cents a day. At this time the prospecting party was working in the vicinity of Lizzard Creek, at which place the camp was situated. On June 4, Burgess directed the Ewan brothers to go to trench 50, some two or three miles distant, and cut a trail along it. This trench was located between Bean Creek and Hartley Creek. On arriving there the Ewans made their camp and pitched their tent close to Bean Creek. They built a small fire-place in which each morning and evening they kindled a fire to boil their coffee and fry their bacon. On June 7, Telfer, another engineer, went to the Ewans' camp and directed them to commence work next day on trench 49 on Baldry Creek, which was about two thousand feet distant from trench 50. On the morning of June 8, about 6.15 a.m., John Ewan kindled a fire in the fire-place and boiled the breakfast coffee. After breakfast, he says, he and his brother extinguished the fire by pouring water over it. They then went to trench 49 taking with them their tent and a portion of their camp equipment. Some time between ten o'clock and noon smoke was observed in the vicinity of the place where the Ewans' tent had stood. Before anyone reached the spot a fire had got under way and, fanned by a strong wind, overran the lands on which the respondents had a license to cut timber and burned not only the standing timber but also a quantity of posts and poles belonging to the respondents. To recover damages for the loss they suffered on account of this fire, the respondents brought this action. In their statement of claim they allege that the fire was caused by the negligence of the appellant's workmen in the course of their employment, or alternatively, that the appellant's workmen set out a fire on the appellant's property in the midst of inflammable material and did not totally extinguish it but allowed it to spread and damage the respondents' property. To this claim the appellant set up two defences: first, that the fire in question was not kindled by its workmen and, secondly, that if it was, its workmen, in so kindling it, were not acting in the course of their employment.\nThe trial judge found in favour of the respondents, holding that the fire which destroyed the respondents' property had its origin in the fire kindled by the Ewan brothers for the purpose of cooking their meals, and that at the time it was so kindled they were acting in the course of their employment. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (McPhillips J.A., dissenting). The defendant now appeals to this court.\nKnowing the jurisprudence of this court to be against interference with the concurrent findings of two courts on a pure question of fact unless satisfied that the conclusion reached was clearly wrong, Mr. W. N. Tilley, K.C., who appeared for the appellant, confined his argument to the question of agency.\nThe Ewans were employed to cut trails and strip phosphate veins with tools provided by the appellant, for eight hours a day. For this they were to receive a daily wage of $5. The usual time for commencing work was eight o'clock in the morning. Having, by the terms of their employment, to board themselves, the appellant was under no obligation to cook their meals or to see that they obtained them. It was argued, however, that as eating was a necessary operation, the preparation of their meals was incidental to their employment and that therefore, while engaged in preparing their meals the workmen were acting in the course of their employment. The acts of a workman which come within the scope of his employment are in general determined by the terms of the contract, including the terms implied as well as those expressed, and many authorities were cited to us in which the terms to be implied had received judicial consideration. A number of these authorities were discussed in St. Helens Colliery Company v. Hewitson[2]. In that case Lord Atkinson, at page 71, suggested the following test:\nA workman is acting in the course of his employment when he is engaged \"in doing something he was employed to do.\" Or what is, in other and I think better words, in effect the same thing\u2014namely, when he is doing something in discharge of a duty to his employer, directly or indirectly, imposed upon him by his contract of service. The true ground upon which the test should be based is a duty to the employer arising out of the contract of employment, but it is to be borne in mind that the word \"employment\" as here used covers and includes things belonging to or arising out of it.\nIn the same case Lord Wrenbury, at page 92, said :\nA useful test in many cases is whether, at the moment of the accident, the employer would have been entitled to give the workman an order, and the man would have owed the duty to obey it.\nIn Parker v. Black Rock (Owners)[3], the contract of employment contained a clause \"crew to provide their own provisions.\" A fireman belonging to the steamship went ashore, with leave, to buy provisions for himself. When he endeavoured to return to the ship he fell off the pier where the ship was supposed to be (though in fact she had been moved) and was drowned. It was held that his widow could not recover as the deceased owed no duty to his employer to go ashore to buy provisions. In his judgment, at page 730, Lord Sumner, in commenting on the clause \"crew to provide their own provisions,\" said :\nI think it does not constitute any promise by the seamen severally to the master of the vessel that they would as a duty towards him provide themselves with their own provisions. Could he have recovered damages if one of them had provided no provisions or not enough? Could he have dismissed one of them because he preferred to be abstemious instead of providing himself amply with food? The answer in each case must be No.\nAnd, at page 733, Lord Wrenbury expressed his opinion as follows:\u2014\nBut then it was said that, contract or no contract, at any rate under the circumstances the man was bound to get provision in order to sustain himself during the next journey of the vessel, and that it was a duty which he owed, and he was performing that duty. It seems to me that from the stipulation that he was to get his own provisions this consequence ensued\u2014that the master was bound to give him reasonable facilities from time to time for going to buy them, but it does not follow that when he was buying them he was discharging any duty towards his employer. The man was doing an act which under the circumstances he had to do, but he was not doing an act which he owed to his employer the duty to do.\nAnother instructive case in point is Philbin v. Hayes[4] . In that case the contract of employment provided that the plaintiff should be paid by the hour, his hours of work being from 7 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. It also provided that the employer, for the sum of two pence per day, would furnish a hut in which the plaintiff could live and sleep. He was not, by the contract, bound to take the hut, but, as it was difficult to obtain other sleeping accommodation, a number of workmen, including the plaintiff, took huts. While the plaintiff was asleep in the hut a strong wind blew it down and the plaintiff was injured. It was held that the accident did not occur in the course of his employment. In his judgment Swinfen Eady J., at page 782, said:\u2014\nThis man was not living in the hut upon any term of contract for his employer's benefit that he should be there. He was given the choice, and was as free as possible to come and go. Counsel for the applicant urged that there was a difficulty in obtaining lodging in the village. That I quite accept, and, of course, the man could only obtain such lodging as was available, but if he could have obtained accommodation elsewhere suitable to his means, he was perfectly free to avail himself of it. The employer had no right to make him live in the hut.\nand Neville J., said:\u2014\nIt seems to me impossible to say that when the man was in the hut, sitting there or resting there, he was doing anything within the scope of his employment. I think he was no more doing something within the scope of his employment while sleeping in this hut than he would be sleeping in a lodging. Therefore, it is impossible to say that the accident happened in the course of the employment.\nIn view of these and other authorities to which we were referred, I am of opinion that before it can be held that the Ewan brothers were in the course of their employment when they lighted the fire which escaped and did damage to the respondents' property, it must be shewn that the lighting of that fire was an act which they were under a contractual obligation to perform as a duty to their employer, or which their employer had ordered them to do. The appellant in this case did not order its workmen to light a fire nor were the workmen under any contractual obligation to do so. Their contract called upon them to board themselves which, as Lord Sumner and Lord Wrenbury, in the passages above quoted, point out, did not constitute a contractual obligation on their part as a duty to the appellant to cook their meals. It was necessary for them to have food if they wished to be in physical condition to do their work, just as it was necessary for them to wear stout boots while performing it, but in securing these necessary things they were doing something for themselves rather than discharging a duty towards the appellant.\nIf, instead of cooking their own food, the Ewan brothers had, without loss of time to their employers, gone elsewhere for their meals the appellant could not have ob- jected thereto for it was none of its concern. Once the workmen had finished their eight hours' work in any one day they were, it seems to me, at liberty, so far as the appellant was concerned, to go where they wished and to do what they pleased until they commenced their next day's work.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that when they lighted the fire which escaped and damaged the respondents' property, the Ewan brothers were not acting in the course of their employment.\nFor the respondents it was argued that even if the Ewan brothers were not acting in the course of their employment in lighting the fire in question, yet the appellant should be held liable because it was the occupier of the area covered by timber license 141, and a fire having arisen thereon the appellant failed to prevent its escape.\nAt the trial this ground does not appear to have been urged and it was not shewn who owned the soil covered by the timber license. It was, however, established that both appellants and respondents were licensees entitled to be in possession of the area for the purpose of their respective operations. The fact that the respondents were licensees only, would not, in my opinion, prevent them, if otherwise entitled, from recovering for the loss they suffered as the result of fire escaping from the land occupied by the appellant. (Charing Cross Electric Supply Company v. Hydraulic Power Company[5] ). It was also established that, although the Ewan brothers were not in the course of their employment when they kindled fires with which to cook their meals, the appellant knew they had pitched their tent close to Bean Creek within the area covered by the timber license, and knew also that morning and evening they kindled a fire; and yet it raised no objection whatever either to their occupation of the camp site or to the use of fire for cooking purposes. Knowledge on the part of the appellant of such acts without objecting thereto may be evidence of a tacit acquiescence therein which would thereafter prevent the appellant from treating these workmen as trespassers. Lowery v. Walker[6] . But passive acquiescence while it might as against the appellant give the workmen the status of bare licensees, would subject the appellant to no other obligation.\nIn this case I am not sure that the Ewan brothers can be considered even bare licensees of the appellant. Subsections 2 and 3 of section 95 of the Forest Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 93), provide that, subject to the observance of all obligations and precautions imposed by the Act, or the Regulations, a person may set out, start or kindle a fire for, inter alia, \"cooking or preparing food,\" but no person shall do so for that purpose in any forest or wood-land without first obtaining a written permit authorizing the kindling of such fire, and every person kindling a fire pursuant to such permit \"shall totally extinguish the fire before leaving the vicinity of the fire.\" It was not suggested by the respondents that the Ewan brothers did not have a permit to light a fire to cook their food, and, in the absence of any such question being raised, I think it must be assumed that they complied with that requirement of the law. Having a permit to light a fire, where they did, they would not require any license from the appellant to justify their occupation of the camp site or the kindling of the fire. They were totally independent of the appellant which had no control over them until they commenced to work.\nAssuming however that they were bare licensees of the appellant, the question we have to determine on this branch of the case is the extent of the liability of an occupier of land towards an adjoining proprietor for damage occasioned by fire escaping from the occupied land through no fault of the occupier but which was kindled thereon by a bare licensee, and allowed to escape by reason of the licensee's negligence.\nAt common law all householders were under obligation to keep their fires from damaging their neighbour's property. Hence if a fire arose in a house by the act of a servant or guest and damage was done to the house of another, the householder was liable. He could only escape liability if he could shew that the fire originated from the act of a stranger. Holdsworth's History of English Law, vol. 3, p. 385.\nBy a statute passed in the reign of Queen Anne (6 Anne, c. 31, s. 6) the rigour of the common law was mitigated and thereafter an owner was not liable in cases where the fire \"accidentally began.\" And by a subsequent statute (14 Geo. III, c. 27, s. 86) this provision was made to apply to fires occurring in the fields as well as those occurring in a building. The reason for holding an occupier liable for a fire started by a servant or agent is stated by Littledale J. in Laugher v. Pointer[7], as follows:\u2014\nThe injuries done upon lands or buildings are in the nature of nuisances, for which the occupier ought to be chargeable when occasioned by any acts of persons whom he brings upon the premises. The use of the premises is confined by law to himself, and he should take care not to bring persons there who do any mischief to others.\nOver the acts of persons whom he brings upon his land an occupier is supposed to exercise control.\nThe common law was based upon the broad maxim \"sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas,\" which found expression in the rule laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher[8] , which may be formulated thus:\u2014\nThe occupier of land who brings and keeps upon it anything likely to do damage if it escapes, is bound at his peril to prevent its escape, and is liable for all the natural and probable consequences of its escape, even if he has been guilty of no negligence.\nUnder this rule an occupier is liable not only where he causes, but also where he fails to prevent the escape from his land of the dangerous agency. Fire is a dangerous agency if not kept under control, and a person who has fire on his land must keep it under control at his peril. The rule, however, is subject to a number of exceptions. It is not applicable where the dangerous agency is brought on, or kept on the land of the occupier with the consent of the person damnified; nor, perhaps, where it escapes in consequence of an act of God, or vis major. Neither has it any application where the damage is caused by the act of a stranger or third person, whether such act be malicious or merely negligent. Richards v. Lothian[9] ; Smith v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[10].\nEven in the case of a servant the rule has no application if the act of the servant, which caused the damage, is outside of his employment. But where the servant's act is done in the course of his employment and for his master's benefit the rule applies and the employer is liable not only where the act had not been authorized by the employer, but even if the servant has been expressly forbidden to do it. Black v. Christ Church Financial Co.[11].\nIn the old case of Rich v. Basterfield[12] , the head-note reads as follows:\u2014\nAlthough the owner of property may, as occupier, be responsible for injuries arising from acts done upon that property by persons who are there by his permission, though not strictly his agents or servants,\u2014such liability attaches only upon parties in actual possession.\nIn commenting on that case in Barker v. Herbert[13], Vaughan Williams L.J., says:\nThe responsibility of the possessor of land as defined in that case would appear to be limited to cases where the injury has arisen from the acts of himself, or of his agents or servants, or those persons who, though not his agents or servants, are upon his premises by his permission, and are therefore under his control.\nIt is this control over the acts of those whom he brings or permits to come upon his land that differentiates the cases in which an occupier is held vicariously liable for such acts, from those cases in which he is held not liable for the acts of a stranger. In Job Edwards Limited v. Birmingham[14] , Scrutton L.J., at page 355, states the cases in which an occupier will be held liable for a nuisance on his land which spreads and damages his neighbour's property. His language is as follows:\u2014\nIn my view it is clear that a landowner or occupier is liable to an action by a private persons damaged by a nuisance existing on or coming from his land: (1) if he or his servants or agents created the nuisance; (2) or if an independent contractor acting for his benefit created the nuisance, though contrary to the terms of his employment; (3) or if being a tenant, or successor in title, he took the land from his landlord or predecessor with an artificial nuisance upon it.\nThe third of these classes has no application here, and the other two, it will be noted, are limited to persons over whose acts the occupier has control, or who, in creating the nuisance, are acting for the occupier's benefit. The appellant in the case at bar does not come within either of these classes. In lighting the fire which escaped and created a nuisance, the Ewan brothers were not acting for the appellant's benefit but solely for their own, and their act in lighting the fire must, as regards the appellant, be deemed the act of a stranger.\nIf a farmer sees a workman taking a short cut across his field to and from his work, and smoking as he goes, must he forbid him to smoke on his premises on pain of being liable for damages in case the smoker, after lighting his pipe, throws down a lighted match which sets fire to the grass, spreads to the adjoining property and there occasions damage. I do not think the law goes so far. I am unable to see how an occupier can be said to bring a person upon his land simply because when he sees him there he takes no steps to put him off.\nIn Williams v. Jones[15] , the plaintiff had gratuitously permitted the defendant to use his shed for the purpose of having a sign-board made therein. The defendant employed a carpenter to make the sign-board for him in the shed. Whilst at work making the sign-board the carpenter lighted his pipe with a shaving which he dropped setting fire to the shed with the result that it was totally destroyed. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for the loss sustained it was held that he could not recover because the carpenter, although he had leave and license to occupy the shed for the defendant's purpose, was not in the course of his employment in lighting his pipe as he did. Mr. Justice Blackburn and Mr. Justice Mellor dissented, but, as pointed out by Bankes L.J., in Jefferson v. Derbyshire Farmers, Ltd.[16] , the judges in that case did not differ on any question of law but as to the proper inference to be drawn from the fact that the man lit his pipe while working at a sign-board.\nIn Williams v. Jones[17], the majority of the court were of opinion that the negligent act of the carpenter was unconnected with the work he was employed to do.\nIn Whitmore's Limited v. Stanford[18], Eve J., after quoting the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher[19] , said:\nThe rule so stated does not appear to me to extend to make the owner of land liable for consequences brought about by the collecting and impounding on his land, by another, of water, or any other dangerous element, not for the purposes of the owner of the land, but for the purposes of such other.\nThis statement of the law applies to the case before us: The Ewan brothers introduced to the land covered by the appellant's license, a dangerous element, not for the purposes of the appellant but for their own. They were not there either by the command or invitation of the appellant, and the appellant, at the time they set out the fire which escaped, had no control over their acts. In my opinion, therefore, the respondents' action fails.\nCounsel for the respondents referred us to the case of Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[20] , as supporting the respondents' argument. That case is clearly distinguishable as the facts appearing therein bring it within the general rule that an employer is liable for the tortious act of his servant acting in the course of his employment. At page 247 of the report my brother Duff, whose judgment was concurred in by the Chief Justice and Anglin and Brodeur JJ., said:\nOn the other hand it has been laid down that the occupier is not responsible for the fire brought about by the act of a servant who is doing something entirely outside his employment (McKenzie v. McLeod[21] ) ; the theory apparently being that the act of the servant in such circumstances is the act of a \"stranger.\"\nBut here we have a servant who admittedly as servant occupies for his master and whose occupation is therefore his occupation and who moreover as incidental to his occupation has his master's authority to light fires.\nIdington J. gave judgment to the same effect, while my brother Mignault, who dissented, did so not because of any difference of opinion as to the law but because he thought the proper inference from the facts established was that the employee was acting outside of his employment when he started the fire in question.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below and enter judgment for the appellant, dismissing the action with costs in all courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.

Plaintiff claimed that his homestead, which he had conveyed to defendant, his son, was held by defendant in trust for him and should be reconveyed; also that he was entitled to an interest in two other parcels of land standing in the defendant's name. The trial judge (Boyle J.) held, on the evidence, in plaintiff's favour as to the homestead, and against him as to the other parcels. The Appellate Division, Alta., reversed his judgment as to the homestead, and affirmed it as to the other parcels. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld, that, on the evidence and the circumstances of the case, the findings at trial should not be varied by an appellate court; and that the judgment at trial should be restored in plaintiff's favour as to the homestead, and should stand as to the other parcels.\nHeld, further, as to a certain document signed by plaintiff reciting the ownership of the homestead to be in defendant and purporting to give plaintiff certain rights thereon, that, in view of all the circumstances under which it was signed, the plaintiff was not estopped from asserting his claim. A presumption arose from the relation of the parties, the nature of the document, and the other circumstances, which cast upon defendant the duty to explain and satisfy the court that plaintiff realized what he was doing and acted as a voluntary agent; and there was no satisfactory evidence to overcome or rebut that presumption. The law as stated in Pollock's Principles of Contract, 9th ed., p. 648 et seq., quoting from Smith v. Kay, 7 H.L.C. 750, at p. 779, and from Tate v. Williamson, L.R. 2 Ch. App. 55, at p. 61, approved. Turner v. Collins, L.R. 7 Ch. App. 329, at p. 338, and Inche Noriah Binte Mohamed Tahir v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar Bin Abdullah Bahashuan, 45 T.L.R. 1, also referred to.\nHeld, further, that there was not shown, in the circumstances of the conveyance of the homestead by plaintiff to defendant, any attempt to defeat creditors, so as to disentitle plaintiff to the relief claimed. Scheuerman v. Scheuerman, 52 S.C.R. 625, distinguished on the facts, and commented on as follows: \"The facts in the Scheuerman case were special; that decision depends upon its own facts, and there does not seem to be that unanimity in the reasons handed down by the judges constituting the majority that is necessary for a ruling case.\" Further, under the Exemptions Act of Alberta, the homestead is exempt from seizure under execution, and therefore, if there be any creditors of plaintiff, the conveyance does not prejudice them.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing in part the judgment of Boyle J.\nThe plaintiff, who was the father of the defendant, sued for a declaration that the defendant held in trust for the plaintiff a certain quarter-section of land, being the plaintiff's homestead, which the plaintiff had conveyed to the defendant, and for an order that the defendant transfer the same to the plaintiff; also for a declaration that the defendant held in trust for the plaintiff a half interest in two other parcels of land, and for a certain sum alleged to be owing to the plaintiff in respect of one of these latter parcels.\nThe action was tried before Boyle J., who, at the close of the trial, delivered judgment orally, finding in favour of the plaintiff in regard to the homestead and ordering a re-transfer of the same by the defendant to the plaintiff, but finding in favour of the defendant as to the other parcels of land in question.\nThe defendant appealed, and the plaintiff cross-appealed, to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which allowed the defendant's appeal, and dismissed the plaintiff's cross-appeal, and ordered that the plaintiff's action be dismissed with costs. No written reasons were delivered. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed as to the homestead with all costs here and also in the Appellate Division (except costs of the cross-appeal in that court, which were to be allowed to defendant and set off against plaintiff's costs), and the judgment of the trial court was restored.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nN. D. Maclean K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The trial of this action occupied three days, beginning 22nd March, 1927. The parties are Ruthenian immigrants, father and son, who have lived for twenty-five years in the province of Alberta, engaged in farming. Three parcels of land and some live stock are in controversy.\nThe plaintiff (appellant) is Wasyl Krys, the father, and the defendant (respondent), Anton Krys, the son. The former gave his testimony wholly through an interpreter; the latter used an interpreter at critical places. Wasyl was seventy years of age at the time of the trial, and Anton was then forty-two. Anton lived with his wife and seven children on his farm, situated about a mile from the homestead upon which his father lived. Anton's mother had been dead for many years, and his father had married again, and, by his second wife, had several children, the eldest of whom, at the time of the trial, was seventeen or eighteen years old. Wasyl was industrious and thrifty, but he did not get on very well with his second wife. Anton was his favourite son, and Wasyl appears to have trusted and relied upon him. The evidence suggests that Anton looked with disfavour upon his step-mother and her children, and that he encouraged or promoted divorce proceedings which his father at one time prosecuted against his second wife.\nWasyl, in 1914, when his wife was in hospital, became suspicious that she was likely to ruin him with expenses. He consulted with Anton, and in the result he conveyed, or, as he says, \"lent\" to Anton his homestead upon which he lived\u2014the North-East quarter of section 2, township 57, range 20, west of the 4th Meridian, and, at the same time, by bill of sale, transferred to Anton all the horses and horned cattle which he had upon the place. The secret understanding was that the property so conveyed should remain Wasyl's, and should be subsequently reconveyed. Wasyl remained upon the land and farmed it, and continued to take the crops and to use and dispose of them and the live stock as theretofore. Anton subsequently denied his father's equitable title, and claimed that the conveyance of the land, which was upon its face expressed to be in consideration of the sum of one dollar and love and affection, really represented a purchase of the land by him from his father in consideration of $2,000, which Anton says he paid at the time the conveyance was executed. The plaintiff, in these circumstances, claims a declaration that the land is held in trust for him by the defendant and that the de- fendant should execute a transfer, and other appropriate relief. The bill of sale is not mentioned in the pleadings, but the facts connected with it were investigated at the trial, and the learned judge, who gave an oral judgment, at the conclusion of his remarks was requested by the plaintiff's counsel to dispose of that question, and he did so without any objection.\nThere were two other parcels of land with which the case is concerned, namely, an undivided half-interest in the South-West quarter of section 23, township 56, range 20, W. 4th Meridian, and the North-East quarter of section 14, township 56, range 20, W. 4th Meridian, which were standing in the defendant's name, and as to which the plaintiff likewise alleges that he has the equitable title, or an interest which the defendant holds in trust for him, though not represented upon the registry; the plaintiff claiming that he had been defrauded by his son in acquiring the titles, or otherwise in relation to the transactions. But as to these two parcels, it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the true facts, owing to the confusion of the testimony and the conflict and character of the witnesses.\nI have, since the hearing, read and considered the evidence, but I do not think it would be profitable to attempt to make an intelligible review of the facts, because there is certainly evidence to sustain the findings, and I am satisfied that this Court cannot displace these without a considerable risk of doing some injustice.\nBoyle J., examined the case at considerable length in the oral judgment which he pronounced at the trial. He finds that the plaintiff, although \"quite illiterate and unfamiliar with the language of the country,\" had obtained a good homestead and done fairly well; that he was not in any way above the average in intellect of the class of immigrants to which he belongs, while his son, the defendant, was particularly bright and intellectual above the average. He says that he does not think that the son\nis entirely without filial affection, nor do I think that up to the time that his father had the disagreement with the stepmother that he was anything but probably what a young man should be with respect to his father. The plaintiff's troubles started when he commenced to think about how he would prevent his wife from getting satisfaction out of him by way of his property, and I think the facts are that he consulted his son and decided he would have his son hide away his property from the wife so as to see that she did not get it. And he had sufficient confidence in the son that the son would protect him. Whatever the arrangement was is not certain. We have the story of the two of them which is in some respects contradictory. It seems to me that was the motive that the plaintiff had in undertaking to transfer this land to his son. I am satisfied that the son agreed to act as trustee for the father, and that when the father thought it was safe to have the land reconveyed to him, the son was to reconvey it.\nContinuing, the learned judge refers to the documentary evidence, and to the divorce proceedings, which I shall mention again, and expressed the opinion that the defendant recognized that he held the homestead as trustee for his father, although he became unwilling to reconvey it.\nHe says that\nThe story told by the son in the witness box was not very convincing. He was fairly lucid on his transactions in connection with the other property, but when it came to giving evidence with regard to the homestead, it did seem to me that after all he had some conscience in the matter, and he did not really have the stomach to definitely press the matter in his evidence in connection with the homestead, the way he did with regard to the other land.\nAnd he makes the following observations:\nwhen all is said and done, a man's actions are more likely to be the truth than his statements when it comes to a question of his own interest in a legal action. I do not think that the circumstances, considering the illiteracy of the plaintiff, considering his ignorance of both the language and the customs of the country\u2014that the conditions are such that the Court is barred from compelling the son to make restitution.\nHe does not credit the evidence of Pullishy, the defendant's leading witness. He does not think Pullishy's recollection good enough to justify the evidence which Pullishy gave; about that the learned judge is very confident. And, on the question as to whether Anton bought the homestead from his father and paid $2,000 for it, as he testified he did, the learned judge expresses himself in these words:\nI am satisfied of one thing; I may have some doubts or some hesitation about some of the other facts, but I am absolutely confident on the evidence about one thing, and that is that there never was any consideration paid for this homestead.\nHe alludes also to the fact that\nThe father never moved off, he was always there, he is there yet, and never was disturbed in his possession.\nwhich, the learned judge says,\nhelps to confirm my opinion that the son held that property in trust for the father all the time. When this land was encumbered the son knew that he only held it in trust and in my opinion he should not have encumbered it; the rights of the mortgagees, who were innocent parties, in so far as any evidence before me is concerned, cannot, of course, be disturbed. But in my view the plaintiff is entitled to succeed with respect to the homestead. He is entitled to a conveyance of that land back to him, and he is entitled to have the son remove that mortgage.\nWith regard to the S.W. \u00bc of sec. 23, which was transferred to Anton by one Henkelman, \"There is,\" as the learned judge says,\nthe evidence of one side against the other side, and no documents of any kind, and the only thing I can do is to say that the onus is upon the plaintiff, and he has not satisfied it.\nThen, as to the fact that the plaintiff made the first payment on the S.E. \u00bc of sec. 14, the learned judge says:\nThat seems to be fairly clearly established now from the documents. But what finally was done regarding that is not so clear. It is very difficult for me to be able to decide whether or not the old man received really consideration for turning that over or whether he just made a gift of it to his son. Of course, there is nothing in the law of this country that prevents a father from presenting his son with $700 if he wants to do it. I am going to take the documents in that case again and hold that while the father paid $700 on account of that property, he gave the property as a gift to the son, and I do not think that the evidence in that case is clear enough to say that he is able to recover that amount back.\nAfter reading the evidence more than once and considering the well known advantages which the judge possessed for determining the facts, and which are of special weight in a case of this kind, where the parties and their witnesses go upon the stand, where it is necessary to introduce an interpreter, and where local knowledge is useful, I am impressed with the view that a Court of Appeal should not venture to vary any of these findings. It is, I think, abundantly clear that it would be impossible for any judge, upon whom the duty is cast to review the evidence, to find otherwise than did the learned trial judge with relation to the homestead; and, while I might at first instance have been disposed to come to a different result upon the other two parcels, especially the S.E. \u00bc of sec 14, I do not think I can properly reverse the conclusion reached.\nThere is no well founded complaint of misdirection. Neither party has the credit of strict reliability, and the trial judge said, towards the end of the trial, that he did not intend to accept as truth all the evidence that had been uncontradicted on either side.\nThere is, however, one feature of the case which was not, perhaps, adequately considered at the trial, and which was strongly pressed on behalf of the defendant upon the hearing of the appeal; to this I shall direct a few observations. Wasyl Krys had sued his wife for divorce, and apparently she had counter-claimed for judicial separation. That action was tried in March, 1925, before Tweedie J., who dismissed both the claim and the counter-claim; but at the close of the trial, immediately after the judgment had been pronounced, the judge addressed the parties, evidently through an interpreter, as follows:\nYou have used up a great deal of time and spent a great deal of money in Court here. Neither of you get a divorce and there is no judicial separation between you. She is entitled to go back to that homestead and live, and he is bound to maintain her and support her, and he cannot in any way ill-treat or abuse her or drive her away from that place. And I think that the son has got that farm; that Krys ought to have the farm and she should not be working there all her life and raising children by him, and other people get his property, and she is entitled to be protected, and that they had better straighten out their property difference between themselves, and I do not think they will have any trouble. I think that the trouble is caused by the fact that this woman thinks the homestead is in the name of his son, and she is working there and raising children of her own for nothing.\nThen the parties left the Court. Anton and Pullishy had been in attendance, and they went out at or about the same time. They prevailed upon Wasyl to go to Mr. Ewing's office. It was, as I understand the evidence, Mr. Ewing, or his partner, Mr. Bury, who had conducted the divorce proceedings on behalf of Wasyl, and Wasyl says that Anton asked him to go to Mr. Ewing's office, so that Anton could give him back his land, a purpose that coincided with the view expressed as above by Tweedie J. Arrived at the office, a document was produced, or prepared, under instructions communicated either by Anton or Pullishy, which reads as follows:\nMEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT made this Twelfth (12) day of March, A.D. 1925.\nBETWEEN :\u2014\nANTON KRYS, of Skaro, in the Province of Alberta, farmer,\nOf the First Part,\nAnd\nWASYL KRYS, of Skaro, in the Province of Alberta, farmer,\nOf the Second Part.\nWHEREAS Anton Krys is the natural and lawful son of the said Wasyl Krys, and in consideration of natural love and affection, the parties hereto are desirous of entering into the arrangement hereinafter set out:\nAND WHEREAS the said Anton Krys is the owner of the North-East Quarter of Section Two (2) Township Fifty-seven (57), Range Twenty (20), West of the Fourth (4) Meridian, free and clear of all encumbrances; NOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH:\n(1) It is agreed between the parties hereto that, in consideration of natural love and affection, the said Wasyl Krys shall have the sole and exclusive right to reside in the Buildings situate on the South half of the North-East Quarter of Section Two (2), Township Fifty-seven (57), Range Twenty (20), West of the Fourth (4) Meridian in the Province of Alberta, during his natural life, without rent or charge of any kind, and shall have the right to use the stables, granaries and all other buildings on the said land.\n(2) The said Wasyl Krys for the consideration above named shall have the sole and exclusive right to cultivate and crop the said South half of the South-East (sic) Quarter of Section Two (2), Township Fifty-seven (57), Range Twenty (20), West of the Fourth (4) Meridian without rent or other charge whatsoever, and all crop, hay or other produce grown upon the said land shall belong to and be the sole property of the said Wasyl Krys.\n(3) The said Wasyl Krys agrees to pay the taxes on the above land.\n(4) If at any time the said Wasyl Krys becomes physically unable to cultivate the said land owing to old age or infirmity, then, in such case, the said Anton Krys may cultivate the said land for the sole use and benefit of the said Anton Krys, but in such case the said Anton Krys shall pay the taxes on the said land.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and seals the day and date first above mentioned.\n(Sgd.) Wm. Pullishy, (Sgd.) Anton Krys. (Seal).\nhis\n(Sgd.) E. Michajluk. Wasyl X Krys. (Seal).\nmark.\nAnton signed this, and Wasyl, at the request of Anton and Pullishy, signed also. The subscribing witnesses are Pullishy and Michajluk. The latter was a law student in the office of Mr. Ewing, articled to him. It does not appear who prepared the instrument. Michajluk says that Mr. Ewing called him in from the general office, and when he went in, he found there, \"the old gentleman, Krys, and his wife, and the young man Anton,\" and Pullishy; and that Mr. Ewing asked him to read out the contents of the document to them, and tell him (presumably Wasyl) what was in it, which Michajluk says he did very carefully. His testimony upon the point is this:\nQ. And when you read that, I would assume that you understood it yourself?\nA. I think so.\nQ. And you read that, and you understand, don't you, that it says: \"Whereas Anton Krys is the owner of certain property?\"\nA. I interpreted it to him just as it is in this document. q. And what did you understand the document to be?\nA. Well, it was an agreement between the two Krys's.\nq. What is it called? Is it an agreement you would stamp as a bill of sale or is it an encumbrance or a mortgage? Has it the effect of an encumbrance or what?\nA. I was not asked by Mr. Ewing to give the definition of the document, but just to interpret the contents of the document.\nThe Court: What did you tell him it was?\nA. I told him word for word just what it was, Your Lordship.\nq. Mr. Mackie : You did not tell Mr. Krys: \"Your son is the owner of the land, and in consideration of the love and affection he has for you, he is going to let you stay on that land with your wife, but if you should die before she does, she has to get off?\" You did not explain it that way to him?\nA. Well, to be earnest about it, I could not say. I did not tell him anything that is not in this document, but I am sure I explained everything to him that is in this document.\nq. What explanation did you give?\nA. I explained to him the contents of this document.\nThe Court: What did you tell him?\nA. I could not tell you what I told to him. I know this much, that I was asked by Mr. Ewing to translate the document as it is.\nq. But you told us now you explained to him as to what the document was?\nA. When I read this over to him once, I read it sentence by sentence, and I did not read the whole document over, but I was explaining to him after each sentence. I told him the contents of the sentence in Ukrainian and explained it to him where it was necessary.\nq. You mean you translated it?\nA. Yes, that is right.\nq. But outside of translating it, quite apart from the question of translating it, what explanations did you give?\nA. I did not give any explanations unless he asked me.\nThere is no evidence of any conversation between Mr. Ewing or Mr. Bury, or any solicitor in the office, and Wasyl, or that Wasyl gave or concurred in any instructions for the preparation of the agreement. Pullishy, however, who appears usually to have been at Anton's elbow when business was being transacted with Wasyl, and who says he had an intimate knowledge of their affairs, also signed as witness, and it was he who accompanied the father and son to the solicitor who prepared the document by which, in 1914, Wasyl transferred the homestead to Anton. It is not shewn that either Mr. Ewing, or anybody belonging to his office, knew that Anton held the title under a transfer without consideration in trust for his father, who remained in possession, and it is sufficiently apparent that Wasyl re- ceived no independent advice or explanation whatever as to the purpose and effect of the agreement, or as to the inadvisability of his entering into any such transaction. It must be realized also that he did not speak English, and could not read a word; that he was relying upon his son, to whose hands he had committed this property in trust, and that it was either his son or Pullishy, or, perhaps, both, who contrived the meeting and originated the project for the agreement. A more foolish or improvident arrangement, in the interest of the old man, it is difficult to imagine. It was made a strong point of the defendant's case that the plaintiff was conclusively estopped by the recital that Anton was owner of the homestead, free and clear of all encumbrances. But the Court has to deal with the particular circumstances of the case, and, having regard to these, I am satisfied that the learned trial judge was right in reaching the conclusion that the plaintiff ought not to be bound.\nThe law is admirably stated in Sir Frederick Pollock's Principles of Contract, 9th Edition, 648 et seq., where he quotes a passage from the judgment of Lord Kingsdown in Smith v. Kay[1]; also the following from Lord Chelmsford in Tate v. Williamson[2]:\nWherever two persons stand in such a relation that, while it continues, confidence is necessarily reposed by one, and the influence which naturally grows out of that confidence is possessed by the other, and this confidence is abused, or the influence is exerted to obtain an advantage at the expense of the confiding party, the party so availing himself of his position will not be permitted to retain the advantage, although the transaction could not have been impeached if no such confidential relation had existed.\nSee also Turner v. Collins[3].\nThe most recent case is that of Inche Noriah Binte Mohamed Tahir v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar Bin Abdullah Bahashuan, an appeal from the Straits Settlements, decided only a few weeks ago in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[4]. That was the case of a deed of gift of considerable property by a Malay woman, wholly illiterate and of great age, to the respondent, who was of Arab birth, and the appellant's nephew by marriage. The facts cannot very well be stated in the space here available. They are, no doubt, more convincing than those upon which the present case depends; nevertheless I am persuaded that the principles enunciated by the Lord Chancellor are not irrelevant to the determination of the present appeal. His Lordship, having referred to the judgment of Lord Justice Cotton in the well known case of Allcard v. Skinner[5], and some of the other authorities, expresses the views of their Lordships as follows:\nThe decision in each of these cases seems to their Lordships to be entirely consistent with the principle of law as laid down in Allcard v. Skinner (1). But their Lordships are not prepared to accept the view that independent legal advice is the only way in which the presumption can be rebutted; nor are they prepared to affirm that independent legal advice, when given, does not rebut the presumption, unless it be shown that the advice was taken. It is necessary for the donee to prove that the gift was the result of the free exercise of independent will. The most obvious way to prove this is by establishing that the gift was made after the nature and effect of the transaction had been fully explained to the donor by some independent and qualified person so completely as to satisfy the Court that the donor was acting independently of any influence from the donee and with the full appreciation of what he was doing; and in cases where there are no other circumstances this may be the only means by which the donee can rebut the presumption. But the fact to be established is that stated in the judgment already cited of Lord Justice Cotton, and if evidence is given of circumstances sufficient to establish this fact, their Lordships see no reason for disregarding them merely because they do not include independent advice from a lawyer. Nor are their Lordships prepared to lay down what advice must be received in order to satisfy the rule in cases where independent legal advice is relied upon, further than to say that it must be given with a knowledge of all relevant circumstances and must be such as a competent and honest adviser would give if acting solely in the interests of the donor.\nIn the present case their Lordships do not doubt that Mr. Aitken (the solicitor) acted in good faith; but he seems to have received a good deal of his information from the respondent; he was not made aware of the material fact that the property which was being given away constituted practically the whole estate of the donor, and he certainly does not seem to have brought home to her mind the consequences to herself of what she was doing, or the fact that she could more prudently, and equally effectively, have benefited the donee without undue risk to herself by retaining the property in her own possession during her life and bestowing it upon him by her will. In their Lordships' view the facts proved by the respondent are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of undue influence which is raised by the relationship proved to have been in existence between the parties; and they regard it as most important from the point of view of public policy to maintain the rule of law which has been laid down and to insist that a gift made under circumstances which give rise to the presumption must be set aside unless the donee is able to satisfy the Court of facts sufficient to rebut the presumption.\nI think a presumption arises from the relation of the parties; the astonishing nature of the instrument which emerged from their meeting on 12th March, 1925, when Anton took his father to the lawyer's office on the pretence of giving him back his property, and from the other circumstances of the case, which casts upon Anton the duty to explain, and to satisfy the court that his father realized what he was doing, and acted as a voluntary agent; and no satisfactory evidence has been produced to overcome or to rebut that presumption; the testimony of the Ukrainian law student is quite inadequate to clear up the situation.\nThere was an appeal, and a cross appeal, to the Appellate Division, and upon the hearing, the appeal was allowed and the cross appeal was dismissed, without reasons. There is nothing in the record to suggest why this was done, but it is said that the Court considered that, at least with respect to the homestead and the chattels, it was bound by the decision of this Court in Scheuerman v. Scheuerman[6], and that the plaintiff was disentitled to relief, because the conveyance by Wasyl to his son evidenced an attempt to defeat creditors, and was fraudulent and void as against them under the statute of 13 Eliz., Ch. 5, and that to give effect to the claim would be a breach of the principle that the court will not assist a suiter to obtain relief from the consequence of his own unlawful act. The facts in the Scheuerman case 6 were special; that decision depends upon its own facts, and there does not seem to be that unanimity in the reasons handed down by the judges constituting the majority that is necessary for a ruling case. 1 need not, however, review the judgments, because the present facts are entirely different. Here there are no pleadings and no proof of intent to defraud creditors, and that question was not raised or suggested at the trial. The plaintiff testified as follows:\nQ. When did Anton begin to tell you things about your wife?\nA. Every time he came up to me.\nQ. Did he say anything about her before she went to the hospital?\nA. He said \"She will ruin everything for you.\"\nQ. When did he say that? Did Anton say that to you before your wife went to the hospital, or after she went to the hospital? A. He told me that before she went to the hospital and after she was in the hospital.\nQ. Do you know why your wife went to the hospital?\nA. Well, she took sick. I could not tell you what was the cause of it.\nQ. Well, did you beat her up?\nA. I did not.\nAnd, referring to his homestead,\nQ. And did you give it to Anton in some way?\nA. The time my wife was in the hospital I decided I should assign that land to my son to protect myself from the expenses which my wife put on me in the hospital and arranged it then he had to assign it back to me again.\nQ. Your wife went to Lamont Hospital, did she?\nA. Yes.\nThe impression which this evidence left with the trial judge was, as already shewn, that the plaintiff consulted with his son, \"and decided he would have his son hide away his property from the wife so as to see that she did not get it.\" There was obviously trouble between the plaintiff and his wife at the time, the particulars of which were not investigated; but there was no proof that he had creditors or that any creditor was defeated, hindered or delayed by the transfer; and a judicial inference, in these circumstances, that the conveyance was unlawful under the Statute of 13 Eliz., Ch. 5, is, in my opinion, not only unjustified, but seems directly to conflict with the venerable principle propounded in the Year-Books by Brian C.J., that\nHaving in your mind is nothing, for it is common learning that the thought of man is not triable; for even the Devil has not knowledge of man's thoughts.\nThat is said by Lord Macnaghten, in Keighley, Maxsted & Co. v. Durant[7], to be a sound maxim, at least in its legal aspect.\nMoreover, it is provided by the Exemptions Act of Alberta, R.S.A., 1922, ch. 95, sec. 2 (i), that\nThe homestead of an execution debtor actually occupied by him, provided the same be not more than one hundred and sixty acres.\nis free from seizure by virtue of all writs of execution, and also, by paragraph (d) of the same section, that horses and cattle, substantially including those which were subject to the bill of sale, are also exempt; and it was in fact admitted at the hearing that the homestead and the chattels are not available to the creditors. Therefore the conveyance and transfer which the plaintiff made to the defendant in 1914 does not prejudice Wasyl's creditors, if there be any, and, so far as the later transactions are concerned, it was not even hinted that there was evidence to manifest or to suggest any unlawful purpose on the part of Wasyl.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial; and I think the plaintiff should have his costs throughout, except the costs of his cross appeal to the Appellate Division, the defendant to have his costs of that cross appeal, to be set off.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\n[1] (1859) 7 H.L.C., 750, at p. 779.\n[2] (1866) L.R. 2 Ch.

The appellant supplied the dynamite, the tools and accessories. The respondent hired the men, paid them, controlled them, and discharged them. He was allowed to do the work as he pleased, except that he was indicated where the mining should take place. He was not in any way the subordinate of the company, his whole obligation towards the latter consisting in supplying a sufficient quantity of mineral rock of a given size for the run of the mill. He was responsible in damages if he failed in this respect. He was paid twenty cents per wagon; and in addition, the appellant paid the insurance premiums required by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board to cover accidents to the respondent\u2019s employees; but this was done as the result of an express condition of the agreement between the respondent and the appellant. The respondent had to deliver rock of the required size. The rock was loaded into small wagons and carried to the mill. The loading was done by means of a steam shovel operated by one of the employees of the appellant company. When the rock was found too large, it was laid aside and it became the respondent\u2019s duty to reduce it to the required size. The respondent, one day, while performing the latter operation and while engaged in drilling a hole in one of the rocks, was seriously injured by an explosion of dynamite. It was generally admitted that the cause of the accident was the fact that the drill had come into contact with an unexploded charge previously placed in the rock by the respondent or his employees in the course of the former operations and which had failed to explode. The respondent brought an action in damages against the company.\nHeld that, under the circumstances of his engagement, the respondent was an independent contractor; that the appellant company was not liable, as the respondent was not its employee and it did not have towards him the responsibility of an employer; and that the accident was due to the fault or negligence of the respondent himself or that of his employees and he could not recover against the appellant company.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Tessier J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAlfred Savard K.C. and M. A. Phelan K.C. for the appellant.\nLouis Morin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Quebec Asbestos Corporation exploite \u00e0 East Broughton dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, une mine d\u2019amiante.\nLe 7 novembre 1927, G\u00e9d\u00e9on Couture, le demandeur intim\u00e9, y fut la victime d\u2019une explosion de dynamite qui l\u2019a rendu infirme pour la vie. Il a obtenu de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant dans le district de Beauce, un jugement condamnant la compagnie \u00e0 lui payer les dommages r\u00e9sultant de cet accident. La majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Deux des juges de la cour cependant \u00e9taient d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y avait \u201cau moins faute commune\u201d de la part de Couture; et, pour cette raison, ils auraient r\u00e9duit de moiti\u00e9 le montant de la condamnation. Cette cour est maintenant saisie de la question.\nPour en faciliter l\u2019examen, il est d\u2019abord n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019expliquer les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de travail \u00e0 la mine.\nLe puits est \u00e0 ciel ouvert. On commence, au moyen de la dynamite, par en d\u00e9tacher des pans entiers des parois lat\u00e9rales. Sous l\u2019action des explosifs, les parois se fractionnent en quartiers de roc qui tombent et s\u2019entassent au fond du puits. De l\u00e0, une pelle m\u00e9canique les charge dans les wagonnets qui les transportent \u00e0 l\u2019usine o\u00f9 l\u2019on extrait le minerai. Mais les machines de l\u2019usine ne peuvent recevoir que les quartiers de roc qui n\u2019exc\u00e8dent pas une certaine dimension. Il ne faut charger dans les wagonnets que la pierre de minerai qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette dimension. Il arrive donc que, avant de laisser le puits, les quartiers de roc doivent \u00eatre de nouveau soumis \u00e0 une et parfois \u00e0 deux explosions suppl\u00e9mentaires afin de les r\u00e9duire \u00e0 la dimension voulue.\nC\u2019est Couture qui avait entrepris de la compagnie le contrat de miner les parois et le roc et de fournir aux wagonnets la pierre de minerai du volume requis en quantit\u00e9 suffisante pour alimenter l\u2019usine. A cette fin, il employait plusieurs hommes. Il les engageait, fixait leur salaire (sauf qu\u2019il ne lui \u00e9tait pas permis de d\u00e9passer le maximum des salaires \u00e9tablis \u00e0 l\u2019usine); il les payait, les dirigeait, les d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait et les renvoyait. Pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son contrat, il \u00e9tait libre d\u2019adopter la m\u00e9thode de travail qu\u2019il entendait. Les seules instructions que le contrema\u00eetre de la compagnie avait \u00e0 lui donner \u00e9taient de lui indiquer les endroits o\u00f9 il devait miner. La compagnie fournissait les outils, les accessoires et la dynamite. Couture recevait \u201cvingt cents du char.\u201d Il \u00e9tait responsable en dommages s\u2019il manquait \u00e0 son obligation de fournir toute la pierre dont on avait besoin pour la marche r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019usine.\nLa pelle m\u00e9canique qui chargeait le roc sur les wagonnets \u00e9tait manoeuvr\u00e9e par un employ\u00e9 de la compagnie. Lorsque ce dernier rencontrait des pierres (block-holes) trop grosses pour \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es au moulin, il les mettait de c\u00f4t\u00e9, et Couture devait y pratiquer de nouveau la dynamite. C\u2019est au moment o\u00f9 Couture perforait une de ces pierres qu\u2019une explosion se produisit: il fut projet\u00e9 dans les airs et gravement bless\u00e9. On a expliqu\u00e9 l\u2019accident de la fa\u00e7on suivante: Une charge de dynamite d\u00e9j\u00e0 introduite dans ce m\u00eame quartier de roc au cours des op\u00e9rations ant\u00e9rieures aurait manqu\u00e9 d\u2019exploser (ce qui arrive parfois) et aurait \u00e9clat\u00e9 lorsque Couture entreprit une nouvelle perforation. C\u2019est la th\u00e9orie qui fut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accept\u00e9e.\nLes jugements soumis \u00e0 cette cour ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 Couture comme \u00e9tant l\u2019employ\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec Asbestos Company; et c\u2019est en appliquant \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce les principes qui r\u00e9gissent les relations entre patrons et employ\u00e9s qu\u2019ils ont tenu l\u2019appelante responsable des dommages subis par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ils ont trouv\u00e9 que la compagnie avait failli \u00e0 ses obligations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son ouvrier, qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb pr\u00e9voir toutes les causes non-seulement habituelles mais simplement possibles d\u2019accidents et adopter toutes les mesures et les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour les \u00e9viter. Ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait du devoir de la compagnie de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019explosifs dans le quartier de roc sur lequel travaillait Couture au moment de l\u2019accident et qu\u2019elle avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce devoir.\nMais il est \u00e9vident que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e d\u2019un point de vue diff\u00e9rent si Couture, au lieu d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 son employ\u00e9, \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nOr, nous sommes d\u2019avis que c\u2019est bien l\u00e0 la nature juridique du contrat qu\u2019il avait fait avec la compagnie. On y trouve les principaux caract\u00e8res distinctifs du contrat d\u2019entreprise: le mode adopt\u00e9 pour sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration; le droit de choisir les hommes qu\u2019il employait, de fixer leur salaire, de les diriger et de les renvoyer; la responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages comme cons\u00e9quence de son d\u00e9faut d\u2019alimenter l\u2019usine; surtout l\u2019absence d\u2019un lien de subordination entre Couture et la compagnie et son ind\u00e9pendance dans la m\u00e9thode de travail.\nLe contrat de louage d\u2019ouvrage se distingue du contrat d\u2019entreprise surtout par le caract\u00e8re de subordination qu\u2019il attribue \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9. M\u00eame pay\u00e9s \u00e0 la t\u00e2che, les ouvriers peuvent \u00eatre\ndes locateurs de services, s\u2019ils sont subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 un patron; mais au contraire les ouvriers sont des entrepreneurs, s\u2019ils ne sont pas soumis \u00e0 cette subordination.\n(Baudry-Lacantinerie & Wahl, Trait\u00e9 de droit civil, 3\u00e8me \u00e9d., Du contrat de louage, tome 2, premi\u00e8re partie, n08 1638 et 1641).\nC\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec:\nBeaulieu v. Picard, Cour de R\u00e9vision (Tellier, Delorimier, Greenshields JJ.)[1]; Lambert v. Blanchet[2], Cour d\u2019Appel (o\u00f9 Monsieur le Juge Howard fait une revue compl\u00e8te de la question); Collin v. Gagnon[3], Cour d\u2019Appel, o\u00f9 Monsieur le Juge L\u00e9tourneau, parlant au nom de la cour, dit, entre autres choses:\nEt si l\u2019on ajoute que le revenu et le profit des jobbers, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre fixe ou l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un salaire, d\u00e9pendait en somme du contr\u00f4le et de la direction qu\u2019ils exerceraient exclusivement sur leurs hommes et de leur habilet\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer parti d\u2019un travail qu\u2019il leur \u00e9tait permis de diriger, on en vient facilement \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient des chefs d\u2019entreprise distincts.\nCouture ex\u00e9cutait son travail d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante, en dehors de la direction et du contr\u00f4le de la compagnie; et celle-ci devait seulement en v\u00e9rifier la bonne ex\u00e9cution lors de son ach\u00e8vement (Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vbo Louage de services, n08 29 et 57).\nLe contrat que nous avons \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter ne r\u00e9servait pas \u00e0 Quebec Asbestos Corporation le droit de donner \u00e0 Couture des ordres et des instructions sur la mani\u00e8re de remplir les fonctions qu\u2019il avait accept\u00e9es. C\u2019est ce droit qui fonde l\u2019autorit\u00e9 et la subordination sans laquelle il n\u2019existe pas de v\u00e9ritable commettant (Bouly v. Lefebvre, Cour de Cassation[4]).\nIl est vrai que la compagnie avait assur\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 contre le risque des accidents du travail; mais elle l\u2019avait fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une convention qui faisait partie de son contrat avec Couture. Cette stipulation elle-m\u00eame, peut-\u00eatre encore plus que tout autre fait, confirme la nature du contrat, puisqu\u2019il avait fallu une condition expresse pour faire assumer par la compagnie une charge qui autrement e\u00fbt incomb\u00e9 \u00e0 Couture \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses employ\u00e9s. Il nous dit que c\u2019est lui-m\u00eame qui avait exig\u00e9 cette convention. Il s\u2019\u00e9tait donc bien rendu compte de sa responsabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis de ses employ\u00e9s, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accidents du travail, et, d\u00e8s lors, de sa situation d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 avait entrepris de miner la pierre de minerai dont la compagnie avait besoin et de la lui livrer aux wagonnets qui la transportaient \u00e0 l\u2019usine, de la dimension et en la quantit\u00e9 requises pour les besoins de l\u2019usine. Il travaillait sur une mati\u00e8re appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie; mais cela n\u2019affectait pas ses relations juridiques avec la compagnie. En cela, sa situation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente de celui qui entreprend la coupe du bois sur les limites appartenant \u00e0 un autre et qui s\u2019engage \u00e0 le lui livrer \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re, par la voie de laquelle le bois est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 la scierie. Dans ces conditions, tous deux, celui qui a le contrat de la coupe et celui qui a le contrat de la mine (comme Couture), sont des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants. Depuis le moment o\u00f9 Couture commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 miner la paroi du puits de la mine jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il livrait aux wagonnets la pierre de minerai, toute l\u2019op\u00e9ration se faisait sous son contr\u00f4le et sous sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nIl \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de se servir d\u2019une substance dangereuse. Il avait l\u2019habitude de tirer plusieurs coups de mine \u00e0 la fois. Il savait qu\u2019il arrive parfois qu\u2019une charge, ou plusieurs charges de dynamite ne partaient pas en m\u00eame temps que les autres et que la ratelle faisait long feu. Il se rendait compte du danger imminent qui pouvait en r\u00e9sulter pour tous. Il reconnaissait son devoir, apr\u00e8s chaque explosion, de faire une inspection minutieuse de toutes les charges afin de v\u00e9rifier si quelqu\u2019une n\u2019avait pas explos\u00e9 C\u2019est \u00e0 lui qu\u2019incombaient la responsabilit\u00e9 de cet examen et les cons\u00e9quences qui pouvaient r\u00e9sulter de son insuffisance. (Citizens Light v. Lep\u00eetre[5]). Si toute autre personne e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e comme lui, c\u2019est \u00e0 lui que la faute en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 imput\u00e9e. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, en cette circonstance, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime de cette faute.\nCela ne nous para\u00eet pas faire de doute si le quartier de roc e\u00fbt fait explosion avant qu\u2019il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9 par la pelle m\u00e9canique. Nous ne pouvons voir comment l\u2019intervention de la pelle m\u00e9canique a pu modifier la responsabilit\u00e9. Tout ce que Lessard, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette pelle m\u00e9canique, avait \u00e0 faire \u00e9tait de charger la pierre que Couture et ses employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9paraient. Ses fonctions ne lui imposaient pas l\u2019obligation de v\u00e9rifier si la pierre qu\u2019il remuait pouvait encore \u00eatre charg\u00e9e de dynamite. L\u2019on ne pouvait s\u2019attendre que Lessard, qui se tenait dans la petite cabane \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de sa machine, descendit \u00e0 chaque mouvement pour aller constater si les explosifs avaient ou non \u00e9clat\u00e9. Nous croyons que Lessard lui-m\u00eame e\u00fbt eu un recours contre Couture si, pendant qu\u2019il d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait les pierres, il lui f\u00fbt arriv\u00e9 un accident semblable \u00e0 celui dont Couture fut la victime. En mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les quartiers de roc qui exc\u00e9daient la dimension requise, Lessard ne faisait pas autre chose que de refuser d\u2019accepter pour le compte de la compagnie un travail qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore compl\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux conventions; et c\u2019est dans le but de remplir son obligation contractuelle de livrer des pierres de la dimension d\u00e9finie que Couture, au moment de l\u2019accident, \u00e9tait \u00e0 perforer le quartier de roc qui avait besoin d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9duit. Couture savait que ce quartier de roc \u00e9tait un de ceux que lui ou ses hommes avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 et qu\u2019il pouvait contenir encore une charge qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9clat\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui d\u2019\u00eatre sur le qui-vive; et, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, si la dynamite se trouvait encore dans cette pierre, pleine de danger pour tous ceux qui l\u2019approcheraient, c\u2019est que son travail de mine avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal fait ou que son examen, apr\u00e8s les explosions, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 insuffisant.\nDans les circonstances, nous croyons que Quebec Asbestos Corporation ne peut \u00eatre tenue responsable de l\u2019accident qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de son action.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Savard & Savard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morin & Vezina.\n[1] Q.R. 42 S.C. 455, at p. 458.\n[2] Q.R. 40 K.B. 370.\n[3] Q.R. 44 K.B. 389.\n[4] S. 1923-1-115.\n[5] (1898) 29 S.C.R. 1.\n"}

At the trial Maclean J. granted the defendant\u2019s application for non-suit, withdrew the case from the jury, and dismissed the action.

The judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1928] 1 W.W.R. 815, which reversed the judgment at trial on the findings of a jury, and held that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover damages for injury to the infant plaintiff, who was run over by defendant's street car, on the ground of want of the requisite corroboration of the evidence given by infant witnesses not under oath, to show that the accident was caused by negligence of defendant's motorman, was set aside, and the judgment at trial was restored, the Court holding that, apart altogether from the question of corroboration, there was sufficient in the evidence of the motorman himself, under the circumstances, to justify the jury in drawing the inference that he was negligent; that there was, in any case, corroboration of the infant plaintiff's story of what happened just before the accident, sufficient to enable the jury to say that a proper watch was not kept; that the jury's finding that there was not sufficient lookout should not have been disturbed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] allowing (Beck and Clarke JJA., dissenting) the defendant's appeal from the judgment of Tweedie J., upon the verdict of a jury, given in favour of the plaintiffs, in an action for damages for injuries to the infant plaintiff, a boy of seven years of age, caused by his being run over by the defendant's street car, owing, as alleged by the plaintiffs, to the negligence of the defendant's motorman.\nThe accident happened about 2.30 o'clock in the afternoon of May 23, 1927, near the intersection of Ninth Avenue South and Twelfth Street South in the city of Lethbridge. The car was going westward on Ninth Avenue. The track on Ninth Avenue is a single track, and Ninth Avenue runs straight from Thirteenth Street westward to Sixth Street. The boy's leg was badly injured and had to be amputated.\nAccording to the boy's story, he was running to catch the street car to go home on it. To get on the car he had to cross the track from the south side of it to the north side. He was wearing rubbers on his shoes, and as he was crossing the track, in front of the car, he got stuck in the mud, could not get his foot away, cried \"help\" and waved his arms, but the car ran over him. He said that before the car hit him he saw the motorman talking to a lady in the car, and looking towards her and not towards him.\nAccording to the motorman's evidence, he did not see the boy at all, or anybody on the track; he was keeping a watch ahead, and there could not have been anything on the track without his seeing it; he knew nothing of the accident until his car returned to the same place, about seventeen minutes after the accident. He said that a lady came out into the vestibule of the car, and he applied his brakes, thinking she wanted to get off at Twelfth Street, but when they were at Twelfth Street she said \"Not here. Ninth Street.\" His application of the brakes brought the car almost to a standstill, but at her said remark he released the brakes and went on. He said also, in the course of his evidence:\nA. When I expected my car to come to a stop I attempted to open the door, and during the time I was attempting to open the door she said, \"Not here.\"\nQ. You did not actually open the door, though?\nA. No; I was on the point of opening it and my head was turned at that time.\nQ. So until that time which way had you been facing?\nA. Straight to the front.\nQ. And how long, or for how long a period did you turn your head towards Mrs. Younkers?.\nA. It might be a second. Just a matter of turning and going back.\nThe said lady, Mrs. Younkers, who was a witness for the plaintiff, testified that she came out into the vestibule and asked the motorman to let her off at Ninth Street, as she could not get off at Eighth Street (her usual place to get off) as it was so muddy, and he said \"All right,\" She could not say whether or not she got up to come out (into the vestibule) before the car came to Twelfth Street, but it was \"along there\" that she went out into the vestibule. She did not see anybody on the track. She did not learn of the accident until afterwards.\nA Mr. Wood, who was working in his garden at the North West corner of Twelfth Street and Ninth Avenue, heard, after the car had passed, the boy shouting \"help me,\" and went and picked him up. The leg that was hurt was across the rail on the south side of the track. Blood was lying on the south side of the track inside the rails. A rubber was found in the mud.\nTwo men, who were on the car at the back, testified that they saw, from the back of the car, a boy lying on the roadway. One of these men was an employee of the defendant, but did not report the matter, as he did not connect it at the time with anything to do with the street railway.\nThe evidence of the infant plaintiff, and also the evidence of a girl of nine years of age (called on behalf of the plaintiffs; and of a girl of seven years of age (called on behalf of the defendant) was given not under oath, as provided for in s. 19 of The Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 87, which reads as follows:\n19. (1) In any legal proceeding where a child of tender years is offered as a witness, and such child does not, in the opinion of the judge, justice or other presiding officer, understand the nature of an oath, the evidence of such child may be received, though not given upon oath if, in the opinion of the judge, justice or other presiding officer, as the case may be, such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of the evidence, and understands the duty of speaking the truth.\n(2) No case shall be decided upon such evidence alone, and such evidence must be corroborated by some other material evidence.\nThe jury found that the motorman \"was negligent by not being on a proper lookout,\" and judgment was entered for the plaintiffs for damages.\nThe Appellate Division[2], by a majority, reversed the judgment at trial, on the ground that, although the evidence established that the boy was run over by the street car in question at the place alleged, and as a result lost his leg, yet there was no evidence to corroborate the story of the infant witnesses for the plaintiffs going to show that the accident was caused by negligence of the defendant's motorman, and such corroborative evidence was necessary in order for the plaintiffs to succeed. Hyndman J.A., whose judgment was concurred in by Harvey C.J.A., and Mitchel J.A., said, in the course of his judgment (after referring to authorities):\nIn these cases it would appear that what is meant by \"other material evidence,\" is material to the issue to be sustained by the party to be corroborated. In the case at bar since the substantial issue is negligence, it must mean, material to the issue of negligence. Every particular, of course, need not, and in most cases could not, be corroborated, but in some substantial respect the negligence complained of must be. It is not sufficient that some particular of the evidence given in the case be corroborated unless it is connected with the issue of negligence.\nJust how this accident happened, apart from the infants' evidence, is to my mind left to conjecture and capable of different theories, and there is not the necessary corroboration of their testimony touching the heart of the question or issue involved in the action, namely, negligence.\nBeck and Clarke JJA., dissented from the judgment of the majority of the Appellate Division.\nThe plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nA. M. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.\nW. S. Ball K.C. for the respondent.\nCounsel for the appellant was stopped by the Court, and on the conclusion of the argument of respondent's counsel the judgment of the Court was orally delivered by ANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014We are all of the opinion that the appeal must succeed, the judgment of the Appellate Division be set aside, and the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiffs restored. Apart altogether from the question of corroboration, we are of opinion that there was sufficient in the evidence of the motorman himself, under the circumstances, to justify the jury in drawing the inference that he was negligent. There is, in any case, corroboration of the boy's story of what happened just before the accident, sufficient to enable the jury to say that a proper watch was not kept. Their finding is that there was not a sufficient lookout. That finding is sustained by the evidence, and should not have been disturbed. The appeal is allowed, as indicated, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1928] 1 W.W.R. 815.\n[2] [1928] 1 W.W.R. 815.\n"}

Beique, [1929] S.C.R. 19\nDate: 1928-06-12\nArsene Messier and Another (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nHortensias Beique (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1928: May 9; 1928: June 12.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nTransfer of shares\u2014Certificate remaining with transfer or\u2014Consideration\u2014 Services rendered\u2014Donation\u2014Remuneratory donation\u2014Amount transferred exceeding value of services\u2014Nullity\u2014Arts. 754, 776, 804, 806 808 C.C.\nThe respondent is a broker dealing in bonds and industrial securities and for some years had business transactions with one P.D. by way of exchanging, selling or buying bonds for him. Some time before his death, P.D. signed a blank form generally known as a \u201cPower of Attorney for transfer of bonds\u201d, thus transferring to the respondent 180 shares of a certain industrial company valued at $18,000; and, on the same date, the respondent \u201caccepted the * * * shares (therein) mentioned and so transferred.\u201d P.D. retained possession of the certificate of shares until his death. The respondent then claimed, by an action in revendication, from the appellants, the testamentary executors of the estate of P.D., the ownership and possession of the certificate. In his pleadings as well as in his testimony at the trial, the respondent alleged that he had attended to the business of P.D. for many years and had never been paid for his services; that in acknowledgment and in payment of the services thus rendered, P.D. made several wills in which he favoured the respondent but which were revoked owing to the influence of M., one of the appellants; that, in lieu of the legacies, P.D. had transferred the above shares to respondent, the whole transaction to be kept secret in order to avoid any intervention from M.; and that it was for that reason that P.D. did not hand over to the respondent the certificate of shares to be registered.\nHeld that the transfer of shares to the respondent fell within the category of remuneratory donations (donations r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires), i.e., donations having for their object the compensation for services rendered by the donee to the donor. As the amount of the transfer to the respondent exceeded the value of the services rendered by him to P.D., the transfer was subject to the same formalities as those prescribed in the case of a gift inter vivos, which are of public order and prescribed by the code under pain of nullity. These formalities not having been fulfilled by the respondent, the gift must be declared null, reserving to the respondent any right he may have to make a claim for the value of his services.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Trahan J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in revendication.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and P. St-Germain K.C., for the appellants.\nRod.

Leur valeur nominale est de $100 chacune; et la preuve est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, lors de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, leur valeur totale \u00e9tait de $18,000.\nLa revendication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie sur le document sous seing priv\u00e9 que voici: Procuration pour transfert d\u2019obligations\nJe soussign\u00e9 Pierre Dionne, d\u2019Iberville, d\u00e9clare avoir c\u00e9d\u00e9 contre valeur, et je transf\u00e8re par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 Hortensius B\u00e9ique, de Chambly Bassin, les actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es suivantes de La National Ciment Compagnie, 180 actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de $100 n08 Al12, au montant global de dix-huit mille dollars et enregistr\u00e9es en mon nom dans les livres de la Compagnie de Ciment Nationale, et je, par les pr\u00e9sentes, constitue et nomme irr\u00e9vocablement comme mon procureur le fiduciaire de la Compagnie de Ciment Nationale, lequel j\u2019autorise \u00e0 faire et signer pour moi et en mon nom tous les actes n\u00e9cessaires pour effectuer le transfert desdites actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es et au besoin se substituer une ou plusieurs personnes, avec les m\u00eames pouvoirs. Je ratifie et confirme d\u2019avance tout ce que mondit procureur ou son d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 feront l\u00e9galement en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes.\nEn foi de quoi, j\u2019ai sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Iberville ce vingt-septi\u00e8me jour d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1925.\nPierre Dionne.\nLe 27 ao\u00fbt 1925.\nT\u00e9moin:\u2014J\u2019accepte les actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es et leur transfert.\nHortensius B\u00e9ique.\nEn apparence, ce document implique une vente ou au moins une dation en paiement par Dionne \u00e0 B\u00e9ique. C\u2019est ainsi que l\u2019a vu la Cour du Banc du Roi; et, comme cons\u00e9quence, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que la revendication du certificat d\u2019actions \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\nMais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait envisag\u00e9 la cause d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. B\u00e9ique est un courtier en obligations; et, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait l\u2019agent d\u2019une maison de finance qui faisait le commerce des actions et des obligations par ventes ou par \u00e9changes. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que l\u2019\u00e9crit dont il s\u2019agit e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme une constitution de pouvoirs par Dionne en faveur de B\u00e9ique pour lui permettre d\u2019\u00e9changer les 180 actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de la Compagnie de Ciment Nationale contre d\u2019autres effets de corporations municipales ou de finance, de commerce ou d\u2019industrie. Mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, la preuve d\u00e9montrait que l\u2019on \u00e9tait en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une donation. Il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle parce qu\u2019elle manquait des formalit\u00e9s essentielles.\nC\u2019est, suivant nous, dans ce dernier aspect de la cause qu\u2019il nous faut chercher la solution qui nous est demand\u00e9e. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous inqui\u00e9ter de savoir ce qui serait arriv\u00e9 si l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019en \u00e9tait tenu exclusivement au document que M. Dionne lui avait remis. Il ne s\u2019en est pas tenu \u00e0 cela, et il a lui-m\u00eame plac\u00e9 le litige sur un autre terrain. Il a cru devoir d\u00e9clarer la \u201cvaleur\u201d qu\u2019il avait donn\u00e9e pour les actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es que M. Dionne lui a \u201ctransf\u00e9r\u00e9es.\u201d Voici comment il s\u2019en est expliqu\u00e9 d\u2019abord dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite:\n3. Pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es il a vu aux affaires dudit feu Pierre Dionne, s\u2019en est occup\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 de ses services, a fait des transactions pour lui sans n\u2019avoir jamais re\u00e7u de commissions, alors qu\u2019il aurait eu le droit de s\u2019en faire payer par lui, le consultant continuellement; en un mot, il \u00e9tait son homme de confiance;\n4. En reconnaissance et en paiement des services rendus et de ce qu\u2019il lui devait pour les causes et raisons mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ci-dessus, ledit feu Pierre Dionne a fait plusieurs testaments dans lesquels il a avantag\u00e9 le demandeur, mais il les r\u00e9voquait parce que, disait-il, le d\u00e9fendeur Messier, aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il apprenait qu\u2019il avait fait des testaments, avait assez d\u2019influence aupr\u00e8s de lui pour les lui faire r\u00e9voquer; \u00e0 la fin, fatigu\u00e9 de voir que ledit d\u00e9fendeur Messier avait connaissance de ses testaments et les lui faisait r\u00e9voquer, ledit feu Pierre Dionne, au lieu d\u2019avantager le demandeur dans son dernier testament, lui transporta les actions mentionn\u00e9es dans * * * la d\u00e9claration en disant au demandeur qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait que lui qui conna\u00eetrait le transfert desdites actions qu\u2019il lui faisait, et que, si d\u2019autres en avaient connaissance, c\u2019est que le demandeur en aura parl\u00e9, car personne autre que lui ne serait au courant de ce transfert avant sa mort; c\u2019est pourquoi ledit feu Pierre Dionne n\u2019a pas remis au demandeur ledit certificat n\u00b0 A 112 pour lesdites actions, afin que le demandeur ne puisse en op\u00e9rer l\u2019enregistrement, tel enregistrement devant avoir pour effet de faire conna\u00eetre ledit transfert audit d\u00e9fendeur Messier;\n5. Ledit transfert a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en reconnaissance et en paiement des services rendus par le demandeur audit feu Pierre Dionne.\nPuis, en r\u00e9ponse sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 l\u2019objection des appelants que le pr\u00e9tendu transfert invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait absolument informe et insuffisant \u00e0 sa face pour constituer une donation valable: qu\u2019en outre il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 au d\u00e9sir de la loi, ce qui rendait absolument nulle une donation mobili\u00e8re de ce genre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis que le transfert n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9, en ajoutant cependant qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas besoin de l\u2019\u00eatre.\nAu proc\u00e8s, voici comment B\u00e9ique a relat\u00e9 les circonstances qui avaient accompagn\u00e9 la remise du transfert par M. Dionne:\nVoici, Monsieur Dionne m\u2019avait dit qu\u2019il me paierait tout mon travail que je faisais pour lui d\u2019un seul montant, comme je viens de le dire, d\u2019un seul coup, alors un jour il me dit qu\u2019il m\u2019avait plac\u00e9 sur son testament, alors quand j\u2019ai vu que M. Dionne \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 me payer le travail que je ferais pour lui, j\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 faire dans ce sens l\u00e0, et un jour en 1925 Monsieur Dionne s\u2019est plaint \u00e0 moi qu\u2019il ne pouvait plus faire de testament en ma faveur, ou qui m\u2019avantagerait, sans qu\u2019un nomm\u00e9 \u201cMessier le sache et vienne chez lui l\u2019influencer pour me faire sortir de son testament, par des menaces, etc., il me dit je ne peux plus dormir c\u2019est toujours \u00e0 recommencer \u00e0 tous les soirs, \u00e7a fait 7 \u00e0 10 fois que je change, il le sait, en parlant de Messier, il le sait toujours, et c\u2019est toujours \u00e0 recommencer, l\u00e0 il me dit: \u201cJe vais r\u00e9gler mes affaires avec vous, je vais vous enlever de sur mon testament, et je vais vous faire un transfert d\u2019un montant pour r\u00e9gler ma dette envers vous,\u201d alors il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 l\u00e0 de lui pr\u00e9parer un document dans ce sens l\u00e0, j\u2019ai pris un blanc de papier pour pr\u00e9parer cela \u00e0 sa demande, \u00e7a demandait peut-\u00eatre quelqu\u2019un de plus que moi en loi pour faire cela, mais enfin, en regardant mes papiers j\u2019ai vu une formule de transfert que j\u2019avais dans ma poche, et apr\u00e8s lui avoir lu cette formule j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Dionne si c\u2019\u00e9tait bien cela qu\u2019il voulait faire transporter, il m\u2019a dit c\u2019est bien cela, je lui ai dit je vais me servir de ce blanc de transfert qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 imprim\u00e9 afin que vous puissiez relire votre volont\u00e9 plus facilement, alors j\u2019ai rempli le document, le blanc de transfert, et l\u00e0 Monsieur Dionne m\u2019a dit: \u201cDe cette mani\u00e8re l\u00e0 il n\u2019y aura que vous et moi qui allons le savoir. Comme cela je serai tranquille,\u201d il m\u2019a dit \u201cje vais signer ce transfert, et vous allez le garder, c\u2019est votre paiement, dormez tranquille, vous serez pay\u00e9, c\u2019est votre paiement.\u201d\nIl ressort donc de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite et du t\u00e9moignage de M. B\u00e9ique que ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s s\u00fbr de recevoir une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les services qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tendait rendre \u00e0 Dionne. Il est possible que, pour une raison ou pour une autre, Dionne ait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 de la reconnaissance pour B\u00e9ique que, dans quelques-uns de ses testaments successifs, il appelait son \u201caide et bienfaiteur\u201d. Il apprit \u00e0 B\u00e9ique qu\u2019il l\u2019avait \u201cavantag\u00e9\u201d dans son testament. C\u2019est l\u00e0 que B\u00e9ique vit, comme il le dit lui-m\u00eame, \u201cque M. Dionne \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 (lui) payer (son) travail\u201d. Mais il n\u2019y avait jamais eu entre eux de convention de paiement.\nLe 27 ao\u00fbt 1925, il lui aurait dit:\nJe vais r\u00e9gler mes affaires avec vous. Je vais vous enlever de sur mon testament et je vais vous faire un transfert d\u2019un montant pour r\u00e9gler ma dette envers vous.\nCette d\u00e9claration que B\u00e9ique met dans la bouche de M. Dionne ne cadre pas avec les faits, car, \u00e0 cette date, B\u00e9ique avait cess\u00e9 de figurer comme l\u00e9gataire sur les testaments de M. Dionne depuis le 26 d\u00e9cembre 1924. Ce jour-l\u00e0, M. Dionne fit un testament o\u00f9 Ars\u00e8ne Messier, l\u2019un des appelants, est institu\u00e9 l\u00e9gataire universel, les deux appelants, sont nomm\u00e9s ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne figure en aucune fa\u00e7on m\u00eame \u00e0 titre de l\u00e9gataire particulier.\nIl ressort encore de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite et du t\u00e9moignage de B\u00e9ique que le document qu\u2019il invoque maintenant comme transfert des actions de la Compagnie de Ciment Nationale lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en reconnaissance de certains services et fut substitu\u00e9 aux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s testamentaires dont Dionne avait jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le gratifier. Enfin, le transfert des actions devait rester secret jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la mort de Dionne. Il est tr\u00e8s certain que jusque-l\u00e0 B\u00e9ique n\u2019avait jamais discut\u00e9 avec Dionne la question de savoir s\u2019il serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 pour ses services. Aucun compte ne fut jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Aucun montant ne fut jamais mentionn\u00e9. S\u2019il fallait s\u2019en rapporter aux nombreux testaments, l\u2019on voit que Dionne lui-m\u00eame n\u2019avait aucune id\u00e9e arr\u00eat\u00e9e sur le montant qu\u2019il entendait donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le 3 septembre 1924, B\u00e9ique avait un legs de $5,000 et il devenait l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire et ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire. Le 6 septembre 1924, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus rien et il n\u2019avait aucun legs. Le 9 septembre 1924, il obtenait un legs particulier de $10,000 et il \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire et ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire conjointement avec Ars\u00e8ne Messier. Le 10 octobre 1924, son legs particulier \u00e9tait r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $5,000 et il cessait d\u2019\u00eatre l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire. Le 31 octobre, il r\u00e9apparaissait comme l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire de la moiti\u00e9 des biens de Dionne conjointement avec ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux; et il redevenait co-ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire avec Ars\u00e8ne Messier. Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1924, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire que pour un quart; et, enfin, le 26 d\u00e9cembre 1924 il disparaissait compl\u00e8tement du testament comme ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, comme l\u00e9gataire universel et comme l\u00e9gataire particulier. Il n\u2019y eut plus d\u2019autres testaments jusqu\u2019au 27 ao\u00fbt 1925, date du transfert que B\u00e9ique invoque maintenant.\nDe toutes ces circonstances volontairement expliqu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, il r\u00e9sulte que la disposition dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de la part de Dionne rentre dans la cat\u00e9gorie des donations r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires.\nLaurent (vol. 12, n\u00b0 333) les d\u00e9finit ainsi:\n333. Les donations r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires sont celles qui ont pour objet de r\u00e9compenser les services rendus par le donataire au donateur.\nCes donations peuvent se diviser en trois classes:\n1. Celles o\u00f9 les services ne sont pas appr\u00e9ciables en argent. Dans ce cas, la disposition est une v\u00e9ritable lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et elle est soumise aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires des donations;\n2. Celles o\u00f9 la donation n\u2019exc\u00e8de pas la valeur des services. C\u2019est un contrat on\u00e9reux qui peut \u00eatre valablement fait sans observer les formalit\u00e9s des donations;\n3. Celles o\u00f9 la donation exc\u00e8de les services. Elle n\u2019a pas pour but seulement de payer le donataire, mais aussi de \u201ct\u00e9moigner par une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 la reconnaissance que le disposant ressent \u00e0 raison de ces services\u201d. Elles sont soumises aux formalit\u00e9s prescrites pour les donations entrevifs. (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit fran\u00e7ais, nos 3448 et suiv.).\nIl s\u2019ensuit que, dans chaque cas de donation r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoire, il y a lieu d\u2019\u00e9tablir la proportion entre les services rendus et la gratification dont le donataire est l\u2019objet. Sans doute on sera moins exigeant quant \u00e0 la preuve de ces services et \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de leur valeur. Il ne s\u2019agira pas de requ\u00e9rir entre eux et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration une \u00e9quivalence exacte et pr\u00e9cise. Mais, d\u2019autre part, l\u2019on ne saurait dire qu\u2019il appartient exclusivement au donateur de fixer souverainement cette valeur au montant qu\u2019il entend accorder au donataire, que sa d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9finitive et d\u00e9fend de chercher la v\u00e9ritable nature et le vrai caract\u00e8re de la disposition.\nAutrement (comme le dit Pothier (Bugnet, 3e \u00e9d. vol. 8, p. 380), il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 au pouvoir du notaire et des contractants d\u2019\u00e9luder, quand ils voudraient, la disposition de l\u2019ordonnance (N.B. Il parle ici de l\u2019ordonnance de 1731, art. 20, qui porte que \u201cm\u00eame les donations r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires doivent \u00eatre insinu\u00e9es; l\u2019art. 806 C.C. est au m\u00eame effet) en ins\u00e9rant dans l\u2019acte une \u00e9nonciation de services qui, par la suite, serait devenue de style, et aurait rendu la loi sans effet.\u201d\nSans doute, le donateur est libre de donner la somme qu\u2019il veut; mais si elle est hors de proportion avec les services rendus, il ne fait plus un paiement, il fait une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, et nous sommes alors en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un acte de donation. Il ne peut d\u00e9guiser sa lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 sous la couleur d\u2019un acte \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux et la soustraire par l\u00e0 aux prescriptions imperatives du Code.\nIl ne faut pas oublier, en effet, que sous le Code civil (art. 754) \u201con ne peut disposer de ses biens \u00e0 titre gratuit que par donation faite entrevifs ou par testament\u201d; et les dispositions du code qui imposent aux donations une forme sp\u00e9ciale sont d\u2019ordre public et s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9 (Art. 776 C.C.).\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[1], signale l\u2019attitude des tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\nsi elle ne le d\u00e9clare pas formellement, semble du moins indiquer que les donations devraient suivre les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019un acte notari\u00e9 et d\u2019un enregistrement et que l\u2019exception du second paragraphe de l\u2019article 776, qui rend possible une dangereuse clandestinit\u00e9, devrait \u00eatre bien strictement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e.\nMonsieur le juge Pelletier, qui fait cette remarque, ajoute:\nL\u2019esprit de notre loi, c\u2019est que l\u2019on doit disposer de ses biens par testament ou bien les laisser \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes en ne faisant pas de testament; et que, si on veut faire une donation entrevifs, on lui donnera l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 et la publicit\u00e9 qui sont une protection n\u00e9cessaire.\nEt M. le juge Carroll, commentant l\u2019article 808 du Code civil, dit:\nCet article contient une disposition de droit nouveau qui n\u2019existe pas, ni dans l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, ni au Code Napol\u00e9on. Cet article d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que les donations d\u2019effets mobiliers sont exempt\u00e9es de l\u2019enregistrement, lorsqu\u2019il y a tradition r\u00e9elle et possession publique par le donataire.\nEn droit fran\u00e7ais, l\u2019on n\u2019exige, pour la validit\u00e9 de ces donations, que la tradition r\u00e9elle seulement, tandis que notre droit a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 cette condition de validit\u00e9 la possession publique par le donataire.\n* * * * *\nJe ne crois pas avoir besoin de d\u00e9finir ce que l\u2019on doit entendre par possession publique; qu\u2019il suffise de dire que la donation d\u2019effets mobiliers pour \u00eatre valable ne doit pas \u00eatre clandestine et connue seulement du donateur et du donataire, comme dans ce cas-ci.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 dessein que nous avons reproduit les passages qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent pour d\u00e9montrer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point (sauf la question du don manuel qui ne se pr\u00e9sente pas ici, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu tradition du certificat des actions) O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[2], pr\u00e9sente de l\u2019analogie avec la cause qui nous occupe. Il n\u2019est pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019ajouter que cet arr\u00eat fut approuv\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9[3].\nLe principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de cette d\u00e9cision avait d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire d\u00e8s 1874 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de Richer v. Voyer[4].\nLa diff\u00e9rence entre les diverses classes de donations r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e par Pothier. Au volume 8 de l\u2019\u00e9dition Bugnet, n\u00b0 87, apr\u00e8s avoir dit:\nIl y avait peu lieu de douter que les donations r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoires, qui contiennent une \u00e9num\u00e9ration vague de services incertains, dussent \u00eatre sujettes \u00e0 l\u2019insinuation * * *.\nIl ajoute:\n88. Il y aurait plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des donations qui seraient faites par r\u00e9compense de services certains, et d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par l\u2019acte de donations. N\u00e9anmoins celles-ci sont aussi sujettes \u00e0 l\u2019insinuation, si les services, en r\u00e9compense desquels la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, quoique constants, sont des services qui ne sont pas appr\u00e9ciables \u00e0 prix d\u2019argent, et pour lesquels le donataire n\u2019aurait aucune action contre le donateur pour en \u00eatre r\u00e9compens\u00e9; car, quoiqu\u2019une donation faite pour r\u00e9compense de tels services, ne soit pas si parfaite que la donation simple, n\u00e9anmoins c\u2019est toujours vraiment une donation, puisque le donateur donne, sans qu\u2019il soit besoin de donner. C\u2019est ici, liberalitas nullo jure cogente facta.\nQue si les services, en r\u00e9compense desquels la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, \u00e9taient constants et appr\u00e9ciables \u00e0 prix d\u2019argent, mais que le prix desdits services f\u00fbt inf\u00e9rieur en valeur \u00e0 la chose donn\u00e9e, ce serait encore une donation, qui, faute d\u2019insinuation, serait nulle, sauf au donataire d\u2019exercer ses actions pour se faire payer du juste prix des services rendus par lui.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit donc de d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, si le transfert que Dionne a fait \u00e0 B\u00e9ique \u00e9tait un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux ou une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 en tout ou en partie. Cette d\u00e9cision ne peut d\u00e9pendre \u00e9videmment\u2014et c\u2019est Pothier qui nous le rappelait plus haut\u2014du nom dont les parties ont qualifi\u00e9 leur contrat, mais de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du contrat qu\u2019ils ont vraiment fait.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 (nous dit Laurent (vol. 12, n\u00b0 336), une question de faits que les tribunaux d\u00e9cideront d\u2019apr\u00e8s les circonstances de la cause. Dans l\u2019application, le juge est n\u00e9cessairement influenc\u00e9 par les faits; les services sont-ils r\u00e9els et m\u00e9ritent-ils une r\u00e9compense, le juge cherchera \u00e0 maintenir l\u2019acte, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019il renfermerait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9; les services ne sont-ils pas \u00e9tablis, ou paraissent-ils suspects, le juge s\u2019armera de la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la loi pour annuler la donation r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoire comme vici\u00e9e en la forme.\nC\u2019est un principe reconnu par la Cour de cassation que le caract\u00e8re r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratoire d\u2019une donation est laiss\u00e9 essentiellement \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des juges du fonds (Schauer v. Fortmann)[5].\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il ressortait\ndes circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve que le demandeur est venu en possession de l\u2019\u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 (qui fait la base de son action) sans avoir fourni au dit Pierre Dionne bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration.\nB\u00e9ique a entrepris de d\u00e9tailler les services qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir rendus \u00e0 Dionne. Il s\u2019est surtout tenu dans les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s. La description qu\u2019il en a donn\u00e9e fait plut\u00f4t penser \u00e0 \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nonciation vague de services incertains\u201d dont parle Pothier. Les seules pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il ait fournies se rapportent \u00e0 des transactions par lesquelles il a vendu \u00e0 Dionne ou \u00e9chang\u00e9 pour lui des actions de compagnies industrielles ou des obligations de corporations municipales. Il agissait alors comme l\u2019agent de la maison de finance qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait et il fut pay\u00e9 par cette maison; ou il agissait comme courtier pour son compte personnel, et il a per\u00e7u les commissions que les courtiers re\u00e7oivent d\u2019ordinaire en pareils cas. Dans ces derniers cas, il a m\u00eame remis \u00e0 Dionne la moiti\u00e9 de sa commission. A cet \u00e9gard, on peut dire qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s content d\u2019avoir la client\u00e8le de Dionne et que cela fut tr\u00e8s avantageux pour lui.\nEn outre, B\u00e9ique s\u2019est occup\u00e9 d\u2019un proc\u00e8s intent\u00e9 par Pierre Dionne pour faire annuler un acte de donation. Il para\u00eet avoir fait certaines tentatives, qui ont d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9chou\u00e9, pour effectuer le r\u00e8glement de ce proc\u00e8s. Ce sont l\u00e0 tous les services dont B\u00e9ique parle dans son t\u00e9moignage. Ce sont les seuls, en tout cas, dont il y ait au dossier la moindre preuve susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e par une cour de justice. Ils sont hors de toute proportion avec le montant des actions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es. B\u00e9ique estime que ces actions repr\u00e9sentent une somme de $18,000. Il y a donc eu lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et donation et nous croyons que le juge du proc\u00e8s a fait une juste appr\u00e9ciation des faits sous ce rapport. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la preuve qu\u2019il avait devant lui \u00e9tait certainement de tel ordre qu\u2019il ne conviendrait pas \u00e0 un tribunal d\u2019appel d\u2019en faire une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente.\nCe n\u2019est pas d\u2019ailleurs ce que la Cour du Banc du Roi a fait. Elle a pris la position qu\u2019il ne lui appartenait pas de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de la valeur des pr\u00e9tendus services rendus par B\u00e9ique, et que c\u2019\u00e9tait exclusivement l\u2019affaire de Dionne. Cela \u00e9tait vrai du moment que Dionne voulait faire une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9; mais, dans ce cas, il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 d\u2019adopter la forme exig\u00e9e par la loi.\nNous partageons donc l\u2019avis de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur cette question. D\u2019accord avec la doctrine, nous prenons le point de vue le plus favorable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Pour les besoins de la cause, nous supposerons qu\u2019il ait rendu quelques services. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a jug\u00e9 que le transfert \u00e9tait sans consid\u00e9ration aucune. Sans peut-\u00eatre aller aussi loin, nous ne trouvons rien au dossier qui nous permette d\u2019\u00e9viter la conclusion que ce transfert exc\u00e8de \u00e9norm\u00e9ment les services auxquels B\u00e9ique a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Dans ces circonstances, l\u2019opinion la plus accr\u00e9dit\u00e9e et que nous adoptons, c\u2019est que le contrat est indivisible et constitue une donation pour le tout. Il est soumis tout entier aux formalit\u00e9s des donations (Laurent, tome 12, n\u00b0 337). Le contrat que l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque n\u2019est donc pas en la forme voulue (Art. 776 C.C.). De plus, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 au bureau du domicile du donateur, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la donation (Art. 804 C.C.). Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il le f\u00fbt; et les appelants avaient int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 invoquer ce d\u00e9faut (Art. 806 C.C.).\nNous sommes d\u2019avis de faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nMais, pour le cas o\u00f9 il y aurait une part de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration r\u00e9elle dans la donation que nous d\u00e9clarons nulle, nous croyons devoir suivre la marche indiqu\u00e9e par Pothier dans le passage que nous avons cit\u00e9 plus haut (vol. 8, n\u00b0 88). Nous allons r\u00e9server \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 \u201cd\u2019exercer ses actions pour se faire payer du juste prix des services\u201d qu\u2019il a pu rendre, s\u2019il y a lieu.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Monty, Duranleau, Angers & Monty.\n[1] dans chaque cas\n[2] Q.R. 28 K.B. 332.\n[3] (1922) 1 A.C. 90.\n[4] (1874) 5 R.L. 591; L.R. 5 P.C. 461.\n[5] (1860) s. 62.1.599.\n"}

A judgment creditor of P. subsequently brought both the house and the land under execution. Upon an opposition to the seizure filed by the respondent, judgment was rendered declaring the latter the owner of the land, and P. the owner of the building. The house alone was sold by the sheriff and bought by the appellant who subsequently forced P. to vacate the premises. The respondent then brought an action asking that the appellant should be ordered to remove the building within a certain delay. The appellant contested this action, setting up his ownership of the house under the sheriff\u2019s deed. He further claimed that he was not bound to vacate the premises unless reimbursed his expenses. The trial judge decided that under these circumstances the appellant could keep the house on the respondent\u2019s land as long as it subsisted, but he gave the respondent the option to purchase the house for $1,800, the amount at which he valued it. This judgment was set aside by the Court of King\u2019s Bench which held that the appellant was a possessor in bad faith within the meaning of articles 412 and 417 C.C., but allowed him a delay of 15 days to remove the house, failing which removal the house would belong without compensation to the respondent. The appellant having appealed from this latter judgment.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 44 K.B. 536), that articles 412 and 417 C.C. have no application to this case, nor can the appellant be treated as a possessor in bad faith of the house. The appellant, on the contrary, being the owner of the house by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s deed and the judgment on the opposition, can, under all the circumstances, keep it on the respondent\u2019s land. The court, however, in view of the appellant\u2019s offer in his plea, granted the respondent a delay of six months to purchase the house from the appellant at the amount at which it was appraised by the trial judge.\nAPPEAL, by special leave, from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[2], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, d\u2019Auteuil J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL.

L\u2019appelant a obtenu de cette cour la permission de porter sa cause devant nous, \u00e0 la condition de s\u2019engager \u00e0 payer les frais de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans cette cour, quel que soit le r\u00e9sultat de son appel.\nLa situation de fait qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au proc\u00e8s est la suivante.\nLe nomm\u00e9 Hector Potvin est le gendre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Madame V\u00e9zina. Voulant se b\u00e2tir une r\u00e9sidence au village de la rivi\u00e8re du Moulin, il s\u2019est abouch\u00e9 avec les propri\u00e9taires d\u2019un terrain, et avant m\u00eame d\u2019avoir conclu avec eux une convention de vente, il a commenc\u00e9 sa maison par la construction des fondations en ciment. Or il s\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00e9pris sur l\u2019emplacement que les propri\u00e9taires entendaient lui conc\u00e9der, et ceux-ci refus\u00e8rent de lui consentir un titre. C\u2019est alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour aider ses enfants, dit-elle, acheta le terrain o\u00f9 se trouvait la construction, et avec son plein consentement Potvin acheva \u00e0 ses frais, ou du moins en s\u2019endettant dans ce but, la maison dont il s\u2019agit en cette cause. L\u2019emplacement achet\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e mesure 50 pieds de largeur par une profondeur moyenne de 134 pieds, soit une superficie totale de 6,700 pieds. La maison construite par Potvin n\u2019occupe qu\u2019une partie de ce terrain, car le contrat de construction la d\u00e9crit comme \u201cun carr\u00e9 de 36 pieds par 27 mesure en dehors\u201d. C\u2019est l\u2019appelant qui en a entrepris la construction pour Potvin lequel, lorsqu\u2019elle fut achev\u00e9e, s\u2019y \u00e9tablit avec sa famille.\nApr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9rection de la maison, un cr\u00e9ancier de Potvin obtint un jugement contre ce dernier et fit saisir la maison et le terrain o\u00f9 elle se trouvait. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie fait voir qu\u2019on a saisi tout le terrain achet\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u201cavec les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances\nLe sh\u00e9rif ayant donn\u00e9 des avis de vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 saisie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fit opposition \u00e0 la saisie et vente de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et son opposition fut contest\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ancier saisissant qui, apr\u00e8s avoir ni\u00e9 le titre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, all\u00e9gua que \u201csi toutefois le terrain n\u2019appartient pas au d\u00e9fendeur (Potvin), la b\u00e2tisse qui y est \u00e9rig\u00e9e lui appartient et que l\u2019opposition est mal fond\u00e9e au moins pour cette partie, la dite b\u00e2tisse ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 construite par le d\u00e9fendeur avec des mat\u00e9riaux achet\u00e9s par lui\u201d (analyse de la contestation dans le jugement sur l\u2019opposition).\nLe litige engag\u00e9 sur l\u2019opposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9e fut termin\u00e9 par un jugement du juge Tessier en date du 10 avril, 1924. Ce jugement d\u00e9clare que l\u2019opposante (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle est propri\u00e9taire du terrain sur lequel repose cette maison; que les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ce terrain appartiennent au d\u00e9fendeur (Potvin); que les b\u00e2tisses sont susceptibles d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 un autre que le propri\u00e9taire du sol, et que la loi admet l\u2019existence de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des constructions s\u00e9par\u00e9e de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain sur lequel elles reposent; que l\u2019opposition est bien fond\u00e9e quant au terrain et ne l\u2019est pas quant aux b\u00e2tisses. Par ces motifs, la cour\nmaintient l\u2019opposition quant au terrain saisi, et maintient la contestation de la dite opposition quant aux b\u00e2tisses, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances saisies, chaque partie devant supporter ses frais.\nA la suite de ce jugement, le sh\u00e9rif vendit les b\u00e2tisses, et l\u2019appelant s\u2019en porta adjudicataire pour la somme de $901, se trouvant ainsi \u00e0 tous les droits du d\u00e9fendeur Potvin (art. 780 C.P.C.).\nMuni de son titre du sh\u00e9rif, l\u2019appelant fit d\u00e9guerpir Potvin de la maison, et c\u2019est alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9e intenta contre lui la pr\u00e9sente action par laquelle elle conclut \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire du terrain, et \u00e0 ce que l\u2019appelant soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9guerpir de ce terrain, d\u2019enlever les b\u00e2tisses qui s\u2019y trouvent et d\u2019en abandonner la possession \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e sous 15 jours de la signification du jugement \u00e0 intervenir.\nL\u2019appelant se d\u00e9fend en all\u00e9guant que la maison fut construite par Potvin pour lui-m\u00eame du consentement expr\u00e8s et tacite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de son mari, et qu\u2019il l\u2019a poss\u00e9d\u00e9e animo domini et Ta habit\u00e9e seul avec sa famille, ne payant loyer \u00e0 qui que ce soit. Il invoque la saisie, l\u2019opposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le jugement susdit du juge Tessier. Il all\u00e8gue aussi qu\u2019il a achet\u00e9 la maison du sh\u00e9rif, met en fait que la maison a co\u00fbt\u00e9 $2,034.66, et il conclut \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette maison lui appartient, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ne soit pas tenu de d\u00e9guerpir avant d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9 des am\u00e9liorations, savoir $2,034.66, et \u00e0 ce que l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nSur la contestation ainsi engag\u00e9e le juge d\u2019Auteuil a rendu jugement d\u00e9clarant l\u2019intim\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire du terrain, sujet au droit de l\u2019appelant d\u2019y maintenir la maison aussi longtemps qu\u2019elle durera. Il a aussi donn\u00e9 acte de l\u2019offre de l\u2019appelant d\u2019abandonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison en par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en payant \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la valeur, que l\u2019honorable juge fixe \u00e0 $1,800. C\u2019est la m\u00eame \u00e9valuation de la maison que nous trouvons dans le jugement du juge Tessier sur l\u2019opposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le savant juge \u00e9valuant le terrain de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 $700. L\u2019appelant accepte cette \u00e9valuation de la maison, puisque, dans son factum,\u201d il nous demande de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure fut infirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc du Roi qui renvoya la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019appelant, accordant toutefois \u00e0 ce dernier, suivant l\u2019offre faite par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la facult\u00e9 d\u2019enlever la maison du terrain de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sous quinze jours de la signification du jugement, la maison, faute de tel enl\u00e8vement, devant rester sans indemnit\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nIl a paru utile de faire une rapide analyse de ces diverses proc\u00e9dures afin d\u2019en d\u00e9gager la question qui se pr\u00e9sente pour solution. Cette question est de savoir si l\u2019appelant peut garder sur le terrain de l\u2019intim\u00e9e la maison qu\u2019il a achet\u00e9e du sh\u00e9rif et qui indubitablement lui appartient.\nLa cour du Banc du Roi, pour repousser les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelant, se base sur les articles 412 et 417 et suivants du Code civil, d\u00e9cidant que le d\u00e9fendeur, ainsi que Potvin son auteur, \u00e9taient des possesseurs de mauvaise foi.\nJe ne puis accepter ce motif. Ces articles, \u00e0 mon avis, ne sont pas applicables \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Notamment l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas un possesseur de mauvaise foi au sens de l\u2019article 412 C.C. Le titre en vertu duquel il poss\u00e8de la maison est la vente du sh\u00e9rif faite conform\u00e9ment au jugement du juge Tessier. Le titre de Potvin \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison \u00e9tait l\u2019autorisation de b\u00e2tir qu\u2019il a obtenue de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ainsi que la construction \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens de cette maison. On ne peut dire que ces titres soient des titres vicieux. Ce sont, au contraire, des titres valables, et reconnus tels par le jugement sur l\u2019opposition, susceptibles de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 celui qui en est investi un droit immobilier de la nature d\u2019un droit de superficie. Voyez la d\u00e9finition du droit de superficie qui\nconsiste \u00e0 avoir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9difices ou plantations reposant sur un terrain qui appartient \u00e0 autrui. Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Superficie, n\u00b0 1.\nLes articles 412 et 417 C.C. sont hors de cause. Je puis sur ce point citer Baudry-Lacantinerie et Chauveau, Biens, n\u00b0 372:\nL\u2019art. 555 statue en vue de constructions faites \u00e0 l\u2019insu du propri\u00e9taire du terrain. Si les constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 sa connaissance et surtout avec son autorisation, il ne pourra pas les revendiquer comme lui appartenant, ni forcer le constructeur \u00e0 les d\u00e9molir. Il intervient, en pareil cas, entre le propri\u00e9taire du terrain et le constructeur un contrat sui generis, en vertu duquel le propri\u00e9taire du sol autorise le constructeur \u00e0 jouir des constructions pendant un certain temps, autant qu\u2019elles dureront. Il y a cr\u00e9ation au profit du constructeur d\u2019une sorte de droit de superficie.\nToute doute qu\u2019il aurait pu y avoir sur la question de savoir si l\u2019autorisation de b\u00e2tir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Potvin a \u00e9t\u00e9 inspir\u00e9e par une pens\u00e9e de simple tol\u00e9rance, soit \u00e0 raison des liens de famille qui l\u2019unissaient \u00e0 lui, soit parce qu\u2019elle esp\u00e9rait qu\u2019il pourrait acheter d\u2019elle et lui payer l\u2019emplacement occup\u00e9 par sa maison,\u2014se trouve \u00e9cart\u00e9 dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce par suite du jugement sur l\u2019opposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la saisie pratiqu\u00e9e contre Potvin. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019envisager ce jugement comme formant chose jug\u00e9e\u2014car cette pr\u00e9tention n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant\u2014mais on peut au moins dire que c\u2019est un titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison. En d\u2019autres termes, le jugement reconna\u00eet \u00e0 Potvin la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison qu\u2019il a b\u00e2tie. Le droit ainsi constat\u00e9 au benefice de Potvin profite \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, son ayant cause, tant en raison du principe que l\u2019ayant cause jouit de tous les droits et actions que son auteur avait acquis dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la chose \u00e0 laquelle il a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 (Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., tome 2, p. 97), qu\u2019en vertu de la r\u00e8gle formelle de l\u2019article 780 C.P.C. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019appelant est propri\u00e9taire de cette maison, ce qui ne doit pas s\u2019entendre simplement des mat\u00e9riaux qui sont entr\u00e9s dans sa construction, mais de la maison elle-m\u00eame, comme maison, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire comme immeuble par sa nature.\nCette conclusion fait bien voir que nous ne pouvons maintenir le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Avec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis d\u2019opinion, pour les raisons que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9es, d\u2019infirmer ce jugement et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Je crois cependant qu\u2019il convient de fixer un terme pendant lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourra acqu\u00e9rir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison de l\u2019appelant en lui payant la somme de $1,800, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019option que 1a cour sup\u00e9rieure lui a donn\u00e9e. Je lui accorderais \u00e0 cette fin un d\u00e9lai de six mois \u00e0 partir de la signification du jugement de cette cour, pass\u00e9 lequel elle sera d\u00e9chue de cette option.\nL\u2019appelant aura les frais de la Cour du Banc du Roi, mais, suivant la condition de la permission d\u2019appel qu\u2019il a obtenue, il devra payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ses frais devant cette cour.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Elz\u00e9ar L\u00e9vesque.\n[1] Reporter\u2019s Note.\u2014The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this court on the condition that he would pay to the respondent the costs of appeal in any eventi. 24th February, 1928.\n[2] (1928) Q.R. 44 K.B. 536.\n"}

Eug. Lafleur K.C. for the motion.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The Gatineau Power Company applied to the Quebec Public Service Commission for authority to expropriate\na portion of the lot twenty-four in the fifteenth range of the township of Hull * * *, a power-house and a portion of the penstock connecting the said power-house with the dam on Meech\u2019s Creek and forming part of a water-power known as Meech\u2019s Creek power,\nbelonging to Freeman T. Cross.\nIt is alleged that the development of the applicant company\u2019s water-power at Chelsea Falls would have the effect of submerging these lands, constructions and water-power, which have a permanent force of less than two hundred horse-power.\nThe petition was made under section 28k of the Public Service Commission Act (R.S.Q. 1925 c. 17 as amended by 16 Geo. V, c. 16, s. 6).\nThe Quebec Public Service Commission refused to give the authorization applied for.\nUnder the Public Service Commission Act, an appeal lies to the Court of King\u2019s Bench as follows:\n58. An appeal shall lie to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) in conformity with article 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, from any final decision of the Commission, upon any question as to its jurisdiction, or upon any question of law, except in expropriation matters, but such appeal may be taken only by leave of a judge of the said court, given upon a petition presented to him within fifteen days from the rendering of the decision, or from the homologation thereof in cases where the same is required, notice of which petition must be given to the parties and to the Commission within the said fifteen days. The costs of such application shall be in the discretion of the judge.\nAn application for leave to appeal under the above section was made to a Judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, who granted it.\nOn motion of Cross, however, the full court subsequently quashed the order for leave on the ground that this was an appeal \u201cin expropriation matters,\u201d which are specially excepted from the jurisdiction of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe Gatineau Power Company then served notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and Cross now moves to quash for want of jurisdiction. The appeal is from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench only and the question to be decided on the motion is therefore: Whether an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment rendered in a provincial court where the appeal to that court was quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nSince the amendments to the Supreme Court Act (10-11 Geo. V., c. 32) which came into effect on the first day of July, 1920, and \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by sections thirty-seven and forty-three\u201d (which have no application here):\nno appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from a judgment rendered in any provincial court in any proceeding unless,\u2014\n(a) the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars; or\n(b) special leave to appeal is obtained as hereinafter provided.\n(i.e. from the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the judicial proceeding was originally instituted).\nHere, no special leave to appeal was obtained. In order therefore to entertain jurisdiction, this court must find that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars.\nThe matter in controversy in this appeal, as we have seen, is whether in the premises there exists a right of appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench from the decision of the Quebec Public Service Commission refusing to allow the expropriation.\nShould we come to the conclusion that such right exists, all that we could do would be to remit the case to the Court of King\u2019s Bench to be there heard on the merits. In turn, the only question then to be decided by the Court of King\u2019s Bench would be whether the Quebec Public Service Commission was right in holding, as it did, that it had no jurisdiction, under section 28k of c. 16 of the statute of 1926, to authorize the expropriation of an established industry or of a water-power already developed. Assuming this was held otherwise by the Court of King\u2019s Bench or by us on a further appeal, the application would return before the Commission, which might or might not then authorize the expropriation. Its order, in any event, would be made in the exercise of judicial discretion. Thus, the whole matter in controversy, even if traced back to the Commission\u2014and we do not think it should be\u2014is merely the right to have that body entertain an application for authority to expropriate. Such right is not appreciable in money. Still less so is the right of appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench which is the sole matter in controversy on the projected appeal here. The consequence of the authorization by the Commission might result in a proceeding in which the amount involved would exceed two thousand dollars; but the ultimate award on the expropriation is not the matter in controversy in this appeal; and, as was said in Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements de Qu\u00e9bec: (1)\nour jurisdiction does not depend on the possible consequence of a possible judgment.\nWe have no jurisdiction in this case as it now stands. The motion must be allowed and the appeal quashed with costs.\nMotion granted with costs.\n"}

The appellants attacked the committing order, mainly on the ground that M., the Examiner who committed them (and whose adjudication was, on appeal, affirmed by Harris C.J., who, however, set aside the warrants issued and directed the issue of a new warrant), had no jurisdiction, as his appointment was void. S. 1 of c. 30, 1923, provided for the appointment of one or two Examiners for the city of Halifax. The Act was to come into force on a day to be fixed by proclamation. C. 54 of 1924, passed May 9, 1924, repealed s. 1 of c. 30, 1923, and substituted another section providing for the appointment of one or two Examaminers for the city of Halifax. On May 23, 1924, it was proclaimed that c. 30, 1923, as amended, should come into force on June 1, 1924. On the same day\u2014May 23, 1924\u2014M. was appointed as an Examiner for the city of Halifax. Appellants contended that his appointment was void, because made under the authority of a statute that was not in force at the time of his appointment.\nHeld (affirming the judgments below) that the proclamation that c. 30, 1923, as amended, should come into force on June 1, 1924, had the same effect as if that date had been fixed by the statute itself as the date when it should become effective as law; and it was common ground that in the latter case appointments could be made in anticipation of the statute coming into force; the proclamation made that certain which had been contingent; it must be presumed that everything was done regularly unless the contrary was shown; the proclamation and order of appointment bore the same date and were gazetted the same day; and it must be presumed that the proclamation preceded the appointment; the appointment was, therefore, valid, and this ground of appeal failed.\nHeld, also, that the appeal failed on the other grounds taken; as to the contention that the evidence before the Examiner and, on appeal, before Harris C.J., did not disclose any fraud within the meaning of s. 27, subs. 1 (a) and (d) of The Collection Act, it was held that the evidence could not be gone into for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was anything in it to warrant the finding of fraud; the principle of the decision in R. v. Nat. Bell Liquors, Ltd. [1922] 2 A.C. 128, applied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, dismissing, on an equal division of the court, the present appellants\u2019 appeal from the refusal by Mellish J. of their application, on the return of a summons for a writ of habeas corpus, to discharge them from custody in the county jail at Halifax, where they were imprisoned under an order of Harris C. J., under The Collection Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 232.\nThe appellants, against whom a judgment had been obtained for $8,400.40, were examined under The Collection Act before Richard A. MacLeod, Esq., who made two warrants of commitment, dated February 16, 1928, one against each appellant, committing him to gaol for six months or until he should pay the debt, on the ground that he \u201cfraudulently contracted such debt, intending at the time of the contracting of said debt not to pay the same.\u201d These warrants were signed by Mr. MacLeod as \u201cA Commissioner of the Supreme Court in and for the County of Halifax and an Examiner under The Collection Act for the City of Halifax. An appeal was taken, and was heard by Harris C. J., who confirmed the adjudication of Mr. MacLeod, but directed that the two warrants of commitment be set aside and that one warrant be issued, and that against both appellants, to keep them and each of them for the term of six months (to commence February 16, 1928) or until they or either of them should pay the debt.\nA summons was taken out on appellants\u2019 behalf for a writ of habeas corpus, and, on its return, Mellish J. refused their application for discharge from custody; and their appeal from his order was dismissed by the Court en banc, on equal division of that court. They then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Special leave to take such appeal was granted by the Court en banc.\nThe main ground of attack on the committing order (and the only ground on which there was a difference of opinion in the Court en banc) was that Mr. MacLeod had no jurisdiction, as his appointment as Examiner was void, and that the order of Harris C. J., on appeal, was likewise void, for want of jurisdiction in the Examiner. Other grounds were taken, including the grounds that the order of Harris C. J., was bad on its face, as showing that a Commissioner originally acted in the examination, such Commissioner being forbidden so to act (in the order of Harris C.J., Mr. MacLeod was designated as \u201ca Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia\u201d and not as Examiner); and that the evidence taken before Mr. MacLeod, and Harris C. J., on appeal, did not disclose any fraud within the meaning of s. 27, subs. 1 (a) and (d) of The Collection Act.\nChapter 30 of the Acts of 1923. (An Act to amend The Collection Act, R.S.N.S. 1900, c. 182), passed April 23, 1923, provided, by s. 1 (adding a subsection to s. 5 of said c. 182), that\nThe Governor in Council may appoint a person to be a functionary or two persons to be functionaries respectively for the purposes of this Act in the city of Halifax, each such functionary to be called \u201cAn Examiner under the Collection Act for the city of Halifax. The Act (c. 30 of 1923) was to come into force on a day to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor-in-Council. On May 9, 1924, before such proclamation was made, Chapter 54 of the Acts of 1924 (An Act to amend c. 30 of 1923, and The Collection Act, c. 232, R.S.N.S. 1923) was passed. By s. 1 of that Act, s. 1 of c. 30, 1923, was repealed, and there was substituted a provision that\nThe Governor in Council may appoint one or more persons to be a functionary or functionaries respectively for the purposes of this Chapter in the city of Halifax, each such functionary to be called \u201cAn Examiner under The Collection Act\u2019 for the city of Halifax.\u201d.\nBy proclamation dated May 23, 1924, it was declared that c. 30 of 1923, as amended, should come into force on June 1, 1924. On the same day\u2014May 23, 1924\u2014Mr. MacLeod was appointed to be an Examiner under The Collection Act for the City of Halifax.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellants that the appointment of Mr. MacLeod was void, because made under the authority of a statute that was not in force at the time of his appointment.\nIn the Court en banc, Chisholm J., with whom Graham J. concurred, was of opinion that subs. 44 of s. 23 of c. 1, R.S.N.S. 1923 (The Interpretation Act), applied to c. 30 of 1923, and that it was proper to appoint Mr. MacLeod as Examiner as was done. Jenks J., with whom Carroll J. concurred, took a different view.\nA. H. Russell K.C. for the appellants.\nNo one appeared for the respondents.\nAt the conclusion of the argument for the appellants, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C. J. C.\u2014It is not necessary to reserve judgment in this case. We are all of the opinion that the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Chisholm in the court below is correct. The basis of his judgment is that the proclamation that the amendments to the Debt Collection Act should come into force and operation on a date therein named had the same effect as if that date had been fixed by the statute itself as the date when it should become effective as law. It is common ground that in the latter case appointments could be made in anticipation of the statute coming into force. The proclamation made that certain which had been contingent. It must be assumed that everything was done regularly in such a case as this unless the contrary is shewn. The proclamation and order of appointment bear the same date and were gazetted on the same day. It must be presumed that the proclamation fixing the date for the Act to come into force preceded the making of the appointment.\nAs to the other points taken\u2014if some of them are open to review at all here, which we very much doubt\u2014I do not think they call for any extended opinion from us.\nThe suggestion that the examining officer is wrongly designated in the order of the learned Chief Justice is scarcely worthy of consideration. His jurisdiction being clear, it is of little moment that there is not precise accuracy in his designation. He was a well known official, and there can be no doubt as to the capacity in which he acted. It was as Examiner under the Statute.\nThe evidence cannot be gone into for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was anything in it to warrant the finding of fraud. The principle of the decision in Rex v. Nat. Bell Liquors Ltd. (1) applies. The sole question of importance is that of the validity of the Examiner\u2019s appointment, and of that we entertain no doubt.\nThe appeal is dismissed, and, as no one appeared for the respondent, without costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J. H. Power.\n"}

The King, [1929] S.C.R. 42\nDate: 1928-12-06\nEldon Barton (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Defendant) Respondent.\n1928: December 6.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Indictment containing three counts, charging: manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 268); causing grievous bodily injury (Cr. C., s. 284); and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving, etc., of motor vehicle (Cr. C., s. 285)\u2014Acquittal on first two counts, and conviction on third count\u2014Joinder of counts\u2014Right of jury to find guilty on third count, while finding not guilty on other counts.\nThe appellant was tried on an indictment containing three counts (referring to the same occurrence), viz., (1) manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 268); (2) causing grievous bodily injury (Cr. C., s. 284); and (3) causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving, etc., of a motor vehicle (Cr. C., s. 285). The jury found him not guilty on the first and second counts, but guilty on the third count. From the affirmance by the Appellate Division, Ont., of his conviction on the third count, he appealed, on the ground that, as the facts upon which the three counts were based were the same as to each of the three offences charged, it was not open to the jury, after acquitting him upon the first two counts, to convict him upon the third.\nHeld: It was open to the jury to find as they did. It was permissible to join the other counts to the first one charging manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 856). Whether the three counts should be tried together was in the discretion of the trial judge (Cr. C., s. 857). Had appellant been charged only with manslaughter, but so described as to include the offences charged in the said second and third counts, then, under s. 951, Cr. C., he could properly have been convicted of either of these latter offences, as \u201cother offences\u201d the commission of which was included in the offence \u201cas charged in the count,\u201d if, in the jury\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe whole offence charged was not proved.\u201d (R. v. Shea, 14 Can. Cr. Cas. 319, if it implies the contrary, overruled). In the case at bar, that the jury had found that the whole offence charged either in the first count or in the second count had not been proved, was an intendment which must be made in support of the verdict; and it was within the jury\u2019s province so to find, while finding that the offence charged in the third count was proved; and it was not open to this Court to consider the evidence for the purpose of determining whether upon it the jury, as reasonable men, could have negatived the existence of any element necessary to constitute either of the offences charged in the first and second counts, consistently with their finding of guilty on the third count.\nR. v. Forseille, 35 Can. Crim. Cas. 171, overruled.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (35 Ont. W.N. 172; Middleton J.A. dissenting) affirmed.\nSmith J. dissented, agreeing with the dissenting judgment of Middleton J.A., in the Appellate Division, and with the judgment in R. v. Forseille, and holding that, where injuries have been caused by the accused to a deceased person (as found in this case) and these injuries have caused the death, as was unquestionably so in this case, counts under ss. 284 and 285, Cr. C., should not be allowed to go to the jury; an acquittal on the charge of manslaughter is necessarily a finding that there was no criminal negligence, which negligence is necessary to constitute a crime under ss. 284 and 285.\nAPPEAL by the defendant under section 1023, and, by leave of Lamont J., under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, from the affirmance of his conviction by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Mr. Justice Middleton dissenting[1].\nThe question raised is whether, as was decided by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Forseille[2] when an accused is tried on a charge containing two counts, one for manslaughter and the other for causing grievous bodily harm, the second count should not be allowed to go to the jury; and, a jury having found him not guilty of manslaughter but convicted him on such second count, the conviction must be quashed.\nIn the case at bar the appellant was acquitted on the first two counts and was convicted on the third count in the following indictment:\n1. That [he] at the Township of Sandwich East, in the County of Essex, on the sixteenth day of September, 1928, did unlawfully kill and slay one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to section 268 of the Criminal Code.\n2. That [he, at the place and on the date aforesaid] by an unlawful act, or by doing negligently or omitting to do an act which it was his duty to do, did cause grievous bodily injury to one, Albert J. Strockean, contrary to section 284 of the Criminal Code.\n3. That [he, at the place and on the date aforesaid] having charge of a motor vehicle, by wanton or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, did cause or caused to be done, bodily harm to one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to section 285 of the Criminal Code.\nAs authorized by subs. 5 of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code, Middleton, J.A., adverting to the view to the same effect which he had expressed in R. v. Stark[3] delivered a dissenting judgment, avowedly to enable the appellant to appeal as of right to this Court. The sole ground of this dissent is expressed in these terms:\nThis case seems to me to be one well illustrating the difficulty resulting from what I humbly think is a departure from sound principle. The unfortunate victim was undoubtedly killed as the result of the accident. If his death was the result of the fault of the accused, the crime was manslaughter. He has been acquitted and as the death and the fact that the death resulted from the accident are not disputed, the finding of not guilty can only mean that in the opinion of the jury the death was not caused by the misconduct of the accused.\nSimilarly the finding of not guilty on the second count, that of causing grievous bodily harm, must mean that in the opinion of the jury the bodily harm unquestionably sustained by the deceased was not caused by the misconduct of the accused.\nThe finding of guilt on the third count must, in the light of the finding on the other counts, mean that the jury understood that it had the right to find this man guilty of the lesser offence while acquitting him of the only offence of which it was open to them to find him guilty upon the evidence. The only relevant ground of appeal to the Appellate Divisional Court is thus stated in the judgment of the majority of that Court delivered by Orde, J.A.:\nThat, as the facts upon which the three counts are based are the same as to each of the three offences charged, it was not open to the jury after acquitting the accused upon the first two counts, to convict him upon the third.\nAfter alluding to the fact that the Appellate Divisional Court had in the Stark case[4] declined to follow the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Forseille[5], Orde, J.A., proceeds:\nIt may be difficult to understand how upon the evidence in a particular case a jury could come to the conclusion that the accused had by his negligence done bodily harm to another and at the same time acquit him of manslaughter. But it is not open to us in my opinion to approach the matter in that way. The question is one of law simply, and I can see no legal reason for saying that a verdict of guilty of doing bodily harm is bad because upon the same state of facts the Appellate Court, not the jury, thinks it ought to have convicted the accused of manslaughter.\nThe relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are as follows:\n856. Any number of counts for any offences whatever may be joined in the same indictment, and shall be distinguished in the manner shown in form 63, or to the like effect: Provided that to a count charging murder no count charging any offence other than murder shall be joined.\n857. When there are more counts than one in an indictment each count may be treated as a separate indictment.\n2. If the court thinks it conducive to the ends of justice to do so, it may direct that the accused shall be tried upon any one or more of such counts separately: Provided that, unless there be special reasons, no order shall be made preventing the trial at the same time of any number of distinct charges of theft, not exceeding three, alleged to have been committed within six months from the first to the last of such offences, whether against the same person or not.\n898. Every objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer, or motion to quash the indictment, before the defendant has pleaded, and not afterwards, except by leave of the court or judge before whom the trial takes place, and every court before which any such objection is taken may, if it is thought necessary, cause the indictment to be forthwith amended in such particular, by some officer of the court or other person, and thereupon the trial shall proceed as if no such defect had appeared.\n2. No motion in arrest of judgment shall be allowed for any defect in the indictment which might have been taken advantage of by demurrer, or amended under the authority of this Act.\n907. On the trial of an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict to any count or counts, if it appear that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in charge, and that he might on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been made which might then have been made, have been convicted of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, the court shall give judgment that he be discharged from such count or counts.\n2. If it appear that the accused might on the former trial have been convicted of any offence of which he might be convicted on the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, but that he may be convicted on any such count or counts of some offence or offences of which he could not have been convicted on the former trial, the court shall direct that he shall not be convicted on any such count or counts of any offence of which he might have been convicted on the former trial, but that he shall plead over as to the other offence or offences charged.\n951. Every count shall be deemed divisible; and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.\n2. On a count charging murder, if the evidence proves manslaughter but does not prove murder, the jury may find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but shall not on that count find the accused guilty of any other offence.\nS.W. Springsteen for the appellant.\nE. Bayly, K.C., for the respondent.\nAfter hearing counsel for the appellant and the Court having retired for consideration of his argument, the Chief Justice, without calling on counsel for the respondent, announced that a majority of the Court was of the opinion that the appeal failed and should be dismissed.\nSubsequently the following reasons for judgment were delivered.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN, C.J.C.\u2014The only question open on this appeal is whether in law it was competent to the jury to convict the accused on the third count of the indictment while finding him not guilty on the first and second counts. No ground of appeal involving a question of fact, or mixed fact and law can be considered here (s. 1023, Cr. C.). Whatever the evidence may disclose, all findings or intendments of fact necessary to support the verdict must now be made. Thus, it must be assumed that the jury, while it found that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused while having charge of a motor vehicle, by wanton or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, did cause or caused to be done, bodily harm to one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to Section 285 of the Criminal Code.\nnevertheless deemed such evidence insufficient to warrant a finding that some other elements or ingredients necessary to constitute either of the offences charged in the two other counts of the indictment, on which they returned a verdict of not guilty, were also proven. Especially must this be the case when, as here, the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury as to what constituted each of the two offences of which they acquitted the accused.\nWhile, sitting here and considering the evidence as reported, we may find it difficult to appreciate how the jury, finding that the accused by doing an unlawful act had caused bodily harm to Strockean, could, death having ensued, acquit him of manslaughter, we cannot give effect to such a view without invading the realm of fact, which is closed to us by the statute.\nHaving regard to the provisions of s. 856 of the Criminal Code, and notably to the proviso thereto, it was, in our opinion, clearly permissible for the Crown to join counts nos. 2 and 3 to the first count charging manslaughter. Whether the three counts should be tried together was in the discretion of the trial judge (s. 857, Cr.C.).\nUnder s. 951, had the accused been charged only with manslaughter, but so described as to include the offences charged in counts nos. 2 and 3 of the indictment now fore us, he could properly have been convicted of either of these latter offences as \u201cother offences\u201d the commission of which was included in the offence \u201cas charged in the count,\u201d if, in the opinion of the jury, \u201cthe whole offence charged was not proved.\u201d If R. v. Shea[6], implies the contrary, that decision cannot be supported. In a case such as that at bar, that the jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count no. 1 nor the whole offence charged in count no. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we must make in support of the verdict. Moreover, had the accused been tried on an indictment framed as above indicated though charging manslaughter only, and been acquitted, and had he been sub- sequently charged upon the same facts with either of the offences set forth in the second and third counts, he could successfully have pleaded autrefois acquit (s. 907 (2), Cr. C.). No harm can result from the indictment expressly charging the two lesser offences set forth in the second and third counts respectively, of either of which the jury might have convicted the accused upon an indictment charging manslaughter only, but so describing that offence as to include such lesser offences. Moreover, any objection to the indictment on the ground of the unlawful inclusion in it of counts nos. 2 and 3, if tenable, should have been the subject of a demurrer or motion to quash the indictment under s. 898 of the Code.\nWhatever may be the powers of the provincial appellate courts in that regard, it is not open to this court to consider the evidence for the purpose of determining whether upon it the jury, as reasonable men, could have negatived the existence of any element necessary to constitute the offence of manslaughter, or the offence charged in the second count, consistently with their finding of guilty on the third count. It is clearly impossible to say as a matter of law that in no case where manslaughter is charged can a jury convict of some lesser offence included in that charge as laid, or that an indictment may not contain counts charging such lesser offences as well as the offence of manslaughter, which the evidence may not prove. It was within the province of the jury to find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire, some essential element of each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was, in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt.\nSMITH J. (dissenting).\u2014With great respect I differ from the view expressed by the Chief Justice in this case. I am in accord with the view taken in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Forseille[7], and by Mr. Justice Middleton in this case. Where the death of a person is caused by the criminal negligence of another, the crime is manslaughter. Sections 284 and 285 have no application, in my opinion, in such a case, as they are only applicable where the injuries have not caused death. Where injuries are caused by the accused to a deceased person (as has been found here), and these injuries have caused the death, as was unquestionably the case here, I agree with the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, and Mr. Justice Middleton, that counts under sections 284 and 285 should not be allowed to go to the jury.\nIn such case an acquittal on the charge of manslaughter is necessarily a finding that there was no criminal negligence, which negligence is necessary to constitute a crime under sections 284 and 285. It is, in my opinion, not proper in such a case to endeavour to entice a jury to convict the accused by presenting to it an option to convict of a lesser offence, not warranted by the facts, because it may be thought more easy to get a conviction for such lesser offence. It is an invitation to the jury to stultify themselves as the jury in this case has done, by first finding that the accused was not guilty of criminal negligence, and then that he was so guilty. It is said that the jury may have concluded that the injuries did not cause the death. If they made such a finding, it was contrary to all the evidence, and should be set aside.\nThe jury concluded that the accused was guilty of criminal negligence, and, had it not been for the holding up to them of the option of convicting either for the real crime or a lesser crime, they would in all probability have convicted for the real crime. At all events the crime committed by the accused, if any, was manslaughter and nothing else, and he was entitled to a trial and a verdict on that charge, untrammelled by the introduction of minor charges of which he could not, in my opinion, be properly convicted on the facts.\nIn submitting a count for the lesser offence to the jury in such a case, the prosecution is in effect saying to the jury, \u201cThe accused is first charged with having, through criminal negligence, killed the deceased, which is the very serious crime of manslaughter, of which you may not be inclined to convict him. There is, however, a less serious offence charged, which has nothing to do with the killing of the deceased. Under that count the only question is, did the accused, by criminal negligence in driving his auto- mobile, inflict bodily harm on the deceased? If you conclude that he did, you may disregard the killing altogether, and convict him of the minor offence under this count.\u201d\nWhere there is a real question as to whether or not the injuries inflicted by the accused caused the death, the case is entirely different, and the alternative counts are quite proper. In that case it would be the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury that if they found criminal negligence, they must then find whether or not death resulted from the injuries inflicted by the accused, and that if they should find that death did result from these injuries, they must convict of manslaughter, but if they should find that death did not result from this cause, they should convict of an offence under s. 284 or s. 285.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McTague, Clark & Racine.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.H.

Marie, Ontario, stating a case for the opinion of the Court and naming the parties to it, and, further, from the refusal by the said Local Master of Titles at Sault Ste. Marie of the appellant\u2019s application to have Susanna Norella Brownlee registered as owner, as executrix under the will of Emily Court, deceased, of the land registered as parcel 469, Algoma. The land was located by Frederick Henry Court in 1877, under the Free Grants and Homesteads Act. In 1892 he obtained a patent from the Crown. He died, intestate, in 1920, being then the registered owner of the land. His widow, Emily Court, was duly appointed his administratrix, and in 1921 was registered as owner of the land as administratrix of his estate. She did not remarry and did not elect to claim dower in the land. She died in June, 1926, leaving a will, by which she devised all her real estate to James Hincks Court, the present appellant, and appointed Susanna Norella Brownlee her executrix, to whom probate issued accordingly.\nThe appellant based his claim upon the provisions of s. 47 of The Public Lands Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 28 (now s. 48 of c. 35, R.S.O. 1927) which reads as follows:\nOn the death of the locatee, whether before or after the issue of the letters patent, all his then interest and right in the land shall descend to, and become vested in, his widow during her widowhood in lieu of dower, but the widow may elect to have her dower in the land in lieu of this provision.\nThe appellant contended that, under that section, the said Emily Court, the locatee\u2019s widow, took, on the locatee\u2019s death, a fee simple estate in the said land, determinable on her remarriage, and that, not having remarried, she died seized in fee of the land, and that the same passed to the appellant under her will, and that her executrix was entitled to be registered as owner in fee simple as executrix.\nAt the conclusion of the argument for the appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondents, the Court orally delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, holding that under said s. 47 the estate conferred on the widow is a life estate determinable on her remarriage.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJ.E.

Plaintiff sued defendant, attacking said legislation as ultra vires, as providing for indirect taxation, and claimed damages, an injunction, etc.\nHeld that, as the notice which defendant had given under s. 53 contained no reference to appraisal of \"interests\" in land or of any interest separate from that of the owner, and said nothing as to persons claiming any estate or interest in the land, or any charge or encumbrance thereon, and as no taxes, charges, etc., other than those imposed upon the land itself, were notified to the owner, and there was nothing in the notice to indicate or suggest any intention or project to impose a tax upon any person, other than the owner, having any estate or interest in the land, the taxation effected could not, on giving the proper interpretation and effect to the provisions of ss. 51 and 53 of the Act, extend beyond the land and the owner thereof; and that the taxation effected upon the land and the owner was direct, and intra vires of the legislature.\nCity of Halifax v. Fairbanks, [1928] A.C. 117, at pp. 124-126, cited and applied.\nAtt. Gen. of Manitoba v. Att. Gen. of Canada [1925] A.C. 561, distinguished, having regard to the nature of the statutory provisions in question. In the present case, while the statute provides imperatively for the appraisal of the land, and for the taxation of the land and of the owner, it is left to the Board's discretion (except where the fee is still in the Crown) to appraise interests other than that of the owner; and no taxation is intended, or can be effected, of any estate or interest which is not appraised and described in the notice issued by the Board, by means of which notice the taxation is effected; the legislature itself has, therefore, plainly provided for the \"partition\" which was lacking in the Manitoba case, by confiding a discretion to the Board to tax or not to tax persons, other than the owner, claiming any estate or interest in the lands or any charge or encumbrance thereon. In the present case the defendant Board did not include persons interested other than the owner, and there was no evidence that it had, in any case, ever availed itself of the power; it was unnecessary, therefore, to consider what would be the nature of a tax imposed on other persons. Even assuming that such a tax would be indirect, a good tax is not to be held bad merely because the legislature had mistaken its powers so far as in terms to confer upon the Board an ultra vires power which the Board did not exercise.\nSs. 51 (1) and 53 of the Act discussed at length, with regard to their interpretation and effect.\nSince persons claiming any charge upon the land are specially provided for in subs. 2 of s. 53 (the provision imposing the tax), that special provision may be regarded as a \"requirement of the context\" which, in relation to that subsection, excepts the definition of \"owner\" in the Land Registry Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 127, s. 2) from the application to that subsection provided for in subs. 6 (a) of said s. 53.\nHeld further (per Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.; Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. not passing upon the question) that the defendant Board had capacity to be sued in respect of the claim for an injunction with regard to the alleged ultra vires proceedings. By reference to its powers and duties provided by the Act and the business in which it is directed or empowered to engage, there is ample evidence of the convenience and necessity of a power to sue and be sued; such a power may be inferred or implied like any other power which is necessary or incidental to the due execution of the powers expressed. (Graham v. Public Wks. Commrs., [1901] 2 K.B. 781, at p 791; Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 1, s. 23 (13), cited). While it is true that the revenues of the Crown cannot be reached by judicial process to satisfy a demand against an officer or servant of the Crown in any capacity, whether incorporated or not, it is common practice, founded upon general principle, that the court will interfere to restrain ultra vires or illegal acts by a statutory body, and, when it is charged, as in this case, that the proceedings in question, though authorized by the letter of the statute, are nevertheless incompetent, by reason of defect in the enacting authority of the legislature, the court has jurisdiction so to declare, and to restrain the ultra vires proceedings, although directed by the statute and in strict conformity with the legislative text (Nireaha Tamaki v. Baker, [1901] A.C., 561, at pp. 575-6, cited).\nJudgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (39 B.C. Rep. 523) affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , which allowed the defendant's appeal, and dismissed the plaintiff's cross-appeal, from the judgment of Morrison J., and dismissed the plaintiff's action. The defendant Board was created under the Land Settlement and Development Act, Statutes of British Columbia, 1917, c. 34, which, with amending statutes, was consolidated as c. 128 of R.S.B.C. 1924. The sections of the Act hereinafter referred to are those of c. 128 of R.S.B.C. ss1924 (as amended).\nThe matters in question in this action arose under sections 46 to 55, inclusive, of the said Act. The plaintiff complained of proceedings taken by the defendant in respect of lands in and to which the plaintiff claimed an estate or interest as registered owner and as an unpaid vendor. It complained that the defendant had taken proceedings under the provisions of s. 53 of the Act and had claimed against the plaintiff penalty taxes and works and performance of obligations in respect of such lands, and that the defendant had certified to the provincial collector of taxes amounts of penalty tax alleged to be payable, and that thereby, and by proceedings consequent thereon, and by defendant's acts generally, which resulted, as alleged, in the breaking up of the plaintiff's colonization business, the destroying of land values, and the breaking of contracts and abandoning of holdings by purchasers from the plaintiff, the plaintiff had suffered loss, injury and damages.\nBy par. 7 of the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant's acts and proceedings under s. 53 of said Act were illegal, invalid, unlawful and void, for the reason that (a) the said Act was ultra vires; (b) in the alternative, ss. 46 to 55, both inclusive, were ultra vires; (c) the Acts, c. 42 of 1918, c. 41 of 1919, c. 41 of 1920, and c. 23 of 1925 (said Acts enacting amendments to the Land Settlement and Development Act) were ultra vires.\nIn par. 12 of the statement of claim the plaintiff alleged that subs. 2 of s. 53 of said Act was ultra vires, by reason of the fact that the liabilities, charges, taxes and duties thereby created and imposed were indirect, being created against and imposed upon the miscellaneous group comprising and including the owner and all persons claiming any estate or interest in any land affected by the subsection and all persons having any estate or interest in such land or any charge or encumbrance thereon, so that there was no direct tax imposed upon the person who it was intended or desired should pay it. The plaintiff claimed a declaration that sections 46 to 55, both inclusive, of the Act were ultra vires, and that the defendant's acts and proceedings against the lands and against the plaintiff were illegal, and it claimed damages, an injunction, an account, and a decree adjudging the plaintiff and its lands absolutely freed from all past and pending proceedings of the defendant.\nThe defendant, in its defence, set out that it was a branch of part of the Department of Agriculture of the Government of the Province and was a servant or agent of the Crown, and as the Land Settlement Board it possessed no other capacity, and its every act and proceeding as alleged was its act and proceeding in said capacity as servant and agent of the Crown and not otherwise, and submitted that it was not liable to be sued in respect of said acts and proceedings, and that the plaintiff's remedy (if any) was by petition of right; that defendant was not liable, in its capacity as Land Settlement Board or as servant or agent of the Crown or otherwise in its official capacity, to be sued in respect of any of the matters complained of; it denied plaintiff's allegations; and alleged that all its acts and proceedings were done and carried out under the provisions of the said Act, and not otherwise, and without malice.\nBy on order of D. A. Macdonald J., the following points of law raised by the pleadings were directed to be set down for hearing before the trial, namely\n1. Whether the defendant is liable to be sued in respect of any of the matters complained of in this action.\n2. Whether the plaintiff's claim discloses any cause of action.\n3. Whether the Land Settlement and Development Act, and in particular the provisions thereof referred to in par. 7 of the plaintiff's statement of claim, are ultra vires the legislature of the province.\nThe said points of law came on for hearing before Morrison J., who ordered that points (1) and (2) be answered in the affirmative, and that point (3) stand to be considered and determined by the judge trying the action.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal, and moved for an order or judgment setting aside the whole of the judgment of Morrison J., and for judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff cross-appealed as to the failure of Morrison J. to decide question no. (3), and moved for an order or judgment setting aside the said part of his judgment and for judgment on the said part for the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal[2] held that questions (1) and (2) should be answered in the negative, and that question (3) should also be answered in the negative, as the said Act was wholly intra vires of the legislature; it accordingly allowed the defendant's appeal, and dismissed the plaintiff's cross-appeal, and dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nW. N. Tilley K.C.for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C. J. C. and Lamont J. was delivered by\nANGLIN C. J. C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Newcombe.\nI concur in what I understand to be the ground on which he maintains the judgment a quo\u2014namely, that the only tax here imposed is on the land and its owner, that that tax is, on the authority of the Judicial Committee in the recent Fairbanks case[3] , a direct tax, and that the provision in the statute authorizing it is distinct and severable from the provisions for the taxing of other interests.\nThis makes it unnecessary to consider whether the defendant is liable to be sued in the British Columbia Courts\u2014a question of some nicety, to which I should require to devote more time and attention than I am at present in a position to give before concluding that the considered judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia upon it was erroneous.\nThe judgment of Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ., was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The writ was issued on 18th May, 1927, and the plaintiff has pleaded his statement of claim, in which he complains of the imposition of taxes against his lands in the Province of British Columbia, and against him- self as the registered owner and unpaid vendor of the lands, under the Land Settlement and Development Act, c. 128, R.S.B.C., 1924, alleging that sections 46 to 55, upon which the defendant, the Land Settlement Board, relies, are ultra vires of the Legislature; and he claims a declaration, damages, an injunction, an account, and such further and other relief as the case may require.\nThe defendant, by its defence, denies the plaintiff's allegations; sets up that the alleged acts and proceedings of the defendant were done and carried out by the defendant under the provisions of the Land Settlement and Development Act, and amending Acts, and not otherwise, and without malice; avers that the defendant is a branch of the provincial Department of Agriculture, and a servant and agent of the Crown, and possesses no other capacity, and that the acts and proceedings of the defendant alleged were done and executed in that capacity, and submits that it is not liable to be sued in respect thereof, and that it cannot be sued; and the defendant, moreover, alleges that the statement of claim discloses no cause of action.\nThe plaintiff, by his reply, joined issue.\nIn this state of the case, D. A. MacDonald, J., made an order in chambers on 6th September, 1927, setting down, for hearing and disposal before the trial, three points of law, namely:\n1. Whether the defendant is liable to be sued in respect of any of the matters complained of in this action.\n2. Whether the plaintiff's claim discloses any cause of action.\n3. Whether the Land Settlement and Development Act, and, in particular, the provisions thereof referred to in paragraph 7 of the plaintiff's statement of claim, are ultra vires the Legislature of the province of British Columbia.\nThe learned judge, by his order, also directed that notice of the hearing should be given to the Attorney-General of Canada and to the Attorney-General of the Province, as required by the Constitutional Questions Determination Act. The hearing of these questions took place before Morrison J.; notice was given to the Attorneys-General, but it does not appear that either of them was represented. The parties were heard, however, and the learned judge, in his judgment of 10th November, 1927, answered the first two questions in the affirmative, and directed that the third question should stand to be determined at the trial. There was an appeal, and a cross-appeal, to the Court of Appeal, and, in the result, by order of the Court of Appeal of 6th March, 1928, the first two findings were reversed, and it was held that the third question should be answered also in the negative, as it was considered that the Land Settlement and Development Act was wholly intra vires; the defendant's appeal was allowed, and the plaintiff's cross-appeal and action were dismissed[4].\nThe plaintiff now appeals to this Court, and there are, in the view which I take, two questions of substance: first, whether the defendant has capacity to be sued in relation to the matters alleged; and, if so, secondly, whether the statutory provisions in question are in excess of provincial legislative power, as intended to authorize taxation within the province which is not direct.\nI think it advisable, if not necessary, to consider both questions, because the corporate capacity of the defendant Board was very fully discussed at the hearing, and in the provincial courts there was a difference of opinion between the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. It will be convenient to consider these questions in the order stated.\nThe Land Settlement Board, the defendant and respondent in this action, is the body incorporated by the Land Settlement and Development Act. It is upon the interpretation of this Act that the questions in dispute principally depend. Several of its sections have been amended by c. 23 of 1925. The amendments are not, I think, material for present purposes, but, as they were introduced before the action, I shall refer to the Act as amended. The Act provides that, for the purpose of administering and carrying out its provisions,\nthere shall be in the Department of Agriculture or in the Department of Lands, as may be determined from time to time by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, a Board, to be called the \"Land Settlement Board,\" which shall consist of one or more members, who shall be appointed by and receive such remuneration as may be determined by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and such Board shall be a body politic and corporate. Each member of the Board is to hold office during pleasure and to devote the whole of his time to the performance of his duties under the Act; and, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the Board may from time to time appoint and employ such appraisers, inspectors, officers and clerks as may be required for carrying out the provisions of the Act, and may prescribe their duties and determine their remuneration. The Board is to have an official seal, inscribed with the words \"Land Settlement Board of British Columbia,\" of which the courts shall take judicial notice.\nThe Minister of Finance is to advance to the Board, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, such moneys, appropriated by authority of the Legislature, as the Governor in Council may direct, and salaries and other expenses, incurred by the Board for the purposes of the Act, are, in the absence of any special appropriation available for the purpose, to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. All moneys collected or received by the Board are to be paid into a chartered bank for credit of the account of the Board, and, unless directed by the Minister of Finance to be refunded, may be expended by the Board from time to time for any of the purposes authorized by the Act. It is provided that all moneys in the hands of, or payable to, the Board, and all property whatsoever held by the Board or to which the Board is entitled, are to be \"the property of the Crown in the right of the Province, represented by and acting through the Board,\" and all moneys so payable or owing to the Board shall be recoverable accordingly as from debtors to the Crown.\nThe Board is authorized, subject to the provisions of the Act and the regulations, among other powers, to advance money by way of loan for any purpose which, in its opinion, will maintain or increase agricultural or pastoral production, and for carrying out the objects of any association which, in its opinion, will maintain or increase agricultural or pastoral production, subject to approval of the Governor in Council; and, in addition to all other powers conferred by the Act, the Board may do and perform all acts necessary and incidental to the business of lending money at interest, taking mortgages therefor and realizing on the same. The Board is empowered to take as security for loans, first mortgages upon agricultural land in the Province, but before granting any loan, it must ascertain that the loan is justified upon grounds which are specified by the statute, including the value of the security offered, estimated on the basis of agricultural productiveness; and no loan is to be made except upon appraisal and upon the approval of two members of the Board, or of one member with the concurrence of the Minister of Agriculture. Every mortgage is to contain a personal covenant on the part of the borrower for the repayment of the loan, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage. In case of the mortgagor's default, the Board is empowered to enter upon, to seize and take possession, in whole or in part, of the security for the loan, and to dispose thereof at public auction or public tender, and upon such terms and conditions as, under all the circumstances, it deems to be just; and the Board may transfer the land or other security to any purchaser it sees fit, \"and give a good and valid title thereto, notwithstanding any encumbrances which may have been placed thereon in favour of any other person.\"\nThere is a group of sections, 40 to 45 inclusive, under the sub-title Land Development and Land Settlement, which authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, from time to time, to select and grant to the Board Crown lands within the province suitable for agricultural and pastoral purposes. By section 41, the powers of the Board, to be exercised with the sanction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, are defined. They include powers to take over from the Crown, to purchase from or to obtain by exchange with private owners, or to acquire by compulsory purchase, lands within the province for agricultural or pastoral purposes; to survey, cultivate, improve and use the lands so acquired; to erect buildings; to farm the lands when necessary or desirable; to build roads and bridges for the improvement of the lands; to sell, lease or exchange the lands upon such terms as may be agreed; to buy, sell or exchange all kinds of live stock, and every kind of merchandise which may be of use or benefit to the Board in any of its undertakings; to manufacture explosives, and to construct, execute, operate and maintain any work or undertaking necessary or incidental to the exercise by the Board of any of its powers under this section. It has been shewn, in the preceding review of the legislation, that the defendant Board, which is, by the statute, made part of one of the departments of the provincial government, consists of one or more members appointed by the Crown, that each member holds office during pleasure, and that the Board is declared to be a body corporate and politic. It is not expressly enacted by the Land Settlement and Development Act that the Board may sue and be sued; but, by reference to its powers and duties, and the business in which it is directed or empowered to engage, as already briefly described, and as more fully disclosed in the text of the statute, there is, I think, ample evidence of the convenience and necessity of such a power. To reiterate specifically some of these provisions: the Board is to collect and receive moneys of the Crown; moneys payable or owing to the Board are recoverable by and through the Board as from debtors to the Crown; mortgages are to be taken in the name of the Board, and every mortgage is to contain a personal covenant by the borrower for due payment; the borrower is also to insure against fire, if required, and the loss is to be payable to the Board; the Board is authorized to engage in trade, to sell goods and merchandise at retail, to manufacture explosives and to construct works. A power to sue and be sued may, I have no doubt, be inferred or implied, like any other power which is necessary or incidental to the due execution of the powers expressed. Phillimore J., in Graham v. Public Works Commissioners[5], after referring to the convenience of the practice by which the Crown, with the consent of Parliament, establishes officials or corporations who may sue and be sued in respect of business engagements, without the formalities of the procedure necessary when a subject is seeking redress from his sovereign, said :\nNow, the only question for us is whether the Commissioners of Public Works and Buildings are not of the class of persons well described by Lindley L.J., in Dixon v. Farrer[6], as \"a nominal defendant sued as representing one of the departments of the State.\" There is no reason in principle why they should not be. As I have pointed out, there is nothing derogatory to the Crown, and there is very great convenience, in the establishment of such bodies. The mere fact of their being incorporated without reservation confers, it seems to me, the privilege of suing and the liability to be sued. But, moreover, it has become a fashion to rely upon the general interpretation Acts as sources of the express authority which a corporation exercises to sue and be sued, and, in the case of British Columbia, the enactment is to be found in R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 1, s. 23 (13), which provides that,\nIn construing this or any Act of the Legislature, unless it is otherwise provided, or there is something in the context or other provisions thereof indicating a different meaning, or calling for a different construction:\u2014\n*****\n(13) Words making any association or number of persons a corporation or body politic and corporate shall vest in such corporation:\u2014\n(a) Power to sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with, by its corporate name, to have a common seal, and to alter or change the same at its pleasure, and to have perpetual succession.\n*****\nI find nothing in the legislation \"otherwise provided,\" or \"indicating a different meaning,\" and it follows that the defendant body has capacity to sue and be sued.\nBut the question as stated is: \"Whether the defendant is liable to be sued in respect of any of the matters complained of in this action;\" and it is in substance suggested, although the suggestion is not put in this precise form, that the defendant corporation is \"an emanation from the Crown *** a delegation by the Crown of its own authority to particular individuals,\" Gilbert v. Corporation of Trinity House[7] ; and that, if it may be sued at all, it is only in its official and representative capacity; and that, as a body corporate, it furnishes no resort for relief in respect of the claims put forward in this action.\nFor myself, I see no reason to doubt that the defendant Board is sued in its official capacity. It is described and identified in the action not otherwise than by its corporate name; it is thus the corporation, and not its individual members, which is the party defendant; and as a statutory body, it has no capacity other than that which it derives from its constituting Act. I do not question the general truth involved in the proposition expressed by Bankes L.J., in Mackenzie-Kennedy v. Air Council[8] :\nIn the absence of distinct statutory authority enabling an action for tort to be brought against the Air Council, I am of opinion, both on principle and upon authority, that no such action is maintainable. The Air Council are not a corporation, and even if it were to be treated as one the respondent's position would not be improved.\nThe learned Lord Justice mentions the case of Roper v. Public Works Commissioners[9] ; and he quotes from an Irish case, Wheeler v. Public Works Commissioners[10], a passage from the judgment of Palles C.B., as follows:\nNow, if a corporation be constituted for the sole purpose of doing acts for the Crown, it is prima facie outside its powers to do anything except for the Crown, and, as in law a wrongful act cannot be done for the Crown, such a corporation is not capable of doing such wrongful act in its corporate capacity. In such a case, therefore, the wrongful act cannot be deemed that of the corporation, but must be deemed the personal act of those who committed it.\nWith these observations, however, are to be contrasted what was said by Atkin L.J., at p. 533 of the Air Council case[11] . But whatever may be said about the Air Council, and while it is certainly true that the revenues of the Crown cannot be reached by judicial process to satisfy a demand against an officer or servant of the Crown in any capacity, whether incorporated or not, it is common practice, founded upon general principle, that the court will interfere to restrain ultra vires or illegal acts by a statutory body, and, when it is charged, as in this case, that the proceedings in question, though authorized by the letter of the statute, are nevertheless incompetent, by reason of defect in the enacting authority of the legislature, the court must, I should think, have jurisdiction so to declare, and to restrain the ultra vires proceedings, although directed by the statute and in strict conformity with the legislative text. To this extent, in my view, the action is properly constituted; indeed, upon this point the authority is conclusive. In Nireaha Tamaki v. Baker, in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[12], Lord Davey, prouncing the judgment, said:\nIn the case of Tobin v. Reg.[13], a naval officer, purporting to act in pursuance of a statutory authority, wrongly seized a ship of the suppliant. It was held on demurrer to a petition of right that the statement of the suppliant shewed a wrong for which an action might lie against the officer, but did not shew a complaint in respect of which a petition of right could be maintained against the Queen, on the ground, amongst others, that the officer in seizing the vessel was not acting in obedience to a command of Her Majesty, but in the supposed performance of a duty imposed upon him by Act of Parliament, and in such a case the maxim \"Respondeat superior\" did not apply. On the same general principle it was held in Musgrave v. Pulido[14], that a Governor of a Colony cannot defend himself in an action of trespass for wrongly seizing the plaintiff's goods merely by averring that the acts complained of were done by him as \"Governor,\" or as \"acts of State.\" It is unnecessary to multiply authorities for so plain a proposition, and one so necessary to the protection of the subject. Their Lordships hold that an aggrieved person may sue an officer of the Crown to restrain a threatened act purporting to be done in supposed pursuance of an Act of Parliament, but really outside the statutory authority.\nIt is not necessary for me to consider the position of the individual members of the Board, because I hold that, as such, they are not before the Court; but, upon the authorities, it seems to be established that the doer of a wrongful act cannot escape liability by setting up the authority of the Crown, unless in proceedings by a foreigner against a British subject, in which case an exception is introduced, as appears by Feather v. The Queen[15], in which Baron Parke's charge in Buron v. Denman[16], was explained. It seems to be only in such a case that it is of any use to justify upon the authority of an act of State. Walker v. Baird[17].\nNow we come to the main point, which gives rise to the action. It is put by the third stated question, and it is maintained by the appellant that the provisions of the Land Settlement and Development Act with respect to select areas are ultra vires of the Legislature as sanctioning taxation which is not direct.\nFollowing the provisions of the Land Settlement and Development Act, to which I have already referred, there is another fascicle of clauses, entitled Settlement Areas, embracing sections 46 to 55 inclusive, by which the Board is empowered, when, in its opinion, agricultural production is being retarded by reason of lands remaining undeveloped, from time to time, with the approval of the Governor in Council, to establish a settlement area in any part of the province, and to limit that area. Notice of the establishment of any such settlement area is to be published in the Gazette and notified to the Land Registry Office of the district within which the area is established. The Board may make regulations, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, for carrying into effect the provisions of the Act with respect to any settlement area, and may enter into agreements with any person for the colonization of the settlement area, or any portion thereof. The Registrar of Titles is to file the notice and to make the prescribed notations, and this is declared to constitute notice to every person proposing to deal with, or to acquire any estate or interest in, or any charge upon, any land within the settlement area that the land is subject to the provisions of the Act, and shall put such person upon enquiry as to the proceedings which may have been taken by the Board; all subsequent registrations in respect of any parcel of land affected by such notice shall be subject to the rights, options and privileges of the Board; and the person claiming under such registration shall take the land subject to all charges and liabilities which have been imposed, or to which the land may be liable to be subjected under the Act.\nThen follows section 51, the first subsection of which should be quoted. It is as follows:\n51. (1) The Board shall, from information obtained, appraise all lands within a settlement area at such value as the Board considers the property would be taken in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor, and each parcel the subject of separate ownership shall be separately appraised either as a unit or in such sections or divisions as the Board deems advisable. The Board may from time to time, as it deems advisable, again appraise the whole or any portion of the lands within a settlement area. The Board may, if it deems it advisable, for the purposes of this Act, appraise interests in land, and it shall, in the case of land whereof the fee is still in the Crown, make a separate appraisal of the interest which has been parted with by the Crown. The latest value so established is hereinafter called the \"appraised value.\"\nSection 53 is a long one, but it is the important section, and it seems necessary to quote it. I therefore set out its provisions in full:\n53. (1) After every such appraisal the Board shall forthwith send notice thereof by registered mail to each owner of land in the settlement area, addressed to him at his last known place of residence. The notice shall contain:\n(a) A short description of the land and, if all interests are not appraised, of the estate or interest appraised;\n(b) A statement of the appraised value;\n(c) A statement that unless the owner, within thirty days from the date of the notice if the notice is addressed to a place within the Dominion or the United States of America, or within sixty days from such date if the notice is addressed to any other place, or within such further time in any case as the Board may determine, irrevocably agrees that the Board may, in its discretion, buy from him or negotiate on his behalf a sale of the land at its appraised value at any time within two years from the date of the notice, and thereafter until the Board has been notified in writing by the owner of his election to withdraw the land from sale, he shall during each year after the date of the notice be required to make and execute improvements on the land in such manner and to such extent as the Board may by regulations prescribe;\n(d) A statement that, in the event of the neglect or refusal of the owner to agree that the Board may, in its discretion, buy from him or negotiate on his behalf a sale of the land at the appraised value, and, failing such agreement, to improve the land according to the regulations of the Board, and to furnish to the Board a verified statement of such improvements as required by this section within one year from the expiration of the notice, the land shall immediately at the expiration of such year become subject in respect of that year to a penalty tax, payable to His Majesty, of five per cent, of the appraised value in addition to all other taxes imposed on the land; such tax to be payable in full in respect of that year, and thereafter to be payable in full in like manner in respect of such (sic) succeeding year so long as such neglect or refusal continues;\n(e) A statement that each owner of land within a settlement area who decides to exercise the option of improving the land in the manner prescribed by the regulations of the Board is required to furnish to the Board before the end of each year following the expiration of the notice a detailed statement, satisfactory to the Board, of the improvements made by him in respect of that year, verified by statutory declaration;\n(f) A statement that, in the event of the owner of lands within a settlement area having improved the same in accordance with the regulations of the Board for one or more years, he shall during the currency of the said regulations be required to maintain such improvements to the satisfaction of the Board, in addition to the improvements required to be made in the succeeding years;\n(g) The date of the notice, which shall be the date on which it is mailed.\n(2) Every notice mailed by the Board pursuant to this section shall have the effect of imposing upon the land described therein and upon the owner thereof, and all persons claiming any estate or interest therein or any charge or encumbrance thereon, the liabilities, charges, taxes and duties of which such owner is thereby notified, and shall be binding upon the land and upon the owner and upon all persons having any estate or interest in the land described in the notice in every respect in accordance with its terms, and every Provincial Assessor and Collector of Taxes shall, upon receipt of the certificate of the Board furnished pursuant to subsection (3), do all things necessary to assess and collect the penalty tax imposed in any case under this section. All the provisions of the \"Taxation Act\" as to the collection and recovery of taxes and all powers and proceedings which may be exercised or taken under that Act in default of payment of taxes shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to every tax imposed under this section.\n(3) The Board shall from time to time certify to the Provincial Collector of Taxes the amount of penalty tax payable in respect of any lands under the provisions of this section. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the amount of tax payable in each case, and all taxes so certified shall thereupon be deemed to be delinquent taxes within the meaning of the \"Taxation Act.\"\n(4) The Board shall file a copy of the form of notice sent with a schedule showing the persons to whom sent and the lands affected and the appraised value in the Land Registry Office, and the Registrar of Titles shall file the same under the same filing number as the notice of the establishment of the settlement area.\n(5) The regulations of the Board as to improvements and the required extent thereof shall, in case of lands held by pre-emption, be, in so far as their effect extends, in addition to the requirements of the \"Land Act.\"\n(6) \"Owner\", for the purposes of this section and of sections 55, 56, 57, and 62, shall have the following meanings:\u2014\n(a) Where the title to the land is registered, the registered owner as defined by section 2 of the \"Land Registry Act\";\n(b) Where the land is held as a pre-emption, the pre-emptor;\n(c) Where the land has been granted by the Crown but the Crown grant has not been registered, the Crown grantee;\n(d) Where the owner as defined in clauses (a), (b), and (c) is ascertained by the Board to be dead, the person upon whom the land has devolved.\nThe only other provision to which it may be desirable to refer is s. 55, which enacts that every agreement that the Board may buy from the owner, or negotiate a sale on his behalf of, the land at its appraised value, shall be in writing, and, when made with the Board by the owner, shall bind all persons having any estate or interest in the land.\nParticular attention is directed to the provisions of s. 53 that, if all interests are not appraised, the notice to the owner of the land shall contain a short description of the estate or interest appraised; that the notice is directed to the owner of the land; that, by subsection 2, the effect of the notice is to impose upon the land described therein, and upon the owner thereof, and all persons claiming any estate or interest therein, or any charge or encumbrance thereon, the liabilities, charges, taxes and duties of which such owner is thereby notified, and that the notice shall be binding upon the land, and upon the owner, and upon all persons having any estate or interest in the land described in the notice, in every respect in accordance with its terms; from which I think one may be justified to infer that it is only such estates or interests as are appraised that are affected by the section; and that, in addition to the owner, it is only the persons claiming any estate or interest in the land, or any charge or encumbrance thereon, who are iden- tified by the notice sent out by the Board that are subject to the imposition of liabilities, charges and duties, or are bound by the declared statutory effect of the notice. It is thus the notice, which the Board is directed to frame, and the substance of which is to depend upon the facts of the case, that determines whether any interest other than that of the owner is taxed.\nIt may be useful to observe that it is enacted, for the purposes of section 53, and some later sections which it is not necessary now to mention, that the word \"owner\" shall mean, where the title to the land is registered, the registered owner as defined by s. 2 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 127, and, referring to the latter provision, it is thereby enacted that\nIn this Act, unless the context otherwise requires: *** \"owner\" and \"registered owner\" mean any person registered in the book of any Land Registry Office as owner of land or of any charge on land, whether entitled thereto in his own right or in a representative capacity or otherwise.\nThe word \"owner\" occurs in several places in s. 53 of the Land Settlement and Development Act, and it will be perceived that in subs. 2 of that section, which is the provision that imposes the tax, it is the owner of the land, \"and all persons claiming any estate or interest therein, or any charge or encumbrance thereon,\" who are expressly subjected to the imposition of \"the liabilities, charges, taxes and duties,\" which are declared to be binding \"upon the land, and upon the owner, and upon all persons having any estate or interest in the land.\" And, since persons claiming any charge upon the land are specially provided for in subs. 2 of s. 53, that special provision may, I think, be regarded as a requirement of the context which, in relation to that subsection, excepts the definition of owner in the Land Registry Act from the application to subs. 2 of s. 53 of the Land Settlement and Development Act provided for in subs. 6 (a) of s. 53. Therefore it would seem that subs. 2 of s. 53 of the latter Act may be interpreted as self contained, and as not controlled or to be interpreted by the definition of \"owner\" in the Land Registry Act.\nNow the tax is five per cent on the appraised value of the land, and we know that it is the duty of the Board to appraise all lands within the settlement area, and that the Board may, \"if it deems it advisable,\" appraise interests in land, and shall, if the fee be still in the Crown, make a separate appraisal of the interest which has been parted with by the Crown. We know also that the notice to be given by the Board upon the appraisal must contain a description of the estate or interest appraised; that the taxes are imposed by the statutory operation of the notice mailed by the Board; that the taxes imposed are those of which the owner of the land is notified, and that the taxes so notified are to be\nbinding upon the land and upon the owner and upon all persons having any estate or interest in the land described in the notice, in every respect in accordance with its terms.\nThe Legislature cannot reasonably have meant that a person claiming a small charge or encumbrance upon land of considerable value should therefore become liable for a tax of five per cent. upon the value of the land; also it seems strange that, for the purpose of imposing a tax upon a person interested, other than the owner, it should be the owner of the land, and not of the separate interest, who is to be notified under subsection 2 of section 53.\nThe notice is set out in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim. According to the allegations, several of these notices were given, but they are each in the same terms, except as to the lot number and price per acre. It is not suggested that the notice is defective for lack of compliance with the statutory requirements; what is pleaded, and what was urged at the hearing, is stated in paragraph 12 of the statement of claim, which says that subsection 2 of section 53 of the Land Settlement and Development Act is ultra vires of the Legislature, because\nthe liabilities, charges, taxes and duties by the said subsection created and imposed are indirect, being created against and imposed upon the miscellaneous group, comprising and including the owner and all persons claiming any estate or interest in any land affected by the subsection and all persons having any estate or interest in such land or any charge or encumbrance thereon; so that there is no direct tax imposed upon the person who it is intended or desired should pay it.\nIt may be assumed, therefore, that the notice is valid, except for the objection so stated, and that the notice complies with the statutory requirements. Then, by reference to the notice as alleged, it provides, by paragraph (d), after stating the appraised value of the land per acre, and specifying the improvements which the owner is required to make, That, in the event of your neglect or refusal to either enter into the agreement referred to, or to make and execute the improvements on the land specified in clause (c) of this notice, and to furnish the Board with a verified statement of such improvements, within one year from the date hereof, as the case may be, the said lands shall immediately after expiration of such year become subject, in respect of that year, to a penalty tax, payable to His Majesty, of five (5) per cent of the appraised value, in addition to all other taxes imposed on the said land; the said tax to be payable in full in respect to that year, and thereafter to be payable in full in like manner in respect to each succeeding year, so long as such neglect or refusal continues.\nThere is no reference anywhere in the notice to the appraisal of interests in land, or of any interest separate from that of the owner, and nothing is said as to persons claiming any estate or interest in the land, or any charge or encumbrance thereon. No liabilities, charges, taxes or duties, other than those imposed upon the land itself, are notified to the owner, and nothing can be derived from the terms of the notice to indicate, or to suggest, any intention or project to impose a tax upon any person, other than the owner, having any estate or interest in the land described in the notice. In these circumstances, the taxation effected by the mailing of the notice cannot, I should think, extend beyond the land and the owner of the land.\nThe case upon which the appellant relies with relation to the quality of the taxation is Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[18]. The question there was as to the validity of taxes imposed by a statute of Manitoba upon contracts of sale of grain for future delivery. The seller was required to pay a tax proportionate to the quantity sold, and the liability extended not only to brokers and mere agents, but to factors, such as elevator companies, to whom the possession of the grain had been entrusted for sale. Lord Haldane, in pronouncing the judgment, pointed out that, by successive decisions of the Judicial Committee, the principle as laid down by John Stuart Mill, and other political economists, had been judicially adopted as the test for determining whether a tax was or was not direct within the meaning of the British North America Act; he reaffirmed the view that a direct tax is one that is demanded from the very person who is intended or desired to pay it; and he referred to the fact that the grain business had many ramifications, saying that, in view of the cases to which the liability would extend, If, therefore, the statute seeks to impose on the brokers and agents and the miscellaneous group of factors and elevator companies who may fall within its provisions, a tax which is in reality indirect within the definition which has been established, the task of separating out these cases (sic) of such persons and corporations from others in which there is a legitimate imposition of direct taxation, is a matter of such complication that it is impracticable for a court of law to make the exhaustive partition required. In other words, if the statute is ultra vires as regards the first class of cases, it has to be pronounced to be ultra vires altogether.\nAnd he therefore considered it impossible to uphold the legislation. The appellant relies upon this case as establishing in principle that the taxation authorized by the Land Settlement and Development Act is not direct, so far as it affects persons claiming any estate or interest in the land appraised, or any charge or encumbrance thereon; and that, having regard to the variety and diversity of the estates or interests, charges or encumbrances, which may exist or come upon the land, it is, he says, obvious, in respect of some of them at least, that the tax must be imposed upon or demanded from one person in the expectation, and with the legislative intention, that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another, and that so far at least, the legislation is ultra vires. Moreover, he contends that it is a matter of complication, and impracticable, as it was in the Manitoba case[19], for the court to make an exhaustive partition; and that the court cannot safely affirm that any part of the Act which, standing alone, might be sustained, can, in view of the context in which it was enacted, be upheld as expressive of the legislative intention, when it is ascertained that the Legislature had no power to give effect to the provisions of that context. But, in my view, that argument does not apply to this case.\nI have already shewn that, while the statute provides imperatively for the appraisal of the land, and for the taxation of the land and of the owner, it is left to the discretion of the Board, except where the fee is still in the Crown, to appraise interests other than that of the owner; and that no taxation is intended, or can be effected, of any estate or interest which is not appraised and described in the notice issued by the Board, by means of which notice the taxation is effected. The Legislature itself has therefore plainly provided for the partition, which was lacking in the Manitoba case[20], by confiding a discretion to the Board to tax or not to tax persons, other than the owner, claiming any estate or interest in the lands, or any charge or encumbrance thereon.\nThe position, as I see it, is this: the Board is required, when the statutory conditions occur and exist, to give effect to the statutory imposition as against the land and the owner, and it is empowered, \"if it deems it advisable,\" also to tax all estates, interests, charges or encumbrances, because I hold that the expression \"interests in land,\" within the meaning of subsection 1 of section 51, must be intended to comprise what is described in subsection 2 of section 53 as \"any estate or interest therein or any charge or encumbrance thereon.\" Some question might arise as to how the taxation should be worked out, if the Board had desired to tax these interests; but, in the present case, the Board did not think it advisable to include persons interested other than the owner, and there is no evidence that the Board has, in any case, ever availed itself of the power. It is clearly within the contemplation of the statute that the Board might validly tax the land, and the owner, without introducing the holders of other estates, interests, charges or encumbrances; therefore, if the tax upon the land and the owner be direct, it is unnecessary to consider what would be the nature of a tax which might have been imposed upon other persons; and I express no opinion upon that hypothetical case.\nNow it is laid down by the Judicial Committee, in the most recent case of City of Halifax v. Fairbanks[21], notwithstanding what was said in the earlier cases, including that of Cotton v. The King[22] , which is said to depend upon its own facts, that taxes upon property or income were, at the time of the Union, everywhere treated as direct taxes; and that,\nWhen the Act of Union allocated the power of direct taxation for provincial purposes to the province, it must surely have intended that the taxation, for those purposes, of property and income should belong exclusively to the provincial legislatures, and that without regard to any theory as the ultimate incidence of such taxation.\nThe Lord Chancellor proceeds to say, referring to Mill's formula, that, No doubt it is valuable as providing a logical basis for the distinction already established between direct and indirect taxes, and perhaps also as a guide for determining, as to any new or unfamiliar tax which may be imposed, in which of the two categories it is to be placed; but it cannot have the effect of disturbing the established classification of the old and well-known species of taxation, and making it necessary to apply a new test to every particular member of those species *** . It may be true to say of a particular tax upon property, such as that imposed on owners by section 394 of the Halifax Charter, that the taxpayer would very probably seek to pass it on to others; but it may none the less be a tax on property and remain within the category of direct taxes.\nTherefore, within the authority of the Fairbanks case[23] , as I interpret it, taxation upon land and upon the owner of the land is within the category of direct taxation, and there is no attempt in the case with which we are now concerned to impose or to levy any tax, except upon the land and the owner of the land, even assuming that other taxes which the Board has a statutory power to impose might, if imposed, be regarded as falling within the opposing classification. It cannot be, I should think, that a good tax is to be held bad merely because the legislature had mistaken its powers so far as in terms to confer upon the Board an ultra vires power which the Board, for one reason or another, deemed it advisable not to exercise.\nIt is urged in effect for the respondent that estates and interests in, and charges and encumbrances upon, lands might be taxed upon the footing of appraised value without introducing any new or unfamiliar principle; and that, even if the Board had executed to the limit its powers as expressed by the Act, none of the taxes thus imposed ought to be held otherwise than direct, within the interpretation of the Fairbanks case[24] . But I am reluctant to enter upon the enquiry unnecessarily, and I shall therefore follow the wise counsel of Sir Montague Smith in the famous Parsons case[25], where he cautions those upon whom is cast the duty of interpreting judicially the meaning of the British North America Acts, to decide each case that arises as best they can, without entering more fully into the interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand. For these reasons, in the result, the appeal should be dismissed, and the costs, I think, should follow.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Elliott, Maclean & Shandley.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

(Art. 110 C.C.P.)\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 45 K.B. 136) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Weir J.[2], and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe respondent, in order to prove the law of Austria, called a witness described in the text of his deposition as an \u201cinsurance agent, of the city of Montreal, aged 39 years\u201d; and the appellant\u2019s counsel objected that \u201cthe witness (was) not capable of making proof as to foreign law.\u201d This witness was born in Austria, where he lived until 1922, and at the time of the trial, he was a law student at McGill University, Montreal. He had already studied law at the University of Czerinowitz before the war, and, resuming his studies some time after, he received the degree of Doctor of Law. In 1919., he was admitted to the bar and began practice as a lawyer at Suczawa, in the province of Bucovina, in Roumania, where the law of Austria was in force. He produced a certificate of his degree from the dean of the University of Czernowitz and also a certificate from the President of the Lawyers of Bucovina that he had been admitted as a lawyer. After testifying as to the law of Austria as regards marriage and civil status, the witness cited some articles of the Austrian Civil Code which bore out his evidence.\nThe trial judge held that the witness was not competent to prove the law of Austria because he was not actually practising his profession there. The Court of King\u2019s Bench reversed that decision and the principal consid\u00e9rants of its judgment are the following:\n\u201cConsidering that the said expert witness after having prosecuted his legal studies at an Austrian university, became a practising lawyer at the bar of Roumania because his native province was, by the Treaty of Versailles, transferred from Austria to Roumania;\n\u201cConsidering that foreign law is a question of fact which must be proved as any other fact by a competent and qualified witness, and that, besides professional persons, any person whose occupation makes it necessary for him to give special attention to legal topics, may be a competent witness, the application of this test being left for decision to individual cases;\n\u201cConsidering that, in the circumstances disclosed in the present action, the said witness was fully qualified to testify as to the laws of Austria, and that, moreover, his evidence is corroborated by the Austrian code to which he refers, and of which this court is, therefore, entitled to take cognizance;\u201d\nJ. L. St. Jacques K.C. and Louis Fitch K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and H. Weinfield K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) is endeavouring to enforce a contract for the sale to the defendant (appellant) of numbers 22 to 28 Duluth Avenue West, Montreal. The contract is in writing, dated 3rd March, 1925, and there is no dispute about its execution or validity. As the case is presented in this court, the difference between the parties relates to the matrimonial status of the plaintiff, and it is raised in this wise: By the notarial deed of sale and conveyance which the plaintiff caused to be tendered to the defendant on 30th April, 1925, the fifth of the vendor\u2019s declarations reads as follows:\nThat he has been twice married, namely, first to Dame Chaia Sarah Weingost, from whom he was separate as to property in virtue of the lawa of Austria, where he was domiciled at the time of his marriage, and who died in the month of May, 1921; and secondly, to Dame Chaia Spivack, who is alive.\nThe defendant rejected the deed, alleging community, by the law of Austria, between the plaintiff and his deceased wife, by whom the plaintiff had ten children. Of these, five died in childhood in Russia, and one son died in Canada, leaving four children of his own, who are living in Montreal. The defendant\u2019s answer to the notary, who tendered the deed, as recorded in the protest, was:\nAm ready to buy the property and pay the money, as soon as all the heirs sign the deed of sale and give clear titles to same.\nThe plaintiff claimed, by his declaration in the cause, dated 14th May, 1925, the execution of the deed and other relief, as therein particularly set out. The defence, dated 15th December, 1925, in so far as it relates to the matter now in controversy, consists of a single paragraph, no, 15, as follows:\nPlaintiff has at no time, although called upon to do so, produced a certificate of marriage, nor proof of the law of Austria, where the said marriage is purported to have taken place; and according to the laws of Austria, where plaintiff was married to his first wife, plaintiff and his wife were in community as to property; one-half of the immovable property belongs to the heirs of the plaintiff\u2019s first wife, who are still owners of a one-half interest in the said property, and who have not divested themselves thereof, and are not parties to the deed tendered to the defendant.\nThe plaintiff, by the ninth paragraph of his answer to the defendant\u2019s plea, alleges\nThat as a matter of fact, according to the law of Austria, where plaintiff and his first wife were married, the consorts were separate as to property, which law provides that the consorts shall be separate unless an ante-nuptial contract was entered into stipulating community, and as a matter of fact no such ante-nuptial contract had been entered into between plaintiff and his first wife.\nAnd the defendant, by his replication, generally denied this paragraph, along with others.\nAt the trial, the plaintiff, in order to prove the law of Austria, called Milan Oxorn, described in the text of his deposition as \u201cof the city of Montreal, insurance agent, aged thirty-nine years,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s counsel objected that \u201cthe witness is not capable of making proof as to foreign law.\u201d Subject to this objection, Mr. Oxorn testified that he was born in Austria, where he lived in the Austrian municipality of Bucovina (which subsequently became a Roumanian province) until the end of 1922, after which he came to Canada; and that he was, at the time of the trial, a law student at McGill University. He was studying at the University of Czernowitz before the war, but his course was then interrupted, and he became engaged in the Austrian military service. Then, after the war, he resumed his law studies, passed his remaining examinations at the university, and acquired the degree of Doctor of Law. In 1919, he was admitted and began practice as a lawyer at Suczawa, in the province of Bucovina, which had, by the terms of the peace, been added to Roumania, but where the law of Austria nevertheless continued to apply. Dr. Oxorn produces a certificate of his degree from the Dean of the University of Czernowitz, dated 4th August, 1919; also a certificate from the President of the Corporation of Lawyers of Bucovina, Roumania, dated 24th August, 1922, the English translation of which in evidence is suggestive of some imperfection; it reads as follows:\nCORPORATION OF LAWYERS OF BUCOVINA\nRoumania\n(Seal)\nCertificate of Advocate\nSeeing the application registered under no. 824\/22 the Corporation of Lawyers of Bucovina, having examined the acts and diplomas of Dr. Milan Oxorn, stating that he was entered as a probationary advocate in the table of lawyers of Falticeni on the first day of August, 1922, as appears by his advocate\u2019s certificate no. 20 drawn up by the named corporation, as by resolution of August 24, 1922, admitted his transfer and entry as a definitive advocate in the list of the Corporation of Advocates of Bucovina, with domicile in Suczawa.\nThis certificate is drawn up to serve him in all judicial instances.\nThe President of the Corporation,\nDr. Reutz.\nCorporation of Lawyers of Bucovina.\n(Seal)\nNo. 84\/22. August 24th.\nDr. Oxorn testified that he has an intimate knowledge of the law of Austria as regards marriage and civil status; and he goes on to shew that, at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s marriage in 1877, and ever since, according to the law of Austria, marriage, in itself, does not carry with it any community of property between husband and wife; and that, in order that community should exist between them, there must be a special contract, which may be stipulated according to the will of the parties; and he read articles 1233, 1237 and 1238 of the Austrian Civil Code.\nThe witness was cross-examined upon his bar certificate, and explained:\nQ. You were admitted to the bar in 1922, in August, 1922?\nA. No, sir, I was admitted to the bar in 1919.\nQ. I understood from your first certificate, which is in German, that you graduated in 1919?\nA. Yes.\nQ. At the University of Czernowitz?\nA. Yes, but if you examine the wording you will see, a \u201cdefinite\u201d lawyer. I will explain to you. The first two years you are a candidate. As a candidate I could plead before courts, but not before the jury. After two years I was appointed definite advocate.\nQ. You are finally called?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That was in 1922?\nA. Yes.\nIt was brought out, in cross-examination and re-examination of the witness, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the introduction of this subject, that, according to the law of Austria, domicile was acquired by settlement in Austria with intention to remain permanently there; that ordinarily a minor could not, except by intervention of parents, curator or tutor, elect a domicile, but that he became emancipated by marriage; and the witness expressed himself, upon the hypothesis of the present case, in favour of the acquisition of Austrian domicile. The defendant did not pursue the enquiry, nor produce any evidence as to the foreign law.\nThe uncontradicted facts shew that the plaintiff married his first wife in Skala, Austria, in 1877, when he was seventeen years of age, that he had been living there for six months before his marriage; that he continued to live there for a year and a half afterwards, and that his first child was born there. The plaintiff was cross-examined to shew that he was born in Komenitz Podolsk, a Russian province, where his parents resided; that when he left Russia, at the age of seventeen, he did not intend to return, and that when he married, he made up his mind to remain in Austria, where he was; but that, after a year and a half, when he could not get employment in Austria, he returned to Komenitz, and continued to reside there, and at Brechman, in Russia, until fifteen or sixteen years before the trial, when he migrated to Canada, where he has since lived with his family.\nWeir J., the trial judge, pronounced his judgment on 22nd February, 1926. He dismissed the action upon two grounds: first, that Dr. Oxorn was not competent to prove the law of Austria, because he was not actually practising his profession there, and that his evidence was therefore inadmissible; and, secondly, that, since there was, in his view, no evidence of the Austrian law, it must be presumed to coincide with that of the province of Quebec, whereby there was, as the learned judge expresses it,\nlegal community between man and wife, and legal or customary dower In favour of the wife and children born of their marriage;\nand he held that the plaintiff\nhas not proved that during his residence in Austria he made manifest his intention of abandoning his original domicile, and, as a consequence, the law of Russia applied to him at the time of his marriage.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the appeal was heard by five learned judges, Greenshields, Tellier, Bernier, Hall and Cannon JJ., who held, in the circumstances disclosed, after considering the rule of evidence as to proof of foreign law, that Dr. Oxorn was fully qualified to testify as to the law of Austria; that his evidence, corroborated as it is by the Austrian Code, to which he had referred, should be accepted, and that there was, therefore, no community of property between the plaintiff and his wife. I am quite satisfied with the grounds upon which this conclusion is put.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench ignored, as a ratio decidendi, the question of Russian domicile, which was suggested on behalf of the defendant, although not pleaded, because the pleadings assumed Austrian domicile, and had put in issue only the law of Austria with regard to community of property. Greenshields, Hall and Cannon JJ., discussed this subject at some length, and Hall J., quotes paragraph 15 of the plea, pointing out that it is an affirmative allegation, importing a judicial admission that the marriage was governed by the laws of Austria, and Cannon J., introduces the following paragraph in his reasons:\nLe litige \u00e9tant clairement d\u00e9limit\u00e9 par les plaidoires \u00e9crites il semble inutile de se demander, comme le premier juge l\u2019a fait, si l\u2019appellant lors de son mariage, sujet russe mineur, \u00e9tait encore domicile chez ses parents en Russie. La question ne se pr\u00e9sente pas entre les parties qui, d\u2019un commun accord, ont li\u00e9 contestation sur l\u2019effet que la loi autrichienne alors en vigueur pouvait avoir sur le r\u00e9gime matrimonial de l\u2019appelant et de son \u00e9pouse.\nThe construction and effect of the pleadings is a matter regulated by the provincial practice, with which this court is very reluctant to interfere, and particularly in a case such as this, where justice seems to require a strict application of the rules. Manifestly, having regard to the frame and substance of the pleadings, the plaintiff went to trial upon the question of the Austrian law of community, and he made an appropriate objection when, in the course of the cross-examination of his expert witness, the defendant attempted to introduce a question of Russian domicile. The defendant could, no doubt, have raised that question by an apt amendment, upon suitable terms, but he neither, at any time amended, nor asked for leave to amend. It is provided by the general rules of pleading, art. 110 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, that\nEvery fact which, if not alleged, is of a nature to take the opposite party by surprise, or to raise an issue not arising from the pleadings, must be expressly pleaded.\nA litigant is not permitted to set up a new case of fact at the trial without consent or notice, unless upon reasonable terms; and this rule is very strictly applied when, in order to meet the new case, it becomes necessary for the party, against whom it is brought forward, to obtain additional information, or to examine distant witnesses, or witnesses whose attendance cannot be readily obtained.\nIn these circumstances, it seems unnecessary to consider whether the evidence of domicile which the defendant elicited upon cross-examination would accord to the plaintiff the Austrian domicile which he claims, at the time of his marriage; and I shall not enter upon the enquiry, which was argued at some length before us, as to whether emancipation of a minor by marriage and his contemporaneous election of a new domicile, operates, at the time of the marriage, or must be deemed to take effect only subsequently, after the marriage relation or status has become complete.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis Fitch.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Weinfield & Sperber.\n[1] Q.R. 45 K.B. 136.\n[2] Q.R. 65 S.C. 17.\n"}

C.R. 112, holding that the patents in question (for improvements in trainmen\u2019s lanterns), relied on by plaintiffs, were valid, and had been infringed by defendant, was affirmed. It was held that, in the combination patented, there was invention, novelty, usefulness and commercial value; and that (in regard to the patents\u2019 validity) no violation was shown of any statutory provision as to manufacture and importation.\nAll matters of manufacture and importation prior to the coming into force of The Patent Act of 1923 (c. 23) are governed by the provisions of the earlier Act which it replaced. After the Act of 1923 came into force, questions of manufacture and importation were governed by its provisions; and under them the Commissioner of Patents is curia designata to determine such questions; as to which, therefore, the Exchequer Court of Canada, in an action brought in that court, has no jurisdiction.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Audette J.)[1].\nThe action was for alleged infringement of two Canadian patents, dated 13th September, 1921, and 30th January, 1923, respectively, for certain new and useful improvements in lanterns, especially adapted for the use of trainmen. The second patent was for improvements on the invention covered by the first patent. Counsel for defendant had admitted, at the opening of the trial, that, if the patents were good, there was infringement; but disputed the validity of the patents, alleging absence of novelty or invention, and absence of subject matter for valid letters patent. It was further alleged by defendant that the alleged inventions had not been manufactured in Canada in compliance with s. 38 (a) of the Patent Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 69, under which the patents were granted, and that importation had taken place in contravention of s. 38 (b) of said Act. Audette J.1 held against the defendant and gave judgment for the plaintiffs.\nAs to manufacture and importation, counsel for the plaintiffs (respondents) contended, among other things, that the uncontradicted evidence showed that no lanterns constructed under either patent were imported after 13th March, 1923, the last day allowed for importation under the first patent (the year allowed for importation having been extended for six months); that, as the prohibition against importation was repealed (1923, c. 23, s. 66) on 1st September, 1923, (the date of the coming into force of The Patent Act, 1923, c. 23), the time allowed for importation under the second patent never expired; that there was no evidence that any lantern parts were imported between 13th March, 1923, (the last day allowed for importation) and 1st September, 1923, when the prohibition against importation was repealed (1923, c. 23, s. 66); that, in any event, the importation of certain parts, common to the trade, did not constitute importation of the lanterns; the remaining parts, including those that were new, were manufactured in Canada and the lanterns assembled here; that, as the time allowed for manufacture in Canada under the former Act had not expired, as regards either of the patents in suit, on 1st September, 1923, when the requirement was repealed (1923, c. 23, s. 66), there could be no question of either patent\u2019s having become void for failure to manufacture; that under the present Act (1923, c. 23; see ss. 40, 41) which went into force on 1st September, 1923, the provisions as to importation and manufacture had no application here; that there is no provision in the Act rendering a patent void for importation or for non-manufacture in Canada; and that the only tribunal in which the provisions of the new Act relating to importation and manufacture can be invoked is before the Commissioner of Patents; the Exchequer Court has no jurisdiction save on appeal from him, or upon a reference to the Court by him, neither of which is the case here.\nF. B. Fetherstonhaugh K.C. for the appellant.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nAfter argument by counsel, judgment was reserved, and on the following; day the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The Court is unanimously of the opinion that the appeal fails and must be dismissed\u2014speaking generally, for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Audette. That the combination patented by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor involved invention was demonstrated; of its novelty we are satisfied; its usefulness and commercial value do not admit of dispute.\nIn regard to the questions of manufacture and importation, which were discussed, I should, perhaps, add that we agree with the construction put by Mr. Scott on section 66 of the Act of 1923. In our view, all matters of importation and manufacture prior to the date of the coming into force of that Act are governed by the provisions of the earlier statute, which it replaced. That leaves to be considered, in regard to the first patent, the question of importation between the 13th March, 1923, to which the time for importation into Canada had been extended, and the date of the coming into force of the Act of 1923, the 1st of September of that year. As to that, Mr. Scott contends that there is no evidence of importation between those dates. Mr. Fetherstonhaugh did not challenge that statement of Mr. Scott, and failed to point out any such evidence. The time for importation into Canada under the second patent had not expired in September, 1923. There is, therefore, nothing upon which to base a decision that there was importation affecting the validity of either patent prior to the date of the Act of 1923 coming into force.\nAfter that Act came into force the questions of manufacture and importation were governed by its provisions, and under them the Commissioner of Patents is curia designata to determine such questions, and it would be only on appeal from him that the Exchequer Court would have jurisdiction. That being the case, the present proceeding is one in which, as to such questions, there was no jurisdiction in the court of first instance to entertain the action.\nThe attack on the patents entirely fails. The appeal, therefore, is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fetherstonhaugh & Fox.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Ewart, Scott, Kelley & Kelley.\n[1] [1928] Ex.

U. died domiciled in the State of New York and owning a large block of shares in a British Columbia mining company. Shares of the company were dealt with on several stock exchanges. The executors of his estate appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (39 B.C. Rep. 533) affirming the finding of a commissioner, appointed under s. 30 of the Succession Duty Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 244, as to the \"fair market value,\" for succession duty purposes, of U.'s shares at the date of his death.\nHeld: The value found below should stand, as it could not be said to exceed the fair market value.\nIn such cases, where the market price has been consistent and not spasmodic or ephemeral, that price should determine the \"fair market value\"; no deduction should be made on the assumption that all the deceased's shares would be placed on the market at once, thus depressing the market value, as no prudent stockholder would pursue that course.\nHeld, further, that the shares in question were \"property situate within the province\" within the meaning of said Act (Brassard v. Smith, [1925] A.C., 371, at p. 376, referred to), and that the taxation imposed under said Act in respect of the shares was direct taxation, and intra vires.\nAPPEAL by the executors of the estate of Isaac Unter-myer, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the finding of A. D. Macfarlane, Esq., a commissioner appointed under s. 30 of the Succession Duty Act of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 244), as to the value, for succession duty purposes, of 318,800 shares of stock owned by the said deceased in Premier Gold Mining Company, Limited, a British Columbia company, with its head office and place of share registration in that province. The deceased died on August 31, 1926, domiciled in the State of New York.\nSection 3 of said Act provides that \"in determining the net value of property *** the fair market value shall be taken as at the date of the death of the deceased.\"\nThe shares were of the par value of $1 each. The executors' valuation of the shares was $1.19 per share, based on what was alleged to be their book value as at the date of death. The contention of the government department having charge of the collection of succession duties was that the value should be arrived at by taking the market quotation at the date of deceased's death, which was $2.20 per share. The commissioner fixed the value at $2 per share, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal[2]. It was urged on behalf of the appellants that the market quotation was not a fair criterion; that the test of a \"fair market value\" was the amount the shares would have brought in the market if offered for sale at the date of the deceased's death; that the evidence shewed that the market quotation at said date was based on share transactions of a very limited quantity, and a comparatively limited market, and that the available markets at the time of death could not absorb all the deceased's shares at the price of $2.20, and that the best price possible could be obtained only through an underwriting syndicate and that such price would not be more than $1.50.\nIt was also contended on behalf of the appellants that the deceased's shares were not liable to succession duty, on the ground that they were not \"property situate within the province\" within the meaning of the Act; also that the provisions of the Act purporting to impose duties in a case such as that in question were ultra vires, as not being taxation within the province, and as being indirect taxation.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nE. F. Newcombe for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The late Isaac Untermyer, among other property, was possessed at his death of 320,800 shares of Premier Gold Mining Company, Limited, a British Columbia corporation. Of these shares, of a nominal value each of one dollar, two thousand were held by him in trust, and the controversy here is restricted to the balance, 318,800 shares. The total share capital of the company is stated to be 5,000,000 shares. Untermyer was domiciled in New York, and left a will disposing of an estate said to be worth $1,555,000. His executors obtained probate of the will in New York and they also applied for ancillary probate in British Columbia.\nIt is a feature of the British Columbia Succession Duty Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 244, that probate of a will cannot be obtained until the succession duties are paid, or security for their payment is given to the satisfaction of the provincial authorities (ss. 21 and following). The applicant for probate, or for letters of administration, must file two duplicate original affidavits of value and relationship, and this was done in the present instance. The amount of the duties depends on the relationship of the beneficiaries to the deceased, and also, of course, on the value of the property transmitted. The Act deals very briefly with the basis of valuation. It states that \"net value\" means the value of all the property of the deceased after the debts, encumbrances or other allowances or exemptions are deducted therefrom (s. 2). In determining this net value, the \"fair market value\" is taken as at the death of the deceased, less the allowances and deductions (s. 3). After the filing of the affidavit of value and relationship, the Minister of Finance through his deputy may determine the amount of succession duty (s. 22), or, if he be not satisfied with the value stated in the affidavit, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may appoint a commissioner under the Public Inquiries Act \"to inquire into and report what property of the deceased is subject to duty under this Act, and what is the value thereof or of any part thereof.\" The commissioner gives to the persons applying for probate of the will or for letters of administration one week's written notice of the time and place at which he will make such inquiry, and of the nature of the inquiry, and it is his duty to appraise the property of the deceased \"at its fair market value,\" and to make his report in writing, in duplicate, one copy to be sent to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and the other copy to the executor or administrator, as the case may be, or to his solicitor (s. 31).\nAll this was done in the present case. There was no suggestion that all the property of the deceased had not been disclosed in the affidavit, nor was there any dispute as to its valuation with the exception of these shares. The inquiry was held both in Victoria and Vancouver, several witnesses, chiefly stock brokers and financial agents, were called, and the commissioner\u2014Mr. A. D. Macfarlane, a barrister of Victoria\u2014made his report in writing on December 23, 1927, appraising the shares in question at $2 each, or a total valuation for the 318,800 shares of $637,600. In the affidavit, the executors had valued the shares at what was said to be their book value, to wit $1-1924 a share, or $1.19, making a total valuation of $382,521.92. The Act states that any person dissatisfied with the report, or any portion of the report, of the commissioner, may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal, and the powers of that court in respect of the appeal are the same as in the case of an ordinary appeal to the Court of Appeal from any judgment of a judge of the Supreme Court (s. 33).\nAn appeal was brought by the present appellants from the report of Mr. Macfarlane, and this appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal[3]. The respondent cross-appealed, seeking to have the value of the shares placed at $2.20 a share, and this cross-appeal was also dismissed[4]. The appellants now appeal to this Court from the decision of the Court of Appeal. The respondent has not brought any further cross-appeal.\nMr. Farris, in his argument, attacked the report on two grounds:\u2014\n1. The valuation of the shares was too high;\n2. The shares in question are not liable for succession duty.\nDealing with the second ground first, Mr. Farris summarized his contentions as follows:\u2014\nA. The words \"property situate within the province\" (s. 2 of the Act) are not intended to include mobilia of a deceased non-resident.\nB. Intangible property cannot have a situs within the meaning of the Succession Duty Act.\nC. The shares in question are taxable only under section 10 of the Act, and that section is ultra vires as being indirect taxation, and as not being taxation within the province.\nAt the hearing the Court was of opinion that Mr. Farris had not established a case on his second ground of appeal, calling for a reply from the respondent. It is impossible to hold, on the construction of the Act, that this taxation is other than direct taxation. And it appears clear to us that these shares in the capital stock of a British Columbia corporation, which are carried on the share register kept in the province, are \"property situate within the province.\" The question of the situs of these shares is concluded by several pronouncements of the Privy Council. It will suffice to refer to the recent case of Brassard v. Smith[5] . At page 376 of the report, their Lordships state that the test is \"Where could the shares be effectively dealt with?\" The answer here must be that these shares could be effectively dealt with in British Columbia. They were, therefore, at the death of the deceased, situate within the province.\nThere remains only the first ground of appeal, the contention that the valuation of the shares was too high. On this point we have had the benefit of full argument.\nI have carefully read the evidence before the commissioner. The deceased died on August 31, 1926, in New York. Shares of the Premier Company, on September 1, 1926, were quoted on the stock exchange of Victoria and Vancouver at $2.20 a share, this referring to sales made the previous day, the day of Untermyer's death.\nDealings in these shares took place on several stock exchanges, but principally in Victoria and Vancouver (the quotations of which may be taken to have been the same; dealings on these exchanges exceeded in volume the transactions on any other stock exchange in so far as the shares of this company are concerned) and in New York (where the shares were dealt with on what is termed the curb). Exhibit 6, filed before the commissioner, shows the Vancouver and New York quotations of this stock, week by week, from the week ending August 29, 1925, to the week ending August 27, 1927. During the period of one year previous to Untermyer's death none of these quotations on the Vancouver stock exchange was under $2, the vast majority being considerably higher than that figure. For instance, the last week before Untermyer's death, the stock stood at $2.27 bid and $2.30 asked; and the lowest quotation during the whole previous year was $2.08 bid and $2.11 asked.\nThe evidence shows that on this stock, before and at the time of Untermyer's death, a quarterly dividend of eight cents a share was paid. This is an annual return of thirty-two per cent, on the face or nominal value of the shares; and these dividends had been paid regularly up to the time of the enquiry before the commissioner.\nAccording to the Succession Duty Act, the property subject to the duty is to be appraised at its \"fair market value\" at the death of the deceased. The parties before the commissioner seem to have considered that the best test of \"fair market value\" was the price for which Untermyer's holdings could have been sold, but they differed widely in their views of the means whereby such a sale could have been best effected. All the witnesses recognized that it would have been impracticable to attempt to sell at once this large block of shares. Such a course would have broken the market where, of course, to a large extent, price is regulated by the economic law of supply and demand, and it fluctuates according as one or the other of these elements predominates. The suggestion of the respondent was that, if they had decided to sell, the executors would have acted reasonably, that they would have taken time, three months or even a year, to dispose of the stock, and that if they had done so they could have sold it for at least $2.20 a share. The appellants' witnesses thought that no such disposal was possible\u2014they point to the fact that in the closing months of 1926 the stock declined below $2, presumably because a large block had been placed on the market\u2014and they said that the only practicable course would have been to get a group of brokers to underwrite the shares, which would not have given a price exceeding $1.50 a share.\nThe learned commissioner considered that the possibility of a sale of the shares by private negotiation had not been sufficiently looked into. He arrived at a valuation of $2 per share, a figure which, as I read the testimony, was not suggested by any of the witnesses. He was impressed, he said, by a statement by one of the witnesses that he would adopt other methods than putting the stock on the market in the usual way, and by a remark of another witness that a good broker would be careful not to break the market, and he adds:\u2014\nUsing the market quotations as a guide I find that the sum of $2 per share or a total value of $637,600 would represent the fair market value of the Premier Gold Mining shares owned absolutely by the late Isaac Untermyer.\nHe was of opinion, he had said in a previous part of his report, that \"fair market value\"\nmeans such sum as could be obtained by sale of the property under conditions where you have a willing but not an anxious seller and where you have all possible potential purchasers acting under normal circumstances brought into consideration. We were favoured by counsel with several suggested definitions of the words \"fair market value.\" The dominant word here is evidently \"value,\" in determining which the price that can be secured on the market\u2014if there be a market for the property (and there is a market for shares listed on the stock exchange)\u2014is the best guide. It may, perhaps, be open to question whether the expression \"fair\" adds anything to the meaning of the words \"market value,\" except possibly to this extent that the market price must have some consistency and not be the effect of a transient boom or a sudden panic on the market. The value with which we are concerned here is the value at Untermyer's death, that is to say, the then value of every advantage which his property possessed, for these advantages, as they stood, would naturally have an effect on the market price. Many factors undoubtedly influence the market price of shares in financial or commercial companies, not the least potent of which is what may be called the investment value created by the fact\u2014or the prospect as it then exists\u2014of large returns by way of dividends, and the likelihood of their continuance or increase, or again by the feeling of security induced by the financial strength or the prudent management of a company. The sum of all these advantages controls the market price, which, if it be not spasmodic or ephemeral, is the best test of the fair market value of property of this description.\nI therefore think that the market price, in a case like that under consideration, where it is shown to have been consistent, determines the fair market value of the shares. I do not lose sight of the fact that mining operations are often of a speculative character, that there is always a danger of depletion, and that a time will sooner or later arrive when no more minerals will be available, unless other properties are secured to keep up the supply. But all these elements have an effect on the price of the shares on the stock exchange, and no doubt they were fully considered by the purchasers of the stock at the then prevailing prices.\nI would not deduct anything from the market value of these shares on the assumption that the whole of them would be placed on the market at one and the same time, for I do not think that any prudent stockholder would pursue a like course. To make such a deduction in a case like the one at bar, would be to render the \"sacrifice value\" or \"dumping value\" of the shares the measure of valuation. It is certainly impossible to say that the price allowed by the learned commissioner and approved in the Court of Appeal exceeded the fair market value of these shares.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

Justin (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Toronto Guelph Express Company and Leonard Hatch (Defendants) Respondents.\n1928: November 26, 27; 1928: December 21.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Collision\u2014Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 251\u2014Law as to civil liability under ss. 9 (1) and 41 (1), assuming tail light to have gone out shortly before collision without knowledge or negligence of driver\u2014Misdirection to jury\u2014New trial\u2014Amount in controversy on appeals\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Quashing of appeals.\nThe liability imposed by ss. 9 (1) and 41 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, Ont. (R.S.O. 1927, c. 251), exists even in absence of negligence; the failure to have a tail light burning and visible on a motor vehicle in accordance with s. 9 (1) is a violation of the Act, and, if a cause of a collision resulting in damages, may involve civil liability under s. 41 (1), even though the light was burning until shortly before the accident and went out without the knowledge or personal fault or negligence of the driver of the vehicle. (Great Western Ry. Co. v. Owners of ss. \u201cMostyn,\u201d [1928] A.C. 57, applied).\nIn the case in question (an action for damages resulting from a collision of motor vehicles) it was held that the trial judge\u2019s direction to the jury to an effect contrary to the law as above stated was a mis- direction, and that it affected the jury\u2019s findings to such an extent that they should not stand, and a new trial was ordered.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (34 Ont. W.N. 216), affirming the judgment at trial in favour of defendants, reversed. As the claims of two of the plaintiffs were each for an amount less than $2,000, their appeals were (at the opening of the argument) quashed for want of jurisdiction (Armand v. Carr, [1926] S.C.R. 575; Reynolds v. C.P.R., [1927] S.C.R. 505, referred to), the Court refusing an application to allow the case to stand over to permit of leave to appeal being asked from the Appellate Division.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Orde J.A., upon the findings of the jury, dismissing the action.\nThe action was for damages, and arose out of an accident due to the motor car in which the plaintiffs were riding, owned by the plaintiff Wm. R. Hall and driven by the plaintiff Justin, running into the rear of a truck belonging to the defendant The Toronto Guelph Express Company, and driven by the defendant Hatch. The collision occurred between Toronto and Brampton on the 16th November, 1927, at about 6 p.m. It was dark at the time. The plaintiffs alleged that the truck displayed no rear red light, or, if it did, that such light did not comply with the requirements of s. 9 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 251). The defendants alleged that the truck was equipped with the lights required by law, that such lights were lit at the time of the accident, denied any negligence or breach of duty on their part, and alleged that the accident was due to the negligence of the plaintiff Justin in (among other things) driving at an excessive speed and failing to keep a proper look-out, and that the other plaintiffs assumed the risk of their driver\u2019s negligence.\nAt the trial questions were submitted to the jury, which are set out in the judgment now reported, as are also the jury\u2019s answers, so far as answers were made, and, at some length, portions of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, and of discussions between the judge and counsel, and of questions passing between the judge and jury in regard to the jury\u2019s findings. As to the plaintiffs William R. Hall and Alice R. Dale, the appeal was allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment dismissing the action was set aside and a new trial ordered; the costs of the abortive trial being reserved to the judge presiding at the new trial. The ground of the decision was misdirection in charging the jury, as indicated in the above headnote, and as fully set out in the judgment now reported.\nAs to the plaintiffs Annie C. Hall and Frank J. Justin, the appeal was, at the opening of the argument, quashed for want of jurisdiction, as their claims were each for an amount less than $2,000. The Court refused an application to allow the case to stand over to permit of leave to appeal being asked from the Appellate Division[2].\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and A.W. Plaxton for the appellants.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014As we have come to the conclusion that there must be a new trial in this action, following our usual practice, we shall discuss the facts only so far as is necessary to make clear the ground of our decision and as may be desirable to avoid further difficulty arising from the same cause.\nThe sole ground of liability now charged against the defendants is their alleged failure to comply with the requirements of s. 9 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 251, as to a rear or tail light.\nSection 9 (1) reads as follows:\u2014\n9 (1) Whenever on a highway after dusk and before dawn, every motor vehicle shall carry three lighted lamps in a conspicuous position, one on each side of the front, which shall cast a white, green or amber coloured light only, and one on the back of the vehicle, which shall cast from its face a red light only, except in the case of a motor bicycle without a side car, which shall carry one lamp on the front which shall cast a white light only and one on the back of the vehicle which shall cast from its face a red light only. Any lamp so used shall be clearly visible at a distance of at least two hundred feet. Subsection (3) of that section reads as follows:\u2014\n9 (3) Any person who violates any of the provisions of subsections 1 or 2 shall incur, for the first offence, a penalty of not more than $5; for the second offence a penalty of not less than $5 and not more than $10; and for any subsequent offence a penalty of not less than $10 and not more than $25 and in addition, his license or permit may be suspended for any period not exceeding sixty days.\nThis alleged omission, it is claimed, entailed civil liability on the defendants under subs. 1 of s. 41 of the same statute, as owner and driver, respectively, of the motor truck. That section reads as follows:\u2014\n41 (1) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible for any violation of this Act or of any regulation prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner shall also be responsible for any such violation.\nThe defendants, however, also pleaded negligence on the part of the plaintiffs\u2019 driver as the sole cause, or as a contributing cause, of the collision, and gave the following particulars:\u2014\n1. The motor vehicle operated by the said Frank J. Justin was being driven at an excessive speed and was not under proper control.\n2. The said Frank J. Justin was a person of defective vision and not competent to operate the said motor vehicle.\n3. It was the duty of the said Frank J. Justin to have turned to the left as far as may have been necessary to avoid a collision with any vehicles on the highway ahead of him which he had overtaken, and this duty he failed to observe.\n4. It was the duty of the said Frank J. Justin to so operate the motor vehicle of which he was in charge and to so control the same as to bring it to a stop within the distance that his headlights would reveal an object on the highway ahead of him and this duty he failed to observe.\n5. Even after the danger of a collision with an object on the highway ahead of him became apparent, it was the duty of the said Frank J. Justin to keep such a look-out and have the said motor vehicle under such control as to bring it to a stop before coming into collision with such object, and this duty he failed to observe.\n6. The motor vehicle being operated by the said Frank J. Justin was being operated contrary to the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act in that it was being operated at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public.\n7. The lights with which the motor vehicle of the said Frank J. Justin was equipped were defective or insufficient and the brakes with which the speed of the motor vehicle was controlled were defective or inefficient.\n8. If the vision of the said Frank J. Justin of vehicles ahead of him on the highway was obstructed by weather or light conditions, it was his duty to have operated his motor vehicle at a slow rate of speed and under proper control and this condition he failed to observe.\nThey also charged assumption of the risk of the driver\u2019s negligence by his co-plaintiffs.\nThe following questions were submitted to the jury:\u2014\n1. Q. Were the defendants guilty of any negligence causing the accident?\n2. Q. If so, what was that negligence?\n3. Q. Was the plaintiff Justin guilty of any negligence contributing to the accident?\n4. Q. If so, what was his negligence?\n5. Q. After the plaintiff Justin became aware or ought to have become aware of the impending danger, could he by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the collision?\n6. Q. If so, what could he have done?\n7. Q. At what sums do you assess the damages sustained by each of the four plaintiffs:\u2014\nWilliam R. Hall,\nAnnie C. Hall,\nAlice R. Dale,\nFrank J. Justin?\n8. Q. If you find the defendants and also Justin both guilty of negligence, in what degree did the negligence of each contribute to the collision:\nDefendants per cent?\nJustin per cent?\nThe learned trial judge, in the course of a somewhat lengthy charge, said:\u2014\nIn a case like this, the parties are in exactly the same position as if the alleged negligence had nothing to do with motor vehicles at all, and the burden of establishing that the defendants were guilty of negligence rests with the plaintiffs. They must establish to your satisfaction that the injuries which they sustained resulted from some neglect of duty or some failure to comply with the law, which is practically the same thing, before they can recover. * * * They must prove, as I have said, that the defendants are guilty of the negligence which is alleged, or they cannot recover. * * * The only negligence which is imputed to these defendants and the only negligence which the plaintiffs must prove in order to succeed at all, is that there was no light shining, no visible light, on the rear of the truck when the accident happened and immediately before it happened. If the plaintiffs cannot prove and have not proved that allegation, then the action fails. * * * The law requires that every motor vehicle shall carry three lights, two white lights at the front and one red light at the rear; you need not bother about other requirements, but as to that the law requires that these lights shall be clearly visible at a distance of at least 200 feet. The first thing you have to determine, because it is at the very threshold of this case, is whether or not upon the evidence of all the witnesses both for the plaintiffs and for the defendants the rear light was burning on that truck and was visible on that occasion.\n* * * Q. 1. Were the defendants guilty of any negligence causing the accident?\nIf, as has been pointed out, the tail light of the defendant Hayhurst\u2019s truck was lighted and visible, that puts an end to the action if that is your conclusion and you should answer that first question: \u201cNo.\u201d You might, however,, come to the conclusion, and quite properly, having regard to all the circumstances,\u2014if you so conclude upon the evidence that that is the fact\u2014that though the tail light was not burning the real cause of this accident was either excessive speed or failure to keep a proper look-out on the part of Justin, the driver of the plaintiff Hall\u2019s car in which the four plaintiffs were riding. Either of those conclusions will be sufficient justification for answering that question: \u201cNo.\u201d I think it will be wise for you first to deal with that question in those two aspects before proceeding to answer any other questions. * * * If you come to the conclusion from the evidence * * * that the plaintiff Justin was driving at an excessive rate of speed or failed to keep a proper look-out, and that notwithstanding any negligence on the part of the defendants, notwithstanding that the tail light was out, the sole cause of the accident was one or the other or both of those species of negligence on the part of the plaintiff Justin, then again you would answer the first question: \u201cNo,\u201d because the negligence of the defendants as to the tail light being out would not be the cause of the accident. A mere breach of duty on the part of one person towards another does not entitle the other to recover damages unless that breach of duty was the cause of the accident. * * * You may, however, come to the conclusion that the defendants were guilty of negligence causing the accident because of their failure to have the tail light burning. If that is the case, you will answer the first question: \u201cYes.\u201d Assuming that you have not found, also, that the plaintiff Justin was the sole cause of the accident, you will answer the second question:\u2014\n2. Q. If so, what was the negligence?\nYou will state fully what it was, in your opinion.\nAfter being out for some hours (5.50\u20148.41 p.m.), the jury sent to the Judge, in writing, the following memorandum:\u2014\nThe jury wish to know if by chance the tail light in question was to go out immediately prior to the accident would the defendant be considered guilty of negligence directly causing the accident, taking into consideration that the light by going out would be a matter out of his direct control.\nAfter some discussion with counsel, the jury was sent for and the learned judge then said to them:\u2014\nI gather from that question that you may have it in your minds that the evidence establishes two facts. * * * The question, at all events, lends colour to this idea, that you are of the opinion that the evidence might establish that the tail light was in fact lit up until a very short time before the impact, but that it had gone out immediately before that, and therefore it would be quite true that the light had not been seen by the plaintiffs and also quite true that the light was burning, as sworn to by the defendants\u2019 witnesses, shortly before the accident, and in that way there would be a reconciliation of the two statements. I understand your question to amount to this, that having that in mind, and the light having gone out without the knowledge of the driver, under those circumstances would the driver be guilty of negligence directly causing the accident? As I have said, that is not an easy question to answer. I have had the benefit of argument both by Mr. Bell and Mr. Phelan. It is a question which, if I were trying it and had to decide it myself, would probably require several days in order to come to a conclusion. There are a good many aspects of the question which, from a lawyer\u2019s point of view, would have to be investigated. There is no time to do that now, and I have to do the best I can in instructing you. What I have to say may prove upon appeal to be utterly wrong, but that cannot be helped; you have to take it for the time being as being the law. My instruction to you is\u2014I say it with some diffidence\u2014that having regard to the fact that this is a civil action, an action for damages based upon the negligence of the defendant Hayhurst and his driver, if you find the circumstances such as you suggest, namely, that the driver was not aware of the light being out because it had gone out suddenly before the impact, then, in my judgment, the defendants would not be liable. I say I may be wrong as to that, and because of that I am going to ask you, if that is your conclusion, to make it perfectly plain in the answer to the question. It may be necessary for you to amplify your answer by adding a note to the foot of your answer, to the effect that you come to the conclusion as a fact and find it to be the fact that the light was burning up until shortly before the accident, and had gone out immediately before the accident, and that therefore the defendant driver was not aware of it. Have I made myself clear? Is there anything more you desire to know?\n* * *\nNow, gentlemen, please do what I have asked. If your conclusions are based upon any such findings, then make that clear. I think the simplest way would be to attach a memorandum at the foot of the answer, to the effect that you find as a fact certain things upon which you base the conclusions at which you arrive. Please retire.\nThe report of the trial proceeds:\u2014\nHis Lordship: Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your answers to the questions?\nThe Foreman: Yes.\nHis Lordship: The jury has answered only one question and that is the first question:\n1. Q. Were the defendants guilty of any negligence causing the accident? A. No.\nThe jury have attached to the answer this slip: \u201cAssuming that the light may have gone out immediately prior to the accident unknown to the driver, we the jury believe the defendant not negligent.\u201d\nAm I to understand, gentlemen, that it is your conclusion from the evidence that the light did go out immediately before the accident, and that you so find?\nThe Foreman: We do not know, sir.\nAfter some discussion with counsel, the learned judge further said to the jury:\u2014\nHis Lordship: Gentlemen of the jury, are you prepared to make a finding upon that question as to whether or not the plaintiff Justin was guilty of negligence causing the accident? In other words, is your answer \u201cNo\u201d to question no. 1 based upon this assumption which you have attached to the answer, and that only? Is that right?\nThe Foreman: (No answer).\nHis Lordship: That is, you find that the defendants were not negligent because of the assumption that the light may have gone out immediately before the accident? Am I correct in that?\nThe Foreman: (No answer).\nHis Lordship: I think the slip may be regarded as their conclusion that upon that ground and that alone they find for the defendants.\nMr. Phelan: In order to avoid the possible necessity for further trial in the matter, I think the jury ought to be asked their opinion on the answer to the first question. The jury have probably assumed that in answering that question as they have answered it, they have done all that is necessary.\nHis Lordship: It would have been all that is necessary if they had answered the first question: \u201cNo,\u201d without putting this question to me. It might have been assumed that it was on one or other of these two grounds, and it would not have mattered, for either would have been sufficient. You suggest now that they should either affirmatively or negatively deal with the other questions?\nMr. Phelan: Yes, my Lord.\nHis Lordship: Gentlemen of the jury, can you do that without much loss of time? Can you add, in view of the situation created by this assumption of yours, a further statement to the effect: \u201cWe find that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the plaintiff driver,\u201d or \u201cWe find that the plaintiff driver was not guilty of any negligence causing the accident\u201d? Do you think you can do that immediately? I think it is important, because if the law on the question you have answered is settled otherwise than I have assumed to be the law, there might have to be a new trial. You can put your finding on that point on another slip of paper, if you desire to do so: \u201cWe find that the plaintiffs were not guilty of negligence causing the accident,\u201d or \u201cWe find that the plaintiffs were guilty of negligence causing the accident.\u201d\nMr. Plaxton: Is there any doubt about the answer to the first question, my Lord?\nHis Lordship: In what way? I think their assumption is: \u201cAssuming that the light may have gone out prior to the accident unknown to the driver, we find the defendant not negligent.\u201d\nMr. Plaxton: You are stating that as their assumption, my Lord.\nHis Lordship: That is their finding, I think.\nMr. Plaxton: As long as that is clear, my Lord.\nWhereupon the jury again retired at 10.28 o\u2019clock p.m.\n* * *\nMr. Plaxton: My Lord, owing to the absence of senior counsel I am somewhat embarrassed, but on giving this matter further consideration I think the first question should be answered positively. I have in mind a case where there was an answer like this answer made by a jury on an assumption, and the Court of Appeal sent it back for a new trial on the ground that there should have been a positive answer. I think the jury should bring in a positive answer to that question.\nHis Lordship: Do not you think it would be better to let sleeping dogs lie? You are in a stronger position before the Court of Appeal on that answer than are the defendants.\n* * * Mr. Plaxton: Supposing the jury find that Justin\u2019s negligence is the sole cause of the accident, that puts us in an embarrassing position.\nHis Lordship: No; that is a positive finding to that effect, and amplifies or explains the \u201cNo\u201d and eliminates any difficulty that has been raised by this rider.\nMr. Plaxton: I have in mind, my Lord, the future developments that might arise in this case.\nHis Lordship: No doubt it will go to appeal. We will wait and see what the jury have to say.\nMr. Plaxton: My Lord, I hope that this case does not look like a \u201cComedy of Errors,\u201d but after reading over these questions I am going to ask your Lordship to direct the jury to answer all the questions, and particularly question no. 7, dealing with the quantum of damages.\nHis Lordship: I have told the jury that if they negative the first question there is no necessity for their answering any of the other questions. If there has to be a new trial, the jury on the new trial will deal with the question of damages.\nMr. Plaxton: Surely we do not want that, my Lord?\nHis Lordship: You cannot have a series of findings, some by one jury and some by another. The jury is sometimes directed to find the quantum of damages because the trial judge thinks there is a lack of evidence to justify the finding and that the plaintiffs should be nonsuited, and in order to avoid the possibility of a new trial on the question of damages if he is wrong the jury is requested to assess the damages. But if in this case the jury had simply answered the first question: \u201cNo,\u201d and none of the trouble had developed because of the question they put to me, there would have been no necessity for assessing the damages in this case, because if there has been misdirection on my part and a new trial is directed, then all the questions would go back to the new jury. It is only in those cases where a new trial is not necessary that a jury is asked to find the damages, Mr. Plaxton.\nMr. Plaxton: If we are right in our assumption of the law, namely, that the defendants are liable even though they were not aware of the tail light being out?\nHis Lordship: How can you possibly get that question settled except by another jury?\nMr. Plaxton: If they give a positive answer.\nHis Lordship: They give a positive answer, namely that the defendants were not guilty of negligence causing the accident.\nMr. Plaxton: Pursuant to a direction from your Lordship.\nHis Lordship: If I am wrong in that direction, no higher court is going to find the defendants guilty of negligence upon this or any other evidence; they are going to direct a new trial.\nMr. Plaxton: I submit not, my Lord. I submit that if the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that it was the jurors\u2019 intention to find the defendants negligent, or to find that they would have been negligent, in law, if (with respect) properly directed with regard to the question of the tail light\u2014I have in mind a situation that arose in a case I was in.\nHis Lordship: I would be very much surprised to find that a higher Court has ever, where the jury has not found negligence on the part of the defendants, usurped the functions of the jury and found negligence.\nMr. Plaxton: The point is, that if the jury had been directed that it was in law negligence to have the tail light out, even though the driver did not know it\u2014and that apparently is their idea having regard to their answer to the first question\u2014and the Court of Appeal said that there had been a misdirection as a matter of law, then they would say, if these other questions were answered here, that they could deal with the matter without sending it back for a re-trial.\nHis Lordship: I do not see how. Your right to relief is a finding of such negligence on the part of the defendants and until you get that you cannot succeed, and that finding must be\u2014as you have chosen to submit the matter by questions to the jury\u2014a finding of the jury; and no higher court will, because the jury has, upon insufficient grounds or upon an untenable ground, as you suggest, found the defendants not negligent, infer from that that because the ground was wrong therefore the jury would have found that they were negligent.\nMr. Plaxton: I submit it is logical, my Lord.\nHis Lordship: I do not agree with you.\nMr. Plaxton: I press the objection, my Lord.\nHis Lordship: In view of that answer I would not ask them to answer the other questions. They are all based upon the theory of a finding of negligence on the part of the defendants.\nThe jury returned to the court room at 10.45 o\u2019clock p.m.\nHis Lordship: The memorandum reads:\u2014\n\u201cWe the jury find the plaintiff was negligent to the extent of not using necessary precautions as demanded by such adverse weather conditions.\u201d\nHave you any comment to make upon that finding?\nMr. Phelan: Do the jury find that that was the cause of the accident? I think that is apparently their intention, but they ought to say it in order to make the matter clear.\nHis Lordship: Gentlemen of the jury, is that your conclusion, that the plaintiff Justin\u2019s negligence caused the accident?\nMr. Plaxton: How can they say that?\nHis Lordship: Wait a moment, please. It might only be a finding of contributory negligence.\nMr. Phelan: It might be, unless the jury is prepared to say that that was the cause of the accident.\nHis Lordship: Gentlemen of the jury, can you say that that was the cause of the accident? If that is what you conclude, you can add some words to the effect that the plaintiff Justin\u2019s negligence was the cause of the accident.\nThe Foreman: By that memorandum I think that is what we inferred.\nHis Lordship: If that is what you believe, just go back to your room once more and add those words, or words to that effect\u2014I do not desire to suggest what words should be employed, but words to express what you really find. Just continue the sentence to that effect.\nWhereupon the jury again retired and returned to the court room at 10.51 o\u2019clock p.m.\nHis Lordship: Your memorandum now reads:\u2014\n\u201cWe the jury find that the plaintiff was negligent to the extent of not using necessary precautions as demanded by such adverse weather conditions, and was the cause of the accident.\u201d\nIt is not quite grammatical in form, but we will not say anything about that now. Upon those findings I am constrained to dismiss the action with costs.\nOnly question no. 1 of the series of questions submitted to them was answered by the jury; but, to the paper containing them, we find pinned, one below the other, the two memoranda above mentioned.\nI have thought it advisable to set out these latter proceedings somewhat in extenso in order to make clear the course of the trial, which, in our opinion, unfortunately renders a new trial unavoidable.\nIn the first place, it seems open to doubt whether the second memorandum brought in by the jury should be regarded as an answer by them to questions nos. 3 and 4, which were otherwise unanswered, or, as intended to give a second reason, pursuant to the instruction of the learned trial judge, for the negative answer which they made to question no. 1. Physically the paper on which this memorandum is written is attached to the sheet of paper containing the questions as if it might be intended as an answer to questions nos. 3 and 4, and it was so treated by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Appellate Court, and is also so dealt with towards the close of the respondents\u2019 factum, where counsel says that a certain conclusion for which he was arguing \u201cis fortified by the jury\u2019s answer to questions 3 and 4,\u201d although he had, earlier in the factum, as he did at bar in this Court, dealt with the second memorandum as part of the jury\u2019s explanation of, or reasons for, their answer, \u201cNo,\u201d to the first question. So regarded, this second memorandum might present a serious obstacle to the success of this appeal. On the other hand, if it should be treated as made in response to questions 3 and 4, the second memorandum may amount to nothing more than a finding of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs\u2019 driver.\nBut, however that may be, we are clearly of the view that the minds of the jury were so affected by the learned trial judge\u2019s direction to them, that, although the tail light was out and its being extinguished was a cause of the collision, the defendants would not be liable \u201cif the driver was not aware of the light being out, because it had gone out suddenly before the impact\u201d\u2014which was tantamount to telling them that the statutory duty under s. 9 (1) was not absolute but involved civil liability under s. 41 (1) only if the non-observance of s. 9 (1) was in some degree attributable to personal fault or negligence of the defendant Hatch, the driver of the motor truck of his co-defendant, and that, unless they found such fault or negligence to be established by the evidence, they should answer the first question in the negative\u2014that that direction influenced all their findings.\nIn effect, the jury\u2019s findings, as they now stand, merely negative such personal fault or negligence of the defendant Hatch, because, having reached that conclusion, they may have deemed themselves dispensed from making any finding on the vital question whether the tail light of the defendants\u2019 truck was, or was not, in fact lighted and clearly visible at a distance of at least 200 feet, as prescribed by s. 9 (1), at the moment of the collision, or immediately prior thereto. The learned judge had very properly said earlier in his charge:\u2014\nThe first thing you have to determine, because it is at the very threshold of this case, is whether or not upon the evidence of all the witnesses both for the plaintiffs and for the defendants the rear light was burning on that truck and was visible on that occasion.\nUpon that crucial question, owing to the course of the trial and notwithstanding the insistence of counsel for the appellants, there is no finding. The foreman\u2019s answer to the question of the learned judge, thus reported:\nAm I to understand, gentlemen, that it is your conclusion from the evidence that the light did go out immediately before the accident, and that you so find?\nThe Foreman: We do not know, sir.\ndoes not mean that the jury could not find whether the tail light was in fact lighted or extinguished, but only that they could not determine precisely when it had gone out, if it was in fact out. Nor does their first memorandum imply that the light was in fact out, as the learned judge might appear to have thought:\u2014\nMr. Plaxton: Is there any doubt about the answer to the first question, my Lord?\nHis Lordship: In what way? I think their assumption is: \u201cAssuming that the light may have gone out prior to the accident unknown to the driver, we find the defendant not negligent.\u201d\nMr. Plaxton: You are stating that as their assumption, my Lord?\nHis Lordship: That is their finding, I think.\nMr. Plaxton: As long as that is clear, my Lord. Having, in effect, been told that negligence causing the accident was the only matter for their consideration, and that the fact that the requirement of s. 9 (1), as to the tail light, was not complied with, would not, if established, amount, per se, to negligence, the jury, not improbably, put that aspect of the case entirely out of their minds when dealing with the question of the negligence of the plaintiffs\u2019 driver, and took the view that his negligence, which they, no doubt, found to have been proven, could alone in law be regarded as negligence causing the collision. Their second memorandum cannot in any view of it be taken to import more than this. It does not imply either that the tail light was in fact burning, or that, if not, its being out did not contribute to causing the collision. Fault attributable to the defendants being excluded, the only material negligence was that of the plaintiffs\u2019 driver, which was in that sense the cause (the jury, though invited to do so, did not say \u201cthe sole cause\u201d) of the collision. The direction to the jury as to the purview and effect of ss. 9 (1) and 41 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act was impliedly, if not expressly, approved in the judgment delivered by the Appellate Divisional Court in May, 1928. That that direction was erroneous, in our opinion, admits of no doubt under the decision of the House of Lords in Great Western Railway Co. v. Owners of S.S. \u201cMostyn\u201d[3], decided late in 1927, which apparently was not referred to either at the trial or in the Appellate Divisional Court. The head note of the report reads as follows:\u2014\nUnder s. 74 of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act, 1847, the owner of a vessel doing damage to a harbour, dock or pier, or works connected therewith, is responsible to the undertakers for the damage, whether occasioned by negligence or not, where the vessel is at the time of the damage under the control of the owner or his agents.\nIn the course of his speech, Viscount Haldane says:\u2014\nThe claim is based on an allegation of negligence, resulting in liability at common law, and also on the provisions of s. 74 of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act, 1847, which it is said does not require proof of negligence in order to render it applicable. The courts below have agreed in holding that negligence has not been proved, and the nautical assessors who have been present to advise us are of opinion that there was no negligence shown. I understand that we are unanimously of the same opinion. * * * The question which we have to answer is whether, in a case in which neither negligence nor any other act of an unlawful nature has been established against the owners of the Mostyn or those in charge of her, s. 74 makes the owners answerable for the damage done in this case to the dock.\nI assume that the master and those in charge were not answerable for any wilful act or negligence, inasmuch as none has been proved against them. But in the case of the owner the section does not in terms require any wrongful act to be established as the condition of liability. The words, taken by themselves, are unambiguous. The owner is to be liable for any damage done to the undertaking. My Lords, if the language of this section could legitimately be construed by us who sit here without regard to authority, I should find difficulty in saying that the appellants were not entitled to claim that it applied. It has been said that to take this view is to attribute to Parliament an intention which is hardly conceivable, the intention of making people liable for damage where they have been in no way to blame. But I am unable to attach much weight to this consideration, where the words are clear. What the motives of Parliament were we do not know and cannot inquire. It may be that it desired to encourage undertakers of this class by providing insurance at the cost of owners who are in no way to blame. There are instances of such a principle in modern statutes, such as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, and it may be that it was something analogous that was in the mind of the legislature. I do not know, and I feel myself precluded from even trying to inquire, or from speculating.\nBut we cannot proceed here on this simple view. It has been established by a decision which is binding on us by this House that the language must be interpreted as subject to some qualification which is implicit in the words, and the question which alone we are free and bound to examine, is what this qualification is, and how far it extends.\nAfter discussing at length the decision in River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[4], the learned Viscount thus states his conclusion as to \u201cwhat was really laid down\u201d in that case:\u2014\nI think only that there having been no human agency as the cause, and the real cause having been the act of God, the case was not covered by the section. The learned judges were at least agreed on this, that when the cause was not human agency but a vis major beyond human control, it did not come within the words.\nIn the case before us there was not only no negligence, but, on the hypothesis which I am making, there was no breach of duty at all. It is therefore important to see whether the grounds of the decision in this House in the Adamson case4 laid down for us any different principle which was held to take the case outside of the words of the statute. This is not easy to determine, for there was divergence of opinion. After carefully analyzing the speeches delivered in the House of Lords in Adamson\u2019s case4, Lord Haldane concludes:\u2014\nWe appear to me to be bound by the authority of the Adamson case4 to hold that the section in question is not to be read literally, but as applying when the damage complained of has been brought about by a vessel under the direction of the owner or his agents, whether negligent or not. The decision further exempts the owner when the vessel is not under such control but is for instance derelict. When there are facts to which it applies it effects an alteration in the common law which imposes a new liability to be sued on the owner, and to that extent changes not merely procedure but also substantive law.\nAlthough Mr. McCarthy, for the appellants, practically rested his appeal on the authority of the decision in the Mostyn case[5], in the course of his very able argument in answer, Mr. Phelan for the respondents made no allusion to that very recent and most important decision, a careful study of which has failed to disclose to us any real ground of distinction between the statutory provisions there dealt with and those now before us. There, as here, the responsibility of the owner for damages done by his vessel (here, by his motor vehicle) is declared in terms unqualified and unrestricted save by one exception, that of the vessel being under compulsory pilotage\u2014here, the one exception is that of the motor vehicle being in the possession of some person other than the owner, or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent. In each case alike the exception merely serves to emphasize the unlimited scope of the main provision. Obliged by the decision in the Adamson case[6] to place a further limitation upon the responsibility of the owner created by s. 74 of the English statute, the House of Lords in Mostyn\u2019s case[7] confines that limitation most strictly to what they were bound to hold that the judgment in the Adamson case6 necessarily implied. There is no earlier decision on the scope of the statute now before us which precludes our holding that it imposes, subject to the one exception expressed, unrestricted and absolute liability on the owner, thus giving to it the effect which we think its plain language clearly imports. But if the restriction held to have been placed on the application of the English statute in Adamson\u2019s case6 should also be held to apply to the liability im- posed by ss. 9 (1) and 41 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, that would not help the present defendants, because they were not within it. If the rear or tail light was not burning, or if, though burning, it was not visible at a distance of at least 200 feet, neither of these facts can be attributed to an act of God; and the motor truck was at the time of the collision admittedly under the direction of the owner or his agent.\nIt will be noted that Lord Haldane in the Mostyn case7 dealt with the arguments of counsel as to presumed intention and motives of Parliament. Similar arguments were advanced at bar in this Court. Conceding that s. 41 (1) was intended to impose civil liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle where there had been a violation of the statute, counsel for the respondents argued that such responsibility is vicarious and must be confined to cases in which the person in charge of such motor vehicle would be responsible at common law. We find nothing in the statute to justify so restricting its application. On the contrary, the imposition by s. 41 (1) of liability on the driver as well as the owner and the provision of subs. (3) seem to make clear that the purpose of the section is not only to impose direct civil liability, but also that that liability should be unrestricted, save as explicitly otherwise declared in the section itself. The inclusion of the driver\u2019s statutory responsibility is idle, if the application of the section is confined as Mr. Phelan contends.\nWe are accordingly of the opinion that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury as to the scope and effect of ss. 9 (1) and 41 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, and that such misdirection affected their findings to such an extent that they cannot stand. It follows that the judgment for the defendants must be set aside and that a new trial must be ordered in favour of the appellants William R. Hall and Alice R. Dale.\nWhile the Court is naturally reluctant to grant a new trial, it is satisfactory in this case to find such a clear and distinct ground of misdirection on which to base our order; for, otherwise, the later proceedings at the trial, by which the jury\u2019s findings were elicited, seem to us to have been so unsatisfactory that we should have to consider very carefully whether, in the sound exercise of judicial discretion, we ought not, on that ground, to direct a new trial rather than affirm a judgment based on a verdict so arrived at.\nIf, perchance, the Legislature should consider that our interpretation of the statute imposes a liability wider than was intended, that body can by appropriate amendment change the law in whatever direction it may deem proper.\nThere is no reason why on the new trial the jury should not be asked, at the outset, these two direct questions:\u2014\n1. Q. Did the defendants\u2019 motor truck carry up to the moment of the collision a rear lamp lighted and casting a red light clearly visible at a distance of 200 feet?\n2. Q. If not, did the failure to have such a light cause the collision?\nOf course these two questions will be followed by questions appropriate to cover the other issues.\nAt the opening of the argument it was pointed out to counsel for the appellants that the claims of the plaintiffs Annie C. Hall and Frank J. Justin were each for an amount less than $2,000 and that, as was held in Armand v. Carr[8], and Reynolds v. C.P.R.[9], the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal by them. An application to allow the case to stand over to permit of leave to appeal being asked from the Ontario Appellate Divisional Court, the Court felt itself obliged to refuse. The appeals of these two plaintiffs, Annie C. Hall and Frank J. Justin, were accordingly quashed. They will not, however, be required to pay to the defendants any costs in this Court.\nThe judgment of the Court, therefore, is that, as to the plaintiffs William R. Hall and Alice R. Dale, this appeal is allowed and the judgment dismissing the action is set aside with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Divisional Court to the successful appellants and a new trial is ordered. The costs of the former trial will be reserved to the judge who shall preside at the new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs (as to appellants William R. Hall and Alice R. Dale).\nSolicitor for the appellants: Herbert A.W. Plaxton.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Phelan & Richardson.\n[1] (1928) 34 Ont.
